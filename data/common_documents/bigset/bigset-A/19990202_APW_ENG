<HEADLINE> Payton's Disease Hits Immune System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The disease that afflicts Walter Payton -- primary  
sclerosing cholangitis -- is an autoimmune disorder, which means the 
body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, in this 
case, the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease scars the bile ducts, which carry bile from the  
liver to the small intestine to help digest food. When the ducts 
get blocked, bile backs up and migrates elsewhere, to the skin and 
eyes, causing itching and the yellowing known as jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients also get fatigued and tend to lose a lot of weight  
because the liver stores energy for the body, and when it is 
damaged or fails, the tissues starve. Blocked bile ducts may become 
infected or even cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is not known.  
However, it is not related to alcohol, steroids, hepatitis or any 
kind of immunodeficiency disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joseph Lagatutta, Payton's physician, said the disease is  
rare, affecting about three in 100,000 people, and is difficult to 
diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton already has undergone a common procedure to treat the  
disease -- surgical insertion of a stent, or a strawlike tube made 
of plastic or stainless steel, to open a blocked duct. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease eventually requires a liver transplant, but patients  
may go for years before that is necessary, and they usually do well 
afterward, experts say. PSC accounts for about 10 percent of liver 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Chicago-area specialists said Payton will have to wait his  
turn for a transplant, like anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John J. Brems, director of intrabdominal transplantation at  
Loyola University Medical Center, said he believes it would be 
``impossible'' for Payton to get a liver transplant faster because 
of his celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dr. J. Richard Thistlethwaite, chief of transplant surgery  
at the University of Chicago, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe he'll get preferential treatment,''  
Thistlethwaite said. ``I think we all know what Walter Payton 
stands for, and I think he would probably not want to get 
preferential treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Payton gets on a transplant waiting list, he will be given a  
priority status by objective measures of liver disease, both 
doctors said. People who are the sickest have the highest priority. 
Within each priority group, the decision on who gets a transplant 
depends on factors such as whether blood types match and how long 
the patient has waited. 
</P>
<P>
	If Payton chooses the Mayo Clinic, he would benefit from its  
leadership in research and treatment of PSC and from its location 
in Minnesota, Thistlethwaite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayo is one of only two liver-transplant centers in Minnesota,  
so fewer patients are wait-listed there. The Chicago area, by 
contrast, has five liver-transplant centers, so waiting times tend 
to be much longer here, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Corlis Phillips, a 34-year-old Loyola patient who has had PSC  
for 10 years, said it hasn't stopped her from living a full life. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips works full time as a quality-assurance administrator at  
a medical consulting firm and also goes to school at night. She is 
taking undergraduate classes in preparation for law school. She has 
been wait-listed for a liver transplant for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live life to the fullest,'' Phillips said Tuesday. ``I stay  
positive.''

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Three current inspectors and one former inspector  
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service have been indicted 
on bribery charges, federal officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gas Tax Money Sparks Highway Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling gas prices have been a boon not only  
to American drivers, but also to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	They've spurred fuel consumption, generating about $1.5 billion  
in unanticipated gas tax collections. They've also sparked a budget 
battle between the Clinton administration and the 
Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants to spend the money on an array of  
transportation programs, but Republicans say the nation's new 
highway bill limits any extra spending to road construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of each transportation program receiving a  
proportional increase as was agreed to in the law, the president 
seeks to steer gas taxes away from flexible state programs to 
programs run by federal bureaucrats,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, 
R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sees things differently. With some $25  
billion already in the pipeline for highway construction projects, 
and $1.456 billion in extra gas tax money now expected, the new 
Transportation Department budget proposes diverting some of tax 
money elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
	--$730 million for road construction, congestion reduction and  
air quality improvements, as allowed by the highway bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--$291 million for mass transit.  
</P>
<P>
	--$250 million for surface transportation research.  
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$35 million for rail programs, including grade-crossing  
eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
	--$25 million for a transportation preservation program.  
</P>
<P>
	All told, roughly 50 percent would be spent in ways other than  
those outlined in the highway bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proposing to direct those resources to programs that we  
think are strategic and are in keeping with the overall needs 
identified by the administration, where we focus on investments in 
the environment, safety, technology and the like,'' Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday during a briefing on the 
department's $45.5 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how low the price of gas goes, drivers still pay their  
local, state and federal governments an average of 43 cents per 
gallon in taxes. The federal take is 18.4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the administration appeared to end their battle  
over the money last June, when President Clinton signed into law 
the biggest transportation bill in the country's history. The 
measure allocated $167 billion to improve, widen and extend the 
nation's highway system through 2003. It also budgeted $36 billion 
for improving mass transit systems. The split was roughly 80-20 
between highways and mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hallmark of the bill was a provision requiring the government  
to spend all future gas tax collections on transportation projects. 
That was a major shift from past policy in which a portion of the 
receipts was held and used to reduce the size of the overall 
government budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Any unanticipated tax revenues were supposed to be restricted to  
highway construction, traffic reduction and air quality 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	For planning purposes, the drafters of transportation law relied  
on gas tax revenue estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. 
They are now turning out to be low. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for example, the CBO estimated collections would total  
$22.16 billion. In reality, $23.14 billion came in. This year the 
CBO projected collections of $32.62 billion. The administration 
expects they will exceed $33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials attribute the added consumption to  
extra driving and larger gas purchases, especially to fill the 
tanks in sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to rankling some Republicans, the administration's  
proposed spending plan also would give a double-shot of money to 
some programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the administration would allocate $341 million  
outright to traffic mitigation and air quality programs. But it 
also would allocate an additional $388 million for more general 
programs funded by transportation law, including some for traffic 
mitigation and air quality.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Panel Proposes Bans for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch opened a world summit on drugs in sport by calling for a 
new drive to wipe out ``this odious and unhealthy form of 
cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening address, Samaranch also referred to the  
corruption scandals which have plunged the IOC into the worst 
crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you all know, over the last few weeks the International  
Olympic Committee has been confronted with a serious situation with 
regard to allegations of wrongdoing leveled against some of its 
members,'' Samaranch said today. ``We have swiftly taken all the 
necessary measures and are continuing our investigations to ensure 
that Olympic ethics are respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled for receiving  
cash payments, gifts and other favors stemming from Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the drug problem, Samaranch proposed the creation of  
an international anti-doping agency to coordinate drug testing 
around the world -- one of the centerpieces of the three-day 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency should be autonomous and run by a board of  
directors composed of Olympic officials, scientists and 
representatives of government and non-governmental organizations 
and pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have insisted that the agency must be fully independent  
to have any credibility, an issue which will certainly play a major 
role during the rest of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Samaranch said he would oversee the agency and  
proposed that IOC medical commission chief Prince Alexandre de 
Merode should run the body on a day-to-day basis. The proposal has 
already drawn opposition from delegates and IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said de Merode had done ``a very good job'' as the  
Olympic drug chief for almost three decades. His detractors claim 
he has been largely ineffective while doping has become one of the 
chief issues in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's speech, Samaranch said athletes had turned to doping  
in ``the pursuit of victory at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the controversial issue of drug sanctions, Samaranch said the  
IOC cannot force sports federations to apply specific penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We apply sanctions whenever they are necessary,'' he said.  
``But we are not a court and we do not wish to become one. All we 
ask is for the rules we have set to be observed by all those 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``corrective and emergency methods'' have a limited  
effect and that a campaign of prevention and education would prove 
more successful in the long run. He also called on governments and 
pharmaceutical companies to collaborate in the fight against drugs, 
including drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those scheduled to speak today was White House drug czar  
Barry McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the conference, McCaffrey said the Olympic  
movement faced ruin unless effective steps were taken to curb the 
escalating drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey planned to call on the IOC to accept a fully  
independent worldwide anti-doping agency. He opposed plans that 
would give Olympic officials effective control of the proposed 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Independent doesn't mean dependent,'' McCaffrey aide Bob  
Weiner said Monday. ``He is pushing for true independence with 
random outside audits and verification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was hoping the meeting would smooth the way for a  
``level playing field'' for all competitors from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But proposals of an IOC working group to streamline drug  
policies around the globe already ran into obstacles before the 
meeting started. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel proposed that athletes face life bans and fines of up  
to $1 million if found guilty of serious cases of ``intentional 
doping'' and suggested selective bans for some first-time 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The world soccer federation call the proposals too tough and  
unworkable while the swimming federation said a unified anti-doping 
stance would be impossible under such circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Internet Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge has issued a preliminary injunction  
shielding Web site operators from prosecution under a new federal 
Internet indecency law that was to take effect today. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the public certainly has an interest in protecting its  
minors, the public interest is not served by the enforcement of an 
unconstitutional law,'' U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed wrote in 
a decision released Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton signed the Child Online Protection Act  
last year, Reed issued a restraining order against its enforcement, 
saying it could hinder constitutionally protected speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's latest decision acts as a more permanent delay.  
</P>
<P>
	The law would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit  
card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view online material ``harmful to 
minors.'' Violators would face penalties of up to six months in 
jail and $150,000 per day in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers now must decide whether to appeal the  
preliminary injunction, ask for a full-blown trial or agree to 
allow Reed's decision to become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	The law's lead sponsors urged the department to continue  
defending the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to a favorable judgment at the appellate level  
-- a day that will be celebrated by millions of parents and 
grandparents across the nation,'' said Rep. James C. Greenwood, 
R-Pa., who co-sponsored the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit on behalf  
of 17 clients, also lauded the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the judge has realized at this stage that  
our clients have some very credible fears,'' ACLU spokeswoman Emily 
Whitfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of a chain of gay- and lesbian-themed bookstores that  
does a portion of its business online expressed relief at the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Laurila, founder and owner of A Different Light, which  
has bookstores in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, had 
planned to take down the company's Web site if the law was 
permitted to take effect. He said he feared prosecution or having 
to defend against a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least this lets us heave a sigh of relief for the short  
term and do everything we can do to provide the courts with 
whatever information they need to make the right decision and leave 
the Internet monitoring to the parents,'' said Laurila, whose Web 
site offers 21,000 titles, many with sexually explicit themes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presents Plan To Fix Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton today backed his call to fix or  
close failing schools with a $200 million proposal to support 
intervention in troubled classrooms. He challenged skeptical 
Republicans to a debate over increasing accountability in the 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should invest more in education, but we should spend it  
more wisely,'' the president said at a Democratic National 
Committee luncheon today in Boston. ``We should spend it on what we 
know works and stop financing what we know doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million proposal is part of the education package  
included in the president's fiscal 2000 budget designed to boost 
education standards, hire more teachers and improve their skills 
and increase schools' accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he focused on accountability -- on the part of students,  
teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``From now on, we must say to states and school districts:  
Identify your worst-performing, least-improving schools, and turn 
them around, or shut them down,'' Clinton said at the Jackson-Mann 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people argue that even though we spend $15 billion a year  
on public education, the national government has no business 
whatever holding the system accountable for results,'' he said. 
``Can you imagine any company spending $15 billion and saying 
'Here, take the money, we don't care what the results are?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million for intervening in troubled schools would  
require states and school districts to identify the schools with 
the lowest achievement levels and take immediate steps to improve 
performance. Intensive teacher training and increased disciplinary 
measures are two examples of such steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, concerned that Clinton's education proposals would  
encroach upon state and local school autonomy, questioned whether 
his new budget does enough to directly support teaching and whether 
it allows local school officials enough flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and  
Workforce Committee, said today that Clinton was embracing GOP 
goals in calling for greater accountability, bans on social 
promotion and teacher performance exams. 
</P>
<P>
	But while he said Clinton ``is on the right track with his new  
education ideas,'' Goodling questioned whether Clinton could 
implement them ``without deeply extending the federal reach into 
our local schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His challenge is to implement these new initiatives without  
micromanaging our neighborhood schools from Washington,'' Goodling 
said. ``Regrettably ... under the president's proposals, Washington 
bureaucrats will call the shots on most of the major issues 
confronting states and local school districts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took such criticism head-on today, saying his ideas had  
come from educators across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will not find anybody who is more reluctant to micromanage  
the schools than me,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was adamant about setting standards for schools to meet.  
``If you want the money, you should do this -- not should, you 
must,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was making his education announcement between  
fund-raising events in Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, he was attending a $250 per-person reception to  
benefit the Democratic National Committee and then addressing a 
$10,000 per-person lunch at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel in honor of 
Steve Grossman, the DNC's outgoing co-chairman. The president also 
was addressing a $10,000 per-person DNC dinner at Le Cirque in New 
York tonight.

<HEADLINE> Jury Chosen in Gary Coleman Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A jury has been chosen to hear  
misdemeanor assault and battery charges against Gary Coleman, who 
is accused of punching an autograph-seeker. 
</P>
<P>
	The former child star of the NBC series ``Diff'rent Strokes,''  
which ran from 1978 to 1986, has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bus driver Tracy Fields said the 30-year-old former actor, who  
now works as a security guard, agreed to give her an autograph. She 
claims he became angry when she asked him to personalize it for her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman's attorney, Adam London, said Tuesday that Ms. Fields is  
trying to exploit his client's stardom to ``gain fame and 
fortune.'' Ms. Fields also has filed a $1 million civil lawsuit 
against Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Coleman could be sentenced to a year in jail and  
ordered to pay a $1,000 fine, and could lose his security guard 
license, said police Lt. James McInerny.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are questioning Vernon  
Jordan on the conflicts between his testimony and Monica Lewinsky's 
in a final effort to bolster the perjury and obstruction case 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As senators for the first time today got access privately to Ms.  
Lewinsky's videotaped deposition, prosecutors were focusing their 
questions on some of the discrepancies that emerged after Jordan 
testified to a grand jury for a fifth and final time on June 9, 
according to a knowledgeable source who spoke Monday only on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time Jordan, a Washington attorney and  
longtime Clinton friend, has testified since August, when Ms. 
Lewinsky began cooperating with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky gave the grand jury specific  
details that linked Jordan to conversations about gifts she 
received from Clinton, destroyed notes to the president and a false 
affidavit in which she denied an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, in the first time she was exposed to possible  
questioning by Clinton's lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky gave testimony that 
closely tracked her earlier grand jury account, according to 
sources familiar with the testimony who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The sources were not associated with the House 
prosecution team and worked outside the White House. Ms. Lewinsky's 
lawyers declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in testimony are important because Jordan  
arranged a job for the former White House intern at the same time 
she was preparing the affidavit in December 1997. The two actions 
are joined in the impeachment article accusing Clinton of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of the discrepancies:  
</P>
<P>
	--According to grand jury testimony released by Congress, Ms.  
Lewinsky said she showed Jordan some gifts she'd received from the 
president; Jordan didn't recall being shown any. 
</P>
<P>
	--She said she thought Jordan was instructing her to destroy  
drafts of notes she'd written to the president. He denied ever 
telling her to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	--He said he had no reason to doubt her denial of having had a  
sexual relationship with Clinton. While she didn't directly 
contradict Jordan's account, she did say she told him she had had 
sexually explicit phone conversations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jordan said he remembered skimming the affidavit  
she filed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton, but not discussing it with Ms. Lewinsky. And through his 
lawyer, Jordan said he did not recall any reference to sexually 
explicit phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton's friend she was concerned  
about some of the language in her affidavit because it could cause 
the Jones lawyers to ask her if she'd ever been alone with the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's recollection is filled with other specific  
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the sexually explicit phone calls, she said the topic  
arose after she told Jordan she was worried someone might have 
eavesdropped on her conversations with Clinton, and Jordan asked 
her why. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same conversation, the former White House intern said,  
she showed Jordan some gifts Clinton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors questioned Jordan, he said he'd never had  
breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. She said otherwise, describing details 
of what she and Jordan ate -- testimony corroborated by a restaurant 
receipt signed by Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's deposition is the second of three such sessions, as the  
Senate edges closer to the end of Clinton's impeachment trial. The 
trial is to resume Thursday, and unless the depositions yield new 
information, the Senate will proceed to closing arguments and final 
deliberations that could meet the lawmakers' target for ending the 
trial by Feb. 12, or sooner. Videotapes of the three depositions 
could be made public if a majority of senators vote to do so, or 
the witnesses could be called to testify live. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of nullifying her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky  
offered no new information to House prosecutors during four hours 
of questioning by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., according to the sources 
familiar with her testimony on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing up an opportunity to question her, White House lawyers  
instead offered an apology on Clinton's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Private presidential attorney Nicole Seligman read a statement  
that apologized to Ms. Lewinsky ``on behalf of the president for 
all the trouble the investigation and impeachment trial had caused 
her,'' one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	One source said Ms. Lewinsky reaffirmed that:  
</P>
<P>
	--When she asked Clinton what to do about subpoenaed gifts from  
him on Dec. 28, 1997, his response was something like ``let me 
think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers had argued to the Senate that on other  
occasions, Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton had no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	--In a middle-of-the-night conversation on Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton  
told her she was on the witness list in the Jones lawsuit, 
suggested she could file an affidavit and mentioned their 
previously arranged cover stories to explain why she was coming to 
see the president. On Jan. 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky signed an 
affidavit denying an affair.

<HEADLINE> No Decision on US Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is discussing with  
Congress the possible use of thousands of American ground troops to 
monitor any peace settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before negotiations begin on the future of the Serbian  
province, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and President Clinton's national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, all have begun preliminary talks on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	They have left the impression the administration is determined  
to have U.S. troops play a peacekeeping role, but publicly and 
privately administration officials say no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Bosnia, the U.S. troops would be part of a monitoring  
group along with European soldiers. In all, a multinational force 
of some 20,000 may be necessary to oversee a cease-fire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright briefed Clinton on Monday at the White House for 75  
minutes on the outlook for a negotiated settlement between the 
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. Serbia is the main 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who attended Monday's meeting, said the situation in the  
Serbian province could turn into a ``burning fuse'' and ``require 
the United States to play a much larger role than some kind of 
small contribution at this point would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the warring parties in Kosovo are due to  
begin Saturday at Rambouillet, France. But neither the Yugoslav 
government nor the ethnic Albanians have pledged to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO threatening military force against the Serbs, the  
United States and five European nations last week demanded Belgrade 
grant maximum self-rule -- but not independence -- to the Albanians 
who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France, the cohosts of this weekend's talks, already  
have announced they would commit troops to a peacekeeping operation 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans deferred to the Clinton administration on  
threatening the Serbs with NATO bombardment. They, on the other 
hand, want the United States to be part of any peacekeeping force 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright began her consultations last Saturday on her return  
from London where the six-nation Contact Group leveled their 
demands. She talked to Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of 
the House International Relations Committee, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, at a news conference, said the role Europeans would play  
and what forces, if any, they were prepared to commit were under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing would be decided until such time as we work in  
consultation with key members of Congress to raise these issues and 
discuss and debate them before the president considers this,'' 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said there was no decision  
yet on U.S. troops. But he emphasized ``there is a need and an 
urgency for American leadership and determination'' in Kosovo, as 
in Bosnia. He offered assurances that while U.S. troops might be 
under the immediate command of a European, their ultimate commander 
would be Gen. Wesley Clark, an American who is the supreme NATO 
commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has tried to calibrate very carefully what  
the relative roles and responsibilities of European countries and 
the United States ought to be,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the spokesman said the United States had ``significant  
national interests at stake'' in ending the 11-month conflict in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	These include the potential for a humanitarian catastrophe in  
the spring, when the weather is more conducive to fighting, and 
that the Kosovo conflict could spread to other areas of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was skeptical about the use of U.S. troops in Bosnia to  
monitor the settlement engineered by the United States in November 
1995 to end a 3 1/2-year ethnic war among Serbs, Croats and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping operation has proceeded smoothly, however, with  
no American soldiers lost in any conflict in the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. contingent has been reduced to 6,900 from a high of  
20,000.

<HEADLINE> Houston Octuplets Gaining Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- All but one of the seven surviving Houston  
octuplets now weighs more than 2 pounds, doctors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the babies born to Nkem Chukwu in December are strong  
enough that they have been upgraded from critical to serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jioke Louis, a boy who was the largest of the babies at birth,  
and sisters Ebuka and Echerem, have been moved from the neonatal 
intensive care unit to a special nursery at Texas Children's 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four -- girls Gorom, Chidi and Chima and brother Ikem --  
remain in critical but stable condition in the neonatal ICU. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorom, the last-born girl, remains the most delicate of the  
babies, weighing just 1 pound, 12 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth baby, Odera, died of lung and heart failure a week  
after birth.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Invited to Prayer Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oklahoma Rep. Steve Largent says this week's  
Congressional Prayer Breakfast is a time for reconciliation -- not 
politics -- so he won't rescind an invitation to Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prayer Breakfast was designed not for political purposes  
but as an independent event with the goal of bringing about 
reconciliation all over the world,'' the conservative Republican 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two conservative Christian groups have spoken out against the  
invitation, and one of them, the Traditional Values Coalition, is 
urging members of Congress to boycott the event Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 politicians, diplomats and religious leaders attend  
the breakfast each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Largent is chairman of this year's breakfast. Each year, that  
position rotates between Democrat and Republicans and between House 
members and senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year, thousands of invitations are sent out under the  
chairman's signature,'' Largent said. ``For the last three years, I 
am told Mr. Arafat has been an invitee. This year he accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has not been invited to speak at the breakfast, and  
several Israeli government officials also have been invited, 
Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said it had not yet received confirmation  
that Arafat would attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition Executive Director Randy Tate said he  
personally will not attend the breakfast because of a scheduling 
conflict and because the Arafat controversy, but his group has not 
called for a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been troubled by this event,'' Tate said. ``We feel  
very strongly that honor and legitimacy should not be bestowed on a 
terrorist, a man with blood on his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to members of Congress, the Rev. Louis Sheldon,  
chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, said the invitation 
should not have been extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how good the intentions of the breakfast's  
organizers are, the results of their decision to invite this 
international outlaw to this event has been disastrous,'' Sheldon's 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until Arafat repents the many murders of innocent people that  
he has encouraged or silently approved, there should not be a place 
for him at the Prayer Breakfast table or any other table of 
civilized people, for that matter,'' Sheldon wrote.

<HEADLINE> GOP Slams Clinton's Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's Pentagon budget proposal  
fails to meet the military's needs, Republican lawmakers said 
Wednesday, even though it calls for the first rise in defense 
spending in more than a decade. They also gave a cool response to 
his request for new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just fear what we will discover is that for every step the  
president wants us to believe he has taken forward, the hard 
reality of the budget will represent two steps backwards,'' said 
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, defending the day-old budget in  
an appearance before the committee, conceded that the budget falls 
short of what the military service chiefs had told Congress they 
needed. ``But this does in fact meet their most-pressing 
requirements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan includes a 4.4 percent across-the-board pay increase  
for the military. But the Senate is soon to debate legislation that 
would give the military an even bigger raise -- 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen defended anew his administration's request for two new  
rounds of base closings, insisting it would save $20 billion, plus 
$3 billion annually once the additional bases are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that two more rounds are in fact necessary,'' Cohen  
said. The administration wants the closings in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last round in 1995, Congress has rejected several  
administration attempts to close other bases it considers 
unnecessary. Republicans have accused the administration of trying 
to politicize the process -- trying to protect certain bases in 
high-electoral vote states like California and Texas, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of trust from the last go-around,'' Rep.  
James Hansen, R-Utah, told Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	And Spence, the committee chairman, suggested that even with the  
base closings the administration seeks, military needs would not be 
met. He said the budget ``appears to rely heavily on assumed 
savings, spending cuts and outlay gimmicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence also complained that the budget rescinds $900 million  
agreed to last fall, in an emergency funding bill, for expanded 
intelligence and a national missile defense. The administration is 
spending the money instead, he said, on payments to Israel and the 
Palestinians to carry out the Wye peace agreement, Spence said. The 
administration says it will find money for the intelligence and 
missile defense later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
the committee previously that the administration's budget, while 
meeting the Pentagon's most pressing immediate requirements, still 
fell short of its long-term needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that basic message Tuesday. ``I am concerned about  
the high impact the tempo of operations is having on our people, 
their families, and our aging equipment,'' Shelton testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration bills the 2000 spending plan as an increase  
of $12 billion, with a total increase of $112 billion through 2005. 
But the $12 billion represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes to spend. Much of the $12 billion is actually 
savings from lower-than-expected inflation, not new money.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Sign Jackson to 3-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Free agent guard Jim Jackson signed a  
three-year, $6 million contract with the Portland Trail Blazers on 
Tuesday, giving the team more outside shooting and depth at the 
guard position. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a six-year NBA veteran, played the final 31 games of  
last season with Golden State, averaging 18.9 points. He began his 
career with the Dallas Mavericks, who selected him with the fourth 
overall pick in the 1992 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson spent more than four seasons with the Mavericks, and  
together with Jamal Mashburn and Jason Kidd, the three ``J's'' were 
supposed to take the losing Mavs to respectability. But that never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was dealt to New Jersey in a nine-player trade in 1997.  
He was traded to Philadelphia on draft day 1997 in the deal that 
sent Keith Van Horn to the Nets. Jackson spent the first part of 
last season with the 76ers before being traded with Clarence 
Weatherspoon to Golden State for Joe Smith and Brian Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who practiced with the Blazers on Tuesday, said he'd  
had offers from five other teams, but came to Portland because the 
team was committed to winning instead of building for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why I chose Portland is because of the direction  
that this team is in, and also that this team is in the playoffs, 
so they don't need Jim Jackson to put them over the hump,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great pleasure for me to finally be in a situation  
where you go out on the court each and every night expecting to win 
the game, not thinking in the back of your mind whether you have to 
play all four quarters really well and hope a break or two goes 
your way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are way over the $30 million salary cap, but were  
eligible for the $1.75 salary cap for free agents. Jackson will 
make that this season, plus a 10 percent raise the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has played mostly shooting guard in his career, the same  
position Isaiah Rider plays for the Blazers. Portland president and 
general manager Bob Whitsitt said Jackson will compete with Rider 
for minutes, as well as play small forward and occasionally point 
guard.

<HEADLINE> Walter Payton Needs Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Walter Payton, gaunt, tearful and barely  
resembling the dashing, durable Chicago Bears' Hall of Famer who 
rushed his way into the NFL record books, got to the point quickly 
on Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
	He has a rare liver disease and needs a transplant to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``To the people that really care about me, just continue  
praying,'' said the 44-year-old Payton, who choked up when he 
embraced his 17-year-old son, Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, afflicts just three  
in 100,000 people, said Payton's physician, Dr. Joseph Lagattuta. 
The cause of the disease, which blocks the bile ducts, is unknown, 
but isn't related to alcohol, steroids, hepatitis or immune 
deficiency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients in Payton's condition survive an average of two years  
unless they receive a liver transplant, Lagattuta said. Symptoms 
include fatigue and jaundice -- yellowing of the pigment of the eyes 
and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was scared, the NFL's all-time rushing leader  
snapped: ``Am I scared? Hell yeah, I'm scared. Wouldn't you be 
scared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's not in my hands anymore,'' he added. ``It's in God's  
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 13 years with the Bears, Payton's trademarks were his  
vaulting goal line leaps and a punishing running style. He 
stiff-armed and barreled past tacklers in the open field almost as 
often as he dodged them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Payton's health spread last week after he appeared  
at a news conference where his son announced he would play college 
football for Miami. Payton said those rumors prompted his 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get everything straight before things got bad,''  
said Payton, who wore sunglasses and an NFL jacket and bluejeans 
that couldn't hide his thinness. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is being evaluated for a transplant at the Mayo Clinic,  
where former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker received a liver 
transplant in 1996 for the same disease. Tucker was on a waiting 
list for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said 88 percent of people who receive a liver  
transplant are alive after a year, and the long-term survival rate 
is ``very promising.'' He said most patients can return to an 
active life if they receive a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients in Payton's condition survive an average of two years  
without a transplant, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say he won't get preferential treatment because of his  
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Payton's illness sobered those who knew him as a  
muscular, fearless player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all humans and regardless of how rich we are, how  
fortunate we are, whatever we maybe, things like this happen,'' 
said retired Bears fullback Roland Harper, who blocked for Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bears coach Mike Ditka called Payton ``the greatest  
football player I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus, he's one of the sweetest human beings I know,'' Ditka  
said from New Orleans. ``And if that's not important, I don't know 
what is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bears owners Ed and Virginia McCaskey issued a brief statement  
saying they were ``devastated to hear that Walter is sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very dear person to our family and the entire Bears  
organization. We'll do all we can to help Walter in his current 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue: ``The love, support and  
prayers of the entire NFL are with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said the disease is difficult to diagnose and can go  
undetected for years. He initially thought it might be a gall 
bladder problem when Payton told him in October that he had felt 
ill for a few months. The liver problem was diagnosed within the 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said Payton has significant bile-duct blockage. To aid  
his digestion and give him adequate nutrition, a plastic tube was 
surgically inserted between the vessel that carries bile from the 
liver to the intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, I can eat anything I want, as much as I want,  
and I still can't gain any weight,'' Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final season with the Bears in 1987, the 5-11 Payton was  
listed at 202 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how much he weighed now, Payton wouldn't say.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he replied: ``You want to pick me up?''  
</P>
<P>
	It probably wouldn't be that hard.  
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick from Jackson State in 1975, Payton  
carried the load for mediocre Bears teams early in his career 
before leading Chicago to its only Super Bowl appearance, after the 
1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected to nine Pro Bowls and inducted into the Pro Football  
Hall of Fame in 1993, the player known as ``Sweetness'' holds NFL 
career records for yards gained, 16,726, and carries, 3,838. 
</P>
<P>
	He posted 77 100-yard games and 10 1,000-yard rushing seasons.  
His 275-yard rushing performance against Minnesota in 1977 still 
stands as the NFL record for most rushing yards in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from football, Payton co-owned an Indy-CART  
auto-racing team and ran a restaurant and other businesses in the 
Chicago area. He served on the Bears board of directors and joined 
groups seeking NFL franchises.

<HEADLINE> Sprint 4Q Profit Up 14 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp.'s profit rose 14 percent  
for the fourth quarter thanks to heavy long-distance calling, but 
the company's stock fell sharply as Tuesday's report failed to meet 
Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 3 long-distance phone company earned $404.6  
million, or 93 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up 
from $356.5 million, or 56 cents per share, in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's latest results included a one-time gain of $104  
million, or 14 cents a share, from the sale of local exchanges and 
other investments. Excluding those gains, Sprint's per-share 
earnings amounted to 79 cents a share, below analyst forecasts of 
about 85 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sprint were down $2.25 to close at $81.93 3/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenues grew 7.5 percent to $4.14 billion from  
$3.85 billion a year earlier. Long-distance operating income grew 
32 percent to $382 million, up from $290 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1997. Minutes of use rose 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Local telephone revenues rose 6.3 percent to $1.38 billion in  
the fourth quarter, 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's wireline operations were boosted in the fourth quarter  
by an airline mileage partnership with Northwest Airlines and the 
launch of the company's Business Flex plan, chief executive officer 
William T. Esrey said. The company also introduced its Sprint Sense 
Anytime and Sprint Sense Unlimited residential calling plans during 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Sprint earned $1.54 billion, or $3.54 a share,  
up from $1.37 billion, or $3.14 a share in 1996. Revenues grew to 
$16.02 billion from $14.87 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks China Spying Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has ordered a formal  
assessment of possible damage to U.S. national security in the wake 
of a congressional panel's finding that American interests were 
harmed by China's military espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take it very seriously and we're going to conduct a formal  
damage assessment,'' National Security Council spokesman David 
Leavy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the administration had not embraced the committee's  
conclusion that U.S. interests were harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reviewing the information that was gathered,'' he said.  
``We take this issue very seriously and we are organizing an 
interagency team including nuclear weapons and counterintelligence 
experts to conduct a formal damage assessment, which will be 
reviewed by a panel of independent experts,'' Leavy said. He said 
the panel would report its findings to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's action came in response to a study conducted by a  
special House committee investigating military and commercial deals 
with China. The panel, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
concluded late last year that China has been pursuing U.S. military 
information aggressively for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's investigation began with an inquiry into the  
administration's satellite export dealings with China but looked 
beyond those transactions to Republican and Democratic 
administrations over the last two decades. In releasing the report, 
Cox had said that, ``Based on unclassified information, we have 
found that nation security harm did occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said transfers from the United States to China were not  
limited to satellite and missile technology, ``but cover militarily 
significant technology.'' The committee, five Republicans and four 
Democrats, adopted the report without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these charges are quite ridiculous and irresponsible,''  
Zhang Qiyue, a chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said today in 
Beijing. ``China is a responsible power. When conducting commercial 
cooperation and technological cooperation with other countries we 
act in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not concurring that U.S. security has been harmed, Leavy  
said Clinton agrees ``with the broad conclusions and 
recommendations of the (Cox) report and accepted in the bipartisan 
fashion in which it was offered to move forward on a comprehensive 
approach to maintain effective export controls and protection to 
U.S. exports worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee made more than three dozen recommendations  
for legislation and executive action to remedy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this regard, we support and agree with the majority of the  
committee's recommendations,'' Leavy said, adding that many of them 
already are being implemented.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE (AP) -- Excerpts from speeches on the first day of the  
world anti-drug summit: 
</P>
<P>
	--''The IOC must stress the importance of values -- not the  
importance of its leaders.'' -- Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen, Danish 
minister for culture. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''The IOC has a particular responsibility in the global fight  
against doping in sport which it cannot live up to unless it 
regains its basis of legitimation. Those who sacrifice the 
credibility of sport on the altar of economic interests provoke 
immense dangers for the Olympic movement and sports worldwide.'' -- 
Otto Schily, German interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''No one has ever thought to test ministers at the end of a  
parliamentary session, or test industrialists who have to face 
social conflicts. Doping is all over society.'' -- Prince Alexandre 
de Merode, chairman of IOC medical commission 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''The culture of doping begins at an early age and is created  
and may be reinforced by coaches, agents, doctors, team leaders and 
all the others. Athletes call on tough sanctions against these 
individuals who take advantage of the athletes.'' -- Olav Koss, 
Norwegian speed skater, triple Olympic gold medalist, member of IOC 
athletes' commission. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''Athletes who use performance enhancing drugs do not earn  
medals -- they steal them. They are cheating themselves of honor, 
and their fellow athletes of a chance to compete on a level playing 
field.'' --Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Drugs Policy 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''We endorse the notion that if we don't get the problem of  
doping we will not affect a cynicism which pervades where cheating 
is believed by many to be a prerequisite for a successful 
competition.'' -- McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''I would quite clearly call for the IOC and the community of  
nations to consider institutional reform -- open books and financial 
records, open recorded votes, a code of conduct that is published 
and enforced and probably most importantly an elected membership 
that is accountable and responsive.'' -- McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Even in ancient Greece doctors used to help greatly in the  
training of athletes, and cooks would give them bread seasoned with 
juice from the opium poppy.'' -- Andreas Fouras, Greek 
under-secretary of state responsible for sport. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''Doping is like toxic waste, it pollutes its environment.'' --  
Harri Syvaesalmi, director of sports, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''International sports bodies have responsibilities as well as  
rights. Their internal systems of organization and application must 
be based on democracy, accountability and honesty. The British 
government expects the IOC to clean up its act.'' -- British sports 
minister Tony Banks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--''For complete credibility it (the agency) must be headed by  
someone other than an IOC member. Credibility is so important. The 
fact that the United States Olympic Committee has to do that 
testing creates a lack of credibility all over the world. Everyone 
thinks that the fox is guarding the chicken coop.'' -- Dick Schultz, 
executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``In 1980 if I had been a Canadian representative on the IOC  
and voting to go ahead with the games in Moscow, I would have been 
toasted about a nanosecond later. As an independent member of the 
IOC I am now free, untrammeled, to decide based on what I think is 
best.'' -- IOC vice president Dick Pound, reacting to the suggestion 
that the anti-drug agency should be under the control of 
governments through the United Nations rather than the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Female College Professors on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More women are becoming college professors but  
they get less pay and fewer promotions, a survey by a university 
faculty trade group finds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974-75, women made up 22.5 percent of all U.S. faculty  
members. By 1997-98 the percentage had increased to 33.8. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study by the American Association of University  
Professors indicates that more than half the women are in lower 
positions such as lecturers and instructors, regardless of the type 
of institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997-98, women represented 55.6 percent of lecturers, 58.6  
percent of instructors and 46.8 percent of assistant professors -- 
the profession's full-time entry level position. 
</P>
<P>
	But just 18.7 percent of full professors were women.  
</P>
<P>
	The data are based on an annual survey of about 2,500 public and  
private college administrators. The response rate is about 75 
percent, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also are more likely to work at community colleges, which  
generally pay less than four-year colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released Tuesday by the group, was also published in  
the January-February 1999 issue of Academe, the group's journal.

<HEADLINE> Fertility Clinics Increase Births </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of births resulting from fertility  
clinic assistance rose 25 percent in a year, according to a report 
released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Government health officials cautioned that the sharp increase  
could be the result of better record keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's premature to draw too many conclusions about a trend  
between last year and this year,'' said Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director 
of the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest survey, 300 fertility clinics reported that their  
clients had 14,388 live deliveries from pregnancies that began in 
1996. That's up from 11,516 reported the year before by 281 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	The data was included in the CDC's annual consumer guide to  
fertility clinic success rates. It's the second time the CDC has 
released the report, which was mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The report does not rank or grade the clinics since some  
specialize in more difficult fertility cases and would naturally 
have lower success rates. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes data such as the ``take-home baby rate,'' each  
clinic's multiple-birth rate and the number of embryos it used. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also includes the success rates for various types of  
fertility procedures, the ages of the women involved and the types 
of infertility problems treated at each clinic.

<HEADLINE> NBA's Clippers Face Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- How's this for typical Clippers luck: They  
win the NBA draft lottery a year after Tim Duncan turns 
professional, and he immediately becomes one of the league's best 
big men. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being regular participants in the lottery, the Clippers  
have missed out on such stars as Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, 
Kevin Garnett, Antoine Walker, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Allen Iverson, 
Keith Van Horn and Jason Kidd in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They selected Antonio McDyess second overall three years ago,  
only to trade him away and watch him become a star. 
</P>
<P>
	They took Michael Olowokandi with the first overall pick last  
summer, and he signed with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League two 
days before NBA players and owners agreed to a labor settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers can't win for losing. And mostly, they lose. That  
probably won't change much during the abbreviated season that 
begins Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to make the playoffs,'' said former NBA great  
Elgin Baylor, vice president of basketball operations for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers couldn't do much worse than last year. They went  
17-65 and missed the playoffs for the 19th time in 22 years. They 
haven't won a playoff series since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the season ended, coach Bill Fitch was fired with  
a four-year record of 99-229. The team waited until the lockout was 
settled before hiring former Boston and Milwaukee coach Chris Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers did catch a break on Jan. 25 when Kinder Bologna  
granted Olowokandi an early release from his contract. He joined 
the Clippers last weekend and hopes to be ready to contribute right 
away. However, missing training camp will be a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi completed his first full workout with the Clippers on  
Sunday -- five days before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's big, he's mobile, he looks like he's going to be a good  
addition to this club,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a first-round draft choice who averaged 11.5  
points and 4.2 rebounds as a rookie last season, missed several 
days of practice and both Clippers exhibition games because of a 
thigh injury. He returned the same day Olowokandi had his first 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intensity and physical toughness that both of those guys  
bring made a great impact,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, Taylor, Lorenzen Wright, Rodney Rogers, Lamond  
Murray and rookie Brian Skinner, another first-round draft choice, 
give the Clippers some talent and depth in the frontcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	The backcourt is a different story. Point guards Darrick Martin  
and Pooh Richardson, and shooting guards Eric Piatkowski and James 
Robinson don't figure to give the team nearly enough all-around 
ability for success. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Ford and his players are speaking  
enthusiastically. Of course, everyone starts a new season with a 
clean slate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attitude of the players is different,'' Martin said.  
``Hopefully, we can continue this atmosphere. We've got some guys 
who can play.''

<HEADLINE> Army 'Copter Crash Hearing Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- A hearing for three Army soldiers charged  
in a fatal helicopter crash in the Bahamas was postponed because of 
one defendant's lingering medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing had been scheduled Monday to determine whether Sgt.  
William Westgate, an avionics technician, and two pilots, Chief 
Warrant Officers David Guido and Daniel Riddell, should face 
courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash killed the wives of Guido and Riddell, who were along  
on the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter in apparent violation of Army 
regulations. The three soldiers are all assigned to Hunter Army 
Airfield in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a day of legal wrangling, the presiding officer, Lt.  
Col. Thomas Devine, postponed the hearing and ordered a competency 
board to determine if Westgate is mentally competent to take part 
in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Westgate suffered a brain injury in the crash, has amnesia and  
is taking heavy doses of a morphine-like painkiller for injuries 
that included several leg fractures, said his lawyer, Joe Bergen of 
Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Guido and Riddell said they supported Bergen's  
request for a delay because they had planned to use Westgate's 
testimony in their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers face charges including involuntary  
manslaughter, conspiracy, wrongful appropriation of a military 
aircraft, destruction of military property and making false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army investigator concluded that Riddell, the pilot that day,  
caused the crash, but his attorney says the cause was mechanical 
failure.

<HEADLINE> Elway Never Expected MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Throughout his remarkable 16-year career, John  
Elway reminded us that nothing was impossible, that no achievement 
was ever beyond his go-for-broke grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is what made his observation on Monday so startling.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than 12 hours after his Denver Broncos clinched their  
second straight Super Bowl title and he won the MVP award, Elway 
surprised the assembled media by insisting he ``never thought this 
would happen to me. I really never thought I would be standing up 
here the morning after a Super Bowl as the MVP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why, he said, ``After you lose three Super Bowls in a row,  
you're just hoping your team can win. So this (award) is a bonus. 
It's really one of the great thrills of my career, and I've had 
many of them. It's a special moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After what was clearly the best performance of his five Super  
Bowl appearances, Elway won the MVP award in what may be his final 
trip to the NFL's ultimate game. He completed 18 of 29 passes for 
336 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the Broncos' 
34-19 romp over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	His reward? A trophy and a new car.  
</P>
<P>
	The perfect gift for an auto tycoon. Elway recently sold his  
seven Denver auto dealerships for $82 million, currently is the 
front man for 17 dealerships, and owns a stable of cars at home. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue joked about the odd  
circumstances as he introduced Elway at a Monday morning press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the choice of a Ford Mustang or Expedition, Elway chose  
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that a car was an incentive to win,'' Tagliabue  
quipped. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff met last night to try to come up with something that  
would give John an incentive to play another season. The best they 
could come up with was the idea that you have a chance to be the 
first player in NFL history to be the MVP in two different 
centuries. We decided not to offer that to you because it might 
emphasize your age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, spent an agonizing four months following last year's  
Super Bowl victory before deciding to return for the 1998 season. 
He expects to make a somewhat quicker decision about playing in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although believed to be leaning toward retirement, he admitted  
that the opportunity for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl 
title would affect his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' he said.  
``But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level that I'm 
playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment. At 38 and in the  
twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the now and 
not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said he will seek the counsel of his wife and four  
children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and Broncos 
owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Elway said he was 99.9 percent certain that 1998  
would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' he said. ``You can't  
start in July and expect to have a good year. People think that we 
just go out and play on Sunday, but that's not the way it works. 
Our season starts April 1 (with off-season conditioning), and it's 
a nine-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can I compete for an entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the  
time working on what we do offensively from a mental standpoint? It 
was a long haul for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually durable Elway missed all or parts of six games this  
season with hamstring, back and rib injuries. Still, he had the 
best passer rating (93.0) of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, my heart is going to tell me if I can make  
that commitment or not,'' he said. ``If I do, I'm going to make it 
so I can play at the level that I want to play at. I don't want to 
come back and just go through the motions. If I come back, it's 
going to be full bent, trying to repeat.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants Halt to BellSouth Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has asked federal regulators to  
stop BellSouth Corp. from continuing to market a prepaid card that 
people can use anywhere in the country to make long-distance and 
other phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T contends the arrangement violates a provision of a 1996 law  
that bars BellSouth and the nation's four other regional Bell 
telephone companies from providing long-distance service to their 
local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth defended the legality of the card, which the company  
began marketing inside and outside the company's nine-state local 
phone region in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is completely legal,'' said Jim Harralson, general counsel  
for BellSouth Long Distance. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has been selling various forms of popular prepaid  
cards since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance service for the card is being provided by an  
unaffiliated company, U.S. South Communications, although the card 
is being marketed by BellSouth, said BellSouth spokesman Bill 
McCloskey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey did not know how many of the disputed cards, which  
people also can use for local and other phone services, the company 
has sold since December. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed its complaint to the Federal Communications  
Commission on Jan. 29, but announced the action Monday. It was 
filed under a new process to quickly resolve disputes. Under that 
process, the FCC must resolve the complaint by March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law says a Bell company must open its market to  
competitors and get FCC approval before it may provide 
long-distance service to local customers. No Bell has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC declared that separate marketing alliances US  
West Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp. -- both Bell companies 
-- had with long-distance company, Qwest Communications Corp., 
violated the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pacts, Qwest paid US West and Ameritech an undisclosed  
recruiting fee for each client in the Baby Bells' local phone 
regions that chose Qwest for long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said the FCC's decision against Ameritech and US West  
bolsters its complaint against BellSouth. But BellSouth disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Study Refutes Hypertension Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Contrary to previous research, a new study found  
no direct link between high blood pressure and a decline in 
thinking ability as people age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hoped to find a really compelling relationship here, but  
... we just have very little information about what people can do 
to protect (themselves) from loss of their cognitive function,'' 
said the lead researcher, Dr. Robert J. Glynn of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that controlling blood pressure is still vital to  
prevent heart disease and strokes, and that hypertension is often 
undertreated in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. It involved more than 2,000 people over age 65 
who had undergone tests of blood pressure and thinking ability at 
three-year intervals over a period of nine years beginning in 
1973-74. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found slightly greater declines in thinking  
function on one mental test among those with higher blood pressure, 
Glynn said. But the relationships were ``modest, at best,'' and 
they failed to shed light on what the mechanism might be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, who  
researched one of the previous studies but was not involved in the 
new work, said it doesn't necessarily contradict past findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Havlik said the impact of high blood pressure on mental  
functioning may not be apparent unless measured over all of 
adulthood. The new work may have measured thinking ability too late 
in the subjects' lives to show much effect, Havlik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said, recent findings from Europe suggest that people  
who are treated for high blood pressure have smaller declines in 
mental functioning as they age than those who are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Havlik said it is unclear how high blood pressure might damage  
thinking ability, but it may contribute to hardening of the 
arteries, which in turn could affect memory centers in the brain.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Rebels To Attend Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rebel spokesman announced  
today that the ethnic Albanian rebels will attend peace talks in 
France this week aimed at ending the bloody 11-month conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi focuses  
international pressure on the hard-line Yugoslav government, which 
still has not confirmed whether it will send delegates to the 
talks. The Serb parliament is to decide on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some objections to the proposed document but we are  
certainly ready to go,'' Krasniqi said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel spokesman said the Kosovo Liberation Army will name  
negotiators on Wednesday to the team that will attend the talks 
Saturday outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA representatives will demand that Kosovo, presently a  
part of Serbia, become an international protectorate for a 
three-year period while negotiators work out a final status for the 
region. They also want any decision on Kosovo's future to be put to 
a referendum by the ``people of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel group's participation was uncertain after another KLA  
spokesman, Adem Demaci, said he would recommend against sending 
delegates to the talks. More moderate Kosovo Albanian political 
leaders have already said they would attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government has balked at making a decision about  
attending the talks, deferring instead to Parliament. Late Monday, 
the Yugoslav federal Cabinet issued a statement declaring that 
NATO's threats against the country were tantamount to an act of 
aggression and calling for the U.N. Security Council to take up the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dusko Matkovic, a vice president of President Slobodan  
Milosevic's Socialist Party, suggested in remarks published today 
that the Serbs are likely to send a delegation to France. He said 
NATO pressure ``further strengthens Serbian and Yugoslav resolve to 
find a peaceful solution for Kosovo through negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Serb leaders and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels fighting  
to break from Yugoslavia are under international pressure to commit 
to the talks. NATO has threatened airstrikes within weeks if a 
negotiated settlement isn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and five European powers want the two sides to  
commit to talks in Rambouillet, France, aimed at ending the 
conflict over Kosovo Albanians' demand for independence. NATO has 
authorized Secretary-General Javier Solana to take military action 
if the warring parties haven't started talks in a week and reached 
a deal by Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians are by far the majority among the 2 million  
people of the southern Serbian province, and most of them want 
outright independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the government said Monday that the Serbian  
parliament must be the one to decide because ``Kosovo represents a 
vital interest for Serbia and its people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners loyal to Milosevic and ultranationalists led by  
Vojislav Seselj hold a majority in the legislature, which last year 
resoundingly rejected foreign mediation over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between Kosovo Albanian separatists and Serbian forces  
has killed at least 2,000 people, most of them civilians, and made 
refugees out of hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva today, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said  
fighting over the past month has forced 45,000 people from 40 
villages to flee their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center in  
Pristina claimed that two villages in the Drenica region and 
another in the Podujevo region were shelled by Serb artillery 
overnight. There were no reports of casualties.

<HEADLINE> For Falcons, the Hard Part Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Now comes the tough part for the Atlanta Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it was quite an accomplishment to make the Super Bowl for  
the first time in 33 years. Obviously, the ``Dirty Birds'' went a 
long way toward restoring the city's passion for pro football with 
their catchy nickname and funky dance steps. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thing that still eludes this franchise is consistent  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have never had back-to-back winning seasons, a point  
noted quite often by coach Dan Reeves even as he was guiding 
Atlanta to the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an awful lot of things to be proud of,'' Reeves said,  
after an extraordinary season ended with a 34-19 loss to the Denver 
Broncos. ``We've come an awful long ways. What we're trying to do 
now is fight for home-field advantage next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has ever played the NFL title game on its home field.  
Next year, the Falcons have a chance to be the first when the Super 
Bowl comes to the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta took care of its first piece of offseason business  
Tuesday, making five players available to the Cleveland Browns for 
the expansion draft: safety Chris Bayne, running back Harold Green, 
tight end Ed Smith, linebacker Ben Talley and offensive lineman 
Dave Widell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayne, Green and Widell spent much of the season on the inactive  
list, while Smith and Talley had limited roles as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the Falcons can expect heightened expectations, a  
tougher schedule and an already long-in-the-tooth team that will be 
one year older. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, in particular, is starting to take on the look of  
the ``Over The Hill Gang,'' with five starters who will be 32 years 
or older by the start of next season. Average age of the entire 
unit: 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A youth movement is under way, centering around the team's last  
two No. 1 draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Michael Booker, the top choice in 1997, took on a  
larger role when injuries plagued starter Ronnie Bradford. 
Linebacker Keith Brooking, picked No. 1 last year, started slowly 
but gradually worked his way into a regular role in passing 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needed early on to study films and anticipate, take notes  
and understand,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``I think 
he needs to apply all the tools he has, because he has unbelievable 
tools and is going to be a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking eventually figures to take over a regular spot at  
outside linebacker, while second-year player Henri Crockett is the 
heir apparent to Jessie Tuggle at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett are entering the final year of  
their contracts, and both will be 34 at the beginning of next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	While the corners -- Bradford and Booker on one side, Pro Bowler  
Ray Buchanan on the other -- are still in their 20s, how much longer 
can Eugene Robinson (36 in May) and William White (33 next month) 
keep producing at the safety positions? 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was a Pro Bowler and the unquestioned leader of the  
secondary, barking out orders on the field, reciting Bible passages 
in the locker room. But his once-spotless reputation took a 
devastating blow when he was arrested on a charge of soliciting an 
undercover police officer for sex the night before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be a man about it,'' Robinson said of his  
off-the-field scandal. ``I'll let my lawyer handle it, but I won't 
run from you, I won't try to evade you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Age also is a concern at receiver. Terance Mathis and Tony  
Martin were the second-most productive duo in the league -- 
combining for 2,317 yards -- but Mathis will be 32 in June and 
Martin turns 34 early next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line, led by Bob Whitfield at left tackle and  
rookie Ephraim Salaam on the right side, is a young group with 
plenty of room to improve. Twenty-four-year-old O.J. Santiago needs 
to work on his receiving skills, but seems set for a long, 
productive career at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the offense revolves around All Pro running back  
Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler, a Pro Bowler for the 
second year in a row. Depth at those positions will be a major 
focus of the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record with 410 carries this season, mainly  
because his top backup was rookie Ken Oxendine, a seventh-round 
pick. Byron Hanspard, who missed the season with a knee injury, has 
barely started his rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was backed up by 45-year-old Steve DeBerg, so finding  
an experienced -- but much younger -- backup also will be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But those are questions for the days and months to come. For  
now, the Falcons want to relish the moment a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a magical season, without a doubt,'' Tuggle said.  
``It was more than I expected. We worked hard this year to make 
true believers out of everybody. We did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they've got to do it again.

<HEADLINE> Braves Open Pre-Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves' pitching staff is getting a  
head start. 
</P>
<P>
	With the start of spring training still more than two weeks  
away, Braves pitchers began working out this week at ``Camp Leo,'' 
the informal program run by pitching coach Leo Mazzone. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping former closer Mark Wohlers relocate the strike zone and  
boosting rookie Bruce Chen's bid for the fifth spot in the rotation 
are Mazzone's top projects. Wohlers and Chen are due in later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the loss of Denny Neagle, you look at the starting  
rotation and I think the No. 5 hole becomes more important than it 
was last year,'' Mazzone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who appeared in only 27 games with the Braves last  
season, converted his first seven save chances but strained a 
muscle and was clueless when he returned in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He wound up 0-1 with a 10.18 ERA, walking 39 in 20 1-3 innings  
and was sent down to Triple-A Richmond, where he was just as bad: 
0-3 with a 20.23 ERA, 36 walks and 17 wild pitches in 12 1-3 
innings. In late August, he was placed on the disabled list due to 
an ``inability to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers has been throwing in Puerto Rico and California since  
Jan. 3 under the tutelage of Guy Hansen, a pitching instructor and 
Braves special assistant in scouting and player development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anything about his progress,'' Mazzone said.  
``I'll see for myself on Wednesday. That's when he's supposed to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, who lives in Panama, has been having visa problems but is  
expected later this week. The 21-year-old left-hander was 13-7 at 
Double-A Greenville, 2-1 at Triple-A Richmond and 2-0 with a 3.98 
ERA in four starts with the Braves last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed enough in his four starts here last year to  
certainly give you the idea that he can adapt and adjust and be a 
pretty good pitcher,'' Mazzone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The informal pitching program, which began in 1991 -- Mazzone's  
first full season with the Braves -- opened Monday with nine 
pitchers and catcher Javy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, 11 pitchers and Lopez were on hand, a group that  
included NL Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine, 17-game winners John 
Smoltz and Kevin Millwood, and closer Kerry Ligtenberg.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Exchange Proposes Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Stock Exchange proposed dozens of  
measures Tuesday to protect investors from mining-industry scams, 
two years after the Bre-X gold mine scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A TSE report called for tighter technical and scientific  
standards for exploration, development and mining operations. It 
also said stock analysts should be forced to reveal whether they 
own shares in mining companies they promote. 
</P>
<P>
	The TSE, Canada's largest stock exchange, formed a task force to  
look into mining investment after revelations in 1997 that a vast 
gold deposit supposedly found in Indonesia by Calgary-based Bre-X 
Minerals was in fact a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carson, the TSE's senior vice president of market  
regulation, expressed hope that the task force proposals would help 
Canada remain a world leader in financing mining exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the report's recommendations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mining companies should be subject to scrutiny by independent,  
well-trained experts, perhaps drawn from the ranks of a new 
professional association of geologists and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
	--New standards should be established for the scientific analysis  
of mineral samples, as well as for the way in which sampling 
results are reported. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police agencies and securities regulators should strengthen  
their ability to enforce securities regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bre-X stock was listed on the TSE after rising to more than $200  
a share on the smaller Alberta Stock Exchange as the company 
steadily upped its projections of gold at the Indonesia site. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine was later proved worthless, and some of the company's  
geologists in Indonesia were accused of adding gold from other 
sources to samples extracted from the exploration site. 
</P>
<P>
	Bre-X went bankrupt after its share price collapsed, leading to  
numerous pending lawsuits by investors who lost money.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hog futures fell sharply Tuesday on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange amid worries that weak slaughterhouse demand is allowing 
already large herds to grow further. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude oil and its products fell a second day,  
while soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogs suffered from weak meatpacker demand, an indication that  
supermarkets likely have all the supplies they need in the 
near-term. Pork herds were nearly 2 percent higher in late December 
than at the same time last year, largely because of weak domestic 
and foreign demand that came just as producers had moved to 
increase their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rebounded in January amid signs that inventories may  
continue to tighten in the year-over-year period, but have weakened 
in recent days as packer demand slowed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork bellies advanced, however, amid signs of robust demand for  
bacon from restaurants and supermarkets that have been heavily 
promoting sales in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hogs for February delivery fell 1.13 cents to 41.47 cents a  
pound; February pork bellies rose 0.75 cent to 55.67 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures retreated in nervous trading on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as investors awaited the latest reports on U.S. 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S.  
Energy Department have reported bigger-than-expected declines in 
supplies of heating oil and unleaded gasoline as refinery runs 
slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	World producers have been using U.S. shores as a dumping ground  
for oil that few other nations are prepared to purchase amid global 
economic troubles. And while Venezuela, the largest exporter to the 
United States, has been hinting at additional output cuts from top 
producers, market participants say that country has yet to meet 
export cuts nearly a year after they were promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have given back recent gains on that account,  
preferring to take a wait-and-see approach for crude values, 
keeping them close to 12-year lows despite smaller product 
inventories going into the higher-demand gasoline season. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures edged higher as  
investors bet inventories will continue to tighten, while natural 
gas futures staged a technical recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	March crude fell 7 cents to $12.30 a barrel; March heating oil  
rose 0.34 cent to 37.61 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline 
rose 0.34 cent to 37.81 cents a gallon; March natural gas rose 7.4 
cents to $1.818 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were supported on the Chicago Board of Trade by gains  
the Brazilian real has made against the U.S. dollar in the past two 
days. Corn and soybean futures have been pressured in recent weeks 
following Brazil's decision to devalue its currency, a move that 
many feared would result in a flood of exports as producers in that 
country seek hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
	March soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to $5.13 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) --Soybean futures rose sharply Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, pulling corn along for the ride. Wheat futures 
finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans were supported by gains that Brazil's real currency  
has made against the dollar the past two days. Corn and soybean futures 
have been pressured in recent weeks following Brazil's decision to 
devalue its currency, a move that many feared would result in a flood 
of exports as producers in that country sought hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures finished near flat as heavy commodity fund buying  
gave way to renewed concerns about ample supplies and weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for March delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.70 1/4 a bushel;  
March corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.17 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 
1/2 cent to $1.06 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Proposes Bans for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch opened a world summit on drugs in sport by calling for a 
new drive to wipe out ``this odious and unhealthy form of 
cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening address, Samaranch also referred to the  
corruption scandals which have plunged the IOC into the worst 
crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you all know, over the last few weeks the International  
Olympic Committee has been confronted with a serious situation with 
regard to allegations of wrongdoing leveled against some of its 
members,'' Samaranch said today. ``We have swiftly taken all the 
necessary measures and are continuing our investigations to ensure 
that Olympic ethics are respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled for receiving  
cash payments, gifts and other favors stemming from Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the drug problem, Samaranch proposed the creation of  
an international anti-doping agency to coordinate drug testing 
around the world -- one of the centerpieces of the three-day 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency should be autonomous and run by a board of  
directors composed of Olympic officials, scientists and 
representatives of government and non-governmental organizations 
and pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have insisted that the agency must be fully independent  
to have any credibility, an issue which will certainly play a major 
role during the rest of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Samaranch said he would oversee the agency and  
proposed that IOC medical commission chief Prince Alexandre de 
Merode should run the body on a day-to-day basis. The proposal has 
already drawn opposition from delegates and IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said de Merode had done ``a very good job'' as the  
Olympic drug chief for almost three decades. His detractors claim 
he has been largely ineffective while doping has become one of the 
chief issues in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's speech, Samaranch said athletes had turned to doping  
in ``the pursuit of victory at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the controversial issue of drug sanctions, Samaranch said the  
IOC cannot force sports federations to apply specific penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We apply sanctions whenever they are necessary,'' he said.  
``But we are not a court and we do not wish to become one. All we 
ask is for the rules we have set to be observed by all those 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``corrective and emergency methods'' have a limited  
effect and that a campaign of prevention and education would prove 
more successful in the long run. He also called on governments and 
pharmaceutical companies to collaborate in the fight against drugs, 
including drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those scheduled to speak today was White House drug czar  
Barry McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the conference, McCaffrey said the Olympic  
movement faced ruin unless effective steps were taken to curb the 
escalating drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey planned to call on the IOC to accept a fully  
independent worldwide anti-doping agency. He opposed plans that 
would give Olympic officials effective control of the proposed 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Independent doesn't mean dependent,'' McCaffrey aide Bob  
Weiner said Monday. ``He is pushing for true independence with 
random outside audits and verification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was hoping the meeting would smooth the way for a  
``level playing field'' for all competitors from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But proposals of an IOC working group to streamline drug  
policies around the globe already ran into obstacles before the 
meeting started. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel proposed that athletes face life bans and fines of up  
to $1 million if found guilty of serious cases of ``intentional 
doping'' and suggested selective bans for some first-time 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The world soccer federation call the proposals too tough and  
unworkable while the swimming federation said a unified anti-doping 
stance would be impossible under such circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks Failing To Take Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb leaders and ethnic Albanian  
rebels are running out of time to decide whether they will commit 
to peace talks, described as the ``last chance'' to resolve the 
Kosovo conflict without NATO military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and five European powers have summoned the two  
sides to start talks Saturday in France aimed at ending 11 months 
of fighting over Kosovo Albanians' demand for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last chance, and I would like to make a call for  
negotiations in good will to solve this tragedy,'' NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has authorized Solana to take military action if the  
warring parties haven't started talks in a week and reached a deal 
by Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Liberation Army promised an answer on whether it  
would take part by Wednesday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said 
after meeting Monday with rebels in Kosovo's provincial capital of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government in Belgrade  
announced that the hard-line Serbian parliament will decide 
Thursday whether the Serbs will show up for Saturday's conference 
in Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rebels, the risk of exhausting the patience of foreign  
mediators was an even greater threat than a NATO attack, European 
Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo Albanians really have to see that they must  
maintain the support of the international community,'' Petritsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-proposed peace plan on the table would give Kosovo  
greater autonomy for the first three years it takes effect; 
political parties would decide what happens after then. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians are by far the majority among the 2 million  
people of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, and most of them 
want complete independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said rebel leaders have come around to accepting at least  
``the concept of an interim accord'' that stops short of their 
demand for full sovereignty. He remained hopeful that the peace 
process was still on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never like to use 'optimism' and 'Balkans' in the same  
sentence but I believe we have a very good process ahead,'' Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanian political leaders have agreed to attend the  
conference. However, without the participation of the armed 
factions -- the KLA and the Serb government -- any conference would 
be doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the government said the Serbian parliament must be  
the one to decide because ``Kosovo represents vital interest for 
Serbia and its people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners loyal to Milosevic and ultranationalists led by  
Vojislav Seselj hold a majority in the legislature, which last year 
resoundingly rejected foreign mediation over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Seselj renewed his opposition to the conference Monday,  
``despite the threats.'' Deputy Yugoslav Premier Vuk Draskovic 
said, however, that ``I believe our response must be `Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole world wants us to go, and to say 'no' would mean  
working to our own detriment,'' Draskovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between Kosovo Albanian separatists and Serbian forces  
has made refugees out of hundreds of thousands of people and killed 
at least 2,000, most of them civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana said he believed ground troops would be needed to enforce  
any peace accord -- his strongest statement on the matter so far. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the deployment would be similar to the one in Bosnia but  
gave no estimate of the possible number of troops.

<HEADLINE> Settlement OK'd in Delta Miles Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge has approved the settlement of a  
class-action lawsuit that accused Delta Air Lines Inc. of violating 
its frequent-flier program, an airline official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, approved late Monday by Cook County Circuit  
Judge Judith Cohen, will allow certain members of Delta's frequent 
flier program to receive a package of benefits, depending on the 
number of miles accumulated before July 1, 1988. They would have to 
have accumulated at least 40,000 frequent-flier miles to qualify, 
Delta spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1988 after Delta placed restrictions on  
frequent mile usage and seat availability without informing 
frequent fliers of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a breach of contract,'' said attorney Gil Gordon, who  
represented Delta passengers who filed the lawsuit. ``They can't 
retroactively change the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, certain members of the program can receive  
double frequent-flier miles for every Delta domestic flight for a 
year, discounts of up to $150 per flight or relaxed restrictions on 
the number of frequent-flier mile users on a particular flight, 
Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials estimate 580,000 Delta customers could benefit  
from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta, the nation's third-largest air carrier,  
already has sent a notice to eligible customers. They have until 
March 18 to return their proofs of claim, Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said it took 10 years to settle the lawsuit because Fort  
Worth, Texas-based American Airlines is contesting a lawsuit 
involving the same issues raised against Delta. American, the 
nation's second-largest air carrier, contends the Federal Aviation 
Administration gives it the right to set prices and put conditions 
on tickets, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is representing a group of American passengers in a  
class-action lawsuit contesting the airline's decision to raise the 
frequent flier mileage for a free ticket from 20,000 miles to 
25,000 miles.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with share prices falling in Tokyo for the second straight session. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 115.35  
points, or 1.00 percent, to close at 14,649.83. On Monday, the 
average closed down 34.07 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell on fears of soaring Japanese interest rates  
and a weakening U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates are seen as bearish for the stock market  
because they can damage corporate profits by raising the cost of 
borrowing money. A stronger yen can lower earnings from exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, however, gave no indication that it would  
intervene to slow the rise in rates, with Japanese Finance Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa saying Tuesday he would let market forces decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 113.18 yen in late trading,  
down 2.30 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and its late New York level 
of 115.08 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed lower as investors sold shares to take  
profits after two straight sessions of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chip prices, fell 96.83 points, or 1.00 percent, to close at 
9,502.72. On Monday, the index had gained 92.65 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead  
of a meeting later Tuesday in the United States of the Federal Open 
Market Committee over interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market hasn't had much direction in recent days,'' said  
Andrew To, sales director at Tai Fook Securities Co. ``People are 
awaiting news from the FOMC meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares closed at a new 32-month low amid continued  
concerns over the island's slowing economic growth despite a cut in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 113.15  
points, or 1.9 percent, to 5,749.64. It was the index's lowest 
level since May 22, 1996, when it finished at 5,732.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the Central Bank of China, Taiwan's central bank,  
cut a key short-term interest rate to 4.5 percent from 4.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai stocks also tumbled as foreign investors continued to sell  
shares over concerns that local banks would have a hard time 
pumping up their loan-loss reserves to keep up with mounting bad 
debts, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell 11.63 points, or  
3.2 percent, to 347.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed sharply lower, with the main index  
falling 2.5 percent on profit-taking following the market's recent 
rise. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 14.39 points to 
567.28. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on  
profit-taking. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue chip 
companies, fell 11.88 points, or 2.01 percent, to 579.55. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher,  
with brokers saying a rise by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. 
offset a late round of selling. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index 
edged up 0.81 point to 2,210.26. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Strong interest in a few oversold blue chips pushed the  
key index marginally higher at the close of trading. The 30-company 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 5.30 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 1,975.29. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly lower after  
investors took profits following all-time highs recorded by the 
market indicator and some blue-chip stocks Monday. The All 
Ordinaries Index fell 16.7 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,907. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower, with almost all the losses  
being chalked up after the midday break. The Straits Times Index 
fell 20.28 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,386.59. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on profit-taking. The  
Composite Index fell 3.948 points, or 1 percent, to 405.164.

	Jordan Testimony May Support Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After questioning presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan today, House prosecutors drew concessions they hope will 
bolster their case for live witnesses at the impeachment trial. 
Jordan acknowledged for the first time that Monica Lewinsky called 
him to discuss her affidavit denying a sexual relationship with 
President Clinton, sources said. But He asserted he had no reason 
to believe the affidavit was false because he never believed she 
had a sexual relationship with the president. Head prosecutor Henry 
Hyde, R.-Ill., said Jordan's testimony had ``strengthened some 
points'' of the prosecution case.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American warplanes today attacked Iraqi  
anti-ship missile launchers newly deployed along the Persian Gulf. 
Pentagon officials said the Iraqi weapons had been moved to the 
area as a threat to ships in Kuwaiti coastal waters. This was the 
first time during a recent escalation of tensions with Iraq that 
U.S. planes targeted Iraqi weapons designed to strike ships. The 
other attacks have been against Iraqi sites used to threaten U.S. 
and British planes patrolling Iraq's skies.

	Clinton Unveils Plan To Fix Schools  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed today that the  
government spend $200 million to identify and fix poorly performing 
schools. Before an audience packed in the auditorium at Jackson 
Mann Elementary School, the president debunked suggestions from 
Republican lawmakers that tying $15 billion in federal education 
aid to performance standards would usurp local and state authority. 
He said the federal government has a right to expect results for 
the money it invests.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Do-it-yourself lawyering is under attack in Texas,

legal software. U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders says the 
software amounts to the unauthorized practice of law. The Texas 
court battle has national implications for law practice and 
software authorship, and the issue could wind up before state 
legislatures and the U.S. Supreme Court, lawyers said today.

	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- A grenade destroyed a church and killed  
three people today in Guinea Bissau, where government forces and 
rebels battled for control of the capital, an Italian news agency 
reported. At least 35 people have died and 220 have been wounded 
since the fighting that began Sunday in this West African nation,

	Study Links Living Together, Divorce  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing body of research has found that  
contrary to popular belief, people who live together before 
marriage are more likely than other couples to divorce. According 
to a report released this week from the National Marriage Project 
at Rutgers University, studies done over the past decade found the 
same connection between living together before marriage and 
splitting up after. Many researchers believe people who live 
together are more unconventional and less committed to the 
institution of marriage thus more open to the possibility of 
divorce.

	Northwest Airlines Suit Resurrected

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court today resurrected a  
1997 lawsuit that accuses Northwest Airlines of overcharging ticket 
buyers since its 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines. A district 
judge wrongly interpreted antitrust law in dismissing the lawsuit, 
a three-judge panel ruled. The lawsuit argues that the merger 
violated antitrust law and led to higher ticket prices for 
passengers at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where 
Northwest accounts for 80 percent of the traffic. The plaintiffs 
seek as much as $400 million in alleged fare overcharges.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Close Cold War-Era Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's ``greatest need right now'' is  
to rid itself of Cold War-era bases that are consuming money better 
spent on troops and weapons, Defense Secretary William Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen was testifying before the House Armed Services Committee  
today, arguing for Congress to give him the base-closing authority 
it denied him the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was making a case for President Clinton's proposed $261  
billion defense budget, which asks Congress to authorize military 
base closings in 2001 and 2005. It makes no mention of how many 
bases, or which ones, ought to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The last round of base closings was in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our greatest need right now is for congressional approval of  
two additional rounds'' of closings, Cohen said at a Pentagon news 
conference Monday. He said the closings would begin generating 
savings by 2005 and would ultimately save more than $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cohen himself acknowledged Monday, base closings are a hard  
sell in Congress. Lawmakers are wary of upsetting constituents in 
communities that fear losing the economic benefit of military 
activity. In each of the past two legislative sessions Cohen asked 
for base closings and Congress said no. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Defense Department budget for 2000 is $261 billion,  
compared with the $264 billion projected to be spent in the current 
budget year. The 1999 budget includes $4.5 billion in extra money 
Congress appropriated to improve overall military preparedness and 
to pay for the Bosnia and Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Monday a key goal of the 2000 defense budget is to  
improve conditions for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting harder to recruit and harder to retain quality  
people in this very strong economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposes a 4.4 percent military pay raise in  
2000, but Senate Republicans already are pushing for a bigger 
increase. The Senate Armed Services Committee last week recommended 
a 4.8 percent raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending plan is roughly in line with Republican calls for  
increased spending to modernize the military's weaponry, improve 
troop living conditions and invest in a national defense against 
missile attack.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed at Phoenix Open Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Although an armed man was wrestled to the ground  
within yards of Tiger Woods, investigators don't believe he was 
stalking the PGA superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just let poor sense get the best of him,''  
Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said Monday. ``He got a little 
mouthy, was told to calm down and he didn't heed the officer's 
warnings,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dirren said the Maricopa County attorney's office would be asked  
to review charges of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct 
against Brian K. Murphy, 40, of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was detained briefly in the Scottsdale city jail after he  
was cited Sunday, then was released without bond. In order to face 
the charges, he must be indicted or be formally charged by county 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the county attorney's office,  
said the process would take several days because cases involving 
jailed defendants must be handled before others. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy did not return messages left on the answering machine at  
his listed telephone number, and FitzGerald was unable to say 
whether Murphy had retained an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the incident, general chairman Ray Artigue said,  
the tournament will post signs prohibiting guns in the future. 
Anyone ignoring the sign could be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault count stems from an altercation between Murphy and  
officer Rob Rucker, part of a police detail assigned to shadow 
Woods. Officers on the course wore modified uniforms to blend with 
the crowd but had their mace and service pistols in plain view on 
their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, Murphy had followed the final threesome  
for several holes and kept yelling Woods' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the fan to be quiet, and he said, `I've got a gun,  
too,' and squared off on me,'' Rucker told The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	After the two began grappling, they fell over a rope around the  
tee, and Murphy pulled Rucker's jacket over his head. Another 
officer and a spectator joined in, pinning the burly Murphy to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found a loaded semiautomatic handgun in a backpack,  
Dirren said. Murphy later produced a permit, issued through the 
state Department of Public Safety, that allows him to carry a 
concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirren said Murphy was released because, although the assault  
charge is a felony, authorities considered it a minor incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, these charges didn't warrant him being held  
before a judge,'' Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods, a 23-year-old sensation who finished third on his  
second trip to the tournament, was noncommittal on whether he would 
return to the TPC of Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said metal detectors might be useful at tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
	``Especially when you have this many people doing the things  
they're doing out there on a golf course, with all the (alcohol) 
consumption,'' Woods said. ``People come out here not to watch 
golf. The majority come out here to have a good time.''

<HEADLINE> College of Charleston Back in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Charleston is back in style.  
</P>
<P>
	The College of Charleston has had this most Southern city of  
sweet tea, antebellum homes and debutante cotillions dancing to 
college basketball success the past decade with three NCAA 
appearances and five Trans America Athletic Conference crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Cougars (19-2), who defeated Georgia Southern 66-41  
Monday night, are back in the national spotlight, ranked No. 22 in 
The Associated Press college basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a mid-level program, to achieve a top 25 status is a dream  
come true for the players and the fans,'' Charleston coach John 
Kresse said. 
</P>
<P>
	An undefeated season was a dream that ended for No. 1  
Connecticut, now 19-1 after a 59-42 loss Monday night to Syracuse. 
The Huskies had been voted the top spot for the 10th straight week, 
but played without stars Richard Hamilton and Jake Voskuhl and fell 
for the first time in 16 Big East games. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1), voted No. 2 for the eighth consecutive poll, could  
take over the top spot if it gets by No. 7 Maryland and Georgia 
Tech this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Connecticut's loss, Duke and the College of Charleston are  
tied for the nation's longest winning streak at 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse was schooled by St. John's greats Joe Lapchick and Lou  
Carnesecca and has added a fast-moving offense to Charleston's 
chest-to-chest defensive style. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Cougars, whose streak began against No. 12 North  
Carolina on Dec. 5, appear headed for their third straight NCAA 
tournament and fourth appearance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, personally, the chance to do the Charleston again in  
the Big Dance is what it's all about,'' said Kresse, whose thick 
New York accent seems to fit down here a little bit better with 
every 20-win team he fields. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Cougars were moving up, Kansas fell out of the poll  
for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut got 52 first-place votes and 1,756 points, while  
Duke had the remaining 19 No. 1 votes for 1,720 points from the 
national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse and the Cougars last cracked the rankings in 1996-97,  
when they were on their way to the Trans America Athletic 
Conference title and a first-round NCAA upset of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The College, which went from NAIA to NCAA status in 1990, romped  
through the TAAC with an 80-6 mark and five straight titles from 
1994-98. The Cougars' 125-23 mark during that span -- the fewest 
losses of any Division I team -- included headline-grabbing wins 
against Georgia Tech, Arizona State and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the tougher and deeper Southern Conference, Charleston  
is showing the same dominance. It beat Massachusetts and North 
Carolina before Christmas and has started 11-0 in its new league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that we would definitely be in there a week or two  
after the North Carolina game,'' forward Carl Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been waiting and waiting and just seeing how the  
lower teams in the top 25 did,'' said guard Danny Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford fell one  
place to fourth. Kentucky and Auburn each moved up one, while 
Maryland dropped from fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the top 10 was Michigan State, St. John's and  
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances since Jan. 29, 1991, was the third longest current 
streak behind the 156 of North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) reentered the Top 25 after its 11th straight  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6), No. 24 last week, and Florida, No. 25 a  
week ago, both lost two straight to drop from the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse said the Cougars hoped to make the top 25, but there are  
other, more important goals ahead, like a Southern Conference title 
and an NCAA tournament run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like this is one of the better teams we have been a  
part of,'' said Johnson, who transferred from Clemson two years 
ago. ``We feel we can do some damage. You just can't write us down 
as a loss when we get to the (NCAA) tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Intel, Mattel Unveil High-Tech Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- When the leading computer chip maker  
teamed up with the top toy manufacturer, their brainstorming 
session produced a unique new product that could change the way 
kids have fun. It's also handy for looking up your nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. and Mattel Inc. are showing off the results of their  
collaboration -- call it an 18-month private play date -- with the 
first two products of the Intel Play line of toys, which they plan 
to unveil Monday at the Toy Fair in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the toys is a little electronic microscope that hooks up  
to a home PC, allowing kids to see blown-up images of anything they 
hold up to the lens. Since it's got its own light source, kids can 
use it to see close-ups of their ears, eyes, or even the inside of 
their nostrils. The second product is a camera connected to the 
computer that throws the moving image of a child onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're converting the magic of technology into the magic of  
playthings,'' said Doug Glen, Mattel's chief strategy officer. 
``Together we're offering much more play value than any stand-alone 
toy could have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel Play X3 Microscope, selling for about $99 and designed  
for kids 6 and older, plugs into a computer and magnifies up to 300 
times. It can sit in a stand so kids can hold things up to it, or 
it can be taken out and be held up to things. 
</P>
<P>
	The image is captured in a video format and can be colored, cut  
and moved around by aspiring young film editors. The time-lapse 
feature allows kids to make a movie of a germinating seed or a 
butterfly emerging from a cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect kids are going to start looking at everything.  
Coins, sewing threads, making discoveries all around them,'' said 
Michael Bruck, Intel's director of joint project. 
</P>
<P>
	The second toy, the Intel Play Me2Cam, $99, is a camera that  
sits on top of or next to a computer. It comes with Fun Fair 
software that allows children to be projected into the virtual 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	To play, a child stands in front of the computer and interacts  
by jumping around. In one game, bubbles slip across the screen. 
They can pop ``good'' bubbles with a poke of their finger, but 
``bad'' bubbles capture the player, who watches their trapped image 
struggle helplessly inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tapping the powers of the personal computer that people  
have already invested in and delivering a toy product that is so 
much more magical and amazing than anything we've seen before,'' 
said Mary Ann Norris, Mattel's director of the collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	The new line is being developed at a facility called the Smart  
Toy Lab in Portland, Ore., where a dozen handpicked toy designers 
and high-tech mavens play and create all day long. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts from both the toy and technical worlds said  
they see happy times ahead for the new alliance. ``It sounds like 
an interesting marriage of high tech and toys,'' said Gene 
Gilligan, executive editor of the toy industry magazine Playthings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilligan said toy companies have struggled in recent years as  
children spend more time on their computers and less time with 
their train sets and teddy bears. ``Certainly a company like Mattel 
is looking for a way to make toys to go with a computer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toys are expected to hit stores this fall, just in time for  
the Christmas shopping season.

<HEADLINE> Belfast Plant Declares Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Mackie International PLC, the  
Belfast engineering firm that President Clinton once highlighted as 
a model of peacemaking at work, declared bankruptcy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which straddles the barbed-wire barriers that  
separate Irish Catholic and British Protestant neighborhoods in 
west Belfast, provided the setting for Clinton's keynote speech 
during his 1995 visit to British-ruled Northern Ireland. Standing 
beside a local Protestant boy and Catholic girl, he cited Mackie as 
Belfast's most graphic example of Protestants and Catholics working 
profitably together. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm, which makes industrial looms, die-cast machinery and  
sewage treatment equipment, saw its share price rise above $5 
following Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strong British pound, cheaper foreign competition and  
recession in Asia produced deepening losses that have forced its 
shares down to around 18 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the company reported pre-tax losses of $8.9 million.  
Last year it lost $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackie's board of directors had struggled in recent months to  
raise $23 million in capital to buy another English engineering 
firm. They hoped the merger would bring in business and secure the 
jobs of 320 Belfast employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the directors conceded Tuesday, after lengthy talks with  
their primary creditors Ulster Bank, that the company must be 
liquidated or sold and appointed accountants Deloitte &AMP; Touche to 
do the job. No immediate job cuts were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The British government's Industrial Development Board for  
Northern Ireland -- which has poured many millions into Mackie, most 
recently paying for a new foundry and machine-making equipment -- 
has refused to bail out the company this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams, west Belfast's member of the  
British Parliament, said he is lobbying Clinton's special economic 
adviser to Ireland, Jim Lyons, for U.S. aid to leverage a buyout.

<HEADLINE> No Decision on US Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is discussing with  
Congress the possible use of thousands of American ground troops to 
monitor any peace settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before negotiations begin on the future of the Serbian  
province, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and President Clinton's national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, all have begun preliminary talks on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	They have left the impression the administration is determined  
to have U.S. troops play a peacekeeping role, but publicly and 
privately administration officials say no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Bosnia, the U.S. troops would be part of a monitoring  
group along with European soldiers. In all, a multinational force 
of some 20,000 may be necessary to oversee a cease-fire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright briefed Clinton on Monday at the White House for 75  
minutes on the outlook for a negotiated settlement between the 
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. Serbia is the main 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who attended Monday's meeting, said the situation in the  
Serbian province could turn into a ``burning fuse'' and ``require 
the United States to play a much larger role than some kind of 
small contribution at this point would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the warring parties in Kosovo are due to  
begin Saturday at Rambouillet, France. But neither the Yugoslav 
government nor the ethnic Albanians have pledged to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO threatening military force against the Serbs, the  
United States and five European nations last week demanded Belgrade 
grant maximum self-rule -- but not independence -- to the Albanians 
who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France, the cohosts of this weekend's talks, already  
have announced they would commit troops to a peacekeeping operation 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans deferred to the Clinton administration on  
threatening the Serbs with NATO bombardment. They, on the other 
hand, want the United States to be part of any peacekeeping force 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright began her consultations last Saturday on her return  
from London where the six-nation Contact Group leveled their 
demands. She talked to Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of 
the House International Relations Committee, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, at a news conference, said the role Europeans would play  
and what forces, if any, they were prepared to commit were under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing would be decided until such time as we work in  
consultation with key members of Congress to raise these issues and 
discuss and debate them before the president considers this,'' 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said there was no decision  
yet on U.S. troops. But he emphasized ``there is a need and an 
urgency for American leadership and determination'' in Kosovo, as 
in Bosnia. He offered assurances that while U.S. troops might be 
under the immediate command of a European, their ultimate commander 
would be Gen. Wesley Clark, an American who is the supreme NATO 
commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has tried to calibrate very carefully what  
the relative roles and responsibilities of European countries and 
the United States ought to be,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the spokesman said the United States had ``significant  
national interests at stake'' in ending the 11-month conflict in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	These include the potential for a humanitarian catastrophe in  
the spring, when the weather is more conducive to fighting, and 
that the Kosovo conflict could spread to other areas of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was skeptical about the use of U.S. troops in Bosnia to  
monitor the settlement engineered by the United States in November 
1995 to end a 3 1/2-year ethnic war among Serbs, Croats and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping operation has proceeded smoothly, however, with  
no American soldiers lost in any conflict in the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. contingent has been reduced to 6,900 from a high of  
20,000.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Bounce Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices rose early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the advance, supported by gains the Brazilian real  
has made in the past two days against the U.S. dollar. Corn and 
soybean futures have been pressured in recent weeks following 
Brazil's decision to devalue its currency, a move that many feared 
would result in a flood of exports as producers in that country 
sought hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures bounced from heavy losses a day earlier as large  
commodity fund houses took advantage of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.71 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.17 a bushel; March oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.06 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 3 1/2 cents to $5.12 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose 0.08 cent to 62.65 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle fell 0.30 cent to 72.17 cents a pound; February 
lean hogs fell 0.40 cent to 42.20 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose 0.18 cent to 55.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Software Flaw Marks Living Deceased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- People across the country are finding some  
disturbing information when they open their W-2 forms: They've been 
declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem appears to be that employers used new W-2 forms with  
old computer software programs. As a result, an ``X'' that should 
have been printed in the ``pension'' box appeared in the space 
denoting ``deceased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At New Mexico State University, hundreds of employees opened  
their tax forms this week to find an ``X'' printed under the word 
``deceased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing happened last week to 13,000 city employees in  
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Selling Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So odd are these impeachment-saturated times  
that Chief Justice William Rehnquist, author of an old study about 
two very old impeachment trials, has been outshining ``101 Nights 
of Grrreat Sex'' on book charts. 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of the Federalist Papers also has been going  
gangbusters by the standards of dusty dogma, burying Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's new collection of kids' letters to her cat and dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's not about sex. Maybe it's about history.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's year of tribulation is selling books.  
Americans have been reaching for histories to comprehend the 
goings-on in Washington and thumbing through the works of 
contemporary ideologues eager to tell them what to think. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Woodrow the White House Mouse is finding life to be a hunk  
of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	When the author of that children's series on the workings of  
Washington read a poem on national radio explaining the trial 
through the eyes of his political mice, sales of his books shot up. 
(``It's a rodent republic on Capitol Hill,'' Peter W. Barnes told 
listeners). 
</P>
<P>
	John Grisham and Patricia Cornwell need not worry. To those  
chart-topping authors, the roars of the literary lions of 
impeachment are but a mouse's squeak. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rehnquist, presiding in Clinton's trial, saw his ``Grand  
Inquests'' paperback, based on his 1992 hardcover, rise well into 
the top 100 charts as readers tried to divine his thinking on 
today's drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist's book was No. 53 last week on the Barnes and Noble  
online chart, keeping him just in front of a Dilbert cartoon 
calendar book and well ahead of Laura Corn's ``101 Nights of 
Grrreat Sex,'' at 83. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, Corn's 1995 paperback shot ahead of Rehnquist's  
book, although he was still beating another of her volumes, ``101 
Grrreat Quickies'' from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky has given new life  
to other old books as well. San Diego psychologist Gloria Harris 
says the 1993 book she wrote with Rona Subotnik, ``Surviving 
Infidelity,'' suddenly started selling briskly again last summer 
and prompted an updated version with Clinton and cybersex worked 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question,'' she says. ``It's all the Clinton  
business pushing it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes says sales of his children's series rose by half in  
December even though his books do not mention the trial. ``Parents 
and teachers are having to talk more and more about this with 
children,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped even more last month after he explained the  
impeachment process in verse on National Public Radio. But in the 
poem, Woodrow is on trial for a cheesy scandal; no Monica mouse is 
to be found. ``I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole,'' he 
says. ``Not with kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 paperback edition of ``The Federalist Papers'' rose to  
566 in the sales ranking of online bookseller Amazon.com from deep 
in the thousands. The collection of essays, most by Alexander 
Hamilton and James Madison, rose in popularity after being quoted 
in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	If 566 doesn't sound like much, consider that ``Dear Socks, Dear  
Buddy'' ranked 6,822nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to come in the book world: ``Monica's Story,'' as told to  
biographer Andrew Morton, expected to be released later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The left and the right, meanwhile, have been battling it out  
breathlessly in print, and clawing into top 10 lists, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton adviser James Carville let loose in October with ``And  
the Horse He Rode in On,'' in which he argues that Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr is a swamp creature. It opens: ``As with 
mosquitos, horseflies, and most blood-sucking parasites, Kenneth 
Starr was spawned in stagnant water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carville and conservative moralist William Bennett, author of  
the anti-Clinton book, ``The Death of Outrage,'' traded leads for 
several months in Publishers Weekly, USA Today and Wall Street 
Journal lists. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither could rise quite as high as the source of so much of  
the fuss: the Starr report itself, a hot seller even though it was 
widely available for free. 
</P>
<P>
	As released by three different publishers, the report was 1, 2  
and 3 on USA Today's list the same week in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last fall, lawyer Ann H. Coulter scored well with ``High  
Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton.'' In it, 
she warns: ``At this rate, the entire country will soon be 
molesting interns, lying under oath, buying witnesses, flashing 
subordinates, and rifling through confidential FBI files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, but first we have to get through all these books.

<HEADLINE> A Denver Dynasty? Tune in Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Now it's time for the Denver Broncos to deal with  
their place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Do the two-time Super Bowl champions rate with other great teams  
of the modern era? Lombardi's Packers? The Steel Curtain? America's 
Team? 
</P>
<P>
	The one way to prove with certainty that the Broncos belong in  
such company is for Denver to win again next year. As commanding as 
those other champions were, none of them won three successive Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Can these Broncos, particularly if John Elway retires?  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we've done it is because we're always hungry,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said Monday, hours after the Broncos beat the 
Atlanta Falcons 34-19. ``We always question ourselves. Our mindset 
was that if we played the perfect game, not only could we beat a 
team, we could dominate a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also knew that if we didn't hit on all cylinders, that we  
could be embarrassed. That's why we've had success. If we have that 
type of mindset, then we have a chance to have success in the 
future. I would be surprised if we don't, because of the mindset 
and character of our guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those traits begin with Elway, of course. After a career marked  
by great athletic achievements but no championships, Elway now has 
matched Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman and Joe 
Montana by quarterbacking two straight Super Bowl winners. None of 
them managed three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos just might be good enough to repeat even if Elway  
isn't around. They won four games with Bubby Brister starting for 
an injured Elway this season. They have the NFL's best player, 
Terrell Davis, and some superb other weapons. The offensive line is 
staunch. The defense is stingy and makes big plays. There's a nice 
balance between youth and experience. And a terrific coaching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Elway's leadership and perseverance are at the core of  
this team's success. For the Broncos to survive the rugged 
competition in the AFC alone -- the Jaguars, Jets, Dolphins, Bills, 
Patriots, perhaps the Steelers and Seahawks all could be formidable 
-- will be a tough task with him. Without the man Ed McCaffrey 
called ``the Denver Broncos,'' who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' said Elway,  
who couldn't have written a better ending than winning the MVP 
award on Sunday. ``But it also would be nice to walk away at the 
level that I'm playing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a football player, I'm never going to not want to play  
football. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also know that 
if I play like I played last night that I can play a little bit 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also knows he could return to a very special club that isn't  
likely to lose anyone of significance. It appears Shanahan's 
coaching staff will remain intact with offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak turning down a move to Colorado as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	These Broncos appear in as good a position to win a third  
consecutive crown as any of the other repeaters, and better than 
some. A lot better, if No. 7 is behind center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' Elway said. ``But the last thing I want 
to do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.''

<HEADLINE> German Workers Continue Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's chancellor appealed Tuesday  
to employers and the country's biggest union to compromise on wage 
talks, while tens of thousands of workers held a third day of 
warning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged both sides to hammer out a  
``sensible accord that respects the wider economic conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You will understand that I would like to see strikes  
averted,'' he said in an interview Tuesday with ZDF television. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers of the powerful IG Metall union are staging strikes to  
back their demand for a 6.5 percent wage increase, rejecting 
employers' offer of 2 percent plus 0.5 percent from firms that can 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Opel auto works in central Hesse state alone, 8,000  
workers laid down tools for several hours, while 2,000 workers 
ended shifts early in DaimlerChrysler's main plant in Stuttgart, a 
union spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30,000 workers protested throughout the western state of  
North Rhine-Westphalia, said the union, which represents 3.4 
million workers in the metal and electrical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall has said it will call a full strike vote among its  
members if there's no contract by Feb. 11. The union's boss, Klaus 
Zwickel, told the mass-market Bild newspaper that the union has 
accepted contracts with only modest wage increases in recent years, 
but instead of unemployment sinking, company profits and stock 
prices have soared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our colleagues aren't dumb,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They  
see through this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A glimmer of compromise emerged late Tuesday. The head of the  
employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, said the 2.5 percent offer 
wasn't necessarily final and that employers would make a fresh 
offer Wednesday. Werner Stumpfe called on IG Metall to take ``a 
very, very big step'' toward compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a third round of talks for the states of Hesse,  
Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland were called off Tuesday after 
just one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall negotiator Klaus Mehrens said employers' failure to  
make a fresh offer was ``ridiculing the workers.'' Further talks 
are set for Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers' representatives warn a strike would threaten the  
chancellor's initiative for government, employers and unions to cut 
Germany's 10.9 percent unemployment figure. They say a 6.5 percent 
wage hike would kill jobs at a time of slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaria state employers' negotiator Rainer Hildmann said the  
industry has created 70,000 jobs in the past year alone. He called 
on the union not to push through a contract ``that only brings 
growth for those who have jobs, but leaves the unemployed 
outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes are being closely watched because IG Metall's  
contract traditionally sets standards for wages in other 
industries.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Town Prepares for Groundhog Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) -- Why do perfectly normal people come to  
this off-the-main-road town to see a meteorologically wise 
woodchuck poke his head out of a stump and predict the weather? 
</P>
<P>
	Hard to say, even for those folks who have traveled a long way  
to this town of 6,740 resident today for Groundhog Day, perhaps one 
of the oddest weather forecasts in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Simmons had trouble figuring out why he ended up in  
Punxsutawney's main square Monday, watching a television reporter 
tape a spot with a rodent. Or why his wife felt like signing 
Punxsutawney Phil's visitor's book outside a mock groundhog burrow 
in the local library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' said Simmons, 29, fresh off a four-hour trip  
from the northeastern town of Tunkhannock. ``For the absurdity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something unusual,'' offered his friend, Sandra Peoples,  
26, of Scranton. ``Something you can say you did once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And only once,'' added Simmons' wife, Jackie, 28.  
</P>
<P>
	Phil's prediction was expected at dawn today. Legend has it that  
winter will last six more weeks if the groundhog sees his shadow. 
If not, spring is right around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	The animal has predicted six more weeks of winter 100 times in  
112 appearances, and his forecast has been correct about four times 
in 10 -- not quite Accu-Weather, but not bad for a rodent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Anderson, a member of the Groundhog club's tuxedoed Inner  
Circle and publisher of the local paper, says this annual bit of 
mid-winter frivolity is what brings people to Punxsutawney. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wild affair,'' he said. ``It's another Woodstock.''  
</P>
<P>
	The party began Monday night with banquets, craft shows, a visit  
to a Phil's glassed-in burrow and film screenings. Actually, there 
was only one film showing: Bill Murray's ``Groundhog Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levitt, 23, and his girlfriend drove four hours from St.  
Catharine, Ontario. Why? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' said Levitt. ``Plus, we couldn't afford anything  
else.''

<HEADLINE> More Poor Preschoolers Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- More and more preschoolers from poor families are  
overweight, the government reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 8.6 percent  
of the low-income 2- to 4-year-olds it studied in 1997 were 
overweight, up from 7 percent in 1989. Among children under 2, the 
percentage rose from 10.8 to 11.3. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe the increase is due to high-calorie  
convenience foods rather than lack of physical activity, said Dr. 
Kelley Scanlon of the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed some improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of poor infants who were breast-fed rose from  
35.3 in 1989 to 46.2 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And the percentage of low-income children under 2 who were  
anemic declined from 19.4 to 18.4, though the number of black 
children with anemia rose from 21 percent to 24.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC studied low-income children from 44 states, the District  
of Columbia and five Indian tribes.

<HEADLINE> Payton Treated for Medical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NFL great Walter Payton is receiving treatment  
for an unspecified medical condition that is not life-threatening, 
his brother said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of the 44-year-old Hall of Famer has been in question  
since he appeared gaunt at his son Jarrett's news conference last 
week to announce he would play football for the University of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, the NFL's career rushing leader, had lost a great deal  
of weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Payton, the golf coach at Jackson State, did not want to  
say what was wrong with his brother until an afternoon news 
conference. He did say, however, that it is ``nothing that he's 
contracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he called the news conference is because he wanted  
to get the right information out. All the rumors that (it) could 
possibly be, it's not,'' Eddie Payton said. ``It's something that's 
not immediately life-threatening and he wouldn't mind talking about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about what his brother said, Walter Payton refused to  
comment. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Texaco Wants Lawsuit Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawyers for Texaco Corp. say a billion-dollar  
lawsuit brought against the oil giant by a group of Ecuadoran 
Indian tribes belongs in Ecuadoran rather than American courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texaco's position is quite clear: The case belongs in  
Ecuador,'' said Chris Gidez, a spokesman at Texaco headquarters in 
White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadoran Indians in native dress sat in Manhattan federal court  
Monday as U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff heard oral arguments in 
the class action suit, which he had dismissed in 1997, only to have 
it reinstated by the U.S. Court of Appeals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes claim that oil drilling technology introduced to  
Ecuador by Texaco nearly 30 years ago and still in use by 
Petroecuador, the national oil company, has turned thousands of 
square miles of Amazon rain forest into a toxic waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's Gidez said the plaintiffs have yet to present credible  
scientific evidence to support their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil company's lawyers, who had previously opposed the case  
being heard anywhere, now say the case belongs in Ecuadoran courts, 
not American courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs are in Ecuador, the operations occurred in  
Ecuador, the state oil company, which is a major partner in the 
consortium, is in Ecuador, and the evidence is in Ecuador,'' Gidez 
said. ``Lastly, the kind of relief the plaintiffs seek can only be 
obtained in Ecuador, due to changes in the procedures of 
Petroecuador and regulations concerning the production of oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cristobal Bonifaz, a Boston-based environmental lawyer and  
native of Ecuador, said the plaintiffs believe the U.S. courts are 
the only place where they can get justice, because the government 
of Ecuador is too dependent on oil revenues and its courts have no 
experience with tort law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an incredible catastrophe -- they contaminated the  
land, they contaminated the rivers, they killed the fish and 
created a medical condition that is going to get worse in the years 
to come,'' Bonifaz said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the Ecuadoran government did not intervene with laws  
to stop the practices and clean up the damage, Bonifaz said the 
country is dependent on oil exports for more than half its revenue 
and could go bankrupt if it lost that income. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Rakoff had dismissed the suit in 1997 on grounds that  
Ecuador officials waited too long before deciding whether to 
continue opposing the suit or joining it as a plaintiff. The 2nd 
U.S. Court of Appeals reinstated the case last year and ordered the 
judge to decide on the venue question. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not indicate when he would rule in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Texaco has a marketing subsidiary in Ecuador now but no current  
oil exploration or production operations of its own, said a 
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Falls 137 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower this afternoon, as  
rising in U.S. interest rates were seen as compromising future 
corporate earnings, at the same time investors were taking profits 
for the second day in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 137.23 at 9,208.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well, led by technology  
stocks , with the Nasdaq composite down 54.78 at 2,455.34, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite off 21.32 at 1,251.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses on Wall Street began early in the session after Japanese  
stock prices declined in overnight trading, as interest rates in 
Japan rose to their highest levels since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher Japanese rates sent U.S .bond prices lower on the  
anticipation that investors would begin routing some of their funds 
away from U.S. securities and into Japanese fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 25/32 point, and  
its yield, which moves opposite the price, rose to 5.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in domestic interest rates occurred just as the Federal  
Reserve began two days of policy meetings. Fed watchers do not 
expect the central bankers to change interest rates in this 
meeting. Recent evidence of robust domestic growth would argue 
against raising them, but the risks posed by financial turmoil 
overseas would be a reason not to lower them, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the higher rates today reminded stock investors that  
companies are going to have to rely on strong earnings -- and not 
lower interest rates -- to keep their stock prices aloft, said Tom 
Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a tough transition point,'' he said, because while  
fourth-quarter earnings reports were generally strong, ``most 
investors don't have a lot of confidence in earnings'' going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors took profits in technology stocks. The Dow  
industrials were led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 4 3/16 at 77 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was leading Nasdaq stocks lower and down 1 7/16 at  
106 9/16, while on the New York Stock Exchange, America Online was 
down 4 11/16 at 166 1/2 in heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, investors got more evidence that the economy is  
strong when the Conference Board, a private research group, 
reported that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 
percent to 106.5 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, which signals above-average growth in the months to  
come, was stronger than economists had expected, and it fueled 
worries that not only is the Fed unlikely to ease any time soon, 
but it might actually raise interest rates in a bid to cool the 
strong economy and rocket-high stock prices. Higher interest rates 
would raise corporate borrowing costs and could dampen earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 11 to 5 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 670.14 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Emilio Estefan Helps Cuban Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It's a toss-up who was more startled:  
Emilio Estefan or the 11 Cuban refugees who found themselves 
welcomed by one of their favorite musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban-born Estefan, husband and musical partner of Gloria  
Estefan, was jogging Monday morning on trendy South Beach when he 
saw the refugees come ashore in a crude, handmade boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw them come in and I saw them crying and when they touched  
down,'' Estefan said. ``They were so cold I brought them a little 
Cuban coffee just to welcome them to the land of freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estefan said they were startled to see him.  
</P>
<P>
	``They just acted surprised because they know who Gloria and me  
are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, who were taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol,  
said they left Cuba within the last week aboard a small wooden 
vessel powered by a diesel engine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Surge in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Demand for trucks drove a surge in U.S. sales for  
automakers last month, as consumers increasingly turned to pickups, 
minivans and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday its sales went up 9 percent due to  
strong truck sales. Other automakers, including DaimlerChrysler AG, 
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., did even better, reporting 
a double-digit increases in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect we'll see foreign brands and DaimlerChrysler picking  
up market share over Ford and GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst 
David Healy. ``These are strong numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it sold 259,615 vehicles last month -- 89,543 cars and  
170,072 light trucks. A 9 percent decline in car sales over January 
1998 was erased by a 22 percent increase in trucks, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford said last month broke a record for overall 
January sales set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All Ford truck models posted sales increases, the largest coming  
from the redesigned Windstar minivan, whose sales were up 54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing, sales and  
service, said the decrease in car sales came from a planned cut in 
sales to rental fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	One model that sold well: the new Mustang, whose sales increased  
34 percent. That car is made at Ford's River Rouge complex, which 
was shut down Monday after an explosion in the complex's power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it sold 56,176 cars and 139,631 light  
trucks last month, an increase of 18 percent over the previous 
year. The company reported strong sales for Dodge and Jeep trucks 
and SUVs, and said its large sedans -- Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler 
Concorde, LHS and 300M -- also sold well. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said some of DaimlerChrysler's gains might have come from  
the fleet sales that Ford shunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota reported a 27 percent jump in its sales for the month,  
with sales of the popular Toyota Camry sedan up 72 percent. The 
company's Lexus division benefited from sales of its two SUVs, the 
RX 300 and LX 470. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong market conditions that fueled near-record industry  
sales in the final quarter of 1998 should carry over well into 
1999,'' Yale Giesel, Toyota executive vice president, said in a 
statement. ``High consumer confidence and affordable interest rates 
will play a big part in how long the industry can maintain its 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. said U.S. sales were up 17 percent, driven by  
its Odyssey minivan and CR-V sport utility vehicle. Troubled Nissan 
Motor Co. also posted a sales gain of 4 percent, with increased 
truck sales overcoming a slight decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European automakers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and  
Volkswagen -- also posted sales gains. But Volvo AB, which Ford 
plans to buy for $6.45 billion, reported its sales declined 18 
percent from January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. is scheduled to release its sales report  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Prowling Tiger Still Mystery in NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, N.J. (AP) -- People move to this fast-growing suburban  
enclave in the scrub pines to get away from the big city. A 
prowling tiger has shown some residents just how far they've gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a 431-pound Bengal tiger wandered around a  
residential subdivision for several hours until it was shot to 
death by police, who had tried unsuccessfully to tranquilize the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities still don't know where the animal came from,  
although they don't lack suspects: Six Flags Great Adventure with 
its wildlife safari and a private tiger sanctuary run by woman 
known as ``The Tiger Lady.'' Both deny the animal was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode has left many residents stunned to learn they've  
spent $300,000 or more to buy dream homes between New York and 
Philadelphia in a community that also is home to more than 30 
tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know when you buy a home, it's up to you to ask about  
things: Are there any landfill problems, is the water OK, how are 
the schools, how high are taxes?'' said Karen Klag, who moved to a 
pricey subdivision near the Tiger Lady's compound in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``But who in the world would think to ask, `Are there tigers  
within a quarter-mile of my home?''' she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other new residents of the subdivision, Klag knew  
nothing of Joan Byron-Marasek when she and her husband bought what 
they thought would be an ideal home in which to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
	And the couple certainly never heard of Tigers Only Preservation  
Society, the nearby refuge that Byron-Marasek operates on her 
11.7-acre property about 20 miles southeast of Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Klag and others say, they wish they'd never come here.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you think of tigers, you think of Africa, not New  
Jersey,'' said Juanita Maldonado, who moved in about six months 
ago. ``In the summer, there was this awful smell. We couldn't 
figure out what it was. Then we found out: It was from tigers. 
Tigers!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife say  
they strongly suspect the escaped tiger came from Byron-Marasek's 
preserve, located about a half-mile east of Interstate 195. 
</P>
<P>
	Permit paperwork on file with the state indicated she has 23  
tigers, although only 17 were found there last week. She told the 
town's mayor that three of the tigers had died. That leaves two 
unaccounted for. Although Byron-Marasek hasn't adequately explained 
the discrepancies, the state doesn't believe that any other tigers 
are on the loose, said David Chanda, a state wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	An outer fence surrounding the compound was found partially  
knocked down when wildlife officials visited last week, and they 
issued Byron-Marasek a summons for violating the state permit 
requiring the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron-Marasek's lawyer, Valter Must, said the fence is meant to  
keep intruders out. The 20-foot-high chain link interior fence that 
pens in the tigers remains intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Must said Byron-Marasek is an intensely private person. She and  
her husband, Jan, use their own money and private donations to 
operate the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has got a devotion and love for these cats that I don't  
think anyone can understand,'' Must said. ``She would do anything 
for them. I can understand that someone looking at this devotion 
would characterize it as fanaticism, but I won't characterize it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luane Acevedo, a friend of Byron-Marasek, said the woman is a  
former tiger handler with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey 
Circus who got two Siberian tigers from Russia and some of the 
other Bengal tigers from India. 
</P>
<P>
	``She walks among her tigers just like Tarzan,'' Acevedo said.  
``She's amazing. She told me, `I have scratches all along the sides 
of my ribcage and both my arms have been cut open, but they're just 
playing.' Now that's love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron-Marasek and state officials signed a consent agreement  
over the weekend allowing inspectors to come onto the property at 
will and conduct spot counts of the tigers there. On Monday, the 
agreement was extended indefinitely, Must said. 
</P>
<P>
	Must said Byron-Marasek has operated Tigers Only for 23 years  
without incident, but Jackson Mayor William Allmann said the 
township has received regular complaints from neighbors about odors 
and early morning roars. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I come out here in the morning to start up my car, they  
roar,'' said John Malinowski, who lives 150 yards from the 
preserve's fence. ``It sounds just like you hear on a cartoon -- 
Roooaaaaarrrrr! Every once in a while when I'm playing around out 
here, I look over my shoulder a little.''

<HEADLINE> Condiment Could Ward Off Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Horseradish may do more than just spice up  
your favorite sandwich. Scientists in Oklahoma believe the 
condiment can also serve as a food preservative, guarding against a 
host of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	Both horseradish and mustard oil contain the pungent chemical  
allyl isothiocyanate. Mustard oil has 93 percent AITC, but has a 
milder flavor than horseradish, which has 60 percent AITC. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the presence of the chemical, both condiments can  
help fight off listeria, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and other 
food pathogens, according to the work of Henry Fleming, a food 
technologist with the Agricultural Research Service and Oklahoma 
State University food chemist Brian Shofran. 
</P>
<P>
	That may come as good news to consumers who want to help  
safeguard against bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes, which can 
cause listeriosis. Healthy people usually can fight off the 
bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can 
kill, by causing meningitis or blood infection. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, a number of companies have recalled their meat  
products for fear of contamination by listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumers have sought foods that use fewer  
chemical preservatives, prompting more research for natural 
substitutes in the food industry. Many scientists have investigated 
allicin, a natural microbe inhibitor found in garlic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agricultural Research Service is the chief research agency  
of the U.S. Agriculture Department.

</P>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- It's too early to predict how this  
year's peach crop will fare, but the mild winter temperatures may 
set the crop slightly behind schedule, say state horticulturists. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas Agricultural Extension horticulturist, Jim Kamas of  
Fredricksburg, said the Hill Country is a bit behind in chill 
hours. Peaches need a certain amount of chill hours -- or the hours 
the trees should spend in cold temperatures in preparation for 
spring blooms -- to break out of dormancy and produce a good crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the warm trend in late January is fairly normal,  
there has not been enough chill to set the crop,'' he said. ``We 
are relatively short on those chill hours, but it's too early to 
push the panic button.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamas said the peach trees in the Hill Country usually bloom  
around March 10; tree growth is looking relatively good across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``An ideal February would include 35 to 45 degree temperatures,  
and growers are really hoping that will happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though growers are hoping for cooler weather soon, a late frost  
could severely damage the peach crop once the blooms have set. 
</P>
<P>
	Extension horticulturist Marty Baker of Overton said peaches are  
extremely sensitive to changes in the weather once the fruit 
flowers have set. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of the state are also dealing with low chill hours  
and hoping for cooler weather, Kamas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cultivars (plant species) get progressively more cold tolerant  
as you go north, so nobody really has enough chilling hours yet,'' 
he said. ``Everybody is really in the same boat because the weather 
has been the same proportionately with respect to the cultivars' 
tolerances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Angelo, extension horticulturist John Begnaud said  
dormant oil sprays are being applied to the peach trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil is really safe and basically smothers the insects,''  
he said. ``It only works in mild temperatures, though, so this is 
an ideal time to spray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begnaud said growers and homeowners are also pruning, cutting  
and transplanting trees at this stage in the growing cycle.

<HEADLINE> Baseball's Norm Zauchin Dies at 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Former major leaguer Norm Zauchin, best  
known for driving in 10 runs while playing just five innings during 
a game in 1955, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Zauchin, a first baseman who played for the Boston Red Sox and  
Washington Senators, died Sunday after a long illness. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	During six seasons in the major leagues, he hit .233 with 50  
homers and 159 RBIs in 346 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was 1955, when hit .239 with 27 homers and 93  
RBIs for Boston and finished third in AL Rookie of the Year voting. 
He played in 130 games and led AL first basemen in fielding 
percentage at .995. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 27, 1955, had 10 RBIs with three homers and a double in  
the first five innings of a 16-0 victory over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1957 season, he moved on to the Senators and spent two  
seasons in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Zauchin began his professional career in 1950 with the  
Birmingham Barons, where he set a Rickwood Field record with 35 
home runs. His record stood until 1987, when Rondal Rollins hit 39 
in the final year the Barons played at Rickwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Zauchin is survived by his wife, Janet; a son; two daughters;  
and six grandchildren. Burial is scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Md. Meets Duke in Key Hoops Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- A Duke win Wednesday will likely elevate the  
Blue Devils to the No. 1 ranking. But the Maryland Terrapins have 
been waiting for this game since a humiliating defeat a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins (19-3, 7-2 ACC) certainly remember the first  
meeting Jan. 3 in College Park. Md., a much anticipated game that 
ended in an 18-point Duke blowout. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we did to them up there is going to give them a little  
extra added incentive to come in here and play like they have 
nothing to lose,'' said Duke's Chris Carrawell. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-ranked Terps may have been looking forward to the  
Duke matchup so much that they may have looked past their latest 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Unranked Wake Forest defeated Maryland over the weekend. Seniors  
Laron Profit, Terrell Stokes and Obinna Ekezie combined for just 15 
points on 4-for-17 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do expect your seniors in games like Wednesday night to  
really step up and play great,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said 
Tuesday. ``As a player, I would like this game because Duke has a 
chance to be No. 1 and that attraction alone should get you pumped 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With top-ranked Connecticut's loss to Syracuse on Monday, Duke  
(21-1, 9-0) can claim the top ranking by beating Maryland and then 
Georgia Tech on the road Saturday -- and also get off to the best 
start in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have been ranked second for eight consecutive  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they were fuming after we went up there in January and  
beat them on their home court,'' said Duke forward Shane Battier. 
``They are not going to be sleeping two games in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's success against Duke since 1985 has been feeble at  
best, winning only five of 32 games. They've won only once (1995) 
in Cameron Indoor Stadium, where the Blue Devils are riding a 
33-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think before we step on the court we have a little  
psychological advantage over the other team just because we're Duke 
and that other team has that fear,'' said Battier. ``By saying 
that, we have to go out and establish ourselves as a tough, 
physical, defensive basketball team the first couple of minutes to 
reinforce that psychological fear. 
</P>
<P>
	A key for Maryland this time around will be the play of Steve  
Francis, who was just 3-for-14 shooting with four turnovers in the 
first meeting as Carrawell's second-half defense frustrated the 
Maryland star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we caught Steve Francis off guard,'' Duke coach  
Mike Krzyzewski said. ``He just missed some shots against us and we 
were able to rebound his misses. For us, one of the keys to that 
game was we played really good half-court defense and we took 
pretty good care of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't go into the game thinking we're going to stop Steve  
Francis,'' Krzyzewski added. ``We just hope he doesn't become a 
dominant force in the game. He's one of the top players in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win by Duke would give them a nearly insurmountable three-game  
ACC lead over Maryland and North Carolina with six league games 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can win this game it will give us big breathing room in  
terms of winning the (ACC) regular season title,'' Duke's Trajan 
Langdon said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates the 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans launched a barrage  
of criticism today at President Clinton's $1.77 trillion budget, 
declaring it was riddled with questionable accounting gimmicks and 
seriously flawed by not including broad tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other administration  
witnesses were told by GOP-controlled committees that the budget 
Clinton unveiled Monday would be substantially rewritten to trim 
his proposed spending increases and free money for a significant 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. William Roth, said  
he found it incomprehensible that Clinton's budget would project 
$4.8 trillion in surpluses over the next 15 years and still not be 
able to produce any broad-based tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Americans should have to wait at least 15  
years for a tax cut,'' Roth, R-Del., told Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the budget marked the start of a  
great national debate that would clearly show the differences 
between Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``America can only benefit by the competition of ideas and this  
ought to be one of the highest quality debates in Congress in many 
years,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans in both the House and Senate have signaled  
their support for a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income 
tax rates, which could cost as much as $800 billion over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told the Finance Committee that the administration opposed  
an across-the-board tax cut because two-thirds of the relief would 
go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. He said the 
administration's targeted proposals for increased child care 
benefits and retirement accounts represented a more equitable and 
less costly way to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans who criticized Clinton's budget on the issue of  
tax relief said they support his general goal of using 62 percent 
of future surpluses to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But they asserted that the specific plan Clinton advanced in the  
budget to accomplish this was riddled with accounting gimmicks and 
that a much more straightforward approach should be employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's complex proposal would essentially issue two sets of  
bonds that would be held by the Social Security system. The 
administration argued that this accounting process would serve as a 
``lockbox'' to ensure that politicians were not tempted to divert 
to tax cuts and other uses the financing Social Security will need 
to meet the needs of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said Clinton's plan snared general  
tax revenues to support both Social Security and Medicare, 
something the government has so far avoided doing, preferring 
instead to trim benefits when necessary to keep Social Security and 
Medicare costs in line with the payroll taxes collected to support 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we look to the general fund to take care of these  
shortfalls, all the incentives to make the tough decisions for 
Social Security and Medicare will evaporate,'' Chafee told Rubin 
and Deputy Budget Director Sylvia Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said the administration had put forward a fiscally  
sound document that protects Social Security and Medicare, pays 
down the national debt and supplies funding increases for national 
priorities such as education and child care. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget projects that last year's surplus of $69.2 billion,  
the first in 29 years, will be followed by a rising tide of black 
ink over the next 15 years, an assumption that economists say could 
be wiped out quickly if the current healthy U.S. economy suddenly 
dips into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that tensions between the two parties have already been  
heightened by the impeachment battle, this year's budget battle in 
an era of surpluses is shaping up to be every bit as contentious as 
the monumental fights during two decades of soaring deficits that 
often produced gridlock and government shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my days in Congress, I've never seen such a  
kitchen-sink approach to government. The budget contains something 
for everyone and that's what's troubling,'' the House Ways and 
Means Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, complained 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the  
Republican chairmen of the budget committees of Congress, said at a 
joint news conference Monday that the GOP had surmounted the 
differences on tax policy that last year kept Republicans from 
presenting a unified front. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici, who had been reluctant to go along with House  
Republicans' calls for big tax cuts, said he was firmly behind 
efforts to get across-the-board reductions in rates.

<HEADLINE>  Broncos, Fans Hold Rally in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- At the end of a day, a distinct chant emerged from  
the din made by the throng of fans who came to see the NFL 
champions come home: ``One more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd at Monday's parade and rally for the Denver Broncos  
voiced a collective plea to quarterback John Elway, asking him to 
play for one more year before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	And behind that hope was a hunger for an unprecedented third  
consecutive Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come back because he wants to be the only quarterback  
to three-peat,'' Cindy Unrein Chengery, a season ticket holder like 
her parents before her, said of Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Elway's teammates had said they expect him to retire,  
but that was before Sunday night's 34-19 victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons. Elway was named the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the crowd after doing a little dance to Billy Idol's  
``Rebel Yell'' when he was introduced, Elway gave the fans a spark 
of hope that he could be back for more -- but no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``That three-peat does sound interesting,'' Elway said. ``But  
we'll talk about that, but right now we're going to enjoy this win 
we had last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Coach Mike Shanahan, who usually avoids putting any public  
pressure on his quarterback, urged Elway to stay, saying ``One more 
time for Elway'' and starting a crowd chant of ``One More Year, One 
More Year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway would say nothing more about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought last year was great, this year was even better,''  
the quarterback said. ``As I said two weeks ago, I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's exuberant festivities were in direct contrast with  
Sunday night's violent post-Super Bowl celebrations, which resulted 
in at least 20 arrests and dozens treated for tear gas exposure. 
Property damage was estimated at $160,000 after the crowd turned 
over trash cans and cars, broke windows and set off bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could have been a lot worse,'' Andrew Hudson, a  
spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb, said Monday. ``I think if 
police had not done as well in organizing their efforts, a lot more 
people would have gotten hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's parade and rally wasn't all about Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just Elway anymore. We have a whole team now,''  
Chengery said. ``Terrell Davis, Bill Romanowski, Rod Smith ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were filled with pride for the whole team.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't call them the donkeys anymore,'' said Fran Cronin,  
40, a Denver native and lifelong Broncos fan who watched her team 
lose four Super Bowls before finally winning two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos initially said they wanted only a rally because nine  
players needed to get to Honolulu for the Pro Bowl by Tuesday. But 
fans and Mayor Webb convinced the team to hold a parade, saying 
they should show some gratitude to the city that voted last 
November to give them a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos traveled down Broadway on fire trucks and in buses,  
starting downtown and continuing about a mile to Civic Center Park 
for the rally. Police and a spokesman for the mayor estimated the 
crowd size at 375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were small children, some doing their best imitation of  
running back Davis, whose jersey they wore, as they zigged and 
zagged to get away from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	So many thousands of people crowded into the 16th Street Mall  
that shuttle buses had to stop running. The city took on an almost 
medieval air with hawkers selling every kind of Bronco 
paraphernalia, and others offering to paint fans' faces blue and 
orange for $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd sat for several hours or more -- with a strong  
north wind dropping the wind chill into the 20s -- to hear their 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to say that this year I think is a little bit  
more special than last year,'' Davis told the crowd. ``I think the 
road to getting back here was a little tougher. But my teammates 
and I, we got together ... and we got another one, baby. Thanks a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parade route was much shorter than last year, when 650,000  
people turned out to celebrate the end of Denver's 37 years in 
football's wilderness. That rally was held several days after the 
Super Bowl on a sunny day when temperatures hit 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had gone to the Super Bowl four times, losing by large  
margins in all of them, and after their first victory they drew 
nearly twice as many to their parade as had gathered to see Pope 
John Paul II celebrate mass in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans, their hearts broken so often, took to calling them  
the ``Donkeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was the quarterback in the last three losses. Last year,  
he became the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, in a 31-24 
victory over Green Bay, at age 37, in his 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to say that after 14 years I thought it could get  
better, 15 it was great, and after 16 to win two in a row, it's 
been unbelievable,'' Elway told the crowd. ``And we all up here owe 
you a bunch because without you it's not all possible. So we up 
here thank you.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hoops Player Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Howard McNeil, who played at Seton Hall  
in the 1980s, faces up to 70 years in prison after being convicted 
in the stabbing death of a suspected prostitute to steal her drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Montgomery County jury Monday found McNeil guilty of  
third-degree murder in the death of Frances Brennan, an alleged 
drug dealer. Police said Brennan's skull was cracked when she was 
pushed into a wall before being stabbed to death. McNeil also stole 
a safe filled with drugs from the house, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old McNeil was found guilty of related drug and  
theft charges, but not convicted on more serious first- and 
second-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's facing enough time to keep him in jail for the rest  
of his life,'' Assistant District Attorney Cynthia Davidoff said. 
``And that's what we'll be seeking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNeil was a star basketball player for Abington High School in  
the 1970s. In 1976, he shot a friend in the head with a handgun at 
a Valentine's Day party. He was found guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter and avoided jail. 
</P>
<P>
	After his career at Seton Hall, he was drafted in 1982 by the  
Los Angeles Lakers, but wound up playing for 10 years in Greece, 
Argentina and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeil's attorney, Stephen Jarrett, said he expected to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett had said his client confessed to the crime only after  
investigators supplied him with details about the killing, and that 
McNeil took the safe before Brennan was killed, the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pats Mulling Stadium Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) --State officials are talking about the  
possibility of finding an alternative location in Hartford for the 
New England Patriots' stadium if the proposed waterfront site 
cannot be cleaned up in a timely and cost effective manner, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday is the deadline for the state and the team to sign a  
stadium development agreement -- a binding contract obligating the 
state to finance a $374 million stadium in downtown Hartford and 
requiring the Patriots to play there for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hartford Courant, citing sources it did not identify,  
reported today that state officials will consider an alternative 
site if they cannot reach a deal soon with the owners of a steam 
plant that must be relocated before the stadium can be built. 
</P>
<P>
	A vacant, city-owned site just north of Interstate 84 is a  
leading contender as a replacement site, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John G. Rowland has previously dismissed the idea of an  
alternate site for the stadium, pointing out that it is to be part 
of a larger waterfront development known as Adriaen's Landing.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Falls Out of Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Connecticut's run as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press  
college basketball poll reached 10 weeks Monday, while Kansas was 
not in the Top 25 for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies were again the runaway choice, receiving 52  
first-place votes and 1,756 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the rankings were released, however, Connecticut --  
which had been the nation's only unbeaten Division I team at 19-0 -- 
lost to No. 16 Syracuse 59-42. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies were minus two injured players -- leading scorer  
Richard Hamilton and leading rebounder Jake Voskuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1) was No. 2 for the eighth straight week, getting the  
other 19 No. 1 votes and 1,720 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Top 25 received a shakeup, with Kansas, which  
had been ranked for every poll since Jan. 29, 1991, dropping out 
along with Texas Christian and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers were No. 20 Utah, which was ranked 10th in  
the preseason poll and for the first weeks of the regular season; 
No. 22 College of Charleston, which is ranked for the second time 
in school history; and No. 24 Missouri, which is back in the Top 25 
after a 3 1/2-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford, which  
lost at Arizona on Thursday, dropped one place to fourth. Kentucky 
and Auburn each moved up one place to fifth and sixth, while 
Maryland, which lost by 13 points at Wake Forest, dropped from 
fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State and St. John's held on to Nos. 8 and 9, while  
Arizona moved back into the top 10 after the win over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances was the third longest current streak behind the 156 of 
North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long time. I'm proud of that,'' Kansas coach Roy  
Williams said. ``But I truly don't think it will affect this team. 
I really don't. We play dumb on the court sometimes. But they're 
not dumb kids. And they realize that doesn't have anything to do 
with the way we play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect me whatsoever and I'd be shocked if  
they let it affect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, at 66 consecutive polls, moved into third place  
followed by New Mexico at 50, and Duke and Stanford, both at 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) moved into the Top 25, having not lost since the  
Texas game when they dropped to 5-4 and out of the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	College of Charleston (18-2) is ranked for just the second time  
in school history. The Cougars were in the Top 25 the last five 
weeks of the 1996-97 season and got as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Both their losses were to Southeastern Conference teams --  
Georgia and South Carolina -- and their current 15-game winning 
streak started with a victory over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season and the Tigers came in having won three straight 
after consecutive losses to Kansas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6) dropped from No. 24 after consecutive  
Western Athletic Conference losses to Tulsa and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (15-4) fell out from No. 25 after just one week in the  
poll, beating Alabama and then losing to Mississippi State.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Central Banker Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Another official at Malaysia's  
central bank is stepping down, the national news agency reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Governor Abdul Murad Khalid is the third high-ranking  
official at Bank Negara, the central bank, to quit since economic 
and political turmoil hit Malaysia last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Murad, who was responsible for banking regulation and  
banking supervision, is widely viewed as an ally of ousted deputy 
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, who was also finance minister, was removed from office  
Sept. 2 after policy disputes with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
His dismissal spurred massive anti-government protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Murad's resignation will take effect Feb. 1, the national  
news agency Bernama reported. No reasons were given for the 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the central bank's then-governor, Ahmad Mohamed  
Don, and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak, quit the central bank on what 
sources said were policy differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after their resignation, Malaysia imposed selective capital  
controls to tackle the country's economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Fire Kills 22 Dogs, Six Cats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASSILLON, Ohio (AP) -- A fire broke out at a house where a woman  
had been mauled by dogs 45 minutes earlier, killing 22 dogs and six 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pets were burned and others apparently died of smoke  
inhalation. The carcasses were found throughout the first floor of 
the 1 1/2-floor wood-frame house, Massillon Fire Chief Tom Matthews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal control officers in this city about 60 miles south of  
Cleveland said one dog survived the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics had been called to the house Monday night to help  
Gertrude Lare, 72, who had suffered numerous dog bites, some of 
them severe. She was listed in serious condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities weren't sure what triggered the dog attack. The  
animals belonged to Lare's daughter, who also lived in the house, 
but was apparently not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after Lare was taken to the hospital -- leaving  
no one home -- firefighters were called to the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were still trying to determine what caused the  
fire, but it didn't appear suspicious, Matthews said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Tackles `Red Tape' Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first full week of activity, Congress  
is taking up at least three bills on an issue that Republicans, and 
some Democrats, hold dear -- curbing the costs of the federal 
government's zeal for new laws and programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The most far-reaching bill, debated by the House Rules Committee  
Tuesday, would extend a 1995 law to better protect consumers, 
workers and businesses from the costs of new federal laws. Under 
the measure, members of Congress could raise objections about new 
laws and force a vote on any mandate that costs the private sector 
more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 unfunded mandates act, one of the cornerstones of the  
``Contract with America'' that guided House Republicans when they 
became the majority party in Congress, required cost analyses of 
new laws but allowed objections to be raised on those that would be 
paid for by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfunded mandates refers to federal laws that force new duties  
on state and local governments but don't help with the costs of 
those duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors of the bill, Reps. Gary Condit, D-Calif., and Rob  
Portman, R-Ohio, argued before the Rules Committee that it would 
make lawmakers more aware of the price tag on new programs and 
would not be used by friends of industry to disrupt debate on 
needed legislation. ``It simply holds us accountable for the 
mandate,'' Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration opposes the bill, saying it created a  
``procedural obstacle'' to passing laws benefiting the public by 
failing to consider how they protect human health, safety and the 
environment, according to a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A second measure, coming to a vote Wednesday before the House  
Government Reform Committee, would give small businesses the chance 
to correct minor mistakes in federal paperwork filings rather than 
paying a fine. The full House is expected to take it up next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most businesses try to comply but often the paperwork is so  
confusing they find it difficult to get it right the first time,'' 
said the bill's sponsor, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened a presidential veto of the McIntosh  
bill, saying the waiving of fines could hamper agencies' ability to 
ensure safety, protect the environment and detect criminal 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	A third bill going through committee this week, sponsored by  
House Small Business Committee Chairman Rep. James Talent, R-Mo., 
would try to reduce paperwork by allowing small businesses to file 
federal reports either electronically or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., John Breaux, D-La.,  
and Trent Lott, R-Miss., are backing a ``regulatory right-to-know'' 
bill that would require the White House budget office to provide 
Congress with annual reports on the benefits and costs of federal 
regulatory programs.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Groups Sue UC Berkeley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Civil rights groups sued the University of  
California, Berkeley on Tuesday on behalf of high-achieving 
minorities who were rejected, saying the university system's 
flagship campus overemphasizes test scores and advanced courses in 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an admissions process that grants preferences to the  
privileged,'' said attorney Joseph Jaramillo of the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight given to the Scholastic Assessment Test, an  
examination of English and math fluency, and advanced-placement 
grades has a discriminatory effect on blacks, Hispanics and 
Filipinos, and lacks ``educational justification,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced-placement courses, worth an additional grade point in  
UC admissions ratings, are far more available in predominantly 
white high schools, Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What advanced-placement and SAT scores don't show is talent  
and ability to succeed in college,'' said one of the plaintiffs, 
Justine Certeza, a freshman at UC San Diego who was rejected by 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks court orders requiring Berkeley to admit  
Certeza and six other minority students and adopt an admissions 
policy that gives qualified blacks, Hispanics and Filipinos ``a 
fair and equal opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such policies are still possible despite California's ban on  
race and sex preferences in state and local government programs, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said the campus retains  
``a strong commitment to access and diversity'' despite ``a new set 
of legal limitations'' -- the UC Regents' ban on affirmative action 
in admissions, later broadened to all state and local government 
programs by Proposition 209. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority enrollment nevertheless fell dramatically last fall in  
the first freshman class at Berkeley affected by the regents' 
action.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Opens Ukraine Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Coca-Cola opened a $100 million soft drink  
plant Tuesday near Ukraine's capital where it will be the biggest 
non-alcoholic beverage facility in the former Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four years, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. has  
invested $270 million in Ukraine and says it is Ukraine's largest 
single foreign investor. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest soft drink company also has a plant in the  
western town of Lviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. chairman and chief executive M. Douglas Ivester  
said at the opening ceremony that the investment shows Coca-Cola's 
belief in Ukraine and its people has not been shaken by the recent 
economic crisis in Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Stressed-Out Employees Can Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- City workers feeling the blues can call up a  
``mood meter,'' an automated phone system that screens for 
depression. They just can't expect to talk to a live person. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers listen to recorded descriptions of how they feel and are  
asked how often they feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Descriptions range from ``I get tired for no reason'' to ``I  
feel others would be better off if I were dead.'' Callers punch the 
digits and hear a recorded diagnosis that urges severe cases to get 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the hotline is valuable for the city's 18,000  
workers, who are often blamed for the city's maladies. But it's 
also good for the city: Healthy employees are less likely to be 
absent and are more likely to be productive, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not meant to replace an appointment with a mental health  
professional, but it's a push in the right direction,'' said Joe 
Cullinan, clinical director of the city's Employee Assistance 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotline was installed in October and so far has received 155  
calls, Cullinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other public employers, such as the city of Toledo, Ohio, the  
Broward County (Fla.) Sheriff's Department, and federal agencies 
such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have also adopted 
the hotline, provided by the Wellesley-based National Mental 
Illness Screening Project, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an employee, it's a great idea,'' said city human resources  
worker Bill Kessler, 46, of Boston.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Finish Deposing Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vernon Jordan was questioned for nearly three  
hours today in a secure area of the Capitol by House prosecutors in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Senators also viewed Monica 
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony and a few Republicans said they saw 
little reason to summon her before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new. If there  
in fact is nothing new, I would not expect her to be called,'' Sen. 
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Republican  
leadership, echoed Bennett's comments. Asked whether there was 
anything to be gained in calling Ms. Lewinsky for live testimony 
based on what is in the videotape, he said: ``Probably not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I see to date that would be gained,'' he added,  
would be that the public would actually see Ms. Lewinsky's 
testimony rather than relying on a White House version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who viewed the tape himself, said  
he believed it might be helpful to have Ms. Lewinsky testify from 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far better for the public to meet her and make up their  
own minds,'' he said. ``Personally, I found her to be young, 
vulnerable and credible. I think she'd make a very effective 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators who watched the tape of Ms. Lewinsky's deposition  
in closed rooms of the Capitol included Republicans Susan Collins 
of Maine and Richard Shelby of Alabama and Democrat Evan Bayh of 
Indiana. They were required to sign an oath promising not to 
describe the contents in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead House prosecutor Henry Hyde acknowledged today that Ms.  
Lewinsky's testimony delivered no ``bombshells,'' but he added that 
``confirming the accuracy and the reaffirmation of her previous 
statement under oath is something worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan faced a deposition under oath in a room normally used by  
the Senate Intelligence Committee. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., was 
the main questioner for the House prosecutors, and -- as on Monday 
with Ms. Lewinsky -- lawyers David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and 
Cheryl Mills were there for the president. Senate observers 
included Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Mike 
DeWine, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The session ended around 2:30 p.m. EST, and Hutchinson said he  
planned to meet with the other 12 House prosecutors to determine 
whether to try to summon any witnesses for live testimony before 
the Senate or to call additional witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are issues we still have to address,'' Hutchinson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The questioning of Jordan began at 9:10 a.m. EST, and each side  
was to have as many as four hours. They took a lunch break after 
12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	As senators for the first time got access to Ms. Lewinsky's  
videotaped deposition, prosecutors were to focus their questions on 
some of the discrepancies that emerged between her grand jury 
testimony and Jordan's last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marked the first time Jordan, a Washington attorney and  
longtime Clinton friend, had testified since Ms. Lewinsky began 
cooperating with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky gave the grand jury specific  
details that linked Jordan to conversations about gifts she 
received from Clinton, destroyed notes to the president and a false 
affidavit in which she denied an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, in the first time she was exposed to possible  
questioning by Clinton's lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky gave testimony that 
closely tracked her earlier grand jury account, according to 
sources familiar with the testimony who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The sources were not associated with the House 
prosecution team and worked outside the White House. Ms. Lewinsky's 
lawyers declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in testimony are important because Jordan  
arranged a job for the former White House intern at the same time 
she was preparing the affidavit in December 1997. The two actions 
are joined in the impeachment article accusing Clinton of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of the discrepancies:  
</P>
<P>
	--According to grand jury testimony released by Congress, Ms.  
Lewinsky said she showed Jordan some gifts she'd received from the 
president; Jordan didn't recall being shown any. 
</P>
<P>
	--She said she thought Jordan was instructing her to destroy  
drafts of notes she'd written to the president. He denied ever 
telling her to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's deposition is the second of three such sessions, as the  
Senate edges closer to the end of Clinton's impeachment trial. The 
trial is to resume Thursday, and unless the depositions yield new 
information, the Senate will proceed to closing arguments and final 
deliberations that could meet the lawmakers' target for ending the 
trial by Feb. 12, or sooner. Videotapes of the three depositions 
could be made public if a majority of senators vote to do so, or 
the witnesses could be called to testify live. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of nullifying her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky  
offered no new information to House prosecutors during four hours 
of questioning by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., according to the sources 
familiar with her testimony on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing up an opportunity to question her, White House lawyers  
instead offered an apology on Clinton's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Private presidential attorney Nicole Seligman read a statement  
that apologized to Ms. Lewinsky ``on behalf of the president for 
all the trouble the investigation and impeachment trial had caused 
her,'' one of the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Mood Somber After Girls' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- At the Granite Run Mall parking lot,  
17-year-old Amber Smith sat in her car, cigarette in hand, and 
shared photographs of herself and the friend she lost in a car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one here was from when we were on vacation,'' Amber said.  
``And here's when she visited me in the hospital after I got stung 
by a bee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was speaking Monday of Tracy Graham, 16, one of five girls  
who died in a one-car crash on a busy suburban Philadelphia highway 
Friday. Also killed were Rachel Lehr, 17; and Loren Wells, Becky 
Weirich and Shaena Grigaitis, all 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died after the car Loren was driving swerved into  
oncoming traffic, hit a utility pole and slamming into a tree on a 
section of Route 1 known as ``Dead Man's Curve.'' State police say 
the car likely was speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the first day of classes at Penncrest High School in  
Delaware County, where the girls were juniors, since the accident. 
The school excused students who were grieving or who broke down 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The school library and hallways were decorated with murals to  
the five girls, and their lockers were covered with notes of 
condolence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been anything but a normal day,'' said Laird Warner,  
superintendent of the Rose Tree-Media school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday afternoon, at the mall parking lot, a radio station  
sponsored an informal memorial service as the five girls' grieving 
friends huddled in clusters, crying, hugging and exchanging 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaena was like our little sister, and Becky always cheered us  
up when we were down,'' Amber said. ``That's what she would be 
doing now if she was here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy wanted to be a television weather forecaster, said her  
17-year-old cousin, Sarah Laxton. But not in Pennsylvania. ``She 
wanted to be somewhere where it was warmer,'' she recounted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rachel, she wanted to be a model, and Loren wanted to go into  
medicine,'' Sarah said tearfully. ``We did everything together. In 
fact, I don't know why I'm not dead with them now.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Ordered To Pay $47M to Nesmith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Public Broadcasting Service must pay  
nearly $47 million to ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith and his defunct 
company for defrauding him in a home video deal that sank the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury decided Monday that PBS went behind Nesmith's  
back to steal the home video rights to such popular fare as 
``Sesame Street'' and the Ken Burns documentary ``The Civil War'' 
while promising to keep his faltering firm afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors rejected PBS' breach-of-contract lawsuit that claimed  
Nesmith owed the nonprofit corporation millions of dollars. They 
upheld a counterclaim of fraud, breach of contract and contract 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like catching your grandmother stealing your stereo,''  
Nesmith said through a publicist. ``On one hand, you're happy to 
get the stereo back. On the other, you're sad to find out your 
grandma's a thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Cantor, a PBS spokesman, said the association of public  
television stations will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``PBS firmly believes that the facts and the law in the case  
merited a ruling in our favor and we are frankly shocked at the 
verdict,'' he said, reading a statement from PBS headquarters in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the latest controversy over PBS' aggressive new  
moneymaking techniques. In the mid-1990s, as Congress threatened 
deep funding cutbacks, PBS turned to the marketplace, offering 
among other things expanded commercial spots to corporate donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesmith, 56, was the hat- and sideburns-wearing member of the  
Monkees, a 1960s music and TV sitcom sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesmith's company, Pacific Arts, made a deal in 1990 to  
distribute the PBS Home Video Line. He licensed the PBS trademark 
and obtained home video rights to dozens of programs from their 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pacific Arts spent $8 million breaking the market, convincing  
stores to give up shelf space for this, putting up kiosks in 
Wal-Marts, things like that,'' said Bruce Van Dalsem, a Nesmith 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1993, the videos were selling well, but Nesmith's company was  
losing money because of the high costs. He decided to sell the 
rights to the accumulated video library, which could earn up to $15 
million and allow him to pay off royalties and other business 
debts, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS agreed in writing to help him recapitalize the business or,  
if that failed, cooperate in slowly winding down the company to 
avoid disruption, Nesmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	While meeting with Nesmith and his staff to reassure them of  
their good faith, PBS officials were busy soliciting a dozen other 
potential distributors, Nesmith said. They also convinced the 
producers of the shows to terminate their distribution contracts 
with Pacific Arts en masse, Nesmith claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS obtained the video distribution rights, split them with  
Turner Home Entertainment and now reaps $27 million per year from 
the business, Van Dalsem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming he owed them millions, Nesmith was sued by PBS, Ken  
Burns' company, public stations WNET-New York and WGBH-Boston and 
by Children' Television Workshop, which created ``Sesame Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He countersued and the cases went to trial before a single jury  
on Jan. 4. The jury ruled PBS must pay the other plaintiffs what 
Pacific Arts owed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded more than $14.6 million to Pacific Arts for the  
loss of the value of the video library and nearly $29.3 million in 
punitive damages. Another $3 million was awarded to Nesmith 
personally.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Makes Fox Ratings Champ / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Denver Broncos' victory over Atlanta may not  
have matched up to previous Super Bowl contests in excitement or 
television ratings, but it was good enough for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 127.5 million people watched at least one minute of  
the game, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. As expected, the 
huge audience enabled Fox to easily capture the week's ratings 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The average audience for the full game was 83.7 million -- making  
it the second lowest-rated Super Bowl game since 1971 and topping 
only the 1990 game between San Francisco and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The number most important to Fox: more than $150 million in  
advertising revenue it earned during the game and its pre- and 
post-game shows. The network said it was the largest single day of 
revenue in television history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also convinced an estimated 22 million viewers to stay  
around after the game to watch a preview of its new animated 
series, ``Family Guy.'' The series begins airing regularly in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, Fox had a 13.2 rating and 21 audience share. CBS  
was second with an 8.0 rating and 13 share, NBC had a 7.5 rating 
and 12 share and ABC was fourth with a 6.8 and 11. The WB had a 3.2 
rating and 5 share among the developing networks, UPN had a 2.1 and 
3 and Pax TV had a 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB's Monday night family drama, ``7th Heaven,'' scored the  
highest rating of any program in the network's history last week. 
It beat its own record set last Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners for the week were CBS' initial airing of ``The  
Shawshank Redemption'' and NBC's new drama ``Providence,'' leading 
the network to its fourth straight win on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the losers: the movies ``Mr. Wrong'' on ABC and  
``Clueless'' on NBC. Critics' favorite ``Cupid,'' just canceled by 
ABC, was again the network's lowest rated program for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program with an 8.7 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' had 
an 8.5 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 7.9 
and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 25-31, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``Super Bowl XXXIII,'' Fox, 40.2; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' Fox,  
33.0; ``Super Bowl Pre Game,'' Fox, 32.5; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' 
Fox, 22.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 13.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.2; ``Family 
Guy,'' Fox, 12.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 12.5; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 11.8; 
``Simpsons,'' Fox, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Would Raise Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tobacco industry isn't the only target of  
President Clinton's budget proposals for business tax increases. 
Corporate America and investors would face more than 70 specific 
tax hikes and 16 loophole-closings in a plan aimed at raising $82 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, small businesses, manufacturers, insurance  
companies and other industry groups were perturbed by the Clinton 
proposals as they examined them Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress rejected some of the same proposed tax increases last  
year, and they could run into trouble with lawmakers again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan is ``kind of picking pockets and not really  
accomplishing a great deal,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice 
president for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is not going to be duped. ... The likelihood of these  
passing is not high,'' he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups expressed bafflement at Clinton proposing tax  
hikes at a time when the federal budget is expected to continue in 
surplus for the next 25 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are especially incensed about a proposal to tax  
companies on the punitive damages they pay to people who win civil 
suits against them. Under current law, companies are charged taxes 
on criminal fines they pay but civil damages can be deducted as a 
business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be unfair to eliminate that deduction without  
``meaningful reform (by Congress) of the civil justice system,'' 
the National Association of Manufacturers said. The manufacturers 
and other industries believe the civil litigation system, 
especially for product liability cases, favors people who sue over 
the companies sued. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would bring the Treasury some $600 million over five  
years, the administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The business groups applauded, on the other hand, Clinton's  
proposal to extend the corporate tax credit for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, meanwhile, is particularly keen about its plans  
for closing corporate tax loopholes and shelters. It wants, for 
example, to force companies to pay taxes on ``forward'' sales of 
corporate stock in which a payment is deferred. A company sells its 
stock ``forward'' by agreeing to issue its stock at a later day in 
exchange for future payments. If a stock is selling for $100 today 
and it was sold forward for $105 three years from now, the 
$5-a-share difference would be taxed under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed business tax increases and new taxes, including a  
55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax hike that would raise $34.5 billion 
over five years, are designed to balance the White House's $1.77 
trillion budget for fiscal 2000. They are the flip side of -- and 
the suggested way to pay for -- Clinton's proposed $36.2 billion in 
tax breaks for groups ranging from stay-at-home parents to the 
steel industry, which are tailored to social needs such as 
education, health insurance and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The securities industry maintained that some of the proposals  
would hurt the stock and bond markets and undermine some 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that the administration is proposing taxes  
that would raise the cost of capital for companies seeking (money) 
to expand and strengthen their businesses,'' said Marc Lackritz, 
president of the Securities Industry Association. ``A pro-investing 
tax policy is critical to sustaining the engine driving the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bond Market Association warned that the Clinton plan  
could deter needed investment in the nation's schools, hospitals 
and other infrastructure by raising borrowing costs for companies, 
states, cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, many of which are arcane, also include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Taxes on certain kinds of stock to prevent companies from  
avoiding taxes on the sale or spinoff of subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Closing a loophole in a way that would discourage some small  
businesses from converting to so-called subchapter S corporations, 
whose shareholders get tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Taxing the investment income of industry trade associations, a  
proposal sure to be unpopular in lobbyist-rich Washington.

<HEADLINE> Gary Sinise Talks About Movie Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gary Sinise is making sure he won't be  
typecast -- he's playing both a hero and a villain in two upcoming 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Dimension Films production ``Reindeer Games,'' which  
begins shooting next month, Sinise will play a con artist who gets 
Ben Affleck to rob a casino, according to Tuesday's Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in ``Mission to Mars,'' a big-budget movie by Disney,  
Sinise will play the leader of a team sent to rescue astronauts who 
confront a mysterious beacon on the red planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinise was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of a legless  
lieutenant in ``Forrest Gump.'' Last year he won an Emmy for his 
portrayal of late Alabama Gov. George Wallace.

<HEADLINE> Nations Cool To IOC Anti-Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The United States and Europe  
rejected an IOC plan to have the committee run a new worldwide 
anti-drug agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics including the White House drug chief and the sports  
minister of Britain said Tuesday that International Olympic 
Committee leadership would doom to failure what is considered the 
linchpin of a historic doping reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	``For complete credibility, it (the agency) must be headed by  
someone other than an IOC member,'' U.S. Olympic Committee 
executive director Dick Schultz said. Spanish Secretary of State 
for Sports Francisco Villar added that the agency ``must not depend 
on the IOC. It must be independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, head of the U.S. Drug Policy Office and head of  
the American delegation to the first worldwide sports drug summit, 
said he agreed with the European Union position ``that the current 
proposal is not adequate to the task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism, on the summit's first day, drew an angry response  
from Prince Alexandre de Merode, the IOC's top drug official and 
committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch's pick to run the 
day-to-day operations of the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this lack of confidence, saying we do  
something not completely correct. I find that a semi-insult,'' de 
Merode said. ``Ask people in the streets if there is a great 
confidence in politicians. I have some doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said that ``an independent agency  
governing the Olympic movement in which the IOC has no part or role 
doesn't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The objections, if not addressed by the IOC, could result in a  
four-month delay in the establishment of the agency, EU officials 
said. Officials hope to have the agency fully operational for the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. proposal also included the lifting of the time limit on  
drug cheating. McCaffrey said future Olympic doping samples should 
be frozen and retained in case scientific breakthroughs allow 
future testing that could stripped users retroactively of medals. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called on the awarding of supplemental medals to former  
athletes who were cheated out of Olympic medals by East German 
athletes who were later documented in courts to be drug users. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening day of the also saw more cracks in demands for  
uniform doping sanctions for all Olympic federations, with even an 
IOC executive board member claiming such a system would not stand 
up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Following objections from several international sports  
federations, Jacques Rogge, an IOC board member from Belgium, also 
came out against a unified drug code. IOC proposals includes a 
minimum two-year suspension for serious doping offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be reasonable. This is not a debate in black and  
white,'' Rogge said. ``You cannot compare athletes. Some careers 
span eight years, some span 20 years. Sanctions have to be adapted 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniform minimum sanctions would be defeated in civil courts, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel proposed that athletes face life bans and fines of  
up to $1 million if found guilty of serious cases of ``intentional 
doping'' and suggested selective bans for some first-time 
offenders.

<HEADLINE> HMO Raise Premiums at Fast Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with rising medical costs and falling  
profits, HMOs are shifting their financial burden to consumers, 
doctors and employers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, health maintenance organizations have  
increased premiums at three times the overall inflation rate and 
have hiked patient costs for prescription drugs. Many have also 
dumped Medicare coverage, causing nearly a half million seniors to 
switch health plans or return to traditional Medicare insurance 
with its higher costs and less generous benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have also have slashed fees to doctors, a move that's led  
some large physician groups to quit the health plans in disgust, 
forcing thousands of patients to find care elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Once seen as a savior for the nation's ailing health care  
system, the managed health care industry has reached a new stage of 
its young life. The days of fast, easy growth are gone as managed 
care has virtually replaced traditional fee-for-service health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, this new dominant form of health care faces an anxious  
public that demands convenience, low out-of-pocket costs and easy 
access to doctors and hospitals. Yet, with prescription drug costs 
soaring by 14 percent a year and more patients demanding more 
services, HMO executives say they've had little choice but to raise 
prices and reduce some benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult time for managed care,'' said Marilyn  
Moon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based 
think tank. ``It's really hard to control health costs, and people 
who acted as if managed care was a magic bullet for cost savings 
for all time were always wrong, and now they are being shown to be 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman who has felt the effects of HMO efforts to build  
profits is Mary Jane Lathrop, 76, a Medicare recipient from 
Antelope, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she saw her monthly co-payments for the estrogen  
replacement drug Premarin and blood pressure drug Zestril increase 
from $10 to $50 when Pacificare Health Systems took them off its 
preferred drug medicine list. 
</P>
<P>
	Lathrop said she was so annoyed, she quit the plan and signed up  
with HealthNet of California. But in November, HealthNet enacted a 
$30 monthly premium for Medicare members. Previously, Lathrop paid 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	So in January, Lathrop switched again, this time to Kaiser  
Health Plan, which has no premium and charges $7 co-payments for 
Zestril and Premarin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been disgusted with HMOs right along,'' Lathrop said.  
``But I can't afford not to be in an HMO,'' because of the 
prescription drug coverage and 100 percent hospital coverage. 
``It's just a necessity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Dawn Hershman, who is training in oncology at New York  
Presbyterian Hospital, has been affected as a doctor and a parent. 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, she had to find a new pediatrician for her year-old  
daughter, Noa, when her doctor quit Oxford Health Plan because he 
said the HMO was delinquent in its payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershman wanted to stay with the pediatrician because he knew  
about Noa's heart problems, had a convenient office and could refer 
to the specialists she needed. And he worked at the same hospital 
as Hershman. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Hershman has to travel across town to see a pediatrician  
and get to know another doctor. ``I sympathize with both sides,'' 
she said. ``The pediatrician group was not getting paid so I 
sympathize with his decision to leave. But, as a result, now I have 
to commute to see her pediatrician and it was not easy to find 
another doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like a teen-ager trying to decide between schoolwork, dating and  
sports, HMOs have been pulled in different directions as they try 
to meet the demands of patients, employers, health care providers 
and shareholders. Each effort to help one group has often come at 
the price of another. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the 1990s, HMOs held premiums increases below 2  
percent, something that pleased big employers who pay most health 
insurance costs. But to hold down premiums, health plans had to 
tighten fees to doctors and hospitals, and limit choice of health 
providers for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to respond to consumer demand for easier access to  
doctors, HMOs have introduced point-of service plans, a variation 
on the HMO model that gives patients some coverage for doctors 
outside the HMO network, as long as the patients are willing to pay 
part of the doctors' fees. Another new option is the open access 
plan, which gives patients direct access to specialists in the HMO 
network without first getting approval from a primary-care doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greater patient freedoms have also come at price. In  
1998, HMO premiums rose by an average of 7 percent, and employers 
predict a 9 percent jump this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And while those premium increases were lamented by employers and  
workers, they were cheered on Wall Street because of their 
potential to improve HMO earnings, which have lagged in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep premiums from rising even higher, health plans and  
employers have pushed more costs onto workers. One typical way is 
to increase the co-payments patients pay each time they visit the 
doctor. Another is to impose higher co-payments for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug costs have been the fastest rising expense for HMOs, as  
pharmaceutical companies increasingly introduce new, pricey 
medicines and build demand for them through intense consumer 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Aetna, United and Cigna, three of the nation's  
largest health insurers, are now using a three-tiered prescription 
drug coverage system. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans charge one co-payment to the patient for generic  
drugs, a higher payment for brand name drugs on the HMO preferred 
list, and a still higher payment for non-preferred drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The system allows coverage for more kinds of drugs, though for  
many it means a $10 or $15 increase in costs per refill. That's 
unacceptable to many HMO members used to getting drugs for free or 
for a nominal charge of $5. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO officials say consumers simply can't get something for  
nothing. But they've been unable to convince consumers of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally we have not done a good job at communicating the  
benefits of managed care and why it is a good thing,'' said Scott 
Serota, executive vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Association. ``We have a public perception problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, managed care's recent focus on saving money and  
improving care by reducing unnecessary services has sometimes put 
it at odds with doctors and patients, said Dr. Lee Newcomer, chief 
medical officer at United Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want the right to a treatment if it works or not,''  
Newcomer said. ``The managed care company says if no evidence shows 
this works, why should we pay for it?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Condemned U.S. Indian Allowed Rite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- For the first time since restoration of  
the death penalty, an American Indian awaiting execution for murder 
has been allowed to undergo a traditional sweat lodge purification 
ritual in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrick Gerlaugh, scheduled to die Wednesday by injection, will  
be the sixth American Indian to be executed in the United States 
since 1976, when the death penalty was restored, according to the 
Death Penalty Information Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six, he is the first allowed to undergo the traditional  
purification ceremony, which was conducted Saturday, said Lenny 
Foster, Gerlaugh's spiritual adviser and a coordinator for the 
National Native American Prisoners' Rights Advocacy Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said the other five asked for the ceremony but were  
denied on security grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It establishes a precedent throughout the United States,''  
Foster said. ``It allows Darrick Gerlaugh to make some peace with 
himself and allows us to demonstrate to Arizona and prison 
officials across the country that there were no problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh was allowed to use a consecrated sweat lodge that has  
been available for other inmates on the prison grounds since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department of Corrections Director Terry L. Stewart said  
officials were able to grant Gerlaugh's request without endangering 
anyone. He didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he were a Catholic, we could in essence bring the religious  
practice to him if he wanted to participate in any of the 
sacraments,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh, 38, whose mother was a Pima Indian, refused requests  
for an interview, but Foster was with him in the sweat lodge for 
the prayer and singing ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	A sweat lodge is a dome-like structure consisting of a frame  
made of willow poles and a covering of blankets. Participants place 
heated rocks in the center, scatter cedar leaves over them and use 
a sage switch to sprinkle water on the rocks to create steam. The 
lodge's flap is opened periodically for cooling before more hot 
rocks are brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sweat lodge ceremony provided him one last opportunity to  
cleanse his mind and body and purify, to make things right with his 
Creator,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh has withdrawn his request for a clemency board hearing,  
and his lawyer said there was almost no chance of a stay of 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death for the 1980 killing of a man who gave  
a ride to him and two friends. The victim, 22-year-old Scott 
Schwartz, was stabbed 30 to 40 times with a screwdriver. Gerlaugh's 
two codefendants were sentenced to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Most Lawmakers Avoid Lewinsky Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Let's go to the videotape!  
</P>
<P>
	Many senators didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott and his Democratic counterpart Tom  
Daschle both took time Tuesday to watch Monica Lewinsky's 
impeachment trial testimony -- videotaped a day earlier. But they 
were in a distinct minority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not even on my radar screen,'' said Senate Armed Services  
Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the chamber's No. 2 Republican,  
said he would stop by a viewing room to watch the tape ``if I can. 
Got a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators, outnumbered by their aides, who did attend the  
private Capitol viewings saw a young woman who stuck to the same 
story she has repeated for months. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Republicans have argued that senators need to look  
the witnesses -- especially Ms. Lewinsky -- in the eye to judge who 
is or isn't telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were a variety of responses from those who took the  
opportunity, at least via videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found her to be heartbreakingly young,'' said Susan Collins,  
R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young, vulnerable and credible,'' said Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.  
</P>
<P>
	``She knew in her head all of the lawyers' tricks,'' said  
freshman Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the senators either said she broke no new ground or else  
they declined to say, citing a secrecy oath forbidding them to 
discuss the substance of closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tape rolled behind closed doors, those present were  
handed transcripts and headsets to help them follow along. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers also could have used some help staying awake, according  
to Sen. Evan Bayh. Asked for his impressions, the Indiana Democrat 
quipped that the room needed ``a new coffeemaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Democrats showed less interest than Republicans in  
seeing the four-hour tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might look at portions,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., as  
he rushed by reporters. Asked whether he knew of any other 
Democrats who would view the tape, he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is that this is pretty much over anyway,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Catching a Lie Isn't All That Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Monica Lewinsky and others are called to  
testify in President Clinton's impeachment trial, senators can look 
them in the eye and tell whether they're lying, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Not necessarily. People are lousy lie detectors, psychologists  
say. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, studies show that to spot liars through their demeanor,  
most people almost might as well flip a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like Pinocchio's nose'' to help judge whether  
someone is telling the truth, says Bella DePaulo, a University of 
Virginia psychology professor. If senators think they can 
accurately tell who's lying and who's not, ``they're simply going 
to be wrong,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	At best, studies show most people do ``a tiny bit better than  
chance'' in judging someone's truthfulness by their facial 
expressions, body language and the tone of their voice, adds 
Brandeis University psychology professor Leslie A. Zebrowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was among the senators who viewed a  
videotape Tuesday of Ms. Lewinsky's private sworn questioning a day 
earlier by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't beat having a live witness, no question about it,''  
Hatch told reporters afterward. ``I found her to be credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal to testify in person 
at the Senate, or at least for senators to view their videotaped 
testimony about Clinton's efforts to hide his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look them in the eye'' to judge their credibility, urged Rep.  
Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But DePaulo said more than 100 psychological studies have shown  
people can correctly identify a liar by studying his or her 
demeanor only 54 percent of the time on average, not much better 
than flipping a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even professional lie-catchers -- judges, police officers, CIA  
polygraphers -- generally did no better than chance in a 1991 study 
by Paul Ekman and Maureen O'Sullivan of the University of 
California at San Francisco. Only Secret Service agents could 
consistently spot a deceiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people simply are great liars. They know people think a  
liar won't look them in the eye -- so they make sure to look someone 
in the eye while telling a falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbal clues tend to be better indicators of lying because  
they're harder to control, Zebrowitz said. Someone's voice pitch 
might get higher, or they may pause more often than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekman's book, ``Telling Lies,'' said the criminal justice system  
almost seems designed to make it hard to spot liars by their 
demeanor. Suspects have plenty of time to rehearse their answers 
and may have repeated a false account so often they start to 
believe it, he wrote. An innocent suspect's fear of not being 
believed may be misinterpreted as a sign of guilt, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts routinely instruct jurors to look at witnesses' demeanor  
to judge whether they are credible. And the Constitution's Sixth 
Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to be confronted 
by their accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our adversarial system is based on the idea that a jury can  
assess the truth by seeing and listening to witnesses,'' said 
American University law professor Thomas Sargentich. ``I think we 
ought to recognize its limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C., lawyer William Moffitt said squirming on the  
witness stand may not be the sign of a lie, but the way a witness 
tells a story can help jurors decide whether it's reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	He said conversations with jurors after trials show they find it  
significant when a witness leaves out some information or 
emphasizes one part of a story over another. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-examination also helps when witnesses are confronted with  
their previous inconsistent statements, said Moffitt, 
president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaulo said studies show that even when people feel confident  
they can tell whether someone is lying, they are no more likely to 
be right than those who feel less confident. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ms. Lewinsky and others testify, ``the senators will probably  
feel more comfortable for having seen them ... but they could 
easily form exactly the wrong impression,'' DePaulo said.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Hispanic Support Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- As Gov. George W. Bush ponders a Republican  
presidential bid, pollsters are disagreeing over how well he did 
among Hispanics during his landslide re-election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an important issue for a candidate whose GOP presidential  
appeal stems partly from his attractiveness to traditionally 
Democratic voters -- especially Hispanics, a growing bloc in 
electoral vote-rich California, New York, Florida and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	One statewide election-day poll, conducted by the Voter News  
Service for The Associated Press and television networks, found 49 
percent of Hispanics voted for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	But an exit poll by the William Velasquez Institute of San  
Antonio for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, 
an Hispanic interest group, put the figure at 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who says he will decide by early April whether to run for  
president, said on election night that the VNS results showed he 
can ``open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and new 
voices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush speaks some Spanish, ran campaign ads in Spanish and spoke  
about issues such as education that appealed to Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The VNS poll surveyed 1,256 Texas voters statewide, including  
208 Hispanics. The margin of sampling error for the Hispanic 
subgroup was plus or minus 9 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Velasquez Institute canvassed 380 Hispanics in 24 precincts  
in heavily Hispanic areas of El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas 
and the Rio Grande Valley, institute research coordinator Robert 
Aguinaga said. The margin of error for Hispanics was plus or minus 
5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguinaga said VNS didn't poll enough voters in heavily Hispanic  
precincts. 
</P>
<P>
	VNS editorial director Murray Edelman defended the 49 percent  
figure, saying the Velasquez Institute poll missed Hispanic voters 
who live in predominantly white districts and are more inclined to 
vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The VNS Texas survey also found that Bush, who was re-elected  
with 69 percent of the vote over Democrat Garry Mauro, captured 27 
percent of blacks, who usually favor Democrats by about 9-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other traditionally Democratic blocs, Bush won 31 percent  
of self-described liberals and 62 percent of voters with a family 
income of less than $50,000. And he won 31 percent of those who 
called themselves Democrats.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Fire on Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes engaged in activity against  
Iraqi forces in both the southern and northern ``no-fly'' zones 
early today, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Richard Bridges said a radar side and a missile site  
were hit in two separate incidents in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	He had no further details immediately of what kind of aircraft  
were involved in the south, or what weapons they used, in the 
incidents occurring at about 5 a.m. EST. But he said the U.S. 
aircraft were not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges said there was some activity in the north about two  
hours later involving ``multiple illuminations, multiple fire,'' 
but he had no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. planes have engaged in almost daily strikes on Iraqi radar  
and missile sites in recent weeks as Iraq increased activities 
apparently aimed at shooting down a U.S. plane. British aircraft 
occasionally have been involved in similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen scoffed at a report Monday in an  
Iraqi newspaper that President Saddam Hussein has offered a reward 
of $14,000 for any Iraqi who shoots down an American plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects just another example of Saddam Hussein flailing  
out,'' Cohen said at a news conference in response to a question 
about Saddam's bounty offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking for any way he can to try to strike out against  
the United States and Britain,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Host Lat Am Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet with Presidents Jamil  
Mahuad of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of Peru on Friday, the White 
House announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders are in Washington this week trying to obtain  
international assistance for a 10-year border integration plan to 
bolster a peace settlement reached in October 1998, said White 
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	That settlement, brokered by the United States, Argentina,  
Brazil and Chile, ended one of the longest-running international 
conflicts in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	During their meeting, Clinton will stress his support for the  
settlement and join in launching the border integration plan, 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Clinton will travel to Atlanta to attend a 65th  
birthday celebration for former baseball star Hank Aaron.

<HEADLINE> How Budget Will Impact You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers would pay 55 cents more, or an average  
of $4 a pack, if Congress approves requests in President Clinton's 
budget for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But soldiers looking for a raise, students in cramped classrooms  
and stay-at-home moms and dads would benefit from the president's 
spending blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster youths on the verge of adulthood and legal immigrants  
also fare well in the $1.77 trillion budget proposal the president 
sent to Capitol Hill on Monday. So do children in Head Start and 
Social Security recipients of today and tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	There's money to speed the development of lightning-fast  
supercomputers to help scientists provide earlier tornado warnings 
and design fuel-efficient autos. There's more money for the 
Pentagon and for AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more to hire teachers and put extra police officers  
on the beat in rough neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget, prepared at a time when federal coffers  
are overflowing with surplus money from the booming economy, has 
morsels for almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican Congress, which has rejected many of  
Clinton's ideas in the past, is not likely to look kindly on many 
of his provisions this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans agree that 62 percent of the projected  
budget surpluses -- $4.85 trillion during the next 15 years -- should 
be set aside to save Social Security. But they're at loggerheads 
over what to do with the other 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use the rest of the surplus to make Medicare  
solvent for 20 years and set up new subsidized retirement accounts 
for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposes to increase spending for scores of domestic  
programs and give the Pentagon $261 billion in new spending, 
including a 4.4 percent pay raise for military members in 2000, 
followed by five annual increases of 3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, on the other hand, want to use the rest of the  
money, after Social Security, for a 10 percent across-the-board tax 
cut. Clinton's budget is a spending smorgasbord, said Sen. Phil 
Gramm, R-Texas. ``If you live in this galaxy ... he has got a 
program for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton counters: If money is not spent on thorny domestic  
problems during prosperous times, then when? 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other tidbits the president seeks:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $250 tax credit for stay-at-home parents caring for a child  
under age 1 -- up to $500 for two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit to help patients, families and caregivers  
cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money to send another 42,000 children to Head Start, and money  
to let foster care children keep their public health insurance when 
they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another $22 billion in school construction and modernization  
bonds to ease overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Triple the money for after-school programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--Money to recruit and prepare thousands more teachers.  
</P>
<P>
	--For the college-bound, a $125 increase in the maximum Pell  
grant to $3,250. Post-college, Clinton would let taxpayers deduct 
interest on their student loans for the life of the loan, not just 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money to restore food stamps for 15,000 legal immigrants who  
are 65 and came to the United States before Aug. 22, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	--Funds to pay for hiring or retaining 30,000 to 50,000 police  
officers to work in pockets of high crime. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger, Clinton proposes $82 billion in  
new or increased taxes, in addition to the 55 cent increase in the 
cigarette tax. The budget would close 16 loopholes in tax laws, and 
propose 79 new or increased taxes, mostly on business. Industry 
spokesmen say some of those increased costs may get passed on to 
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Hostages Freed in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- A British couple and a Dutch family of four  
were released in Yemen today after spending more than two weeks in 
captivity, security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostages, including two boys ages 6 and 7, were in the  
capital San`a and were healthy, the officials said on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In England, a British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed the  
British couple, Eddie and Mary Rosser, were released and added: 
``They are safe, alive and well and in the care of the British 
ambassador and his staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch Ambassador Peter Dorst confirmed that the Dutch family was  
released. He said the family was planning to remain in Yemen and 
return to work as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostages were released following negotiations between the  
kidnappers and Sheik Naji bin Abdel-Aziz al-Shayef, the leader of 
the Bakeel tribe, to which the kidnappers belong. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappers had demanded the release of two fellow tribesmen  
detained in a murder case. It was not clear whether that demand was 
met, but tribal officials said the government paid $50,000 and 
provided the kidnappers with four vehicles to secure the release of 
the hostages, who were abducted on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rossers, both in their 60s, work for the Dutch aid  
organization Worldwide Services. The Dutch hostages, Hans and Berta 
Koolstra, work for the same organization. They were seized with 
their sons, Rense, 7, and Gerrit, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Islamic extremist tribesmen seized 16 Westerners in  
a kidnapping that ended with three Britons and an Australian being 
killed in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, negotiations were still continuing to gain the  
release of two Germans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribesmen had kidnapped three Germans Jan. 26 but released one  
of them Saturday to deliver a message with their demands to 
authorities and return to her abductors. 
</P>
<P>
	She has not returned, and authorities were trying to secure the  
release of her mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the German woman has not been released, but  
officials say she is a 30-year-old midwife. 
</P>
<P>
	She, her mother and brother were abducted by members of the  
al-Shaaby clan of the Bakeel tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government has appealed to the Yemeni government not  
to use any force to free the German hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribal clan is demanding that the Yemeni government arrest  
the alleged assassin of an al-Shaaby chief, security officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappers have threatened unspecified consequences to her  
mother and brother if she does not return. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, tribesmen also released an Irish oil worker after  
holding him hostage for a few hours.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Ford Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The explosion rocked the massive Ford  
Motor Co. River Rouge Complex, then plunged it into darkness. Fire 
shot up into the sky as workers scrambled for safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were dead because of the way the stuff fell on us  
and pushed us to the ground,'' worker Brian Papke said. ``It was 
black and hard to breathe and the debris -- I didn't think we were 
going to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and 22 were injured in the explosion  
Monday in the coal-fired generating station that supplies power to 
the sprawling complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen something like that since my days in Vietnam,''  
said Jerry Sullivan, president of the local chapter of the United 
Auto Workers. ``I saw people that were severely burned, severe 
abrasions all over their bodies. It was a terrible thing to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of these gentlemen were thrown by the blast and  
suffered various head injuries,'' said Dr. Gary Christopher, 
director of emergency services at Oakwood Hospital in Dearborn, 
which gave initial treatment to most of the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	There were so many in such bad condition that they were  
transferred to hospitals as far away as Ann Arbor and Toledo, Ohio. 
Nineteen people remained hospitalized today. The number in critical 
condition rose today to 14 from 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are going to get sicker before they get better,'' Dr.  
Paul Teheri, director of the burn and trauma unit at the University 
of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, said at a news conference today. 
``That's how burns are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion at the No. 3 boiler was not yet  
known, Ford officials said. ``The building shook. We thought it was 
an earthquake,'' said Art Janes, site manager for the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem at the power station could cause a ripple effect  
that could be felt throughout Ford, Janes said. The complex 
assembles Ford Mustangs and makes parts for other plants; its 
stamping plant supplies 16 different assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is our people and working with the union to  
resolve this crisis as soon as possible,'' Janes said at this 
morning's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW said it was pleased with Ford's response.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ford Motor Company has never raised the issue of production  
throughout this crisis,'' union vice president Ron Gettelfinger 
said today. ``We've started discussion about getting the operations 
back. ... But they have dealt with the human side of this story and 
I want to applaud Ford Motor Company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to enter the building this afternoon to  
start looking for a cause. Dearborn Fire Chief Jack McArthur said 
wreckage would complicate the task. ``There's a lot of rubble, a 
lot of falldown,'' he said. ``This is going to be a complex kind of 
scenario to reconstruct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews, using dogs trained to search for bodies, found no  
other victims inside the building this morning, Dearborn Police 
Chief Ronald Deziel said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had not expected to find any additional dead, because  
only one man was unaccounted for and he was likely the 
still-unidentified victim, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The power plant generates enough electricity to serve a city the  
size of Boston, Ford said. The Rouge complex includes six factories 
still in operation -- assembly, engine, tool and die, glass, 
stamping and frame plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility, built in 1918, was once the  
world's largest auto plant. Some of the roof of the 78-year-old red 
brick building, which is listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places, was gone and only metal girders remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Most windows were broken and blackened, and the ground around  
the plant was covered with twisted metal doors, debris and ash. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 employees were in the complex at the time. About  
10,000 people work at the six factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst day of my life,'' said Ford Chairman William  
Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of founder Henry Ford. ``It's awful. 
Everyone who works at Ford is an extended member of the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power plant boiler was last inspected in May, said  
spokeswoman Maura Campbell of the Michigan Department of Consumer 
and Industry Services. State records show the power plant was cited 
for minor safety violations in connection with a January 1996 
explosion from a water-pump turbine, including poor training and 
failure to follow proper safety procedures.

<HEADLINE> Unit To Probe Calif. Prison Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- California's new attorney general plans to  
create a unit to investigate and prosecute alleged criminal 
misconduct by guards who have shot or injured prisoners during 
inmate clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	While signaling a crackdown on misconduct by guards in  
California's violence-plagued prisons, Bill Lockyer also promised 
that the special new unit in the state Justice Department would not 
be on a ``witch hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer, a liberal Democrat, told The Associated Press in an  
interview that the unit also might independently investigate 
alleged guard misconduct of any kind, not only those arising from 
fights between inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal has the backing of the powerful guards' union that  
supported Lockyer's opponent in the Nov. 3 general election, as 
well as the county district attorneys' association and inmate 
rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corrections Department said it doesn't object to the unit's  
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said the unit will handle a ``substantial  
volume of cases'' referred by county district attorneys who tend to 
have limited resources, especially in rural counties that are home 
to many of the state's newest prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever there are allegations of serious misconduct, this  
unit would have the authority to investigate and prosecute,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer said he would ask the Legislature for extra funding for  
the unit as early as this week. The attorney general, who already 
presides over 5,000 employees at the Justice Department, said the 
cost remains undetermined, but the unit's size would be ``pretty 
significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows this attorney general takes unlawful conduct by any  
person to be a serious matter, no matter whether they're members of 
law enforcement,'' said Donald Specter, director of the Prison Law 
Office in San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer's predecessor, conservative Republican Dan Lungren, was  
criticized by prisoner rights advocates for not aggressively 
pursuing allegations of guard misconduct, especially at Corcoran 
State Prison, where federal authorities charged guards in April 
with deliberately staging gladiator-style fights between prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, a state panel reviewing complaints at Corcoran  
concluded that five fatal shootings and 19 other incidents in which 
inmates were injured by guards between 1989 and 1995 were 
unjustified. Lockyer's new unit will now look into those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmate rights advocates claim guards use unnecessary force to  
break up prisoner melees in California, the only state in the 
nation that allows lethal force to break up such fights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corrections Department maintains that lethal force is  
necessary to maintain order in the prisons, which are among the 
nation's most violent. They are overcrowded with more than 160,000 
inmates, partly due to tougher sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the  
powerful state prison guards' union, ``consistently tells me that 
the few bad apples that give them all a bad name should be gotten 
out of the barrel,'' Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	CCPOA spokesman Mike Jimenez said his union doesn't trust  
internal Corrections Department investigations and believes federal 
actions have been tainted by politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for an opportunity to get the entire system  
straightened up as far as investigations,'' Jimenez said. ``We hope 
they have a sense of fair play and are out after the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft in Battle Over Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft must square one of its bedrock  
courtroom defenses with an apparently inconsistent admission by 
some of its own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout its antitrust trial, the company has steadfastly  
denied charges that it illegally bundled its Internet browser into 
newer versions of Windows to trounce a software rival. 
</P>
<P>
	It maintains that it can't be guilty of ``tying'' those products  
because its browser is a component of Windows, not a separate 
software program. 
</P>
<P>
	But in paperwork for an obscure U.S. patent awarded in August  
1998 -- months after the government launched its landmark antitrust 
case -- Microsoft lawyers wrote: ``It should be understood by those 
skilled in the art that a Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator 
or Internet Explorer, ... is separate from the operating system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies, who began questioning  
Microsoft executive Jim Allchin on Monday, said he likely will 
confront Allchin with the document today. He said the government 
learned about the patent application over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies noted that the filing came from the company's patent  
lawyers, who aren't involved in formulating its antitrust defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it shows is that when people are off doing their work,  
not related to this lawsuit, they know they are separate 
products,'' Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Mark Murray said patent lawyers were referring  
to alternate versions of Microsoft's browser designed to run on 
rival operating systems, such as on Macintosh or Unix computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The patent filing, involving online banking, also describes  
software programs asking the operating system to retrieve data from 
a particular Internet address -- a technique Microsoft says is 
consistent with its notion of an Internet-savvy Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who has read the document would understand it supports  
our case,'' Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior vice president and top computer scientist, has  
rejected charges that that Microsoft included its browser within 
Windows to try to ``crush'' rival Netscape Communications Corp., 
whose own browser earned tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (patent filing) certainly doesn't help them because  
they've come up with this fictional argument that the browser and 
the operating system are separate products,'' said Microsoft critic 
Mike Pettit, head of the Washington-based Project to Promote 
Competition and Innovation in the Digital Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that under federal ``tying'' laws,  
Microsoft's design forces consumers who use Windows also to use its 
browser, discouraging them from using Netscape's popular rival 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 90 percent of the world's computers use Windows.  
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Boies, Allchin acknowledged Monday that he  
would ``agree with qualifications'' that Microsoft bundled its 
browser into newer versions of Windows as a response to the 
competitive threat posed by Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that was discussed, but the original intent was to  
unify browsing,'' said Allchin, who wrote a controversial December 
1996 e-mail in which he urged the company, ``We must leverage 
Windows more. We should think first about an integrated solution -- 
that is our strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin also acknowledged that many benefits for consumers from  
Windows 98, with the browser already installed, also are available 
by manually combining Microsoft's browser with older copies of 
Windows 95, which originally didn't include Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what that approach does is, it allows Netscape and others  
to compete,'' Boies said outside court. ``You don't have to tie the 
two together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, Microsoft lawyer John Warden pressed the judge  
unsuccessfully to let him speak with Allchin overnight about his 
testimony. The judge previously prohibited the practice, saying he 
worried about Microsoft ``woodshedding a witness.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen and Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell sharply against the yen Tuesday  
as Japanese interest rates rose and an influential government 
official made encouraging remarks about Japan's recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the euro as U.S. stocks and bonds took a  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 112.05  
Japanese yen, down from 115.08 late Monday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1342, up from $1.1297. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders scooped up yen as yields on the most widely-watched bond  
in Japan, a 10-year Japanese government bond, rose to 2.300 
percent, the highest level since July 1997. Although the yield on 
U.S. Treasury bonds also rose Tuesday, the difference between the 
two rates narrowed, giving investors an incentive to capture yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever interest rates narrow between bonds there and here,  
there's a yen rally,'' said Ralph DelZenero, a foreign exchange 
analyst at First National Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen also drew a boost when Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice  
finance minister for international affairs, said Japan's financial 
sector was set to improve as banks acquire public funds and 
restructure their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, also known as Mr. Yen for his ability to move  
currency markets, also said Japan's recession would hit bottom 
during the summer, while the high-flying U.S. economy was bound for 
a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakakibara's remarks definitely accelerated the fall in the  
dollar-yen,'' said Ryuichi Takami, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4125 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4215, and 1.5143 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5085. The British 
pound fell to $1.6393 from $1.6415. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7244 German 
marks, down from 1.7313; 5.7837 French francs, down from 5.8072; 
and 1,706.48 Italian lire, down from 1,715.27.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 57 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in late morning, as a sharp  
sell-off in technology shares continued and blue chips were spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 57.16 at 9,288.54 , extending Monday's 13-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as technology stocks , with  
the Nasdaq composite down 24.93 at 2,485.16, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 composite off 7.59 at 1,265.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost ground Monday after news of strong growth in the  
economy raised concerns about inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, investors got another piece of bullish economic  
news as the Conference Board, a private research group, reported 
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 percent to 
106.5 in December from a revised level of 106.2 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, which signals above-average growth in the months to  
come, was stronger than economists had expected and gave fuel to 
investors worried that the Federal Reserve might try to cool the 
strong economy and rocket-high stock prices by raising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors today are also concerned that the market's leadership  
higher has been narrowly confined to technology shares, and that 
the broader market isn't that strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody had piled into tech stocks,'' said William Meehan,  
market strategist at Cantor Fizgerald, ``and there's a question how 
far they can go and how long can the market be supported by one 
sector. If tech goes, you have a leadership vacuum in our midst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, declining issues outnumbered advancers by almost 2  
to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 242.28, 
million shares, up slightly from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks were big losers, with America Online  
down 2 3/4 at 168 7/16 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange, 
and Dell off 2 9/16 at 107 7/16 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by another computer stock,  
Hewlett-Packard, which was down 3 1/16 at 78 7/8. But drug stocks, 
often viewed as a defensive play ahead of a downturn in the 
economy, were higher, with Merck up 2 13/16 at 149 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average lost .80 percent, and  
European stock markets were lower as well. In afternoon trading, 
Germany's DAX index was down 0.46 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 0.31 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.58 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices sank today amid fears that a sharp  
rise in interest rates would hurt corporate earnings. The dollar 
dropped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 115.35 points,  
or 1.00 percent, to close at 14,649.83. On Monday, the average 
closed down 34.07 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.18 yen in late trading, down 2.30 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and lower than its late New York level of 
115.08 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, fears of soaring Japanese interest rates  
and a weakening of the dollar pushed Tokyo stock prices lower in 
thin trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates are seen as bearish for the stock market  
because they can damage corporate profits by raising the cost of 
borrowing money, A stronger yen can lower earnings from exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, however, gave no indication that it would  
intervene to slow the rise in rates, with Japanese Finance Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa saying today he would let market forces decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If moves are abnormal, we will be cautious, but if not, we  
will leave it up to the market,'' Miyazawa said at a regular news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the most widely watched bond in Japan, the No. 203  
10-year Japanese government bond, fell to 96.14 yen from 98.15 yen, 
driving the yield which moves in the opposite direction of the 
price to 2.300 percent from 2.035 percent, its highest level since 
July, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the fall in bond prices to concern over the  
government's planned massive bond issue in the next fiscal year 
starting April. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 324 million shares changed hands on the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange today, compared to 310 million shares the previous day. 
Declines outnumbered advances 679 to 459, while 162 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 5.64 points, or 0.50 percent to 1,113.73. The 
TOPIX closed down 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, remarks by Finance Ministry vice minister  
Eisuke Sakakibara sparked a round of dollar selling, pushing the 
greenback as low as 112.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be able to say in the next week or two that  
Japan's financial crisis, at least, is over,'' Sakakibara said at a 
symposium on international monetary affairs in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara also said that falling steel exports to the United  
States does not signal the end of trade friction between the two 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said this comment was yen supportive, as U.S. companies  
are expected to push for a weaker dollar to make their products 
more price competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In euro trading, the new currency was quoted at 128.22 yen, down  
from 131.14 yen late Monday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Soccer Coach Fired for Quote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Under mounting criticism following an alleged  
remark about disabled people, Glenn Hoddle was fired as England's 
soccer coach Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Football Association dismissed him three days after The  
Times of London quoted Hoddle as saying the disabled were ``paying 
for the sins of an earlier life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept that I made a serious error of judgment in an  
interview which has caused misunderstanding and pain to a number of 
people,'' Hoddle said. ``This was never my intention and for this I 
apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle is threatening to sue The Times. He has denied making the  
remarks and maintained what he told the paper had been 
``misconstrued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair had said Hoddle was ``very wrong'' to  
have made the reported remarks, and Sports Minister Tony Banks 
called Hoddle's position ``untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old coach succeeded Terry Venables as England's  
coach in July 1996, agreeing to a four-year contract. He is the 
first England coach fired since Alf Ramsey in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, England made it  
to last summer's tournament in France but lost to Argentina on 
penalty kicks in the second round. Under Hoddle, England went 
17-7-4 and was struggling in qualifying for next year's European 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference announcing his departure turned bizarre when  
a fan shouting ``we want Hoddle back'' was wrestled to the floor as 
FA acting chief executive David Davies read a statement. The fan 
was removed while Davies stopped the news conference. Davies 
returned, read the statement again and declined to take any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle had met with FA officials to try and save his job, and  
his 13-year-old daughter, Zara, sent a letter to the BBC with a 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this situation is the most pathetic reason for someone  
to maybe lose their job and to have so much hassle over,'' she 
wrote. ``If you would take time to listen to what his explanation 
is then maybe you would understand it a bit more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies said it ``became apparent to all those concerned that  
this was the right decision for English football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The past few days have been painful for everyone involved,''  
Davies added. ``But that is as nothing compared to any offense that 
may have been caused to disabled people in our community and in our 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept this wasn't Glenn's intention. It is unquestionable,  
though, that the controversy over whatever was or wasn't said has 
damaged both Glenn and his employer.''

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Eyed at National Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- State and local governments are on the  
front lines of the nation's defense against terrorism, U.S. 
Attorney General Janet Reno told participants at the start of a 
national terrorism policy summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is the lead federal agency for anti-terrorism efforts,  
but ``that doesn't mean I'm going to tell you what to do,'' Reno 
told 200 representatives from 48 states and territories as well as 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities can't just swoop into a region after a  
crisis and take over, she said Tuesday. To prevent turf wars and 
make sure emergency management efforts run smoothly, officials at 
all levels must share information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Key to it all is listening to you who are on the front  
lines,'' Reno said. ``I want to hear from you on how we can make 
this better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Governors' Association Center for Best Practices  
and the National Emergency Management Association are sponsoring 
the two-day summit, a forum for states to give input to the 
development of a national terrorism strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno noted that the National Domestic Preparedness Office was  
created within the FBI in October to help coordinate such a 
national strategy and provide the states information on training, 
equipment and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a summit co-host, said existing  
police and emergency management systems work well, but ``we simply 
need to build on what we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, governors should explore ways to share classified  
information with federal authorities, perhaps by giving select 
officials in each state proper security clearance, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, the information has got to flow, or we're ... groping  
in the dark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore also called for stronger laws governing the possession  
of biological and chemical agents, and said sensitive information 
about U.S. gas and chemical facilities should not be as readily 
accessible on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., another co-host, said  
states need to educate people that terrorism doesn't just happen in 
other countries but threatens ``all of us, from outside and in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the only remaining superpower, the United States is  
vulnerable to terrorism by rogue states, extremist groups and 
criminal cartels, said Richard Clarke, national coordinator for 
security, infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism with the 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrorists can strike with truck bombs or deadly chemicals, or  
they could use computers to shut off or damage the nation's 
electricity networks, banking systems and even 911 operations, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last decade, quietly, we have made this country  
entirely dependent on computers,'' he said. ``Those networks were 
never designed with the threat of terrorism or warfare in mind.''

<HEADLINE> Devils' Dean Out for Wed. Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Defenseman Kevin Dean will miss the  
New Jersey Devils' game with Carolina on Wednesday night because of 
an irregular heartbeat, coach Robbie Ftorek said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean, 29, will probably also miss a game on Thursday at St.  
Louis, the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean was hospitalized on Monday night after developing the  
irregular heartbeat during the Devils' 2-2 tie with the Detroit Red 
Wings at the Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year veteran had a series of tests performed on Tuesday  
at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, team spokesman Mike 
Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, Wis., native was supposed to be released by the  
hospital on Tuesday, but Levine could not confirm that happened 
late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean has played 38 games for New Jersey, recording six assists.  
</P>
<P>
	Devils coach Robbie Ftorek said Dean looked good when he visited  
him at the hospital after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' Ftorek said Tuesday after practice. ``Deano  
is in good hands, they'll take care of him.'

<HEADLINE> Angels' Pitcher Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels right-hander Jack McDowell  
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching shoulder Tuesday to 
repair damage to his rotator cuff and labrum. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell, who re-signed with the Angels in December for  
$500,000, will begin rehabilitation in 7-to-10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell, 33, was 5-3 with a 5.09 ERA in 14 starts last season.  
He had two stints on the 15-day disabled list, once for an inflamed 
right elbow and another for a stress reaction in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell was hampered by right elbow problems while pitching for  
Cleveland in 1997, and underwent arthroscopic surgery to alleviate 
pinching of soft tissue. During his comeback, he sustained an elbow 
bruise that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell, who won the AL Cy Young Award while pitching for the  
Chicago White Sox in 1993 when he went 22-10 with a 3.37 ERA, 
signed with the Angels last February.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Axed As England Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Glenn Hoddle was fired as England's soccer coach  
today after reportedly saying the disabled were ``paying for the 
sins of an earlier life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle's three-year stay ended amid public condemnation  
regarding his remarks about reincarnation attributed to him by the 
Times of London on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While organizations for the disabled were the first to call for  
him to go, Prime Minister Tony Blair joined other lawmakers and 
media in assailing the comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle was dismissed after meeting with the Football  
Association, the governing body of English soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle, who is threatening to sue the Times, has denied making  
the remarks and insists he was misinterpreted in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Blair called the comments ``very wrong,'' and Sports  
Minister Tony Banks said Hoddle's position was ``untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As pressure mounted on Hoddle to quit, he said Monday he saw no  
reason to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to resign over this because at the end of the  
day I didn't say those things,'' Hoddle said in a TV interview. 
``It couldn't be further from the truth from what I believe about 
the handicapped and the disabled. The work that I've done with them 
over 25-26 years is there for everyone to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hoddle insists his comment was taken out of context, he  
has yet to precisely spell out what he said about the disabled 
during the disputed interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything I am dreadfully sorry and very sorry that  
this has caused sadness to other people,'' he said. ``But at the 
end of the day I made the mistake and I want to put the record 
straight and say that these people are not being punished for their 
sins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flap comes 10 days before England plays World Cup champion  
France in an exhibition game at Wembley Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible coaching successors are former national coach  
Terry Venables and the FA coaching director Howard Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle had been criticized even before this dispute. His player  
personnel decisions were questioned in the media and he has been 
blamed for England's poor showing during qualifying for the 2000 
European Championship. England is in third place in its group 
behind Poland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle's strong Christian beliefs prompted ridicule in some  
newspapers. He was mocked for enlisting a faith healer before the 
World Cup to help players recover from injuries.

<HEADLINE> New-Home Sales Slide in Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In another sign of strength for the U.S.  
economy, new home sales easily set a record in 1998 despite a small 
slip in December, and a widely-watched indicator showed promise for 
continued economic growth through the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of 978,000 in December, down 3.6 percent from a record 1.02 
million rate in November, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But, for the entire year, they bought 888,000 new homes, up 10.4  
percent from 1997. That beat the previous record, 819,000 in 1977, 
and was the highest since the department began tracking sales in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing-home sales, tracked by the National Association of  
Realtors, also set a record in 1998 -- 4.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest housing data is another sign that the economy  
exited 1998 going full bore,'' said economist Karen Dexter of 
Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing -- and related purchases such as furniture and appliances  
-- have helped the American economy weather spillover from the 
global economic slump that has spread from Asia to Russia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have been supported by low mortgage rates -- averaging  
under 7 percent during the last half of 1998, the longest such 
stretch since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, jobs were plentiful and the nation's unemployment rate  
averaged 4.5 percent last year, a 29-year low. The stock market 
spurred some sales, especially of vacation homes. With inflation 
low, wage gains gave many Americans increased purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Conference Board, a private research group,  
reported in New York that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators 
rose 0.3 percent in December after a 0.5 percent increase in 
November, signaling above-average economic growth in the months to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion shows no sign of ending,'' said Michael Boldin,  
senior economist with the conference board. ``Now almost eight 
years in length, it is the second longest on record and we expect 
it to become the longest ever in early 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By region in 1998, new home sales jumped 5.1 percent to 82,000  
in the Northeast, 18.6 percent to 166,000 in the Midwest, and 9.4 
percent in both the South -- to 397,000 -- and the West -- to 244,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of a new home last year -- meaning half sold for  
more and half for less -- was $151,600, up 3.8 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Michael Carliner of the National Association of Home  
Builders said low financing costs for builders plus a decline in 
lumber prices, reflecting slack demand in Asia, helped keep new 
home prices from rising more steeply in response to strong demand.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Hopefuls Spent $119.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Candidates for governor spent a record  
$119.9 million in the 1998 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending spree -- over a two-year period -- set records in  
both the primary and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised more money than God,'' Gary South, Gov. Gray Davis'  
campaign manager, joked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his Republican opponent, Dan Lungren, spent $47.9  
million from July 1, 1998, through the end of the year, according 
to state finance reports they're filing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a nearly 51 percent increase over the previous record,  
set in 1994 by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democrat Kathleen 
Brown at $31.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates in last June's primary shelled out a combined $72  
million in an 18-month period beginning Jan. 1, 1997, the records 
showed. They were led by Al Checchi and Jane Harman, two wealthy 
but unsuccessful Democratic contenders who dipped deep into their 
own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Checchi and Harman spent a combined $55.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The previous primary record was $28.8 million, set by Wilson,  
Brown and several other candidates.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Will Be Off Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is forecasting decades of  
federal budget surpluses, $4.854 trillion worth by 2014 -- precise 
predictions that come with only one certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be off the mark.  
</P>
<P>
	By how much, and whether the projections are too high or too  
low, depends on the economy, the decisions of at least two future 
presidents, and what happens during the next seven Congresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's 15-year plan forecasts surpluses far exceeding those  
projected by the administration and Congress 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The predictions are that for the next quarter century,  
whatever the ups and downs of the business cycle, the general trend 
is going to be for surpluses every year for the next 25 years,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no disagreement on the upward trend; the director of the  
Congressional Budget Office said that only a cataclysmic recession 
would undo surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	But translating trends into numbers stretching 10 and 15 years  
ahead is educated speculation. The specialists say so. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way for anyone projecting the economy to be able  
to say their projections will come true, because chances are they 
won't,'' said June O'Neill, completing her term as director of the 
CBO. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said it is impossible to  
``confidently project large surpluses'' over the next 15 years, 
given the uncertainties of budget forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that two years ago, the Office of Management and Budget  
projected a $121 billion deficit in the 1998 budget, which turned 
out to be ``a $191 billion error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office said that its five-year  
projections were off by an average of 13 percent annually. At that 
rate, the CBO could be $250 billion off in 2004, which exceeds the 
$234 billion surplus it forecasts for that budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Estimates for more than five years into the future are even  
more uncertain,'' the CBO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The projections have been missing on the down side, first by  
forecasting deficits, then by minimizing surpluses. The 
administration forecasts a $79 billion surplus when the current 
budget year ends on Oct. 1; that is $25 billion more than expected 
a year ago. The CBO projects a $107 billion surplus this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional projection is that surpluses will add up to  
nearly $2.6 trillion over the next decade. Clinton's budget 
projects the total at about $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our estimates, optimistic as they sound, are more conservative  
than those of Congress,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	And longer, by five years, to reach the $4.854 trillion  
Clinton's budget calls the total reserve by 2014. He wants 62 
percent of it, $2.764 trillion, used for Social Security funding, 
15 percent for Medicaid needs, 12 percent for a new system of 
government-aided retirement savings accounts, and 11 percent for 
``military readiness and other critical national needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be all of it, colliding with Republican plans for tax  
cuts of up to $800 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of proposals to get rid of the surplus almost  
rivals Mark McGwire's home run record,'' Greenspan said. Not 
really; that was 70. But it made his point about competing claims 
for the money. He told the Senate Budget Committee caution should 
rule, given the uncertainty of long-range forecasts and the 
difficulty of undoing tax and spending commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not as easy to reduce outlays as it is to increase them,  
and the reverse is obviously the case in taxes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be as true of the new retirement accounts Clinton  
seeks as of the tax cuts Republicans want. 
</P>
<P>
	It's happened before. Ronald Reagan's 1981 income tax cuts  
didn't produce the economic surge and increased revenues his 
administration expected, and deficits increased. A post-Cold War 
peace dividend was supposed to ease budget pressures a decade ago, 
but didn't, in part because of economic downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	As for long-range forecasting, the last major overhaul of Social  
Security, in 1983, was supposed to keep the system solvent until 
2057, but came up 25 years short. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Republican leaders agree that gap should be closed  
using the surplus, although they are at odds how to use the funds. 
</P>

	Prosecutors Finish Deposing Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vernon Jordan was questioned for nearly three  
hours today by House prosecutors in a deposition for President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., was the 
main questioner for the House prosecutors, and lawyers David 
Kendall, Nicole Seligman and Cheryl Mills were there for the 
president. Prosecutors were to focus their questions on some of the 
discrepancies that emerged between Monica Lewinsky's grand jury 
testimony and Jordan's. Meanwhile, senators viewed Monica 
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony from yesterday. A few Republicans 
said they saw little reason to summon her before the Senate. 

</P>
<P>
	Anti-Abortion Web Site Loses Case  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal jury ruled today that a Web site  
and ``wanted'' posters listing abortion doctors' names and 
addresses amounted to threats. At issue was the ``The Nuremberg 
Files'' Web site, which lists hundreds of ``baby butchers'' and 
invites readers to send in such personal details as their home 
addresses, license plate numbers and even the names of their 
children. The verdict could redefine what is considered 
constitutionally protected political speech because the 
anti-abortion materials contained no explicit threats of violence, 
only veiled messages. 

</P>
<P>
	Gephardt Won't Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, seen as a  
formidable opponent for Vice President Al Gore for the 2000 
Democratic presidential nomination, will announce tomorrow that he 
won't run for president, the Associated Press has learned. Gephardt 
has decided to concentrate instead on helping the party gain 
control of the House in 2000, allies to the Missouri lawmaker said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Presents Plan To Fix Schools  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton today backed his call to fix or  
close failing schools with a $200 million proposal to support 
intervention in troubled classrooms. The plan is part of the 
education package included in the president's fiscal 2000 budget 
designed to boost education standards, hire more teachers and 
improve their skills and increase schools' accountability. 
Republicans questioned whether his new budget does enough to 
directly support teaching and whether it allows local school 
officials enough flexibility.

	Kosovo Rebels To Attend Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rebel spokesman announced  
today that the ethnic Albanian rebels will attend peace talks in 
France this week aimed at ending the bloody 11-month conflict. At 
the talks, the KLA representatives will demand that Kosovo, 
presently a part of Serbia, become an international protectorate 
for a three-year period while negotiators work out a final status 
for the region. The hard-line Yugoslav government still has not 
confirmed whether it will send delegates to the talks. The Serb 
parliament is to decide on Thursday. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Court Bans Death Sentences  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's highest court today banned all courts in  
the country from handing down death sentences until the jury system 
is adopted throughout Russia. The ruling means an effective 
abolition of the death penalty, a Constitutional Court spokeswoman 
said. Introducing the jury system will take years, and Russia is 
likely to deliver on its promise of banning the death penalty 
before then, she said.

	Jordan King Gets Bone Marrow  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein is in ``stable condition''  
following a bone marrow transplant today at the Mayo Clinic in 
Minnesota, Jordan's ambassador to Washington said. The envoy said

observation'' for the next two weeks. Hussein was rushed to the 
Mayo Clinic last week after his doctors said they found evidence

had recurred. Hussein has appointed his eldest son, Abdullah, as 
his heir.

	Walter Payton Needs Liver Transplant  
</P>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- NFL great Walter Payton has a rare liver  
disease and needs a transplant, his doctor said today. The 
44-year-old former Chicago Bears star is being placed on a list to 
receive a liver transplant, said Dr. Joseph Lagattuta. The cause of 
the disease -- primary sclerosing cholangitis -- is not known. 
However, it is not related to alcohol, steroids, hepatitis or any 
kind of immunodeficiency disease, Lagattuta said. Payton is the 
NFL's all-time leading rusher, with 16,726 yards.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Racial Divide in AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers reported Tuesday that blacks donating  
blood for the first time are 25 times more likely than whites to 
have recently acquired HIV infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is the latest to document the growing racial divide in  
AIDS, which is evolving from being largely an illness of white 
homosexuals to one of poor blacks who catch it through drug abuse 
and heterosexual encounters. Nationally, more than half of all HIV 
infections are among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The research examined blood donors, who are among the least  
likely of all people to be infected. Those who do risky things, 
such as inject drugs, are discouraged from giving. And since most 
donors do so repeatedly, they have already passed earlier screening 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, scientists developed a method of testing blood that  
reveals whether the infection is new or long-standing. They used it 
to look for fresh infections among people across the country who 
were giving blood for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael P. Busch and others from the Blood Centers of the  
Pacific in San Francisco used the new method to analyze the samples 
of 1.7 million first-time donors. Of the total, 427 were 
HIV-infected. The new test revealed that 58 of them had been 
infected within the previous few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch said new infections were about three times more common  
among first-time donors than among those who give repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis showed that about 2 of every 100,000 white donors  
annually are newly infected, compared with 51 per 100,000 among 
blacks and less than four among Hispanics and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martha Rogers of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention said the latest data reflect ``the well-recognized shift 
in the epidemic to people of color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other findings of the study:  
</P>
<P>
	--The number of new infections among first-time donors remained  
steady between 1993 and 1996, the years sampled. 
</P>
<P>
	--Men were twice as likely as women to be infected.  
</P>
<P>
	--Infections among new donors were highest in the South, where  
there were 25 infections per 100,000, and lowest in the central and 
western parts of the country, where there were less than 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The data were presented Tuesday at the 6th Conference on  
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reports at the meeting, researchers from the Federal  
University of Rio de Janiero, Brazil, showed that about 15 percent 
of men on powerful AIDS medicines still have measurable amounts of 
the virus in their semen. Doctors have hoped that the drugs would 
reduce virus levels so low that infected people will be less likely 
to spread HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	A French team, headed by Dr. Stephane Blance of INSERM, also  
reported the deaths of two babies born to mothers who had taken the 
drugs AZT and 3TC to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus during 
pregnancy. The two were among 197 children born to infected mothers 
in the French study. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies died of a condition caused by genetic damage to the  
mitochondrial DNA. However, the doctors have no evidence that the 
AIDS drugs caused the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the meeting, a United Nations team found that a  
one-week regimen of the two drugs were effective in preventing AIDS 
transmission in Africa. CDC officials said they had heard of no 
cases of this complication in the United States but would look into 
it.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Names Central Bank President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Seeking to calm jittery financial  
markets, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso nominated an 
investment strategist Tuesday to run the nation's Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise move, Cardoso removed Francisco Lopes after just  
three weeks and backed Arminio Fraga, a former associate of 
billionaire investor and currency speculator George Soros, to lead 
the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes had allowed the national currency, the real, to float  
freely on international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of Fraga, who has a doctorate in economics from  
Princeton University, must be approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The real, which had tumbled sharply on Friday, strengthened  
against the dollar for the second consecutive day Tuesday. It 
closed at 1.74 to the dollar, compared with 1.95 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, though, skidded, with the Bovespa index on Sao  
Paulo's stock market, the largest in Latin America, closing down 
1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been struggling to halt the financial crisis  
that has gripped Brazil and threatens to buffet the economies of 
other countries in Latin America. Stanley Fischer, a senior 
official of the International Monetary Fund, was visiting Brazil to 
review the country's economic plight. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing Fraga's appointment, the Finance Ministry  
emphasized there would be no change in its policy to float the 
real, which has depreciated 32 percent against the dollar since the 
policy was implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	Many financial analysts welcomed the choice of Fraga.  
</P>
<P>
	``With the free-floating exchange rate, maintaining stability is  
in the hands of the Central Bank for the short-term. With the 
arrival of Fraga that road just got shorter,'' said Mauro 
Schneider, an economist with ING Barings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Luciano Dias, a Brasilia-based political analyst, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike Lopes, who was too much of a theorist and did not have  
the managerial capacity to stop speculators, Fraga is a veteran 
market insider who knows both sides of the coin,'' Dias added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment, he said, ``was necessary for Brazil to  
regain its credibility and the confidence of the international 
financial community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition politicians, however, criticized Fraga's proximity to  
Soros. Currency speculators like the American billionaire have been 
blamed by some in the developing world for causing the global 
financial crisis that started in Asia in 1997 and has since spread 
to Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has just handed over the Central Bank to one of the  
biggest speculators in the world,'' leftist-Workers' Party 
president Jose Dirceu told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry took pains to stress that Fraga, who worked  
as a managing director for the New York-based Soros Fund 
Management, is no longer associated with Soros, a sharp critic in 
recent days of Brazil's decision to maintain high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Fraga is confirmed by the legislature, Demosthenes  
Madureira de Pinho of the Central Bank will serve as interim 
president. Pending confirmation, Fraga will serve as a special 
adviser to Finance Minister Pedro Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy, has been in  
talks with the IMF over the release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of investors.

<HEADLINE> Torture Slaying Trial Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A serial killer defendant has admitted  
to abusing a sex slave but denied charges he killed her or 11 other 
people in gruesome sex tortures and slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ng, a 38-year-old Hong Kong native, is charged with  
killing two infants, three women and seven men in 1984 and 1985. 
The case could go to the jury this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying for a third day on Monday, against the advice of his  
lawyers, Ng opened the door for new prosecution evidence, including 
his jailhouse cartoons showing babies being killed and a woman 
being strangled during sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng stammered at times as prosecutor Sharlene Honnaka questioned  
him about the cartoons and about videotapes of captive women. The 
tapes show Ng and friend Leonard Lake taunting their prisoners at 
Lake's home in Wilseyville, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	Honnaka asked Ng what he meant by telling the shackled and  
pregnant Brenda O'Connor: ``You can cry and stuff like the rest of 
them, but it won't do you no good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you mean by 'the rest of them?''' Honnaka asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no 'rest of them,''' Ng said. ``I just try to project  
that seriousness... so she wouldn't resist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng said he felt ``pretty disturbed'' about how he treated  
O'Connor. After doing Lake's bidding for about a year, he decided 
to keep his distance, Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is one of California's longest and costliest murder  
prosecutions. Ng was extradited from Canada after a six-year fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake committed suicide by taking cyanide in police custody in  
South San Francisco in 1985 after a shoplifting incident. Ng has 
blamed the killings on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake left behind diaries outlining plans to kidnap and torture  
women, as well as a cell where sex slaves were kept. Human remains, 
some of them burned, were found buried near the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Honnaka introduced four brutal cartoons, which Ng admitted  
drawing in collaboration with informant Maurice Laberge. Ng had 
earlier denied discussing infant murders with Laberge, who died in 
a car accident last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng told the jury that Laberge goaded him into making the  
cartoon. He called them satires with ``no basis in reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of nine women and three men wouldn't have seen the  
cartoons had Ng not insisted on taking the stand last week. His 
attorneys were about to present closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ng and Lake imprisoned, raped and tortured the  
women while using the men's identities to take money from banks and 
credit accounts.

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors Question Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are questioning Vernon  
Jordan on the conflicts between his testimony and Monica Lewinsky's 
in a final effort to bolster the perjury and obstruction case 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As senators for the first time today got access privately to Ms.  
Lewinsky's videotaped deposition, prosecutors were focusing their 
questions on some of the discrepancies that emerged after Jordan 
testified to a grand jury for a fifth and final time on June 9, 
according to a knowledgeable source who spoke Monday only on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time Jordan, a Washington attorney and  
longtime Clinton friend, has testified since August, when Ms. 
Lewinsky began cooperating with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky gave the grand jury specific  
details that linked Jordan to conversations about gifts she 
received from Clinton, destroyed notes to the president and a false 
affidavit in which she denied an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, in the first time she was exposed to possible  
questioning by Clinton's lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky gave testimony that 
closely tracked her earlier grand jury account, according to 
sources familiar with the testimony who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The sources were not associated with the House 
prosecution team and worked outside the White House. Ms. Lewinsky's 
lawyers declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in testimony are important because Jordan  
arranged a job for the former White House intern at the same time 
she was preparing the affidavit in December 1997. The two actions 
are joined in the impeachment article accusing Clinton of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of the discrepancies:  
</P>
<P>
	--According to grand jury testimony released by Congress, Ms.  
Lewinsky said she showed Jordan some gifts she'd received from the 
president; Jordan didn't recall being shown any. 
</P>
<P>
	--She said she thought Jordan was instructing her to destroy  
drafts of notes she'd written to the president. He denied ever 
telling her to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	--He said he had no reason to doubt her denial of having had a  
sexual relationship with Clinton. While she didn't directly 
contradict Jordan's account, she did say she told him she had had 
sexually explicit phone conversations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jordan said he remembered skimming the affidavit  
she filed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton, but not discussing it with Ms. Lewinsky. And through his 
lawyer, Jordan said he did not recall any reference to sexually 
explicit phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton's friend she was concerned  
about some of the language in her affidavit because it could cause 
the Jones lawyers to ask her if she'd ever been alone with the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's recollection is filled with other specific  
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the sexually explicit phone calls, she said the topic  
arose after she told Jordan she was worried someone might have 
eavesdropped on her conversations with Clinton, and Jordan asked 
her why. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same conversation, the former White House intern said,  
she showed Jordan some gifts Clinton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors questioned Jordan, he said he'd never had  
breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. She said otherwise, describing details 
of what she and Jordan ate -- testimony corroborated by a restaurant 
receipt signed by Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's deposition is the second of three such sessions, as the  
Senate edges closer to the end of Clinton's impeachment trial. The 
trial is to resume Thursday, and unless the depositions yield new 
information, the Senate will proceed to closing arguments and final 
deliberations that could meet the lawmakers' target for ending the 
trial by Feb. 12, or sooner. Videotapes of the three depositions 
could be made public if a majority of senators vote to do so, or 
the witnesses could be called to testify live. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of nullifying her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky  
offered no new information to House prosecutors during four hours 
of questioning by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., according to the sources 
familiar with her testimony on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing up an opportunity to question her, White House lawyers  
instead offered an apology on Clinton's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Private presidential attorney Nicole Seligman read a statement  
that apologized to Ms. Lewinsky ``on behalf of the president for 
all the trouble the investigation and impeachment trial had caused 
her,'' one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	One source said Ms. Lewinsky reaffirmed that:  
</P>
<P>
	--When she asked Clinton what to do about subpoenaed gifts from  
him on Dec. 28, 1997, his response was something like ``let me 
think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers had argued to the Senate that on other  
occasions, Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton had no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	--In a middle-of-the-night conversation on Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton  
told her she was on the witness list in the Jones lawsuit, 
suggested she could file an affidavit and mentioned their 
previously arranged cover stories to explain why she was coming to 
see the president. On Jan. 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky signed an 
affidavit denying an affair.

<HEADLINE> Tenor Heppner a Hit at Carnegie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carnegie Hall was offered to tenor Ben Heppner  
last season, when he made his first recital tour. He chose to wait 
until this season's tour, which he ended, with a triumph, at 
Carnegie. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Heppner, the Canadian tenor who is gaining  
fame as a heldentenor -- a tenor who sings the big, heroic Wagner 
roles -- definitely was ready for Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	He sang German lieder in the first half of the program, well  
chosen for variety, then six songs by Rachmaninoff plus four 
American ``parlor songs'' popular in the early 20th century. The 
enthusiastic audience called him back for five encores. Two were 
arias. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Heppner sang with warmth, floated pianissimos and shaped  
gleaming lyric phrases with thoughtful care, he really sounded best 
in the last half hour, when he unleashed his opera voice. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seem to be holding back before but simply singing in a  
way that wouldn't overpower the songs. He hit all the highest notes 
with ease, his voice not thinning out on the high notes but 
remaining rich and shining. But he sang his second encore, 
Walther's ``Prize Song'' from ``Die Meistersinger,'' with all the 
thrilling power which had been latent earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After he sang it, Heppner remarked, ``Now I've warmed up.'' He  
added, ``You normally have to wait 5 1/2 hours to hear that one,'' 
referring to the fact that the ``Prize Song'' comes at the end of 
Wagner's long opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Heppner was obviously at ease on the stage. He exuded a  
humorous, likable personality, speaking for the first time to 
introduce the sentimental parlor songs. Indicating his excellent, 
sensitive pianist Craig Rutenberg, Heppner said, ``We refer to the 
next section as `the Schmaltz Brothers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Beethoven, Liszt, Strauss and Rachmaninoff songs, Heppner  
successfully communicated the emotional states of the words by 
varying the volume and coloring of his tones. He conveyed anguish 
to elegance, romance to resolve, homesickness to nature 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	The song recital is in decline. If people with beautiful voices  
like Heppner sing them, song recitals will come back.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Boots Central Bank President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The Finance Ministry today replaced  
Francisco Lopes as president of Brazil's Central Bank, less than 
one month after being nominated to the post and devaluing the 
country's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Lopes will be replaced by Arminio Fraga, a former aide  
to billionaire financier George Soros. Fraga, who has a doctorate 
from Princeton University, was called ``one of Brazil's best 
economists'' in a news conference today by Finance Minister Pedro 
Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry said the government decided to overhaul the  
Central Bank to strengthen the institution following the recent 
shift in Brazil's foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Central Bank formally adopted a policy allowing  
the local currency, the real, to float freely against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since restrictions were lifted on Brazil's foreign exchange  
trading, the real has depreciated 32 percent against the dollar. 
The real weakened further today on news of the change at the 
Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The real had opened stronger this morning and had risen to 1.75  
to the dollar from the 1.91 at Monday's close. It dropped as far as 
1.84 after the announcement, then stabilized at around 1.80 to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened up  
1.5 percent but then dropped 3.43 percent by midday with traders 
using the announcement as an excuse to take profits after Tuesday 
8.8 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said the foreign exchange market is relatively  
calm, awaiting further details of the changes, as well as 
developments on the talks between the International Monetary Fund 
and the government's economic team, led by Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reorganization of the central bank board of directors  
represents no change in the free-float forex policy, nor in the 
general direction of the government's economic policy, which will 
be maintained with determination,'' the Finance Ministry said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said that both he and Lopes had offered to step down amid  
the economic turmoil facing the country, but that President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso wouldn't accept the finance minister's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga was a managing director at Soros Fund Management, a  
private New York-based investment management firm, where his main 
responsibility was investing strategies for emerging markets. He 
also has worked for the New York investing firm of Salomon Brothers 
and as chief economist at Banco de Investimentos Garantia in Rio De 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	He teaches at Columbia University's School of International and  
Public Affairs and has taught at other universities in the United 
States and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga also has served as a member of the board and a director of  
international affairs for Brazil's Central Bank, and was involved 
in previous negotiations with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's business community supported Fraga's appointment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a Central Bank president who knows both sides of  
the coin. He knows how to play against the Central Bank and not to 
give in to those who want to make easy money,'' said Mario 
Bernardini, vice-president of Sao Paulo Center of Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment should calm criticism that Central Bank  
doesn't know how to operate on foreign exchange markets, Bernardini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy, has been in  
talks with the IMF over the release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Fraga is confirmed, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho of the  
Central Bank will serve as interim president. Pending confirmation, 
Fraga will serve as a special advisor to Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry statement made it clear that Fraga is no longer  
associated with Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said that Fraga's views don't necessarily correspond with  
those of Soros, who has been a sharp critic in recent days of 
Brazil's decision to maintain high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after being appointed as Central Bank president on  
Jan.13, Lopes effectively devalued Brazil's currency, the real, by 
about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar by widening the range the 
two currencies could trade before the government intervened in 
foreign exchange markets to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later he allowed the real to be traded freely on  
foreign exchange markets. At one point last week, the real sank 
below two to the dollar for the first time since it was established 
in July 1994, representing a drop of more than 40 percent since 
devaluation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offended by Clinton 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans took the offensive Tuesday against  
President Clinton's new $1.77 trillion budget, accusing the White 
House of advancing a dubious plan to save Social Security and 
proposing a tax-cut plan of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Clinton shipped his proposal to Congress, lawmakers  
were still skeptical of Clinton's plan to use most of the $4.85 
trillion in federal surpluses projected for the next 15 years to 
shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in Washington would this kind of creative accounting be  
considered,'' Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., told Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, was less generous. Referring to  
Rubin's previous career as an investment banker, Gramm said that if 
Rubin had used ``accounting like this in private practice, he would 
be in prison now rather than sitting before us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he wants to revamp Social Security this year  
for the impending retirement of the nation's 76 million baby 
boomers. How to buttress the pension system for the elderly and 
disabled is one of Washington's most politically sensitive issues, 
and one that Democrats have wielded effectively against Republicans 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's latest proposal serves a crucial political goal for  
Democrats by linking the surpluses to Social Security and in effect 
daring Republicans to try to pry that money loose for tax cuts, 
which polls show are not as popular. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials argue that reserving trillions in budget  
surpluses for Social Security would extend the date the program 
would deplete its trust fund from 2032 to 2055. Under the plan, the 
government would put special Treasury bills into Social Security's 
trust fund -- in effect promising that the surplus money will be 
used to help Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a long tradition of grilling administration officials  
the day after the budget is released, Republicans summoned Rubin to 
the Finance Committee and White House budget chief Jacob Lew to the 
Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Lew conceded that the Social Security plan was  
``complicated.'' But he said the Treasury bills Social Security 
would receive would be assets that are ``very real'' because they 
would be backed by surpluses -- assuming the surpluses occur as 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those assets are there, and they will be honored,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Lew heard much the same criticism Rubin did.  
Republicans said Clinton was double-counting surpluses that come 
mostly from the Social Security trust funds in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your accounting is beyond my comprehension,'' said budget  
panel Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Disapproval also came from the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan  
budget watchdog group. In a written statement, the coalition called 
the Social Security plan ``three-card monte.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed no changes in Social Security benefits or  
taxes. As a result, his proposal does not change the fact that in 
2013, the program's annual expenditures will begin to exceed its 
annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,  
R-Ohio, introduced a $743 billion, 10-year plan to cut income tax 
rates by 10 percent. Divided a year ago over the wisdom of tax 
cuts, House and Senate Republicans have been rallying behind plans 
to use part of the surplus to cut income-tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families, not Washington, deserve more power and money,'' said  
Kasich, a potential presidential candidate next year.

<HEADLINE> Retired Navy Adm. Shear Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROTON, Conn. (AP) -- Retired Adm. Harold E. Shear, who rose to  
vice chief of naval operations during a 42-year Navy career and 
bolstered the use of submarines as a crucial part of the nation's 
nuclear deterrent, has died at 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheare died Monday at his home. The retired four-star admiral  
had suffered from congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 25 years aboard submarines, from World War II to  
Vietnam, and had a significant influence on the development of the 
ballistic missile submarine force. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, he took part in a war game in which he acted as  
commander of the Soviet Union's submarine fleet. During the 
simulated attack, he virtually eliminated the U.S. Strategic Air 
Command by taking out much of the United States' air bombers and 
land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	His virtual victory helped officials realize that the nation's  
defense had vulnerabilities and that submarines could play an 
important part in warding off an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He was promoted to rear admiral in 1967 and served as director  
of antisubmarine warfare. He became full admiral in 1974, when he 
was named commander in chief of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, he was named vice chief of naval operations,  
a job he held two years, the normal tour of duty. After that, he 
was commander in chief of Allied Forces in Southern Europe until 
his retirement in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In civilian life, Shear was vice president of Norton, Lilly &AMP;  
Co., a steamship line, and in 1981 was selected by President Reagan 
to become head of the U.S. Maritime Administration, where he served 
until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Shear entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1938, a member of the  
class that graduated five months early because of the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Central Banker Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Another official at Malaysia's  
central bank is stepping down, the national news agency reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Governor Abdul Murad Khalid is the third high-ranking  
official at Bank Negara, the central bank, to quit since economic 
and political turmoil hit Malaysia last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Murad, who was responsible for banking regulation and  
banking supervision, is widely viewed as an ally of ousted deputy 
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, who was also finance minister, was removed from office  
Sept. 2 after policy disputes with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
His dismissal spurred massive anti-government protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Murad's resignation will take effect Feb. 1, the national  
news agency Bernama reported. No reasons were given for the 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the central bank's then-governor, Ahmad Mohamed  
Don, and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak, quit the central bank on what 
sources said were policy differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after their resignation, Malaysia imposed selective capital  
controls to tackle the country's economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Said To OK Test Ban Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Neither India nor Pakistan is ready  
to renounce its status as a nuclear power, a senior U.S. envoy said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said Washington  
already has a commitment from Pakistan to sign the global test ban 
treaty, a promise Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif gave President 
Clinton last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said that commitment was good enough for him, but added  
there were many other issues on the negotiating table. He said 
later at the Institute of Strategic Studies that there were no 
agreements as the two sides tried to rebuild their relationship 
following last year's underground nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and rival South Asian power India conducted several  
underground nuclear tests which brought worldwide condemnation and 
economic sanctions that have been mostly suspended for Pakistan. 
Each nation has missiles believed capable of hitting the other's 
major cities with nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said both countries have already made a decision to  
forge ahead with nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan has decided to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic  
missiles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the last  
51 years, their nuclear tests generated world fears of a nuclear 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott, who came to Pakistan on Monday from neighboring India,  
got a commitment from New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty, possibly by mid-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that Talbott will be pushing Pakistan toward a  
similar deadline. A joint statement from the United States and 
Pakistan said officials would meet again in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which has been signed by 151 nations, includes a  
pledge against all testing of nuclear devices and sets up a global 
system of sensors to monitor compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a question about whether he would raise the issue  
of Osama bin Laden, who is wanted by the United States in last 
year's deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, Talbott said 
``that is a regional issue,'' quickly adding, ``and a global 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, a Saudi, is being protected by the Taliban religious  
army in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan is one of only three 
countries to recognize the Taliban's rule.

<HEADLINE> Padres Trade Greg Vaughn to Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego's Greg Vaughn, who set a club record  
with 50 homers last year, was traded to the Cincinnati Reds today 
in a five-player deal that sent oft-injured Reggie Sanders to the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego also sent left-handed pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney to the  
Reds, who also gave up infielder Damian Jackson and minor leaguer 
Josh Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres have been looking to unload Vaughn, who will make  
$5.75 million in the final season of a three-year contract. But 
they take on Sanders' $3.7 million salary, plus his history of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden said the Reds originally  
wanted San Diego GM Kevin Towers to agree to pay more than $1 
million of Vaughn's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when the day was done, their need was to reduce payroll,''  
Bowden said. ``He told me we had the athletes they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati was 12th in the NL with 138 home runs last season and  
traded Bret Boone, its home run leader, to Atlanta after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said that if the Reds compete for a playoff spot and  
ticket sales increase, they could afford Vaughn for an entire 
season. If they don't contend, Bowden said Vaughn could be traded 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade of Vaughn continues a financial makeover of the  
Padres, who claim that they've lost about $50 million since John 
Moores and Larry Lucchino bought the team in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Towers said that money wasn't behind the trade, he  
noted that Vaughn will be a free agent after this season and could 
command a huge contract to stay beyond 1999. Sanders has an option 
for 2000 at $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's most appealing is we're able to control  
Reggie for another year and Vaughn, we didn't know if we could,'' 
Towers said. ``That salary fits in very well to the structure of 
all our other players, so we can stay competitively balanced 
throughout our 25-man roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since being swept by the New York Yankees in the World Series,  
the Padres had a new ballpark approved by the voters, but also lost 
have lost ace Kevin Brown, center fielder Steve Finley, third 
baseman Ken Caminiti and have traded starter Joey Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres had no chance of keeping Brown, who signed a record  
$105 million, seven-year deal with division rival Los Angeles, and 
offered far less than what Finley got from another division foe, 
Arizona. The Padres made only a token offer to Caminiti, who was 
broken down physically by the time the Series ended and rejoined 
the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in a platoon system with Rickey Henderson the  
last two months of 1996 and most of 1997, Vaughn had a remarkable 
comeback in 1998. He became the 27th player in big league history 
to hit 50 homers and had a career-high 119 RBIs, tied for the 
second-most by a Padres player. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was traded the day before he and teammate Trevor Hoffman  
were to be honored as two of the four professional stars of the 
year as chosen by the San Diego Hall of Champions. Yankees 
left-hander David Wells and Denver Broncos running back Terrell 
Davis are the other two honorees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, when the Padres' infamous fire sale was at its height,  
San Diego dealt Gary Sheffield to the Florida Marlins on the same 
day he was named to the San Diego's 25th anniversary team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are getting a player once considered to be a rising  
star in the Reds' system. Sanders, 31, had a breakthrough year in 
1995, hitting .306 with a career-high 28 homers and 99 RBIs as he 
helped the Reds reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit only .138 in the postseason, striking out 19 times in 29  
at-bats as the Reds made it to the league championship series 
before getting swept by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Various injuries, including a bulging disc in his lower back,  
limited him to 81 games in 1996 and 86 in 1997. He appeared in 135 
last season, hitting .268 with 143 homers and 59 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 25, is a middle infielder with a lot of speed and a  
history of erratic hitting. He played in a career-best 13 games for 
the Reds at the end of last season, coming off a third consecutive 
season at Triple-A. He hit .261 for Indianapolis, striking out 125 
times in 517 at-bats, with 25 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, a 21-year-old right-hander, was 10-12 in 27 starts for  
Class A Burlington last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney, 28, gives the Reds' bench more depth. He led the major  
leagues with 22 pinch hits in 1997 and ranks second in the National 
League with 34 pinch hits over the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Airline Suit Resurrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday  
resurrected a lawsuit that accuses Northwest Airlines of 
overcharging ticket buyers since its 1986 acquisition of Republic 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	A district judge wrongly interpreted antitrust law in dismissing  
the lawsuit, a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven consumers filed the lawsuit in 1997. They argued that the  
1986 merger violated antitrust law and led to higher ticket prices 
for passengers at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where 
Northwest accounts for 80 percent of the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumers who sued Northwest don't want to undo the merger,  
but they seek as much as $400 million in alleged fare overcharges 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline would appeal the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that has been litigated before three federal  
judges already and has been rejected each time until today,'' 
Austin said. ``We think this is an incorrect decision. We believe 
that on review it will be found to be so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumers sued under a section of the Clayton Antitrust Act  
that prohibits companies from anti-competitive use of stock and 
assets that they acquire. Northwest argued, however, that since the 
two airlines fully merged and Republic's stock ceased to exist, no 
claim was possible under that part of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, U.S. District Judge David Doty dismissed the  
suit, ruling that since the deal had been approved by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, the plaintiffs could not challenge 
the merger based on the Clayton Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The three appellate judges disagreed, saying the section wording  
expressly provides for such a claim even when all of a company's 
stock or assets are acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from 11 states had filed friend-of-the-court  
briefs on behalf of the consumers, arguing that Doty misread the 
law in his earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great news for air travelers, good for competition,''  
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said. ``It could be a way to 
secure competitive prices or damages for noncompetitive prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has maintained it does not engage in unfair  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day strike by pilots that shut down the carrier last fall  
increased debate about airline competition in areas served by 
Northwest, which operates hubs in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit and 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ga. Hostess Program Gets Some Flak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- They are known as the Georgia Girls, a group  
of some 70 ``vivacious'' female students who spend their winter 
weekends taking high school football recruits to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has been around at least 20 years, and is an  
important part of attracting some of the country's best players to 
the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the program is nothing more than a university-sponsored  
escort service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that these hospitality teams are all female and  
the football players are all male sets up the expectation that what 
is being given out is sex appeal,'' said Victoria Davion, who 
teaches a feminist philosophy class. ``They're selling sex appeal 
as an enticement to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, says Dominique Holloman, a sophomore Georgia Girl.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're like hostesses,'' she said. ``You could think of it as a  
tour guide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Tennessee fans taunted Georgia Girls at a game,  
insinuating that they used sex to sign players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs are the pre-eminent team in this football-crazy  
state, drawing 90,000 fans to every home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools with powerhouse football programs, mostly in the  
South, have similar organizations -- the Bama Belles (Alabama), Vol 
Hostesses (Tennessee), Gator Guides (Florida), Rebel Recruiters 
(Mississippi) and Tiger PAWS (Clemson). The NCAA has no objection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls look for young women who are ``vivacious,  
outgoing and informative,'' said Audra Towson, the 22-year-old 
president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruits notice their looks. Bulldog linebacker Adrian  
Hollingshed said recruits often talk about which school has the 
prettiest escorts. But he said the players don't expect 
relationships with the women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls acknowledge they flirt with some recruits but  
say it never goes beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Towson said many of the women are in their 20s and wouldn't  
consider dating teen-agers. Although some Georgia Girls date 
current Bulldog players, Towson said she has never heard of any who 
had a physical relationship with a recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there are rules against it. Revealing clothes are  
frowned upon, but the only thing strictly forbidden is wearing 
anything other than the school colors, red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	Many universities say they would not approve of an all-female  
group because it would give the impression that the school endorsed 
relationships between the group members and recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that, and we won't,'' said Bob Chamiel, Notre  
Dame's coordinator of football operations. ``I think everybody has 
their own way of recruiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls' work really begins in January, when recruits  
visit the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fridays, the women put on their best red-and-black outfits  
for dinner with the players. Each woman takes basic football 
lessons and studies up on her recruit -- where he's from, his 
parents' names and his position -- to keep the conversation flowing 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	They accompany recruits, players and coaches to dinner again on  
Saturday nights, sometimes followed by a tour of Athens' nightlife. 
All of it is paid by the school's football program, which is funded 
by donations, game tickets and television revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the players are underage, bars are rarely on the  
itinerary. The usual destinations are basketball games or bowling 
alleys. 
</P>
<P>
	During visits in the fall, the women sit with recruits at games,  
show them around campus and answer questions about student life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play a part in making them feel more comfortable at the  
school,'' says Haley Cagle, a senior and a program vice president. 
``Sometimes they'll confide stuff in us that they don't tell the 
coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls will see the results of their work on  
Wednesday, college football's signing day, when the recruits' 
decisions on which school they will play for are announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like more than just a person in the stands,'' Holloman  
said. ``I'm actually part of something, not just an onlooker. It's 
kind of like being the ultimate fan.''

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Film Protest Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Protesters heckled Thailand's forestry  
chief for allowing the shooting of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie on a 
protected beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Several activists showed up Monday at the headquarters of the  
forestry department and heckled Plodprasop Suraswadi as he was 
making a speech. Plodprasop told the hecklers they should leave the 
matter to the courts and stop ``treating me like an animal,'' the 
Bangkok Post quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Plodprasop's employees tried to attack the activists  
but were restrained by some of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists are suing Plodprasop, claiming the 20th  
Century Fox production is spoiling Phi Island's fragile ecosystem. 
The filmmakers deny it.

<HEADLINE> French Skier Hurt in Training Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- French Face turned into disaster for France's  
best. 
</P>
<P>
	Regine Cavagnoud, considered among the favorites in the women's  
downhill at the World Alpine Ski Championships, torn a knee 
ligament Tuesday when she crashed during a training run on Vail 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 12 days after winning her first World Cup downhill of the  
season, Cavagnoud tumbled on French Face after taking a large jump 
about 90 seconds into her run down the 1.6-mile International 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she was in the air, I think she panicked,'' said Gilles  
Brenier, team captain for the French women's team. ``She landed on 
her right leg. I think that's where the damage came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud, who is fifth in the overall World Cup standings,  
crumpled to the snow, grabbing at her knee as ski patrol members 
went to her aid. She sat upright while being taken to Vail Valley 
Medical Center in a sled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Cavagnoud, 28, tore the anterior cruciate  
ligament in her right knee, and she also was being evaluated for a 
possible injury to her knee cap. An MRI was scheduled at the 
Steadman-Hawkins Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud is expected to be out anywhere from six weeks to six  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big jump,'' said Austria's Renate Goetschl. ``It's  
really high and far. It's difficult to stay (on course) because 
it's hard snow and it's icy. If you don't land exactly, then it 
could make you crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the downhill and finishing second in the super-G  
at the World Cup stop in Cortina, Italy, on Jan. 21, Cavagnoud was 
considered one of the favorites in Sunday's downhill. She finished 
seventh in the downhill at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's OK, but she's pretty low,'' said Pierre Chambat of the  
French Ski Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, the World Cup downhill leader, finished sixth in  
Tuesday's training run, which was moved up one day after weather 
forced the postponement of the women's super-G race Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Stefanie Schuster had the fastest training time,  
finishing in 1 minute, 52.43 seconds. Teammate Michaela Dorfmeister 
was second at 1:52.70, and Melanie Suchet of France finished third 
in 1:53.13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you get nothing for this but a lot of confidence,''  
Schuster said. ``I have skied most of my best results here, so I 
like to come here. It's sunny. It's a nice course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer placed seventh in  
training, skiing conservatively to finish in 1:54.03 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a security run,'' Meissnitzer said. ``I didn't take the  
risk because I knew a few girls, they were crashing, and so I 
thought I better not take the risk because today I don't get any 
medals, any points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, one of the course forerunners crashed on  
Pepe's Face just above the finish line. It was the same spot where 
American Picabo Street tore knee ligaments during a training run in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, skiing two spots behind Cavagnoud, was sixth in  
1:53.77. Germany's Martina Ertl was fifth in 1:53.37, just 0.09 
seconds behind Sylviane Berthod of Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark was the top American finisher, placing 26th. Megan  
Gerety, the top U.S. downhill skier, missed a gate near the top of 
the course and finished more than five seconds behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not hard at all,'' Gerety said of the course. ``I just  
kind of somehow went the wrong way on a couple deals.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Assailed Over Drugs, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC was assailed about drugs  
and corruption Tuesday, with the White House leading the call for 
the scandal-hit organization to clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent examples of alleged corruption, lack of accountability  
and the failure of leadership have challenged the legitimacy of 
this institution,'' Barry McCaffrey, a White House adviser on drug 
policy, said on the opening day of the IOC's drug summit. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the IOC must institute democratic reforms and  
open its books to have any credibility in leading the fight against 
drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	A top IOC official retorted that the United States has no right  
to lecture the IOC when drug use remains rampant in American sports 
-- and cited Mark McGwire's use of a controversial muscle-booster as 
a sign of American ``hypocrisy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go on the moralizing and lecturing tone, you must be  
sure you're own house is in order,'' senior IOC executive board 
member Jacques Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp exchange underscored the IOC's worst fear -- that the  
drug conference would be overshadowed by the fallout from the worst 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to restore faith in the Olympic movement,'' British  
Sports Minister Tony Banks said. ``At the moment, it's sour and 
sullied. The IOC's reputation is on the line. The British 
government expects the IOC to clean up its act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McCaffrey and Banks stopped short of calling for  
Samaranch's resignation, German Interior Minister Otto Schily 
suggested it was time for the IOC leader -- in office since 1980 -- 
to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``A constitutional monarchy in sports is harmful,'' Schily told  
German television in Lausanne. ``If someone is too long in an 
office, he loses his legitimacy. Everyone has his time and everyone 
must know when it's time to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, speaker after speaker demanded that the  
centerpiece of the conference -- a proposed international 
anti-doping agency -- be independent of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a direct slap to Samaranch, who has proposed that the  
agency be overseen by himself and run by IOC drug chief Prince 
Alexandre de Merode. 
</P>
<P>
	``For complete credibility the agency must be headed by someone  
other than an IOC member,'' U.S. Olympic Committee executive 
director Dick Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Banks: ``We support a totally transparent world anti-doping  
organization. We don't believe the IOC should be that agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode said he couldn't understand this ``lack of  
confidence'' and questioned the moral authority of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take offense that politicians don't trust me to chair this  
agency,'' he said. ``Why should I trust politicians?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to government corruption scandals throughout Europe, De  
Merode said: ``Ask people in the streets if there is a great 
confidence in politicians. I have some doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was further jeopardized by wide disagreement on  
another key issue: drug sanctions. While some delegates pressed for 
fixed minimum two-year bans across all sports, de Merode and Rogge 
proposed more flexibile penalties that would survive legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputes came on the same day that the IOC cleared  
Australian officials of any wrongdoing following allegations of 
vote-buying in Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, the IOC official with oversight for the Sydney Games,  
said he had reviewed documents provided by Australian Olympics 
chief John Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said Coates had broken no rules when he offered $70,000 in  
sports aid to two African IOC members the night before Sydney beat 
Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was legal, legitimate and according to the rules,'' Rogge  
said. ``There is absolutely no problem in the way it was done. No 
cash money was given, no under-the-table payment. Everything was 
straightforward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney case emerged as part of a widening scandal that  
started with bribery allegations surrounding the selection of Salt 
Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Games. Nine IOC members have 
resigned or been expelled so far for receiving cash payments, 
scholarships and other favors from Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had hoped the scandals wouldn't encroach on the drug  
summit, but it was clear from the start that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch referred to the scandal at the start of his opening  
address, saying, ``We have taken all the necessary measures and are 
continuing our investigations to ensure that Olympic ethics are 
respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's credibility in the wake of the scandals was raised  
forecefully by McCaffrey, director of the White House Drug Policy 
Office. He said it was time for the IOC to reform itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC must operate as a democratic and accountable public  
institution,'' he said. ``Its procedures must be based on open 
books and records, open and recorded votes on issues, and an 
elected membership that is accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schily, the German minister, blasted those who ``sacrifice the  
credibility of sport on the altar of economic interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC cannot comply with the functions which go with its  
role unless this institution is completely reorganized and there is 
a proper disclosure of its finances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest debate was over the composition of an anti-doping  
agency to coordinate random drug testing and other drug matters 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 European Union nations came out in a bloc -- later  
endorsed by McCaffrey -- to oppose the IOC's proposal. They objected 
to the agency being governed by the IOC president, as well as 
giving leading roles to sponsors and pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials chafed at the notion of politicians telling the  
IOC how to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said there was ``no relevance'' between the IOC's  
structure and the drug problem, and took a direct shot at the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC was the very first body to start the doping fight in  
1964,'' he said. ``As far as I know, the United States still has no 
anti-doping law today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the United States is a country ``where in  
professional sports you see a lack of real anti-doping rules, where 
you see that one of the biggest heroes, McGwire, is admitting 
taking androstenedione, which is forbidden in all other sports 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andro is banned by the IOC as a steroid but is not prohibited by  
major league baseball. McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs this 
season, said he took andro as a legal, over-the-counter nutritional 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge sneered at American claims that andro is not a steroid.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not be hyprotical,'' he said. ``It's a drug that induces  
the formation of testosterone in the body and therefore is illegal, 
illicit and dangerous. Come on.''

<HEADLINE> IBM, Bell Atlantic Promote Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of home buyers on the East Coast will  
have the option of owning houses already installed with the latest 
computer-networking technology under an alliance announced Tuesday 
between IBM and Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp.  
agreed to work with home builders to equip houses with devices that 
let owners link together personal computers and electronics 
products into low-cost networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The result isn't exactly Bill Gates' $53 million Seattle  
mansion, featuring a computer system that changes music, 
temperature, lighting and even digital artwork to match visitor 
preferences as people move from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
	But the networking equipment, which costs home buyers from  
$1,000 to $10,000, lets different machines access the Internet 
through one account, exchange files and share the same VCR. IBM's 
most expensive version, which it calls a ``home management 
system,'' enables people to operate all their electronics, from 
security systems to kitchen appliances, using a universal remote 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the clout of IBM, the world's largest computer  
company, and Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local-telephone 
company, could give consumers another reason to join the nascent 
home-networking trend. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, just 4.8 percent of all home PCs are linked in networks,  
according to researcher Media Metrix Inc. But a recent increase in 
homes owning more than one computer -- to more than one-third of the 
46 million U.S. households with PCs -- is expected to fuel demand in 
coming months, says International Data Corp., another research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	While other manufacturers sell networking hubs in retail stores,  
IBM is focusing on pre-installing the devices in homes. One reason 
is its pricey home management system needs to be installed by 
on-site technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Targeting newly built homes ``lowers the barriers  
considerably,'' said Kevin Hause, an industry analyst with 
International Data. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic Communications and Construction Services, a unit  
of the New York-based Baby Bell, has 3,500 workers to wire homes 
and install the IBM home-networking equipment to connect 
electronics products, such as PCs, TVs and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has deals with home builders elsewhere, but Tuesday's is its  
biggest. Bell Atlantic officials said they expect to network about 
15,000 homes in the East Coast this year, up from 2,000 last year, 
when Bell Atlantic only used its own home-networking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a huge increase in coverage,'' said IBM  
spokesman Andrew Hayden.

<HEADLINE> Day Care Killer Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A volunteer at a day care center  
for HIV-positive families was convicted of murder Tuesday for 
stabbing a woman whose 4-year-old son complained that the volunteer 
grabbed him by the ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Odette Green, 24, cried and had to be wheeled out of the  
courtroom in the chair she occupied at the defense table. 
</P>
<P>
	She could get up to 34 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Angela Brock, 29, was stabbed in the chest last February and  
died in the courtyard of the center, called Think Life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over. Reliving it over and over wasn't a good  
experience,'' Ms. Brock's mother, Martha Gainey, said outside 
court. ``I feel remorse because she's a mother too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brock and her 6-year-old son had gone to the center to pick  
up her 2-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son, Cedric, who had a 
history of behavioral problems. Cedric ran to her crying that Ms. 
Green had hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brock accused Ms. Green of pinching and hitting Cedric. Ms.  
Green denied it and a fight followed. Ms. Brock punched Ms. Green 
and split her lip and forehead before Ms. Green got a knife and 
stabbed Ms. Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Steven Hammer said his client killed Ms. Brock  
in self-defense. He planned to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Brown Confidant Guilty in Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who was once a business partner of the  
late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown pleaded guilty in a tax case that 
grew out of an investigation of Brown's business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent counsel appointed in 1995 to look into Brown's  
financial affairs stopped work when Brown was killed in a plane 
crash in Croatia the following year. But the Justice Department 
took over investigation of Brown's one-time partner, Nolanda S. 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill and one of her employees, Kenneth Charles White, each  
pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to three counts of preparing 
and filing false income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were charged in March with using a credit card scheme to  
divert thousands from two of Hill's companies to pay Hill's 
personal expenses, such as high-priced clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, a Dallas businesswoman, failed to report more than  
$181,000 in income between 1990 and 1993, prosecutors claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas averted a trial on tax and fraud charges set for next  
week. Five related charges against Hill and six against White were 
dropped as part of a plea agreement with Justice Department 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill and White face up to three years in prison and fines of  
$250,000 when they are sentenced by U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin on April 12. Hill also faces back taxes, plus undetermined 
fines and penalties from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hill and White remain free on their own recognizance.  
</P>
<P>
	The pair allegedly diverted the money from Corridor Broadcasting  
Corp., which ran TV stations in the District of Columbia and the 
Boston area, and Jasas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill largely owned and was chief executive officer of Corridor  
Broadcasting during the period covered by the indictment. White was 
its chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stemmed from a 1995 independent counsel probe of  
Brown's financial dealings, including Hill's payment to Brown of 
more than $300,000 to buy out his portion of a company they shared.

<HEADLINE> IOC Clears Sydney of Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
today cleared Sydney of any wrongdoing in connection with financial 
inducements offered on the eve of Sydney's selection as host of the 
2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive board member with oversight  
over the 2000 Games, reviewed the documents of Sydney's bid with 
Australian Olympics chief John Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is clear,'' Rogge said. ``It was legal, legitimate  
and according to the rules. There is absolutely no problem in the 
way it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No cash money was given, no under the table payment,'' Rogge  
said. ``Everything was straightforward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates disclosed 10 days ago that he had offered $70,000 in  
inducements to two African IOC members the night before the 1993 
vote on the 2000 host city. Sydney beat Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were made to bolster sports in Kenya  
and Uganda as part of an African aid program. The offer, made to 
the two IOC members from Kenya and Uganda, was contingent on Sydney 
winning the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations came amid the bribery scandal surrounding Salt  
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC said it 
would examine the Sydney bid but stopped short of opening a formal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``No single dollar was paid to Kenya before the election of  
Sydney in Monte Carlo in 1993,'' Rogge said. ``Everything was done 
afterwards, so there is absolutely no link between money being 
given and the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney did nothing illegal, and Sydney did what the other bid  
committees did. There's no difference in what Sydney did and the 
other bids. All the other bids had an NOC (national Olympic 
committee) support scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the Australian Olympic Committee had a program to  
provide scholarships to athletes and coaches from 11 African 
countries. As of Dec. 31, 1998, scholarships had been provided for 
56 athletes and 46 coaches at a cost of nearly $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns have been raised over Australia's payments to the  
Kenyan Olympic Committee, whose IOC delegate Charles Mukora has 
been ousted in connection with the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said two payments totaling $13,146 had been transferred  
to help fund junior Kenyan track and field teams in Australia. A 
third payment of $7,996 had been transferred to an account set up 
in the name of the Charles Mukora Sports Foundation in 1997, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the AOC was still trying to ascertain what the third  
payment had been spent on. He said the remaining money would be 
withheld if there is no clear explanation from the Kenyan Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC should now review the whole question of aid  
offered through Olympic bid committees. He suggested the 
possibility of prohibiting financial assistance to countries with 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rogge said he would go ahead with his trip to Sydney  
later this month. The visit had been intended, in part, as a 
mission to gather facts about the Sydney bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to Sydney as a gesture of showing commitment from  
the IOC,'' Rogge said. ``There is no inquiry whatsoever. I've 
cleared everything with John. There is no further need to look into 
papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was greeted with relief by Kevan Gosper, the  
IOC executive board member from Australia who had initially 
suggested the inducements could be viewed as a serious breach of 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy this has been resolved to clarify that the  
rules weren't broken by the Sydney bid team, and that it's off the 
agenda,'' Gosper said. ``It eliminates any doubt about an inquiry 
extended to Sydney. It will enable Sydney and Australia to get its 
focus on the preparations for the Olympic Games.''

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key measure of future economic activity  
increased in December, signaling above average growth in the months 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private research group, reported today  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 percent to 
106.5 in December from a revised level of 106.2 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six  
to nine months in advance. The results indicate the U.S. economy 
will continue to outrun the troubles roiling economies in Asia, 
Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion shows no sign of ending,'' said Michael Boldin,  
senior economist with the conference board. ``Now almost eight 
years in length, it is the second longest on record and we expect 
it to become the longest ever in early 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly better than the 0.2 percent rise  
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index rose in  
December. Among the most significant were rising stock prices and 
orders of consumer goods. The most significant factor on the 
negative side was an increase in weekly initial claims for 
unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ending in December, the leading indicators  
rose 1.2 percent, better than twice the average six-month pace, 
Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means the odds of a recession are almost nil in the next  
six-to-nine months,'' he said. ``They also tell us growth should be 
above average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading index operates from a base of 100, set in 1992.  
First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically fine-tuned 
and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Study Refutes Hypertension Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Contrary to previous research, a new study found  
no direct link between high blood pressure and a decline in 
thinking ability as people age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hoped to find a really compelling relationship here, but  
... we just have very little information about what people can do 
to protect (themselves) from loss of their cognitive function,'' 
said the lead researcher, Dr. Robert J. Glynn of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized that controlling blood pressure is still vital to  
prevent heart disease and strokes, and that hypertension is often 
undertreated in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. It involved more than 2,000 people over age 65 
who had undergone tests of blood pressure and thinking ability at 
three-year intervals over a period of nine years beginning in 
1973-74. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found slightly greater declines in thinking  
function on one mental test among those with higher blood pressure, 
Glynn said. But the relationships were ``modest, at best,'' and 
they failed to shed light on what the mechanism might be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, who  
researched one of the previous studies but was not involved in the 
new work, said it doesn't necessarily contradict past findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Havlik said the impact of high blood pressure on mental  
functioning may not be apparent unless measured over all of 
adulthood. The new work may have measured thinking ability too late 
in the subjects' lives to show much effect, Havlik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said, recent findings from Europe suggest that people  
who are treated for high blood pressure have smaller declines in 
mental functioning as they age than those who are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Havlik said it is unclear how high blood pressure might damage  
thinking ability, but it may contribute to hardening of the 
arteries, which in turn could affect memory centers in the brain.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Terrorism Law Challenge Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. groups should be allowed to send  
humanitarian aid to foreign organizations even if they are deemed 
terrorist entities by the federal government, a lawyer argued. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, from the New York-based Center for Constitutional  
Rights, argued Monday for eight American groups' right to send 
medicine, books and other humanitarian aid to groups affiliated 
with the Kurds in Turkey and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	``This violates protection against guilt by association,'' Cole,  
representing the Los Angeles-based Humanitarian Law Project and 
affiliated aid organizations, said of the 1996 Anti-terrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the act, Cole said, it would be a crime even to send  
children's books to the groups in question. 
</P>
<P>
	But 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski, bristled  
at the argument. ``You send them cash, they can use to build bombs 
to blow up buses,'' Kozinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers Party claims to seek human  
rights and self-determination. In Sri Lanka, the Tigers claim 
similar goals for the Tamil minority. Both have been designated 
terrorist groups by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozinski said that providing medicine and medical equipment  
could be a means of providing cash because such items can be sold 
on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
	Although questioning was less severe when Deputy Attorney  
General Douglas Letter argued his case, the judges also expressed 
concern about potential First Amendment violations if Americans are 
forbidden to send such things as pamphlets with medical 
instructions on how to heal a broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozinski thanked the lawyers for exceptionally astute arguments  
in what he called ``a hard case.'' A ruling will be issued later. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit hearing was sought after a U.S. district court  
granted part of a motion for a preliminary injunction barring the 
government from criminally prosecuting individuals and 
organizations under the anti-terrorism law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Humanitarian Law Project and seven other plaintiffs claimed  
in a March 1998 lawsuit against top federal officials that the 1996 
act violates First Amendment rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Rain fell from southern New England to the Carolinas and over  
parts of the Pacific Northwest this morning. Scattered light snow 
fell in parts of the Plains. Precipitation was expected to continue 
in those areas later today with clear skies in the rest of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin Monday, winter weather conditions and dense fog was  
blamed for a traffic accident that killed a good Samaritan and a 
snowmobiling accident that left a man and his young son dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Today frozen precipitation was expected across northern and  
central New England. Snow is forecast over northern portions of 
Maine, while a mixture of freezing rain and snow was predicted from 
southern Maine into most of eastern New York. To the west, a 
mixture of rain and snow was expected over the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms were forecast along the eastern Gulf  
Coast, with a chance for showers and thunderstorms later today. 
Some of the storms may produce brief gust winds and small hail. 
North of this region, other areas of the Southeast and Tennessee 
Valley were expected to see dry weather, under cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Quieter weather was predicted for the middle part of the  
country, but some precipitation was still possible over the 
northern Plains, and a cold front was expected to produce a few 
areas of snow in the Dakotas. Windy conditions, with possible gusts 
over 40 mph, were possible in the northern and central Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain and snow were expected to continue to fall over the Pacific  
Northwest. Some of the rain may become heavy along the coasts of 
Washington and Oregon. Flooding is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Windy conditions may also pose a problem in the Northwest, with  
wind gusts over 50 mph. To the south, areas from the central 
California coast, east into the central Rockies and south to the 
Mexican Border, were expected to be dry and clear today. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's forecast calls for highs in the lower 30s in northern  
New England, the Northwest and northern Plains; in the 40s and 50s 
along the Northeast, the Great Lakes, mid-Atlantic states and the 
northern and central Plains; in the 60s and 70s in parts of the 
Southeast, Southwest and the southern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature Monday in the U.S. mainland was 80, in  
Lakeland, Fort Myers, and Sarasota, Fla. The lowest temperature was 
minus 14 in Glens Falls, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> A Denver Dynasty? Tune in Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Now it's time for the Denver Broncos to deal with  
their place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Do the two-time Super Bowl champions rate with other great teams  
of the modern era? Lombardi's Packers? The Steel Curtain? America's 
Team? 
</P>
<P>
	The one way to prove with certainty that the Broncos belong in  
such company is for Denver to win again next year. As commanding as 
those other champions were, none of them won three successive Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Can these Broncos, particularly if John Elway retires?  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we've done it is because we're always hungry,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said Monday, hours after the Broncos beat the 
Atlanta Falcons 34-19. ``We always question ourselves. Our mindset 
was that if we played the perfect game, not only could we beat a 
team, we could dominate a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also knew that if we didn't hit on all cylinders, that we  
could be embarrassed. That's why we've had success. If we have that 
type of mindset, then we have a chance to have success in the 
future. I would be surprised if we don't, because of the mindset 
and character of our guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those traits begin with Elway, of course. After a career marked  
by great athletic achievements but no championships, Elway now has 
matched Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman and Joe 
Montana by quarterbacking two straight Super Bowl winners. None of 
them managed three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos just might be good enough to repeat even if Elway  
isn't around. They won four games with Bubby Brister starting for 
an injured Elway this season. They have the NFL's best player, 
Terrell Davis, and some superb other weapons. The offensive line is 
staunch. The defense is stingy and makes big plays. There's a nice 
balance between youth and experience. And a terrific coaching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Elway's leadership and perseverance are at the core of  
this team's success. For the Broncos to survive the rugged 
competition in the AFC alone -- the Jaguars, Jets, Dolphins, Bills, 
Patriots, perhaps the Steelers and Seahawks all could be formidable 
-- will be a tough task with him. Without the man Ed McCaffrey 
called ``the Denver Broncos,'' who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' said Elway,  
who couldn't have written a better ending than winning the MVP 
award on Sunday. ``But it also would be nice to walk away at the 
level that I'm playing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a football player, I'm never going to not want to play  
football. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also know that 
if I play like I played last night that I can play a little bit 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also knows he could return to a very special club that isn't  
likely to lose anyone of significance. It appears Shanahan's 
coaching staff will remain intact with offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak turning down a move to Colorado as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	These Broncos appear in as good a position to win a third  
consecutive crown as any of the other repeaters, and better than 
some. A lot better, if No. 7 is behind center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' Elway said. ``But the last thing I want 
to do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.''

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Is Next To Be Deposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sidney Blumenthal went to the White House as a  
policy adviser, but Republican critics have sought to cast the 
unapologetic Clinton defender in a differing role -- purveyor of 
rumors about the president's detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	It was rumors that Blumenthal, a former journalist, made  
secretive calls to the news media that was among the concerns that 
prompted Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to summon him before a 
grand jury last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was one piece of scuttlebutt that Blumenthal got directly  
from the president and passed on to the grand jury that has earned 
him a visit Wednesday to Capitol Hill, where he'll be the third 
witness questioned by House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors plan to question Blumenthal during a videotaped  
deposition about a conversation he had with Clinton in which the 
president referred to Monica Lewinsky as ``the stalker'' shortly 
after the president's affair with her became the subject of news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalker moniker quickly emerged in news stories about Ms.  
Lewinsky in the early days of the controversy last year. Blumenthal 
denies he ever passed it on and his lawyers bristle at the 
suggestion that he is some sort of rumor mongerer or dirt digger. 
</P>
<P>
	When Blumenthal heard the ``stalker'' comment from the  
president, he ``didn't spread it, he didn't peddle it, he didn't 
urge people to write about it, he didn't tell people about it, he 
wasn't the source for that,'' attorney William McDaniel said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe such a person exists'' in the news media,  
``but if anybody in their mind thinks they have a pledge of 
confidentiality to Sidney'' on the topic of the stalker comment, 
``they're released; let them come forward and say it,'' McDaniel 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	What is not in dispute is that Blumenthal recounted the  
presidential conversation for Starr's grand jury. He testified that 
Clinton told him he had rebuffed Ms. Lewinsky after she ``came at 
me and made a sexual demand on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that  
she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it 
and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she 
wouldn't be the stalker any more,'' Blumenthal, in his testimony 
last June, quoted Clinton as telling him. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are trying to show that Clinton intentionally  
gave false information to Blumenthal so that it would be passed on 
to the grand jury and mislead the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal scholars say there are serious obstacles to making that  
case. Among them is the fact that the president invoked executive 
privilege to try to keep Blumenthal from testifying. Clinton 
eventually lost a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Blumenthal has to say is irrelevant to the impeachment  
charges but puts the president in a very bad light,'' Georgetown 
University law professor Paul Rothstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a politician and you can't prove a politician  
wasn't thinking more about his public image than he was thinking 
about interfering with official proceedings,'' Rothstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has long been a favorite target of criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	A New York Post editorial last fall dubbed him ``Sid Vicious.''  
And Republican leaders singled him out when they asked FBI director 
Louis Freeh to investigate whether Clinton allies peddled stories 
of adulterous affairs by lawmakers to the media. Blumenthal denied 
any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	While other White House witnesses left grand jury appearances  
without commenting, Blumenthal held news conferences on the 
courthouse steps to attack Starr. And when presidential lawyers 
accused Starr of illegal grand jury leaks, Blumenthal sought to be 
party to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	After one grand jury appearance, Blumenthal said prosecutors  
were asking him about his contacts with the news media and were 
trampling on the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one to shy away from a fight, Blumenthal filed a defamation  
suit against Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge over a false 
report about Blumenthal's past. Drudge quickly retracted and 
apologized hours after sending out the item on the Internet. The 
lawsuit is pending.

<HEADLINE> Anger Still Marks Right-to-Die Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Although Michele Finn won the battle to end  
life support for her severely brain-damaged husband, she and her 
children lost something in the process -- a relationship with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months since Hugh Finn died after his feeding tube was  
removed, the bitterness and anger that marked the case still 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his family angrily maintains Hugh's death was the  
euthanasia of a healthy man. And Mrs. Finn no longer speaks to her 
sister, who sided with Finn's parents during the legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the relationship between Michele and I is over,''  
Elaine Glazier, Mrs. Finn's sister, said last week. ``We're hoping 
that when the children become of age, we'll re-establish contact 
and they'll understand what we tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finn, a former Louisville, Ky., television news anchor, was  
critically injured in a March 1995 car accident. His doctors said 
he was in a ``persistent vegetative state'' -- unable to think, 
walk, talk or control his body. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, Mrs. Finn told her husband's family that she  
planned to let him die. Under Virginia law, food and water may be 
withheld from people who are permanently vegetative. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn's family questioned Hugh's diagnosis, and Finn's brother,  
John Finn, unsuccessfully filed suit to stop the removal of the 
feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Gilmore's emergency motion to stop the removal also was  
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional toll the court fight had on the family took center  
stage in the Virginia state Senate last week, during a hearing in 
which the panel approved reimbursing Mrs. Finn $48,000 for the 
state's effort to keep Finn alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Through tears, Mrs. Finn testified about an article her daughter  
read in which her father-in-law, Thomas Finn Sr., was quoted as 
saying her decision to let Hugh die was ``murder.''

	``I had to let my oldest daughter, who was almost 13, know how  
bad the situation had become,'' Mrs. Finn said, her voice breaking. 
``I let her read the article. Her only comment was, `How could 
Grandpa say such a thing?''' 
</P>
<P>
	``My children not only have lost their father, they've lost most  
of their extended family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The animosity between the families was exacerbated by those who  
counseled Hugh's family to keep fighting Michele's decision, said 
Karen Finn, Hugh's sister and the one blood relative who supported 
Michele. 
</P>
<P>
	The anger has not subsided. Ms. Glazier traveled from her  
Pennsylvania home to Richmond last week to tell legislators that 
Mrs. Finn doesn't deserve to be reimbursed for her legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Glazier said her brother in-law was ``cruelly starved  
to death,'' Mrs. Finn sat outside the hearing room weeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resent the fact that my sister insinuates that I did not  
have the best interest of Hugh in mind,'' Ms. Glazier said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Karen Finn said, the two sides undoubtedly will remain  
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long process, and we all have to heal,'' she said.  
``Michele and Keeley and Bridget are all we have left of Hugh. I 
love being involved in their life. ... I hope that can happen for 
the rest of my family.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Fire Could Affect Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A prolonged shutdown of Ford Motor Co.'s  
Rouge parts making complex which was hit by fire Monday could 
affect other plants in the automaker's North American production 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprawling complex closed Monday after an explosion and fire  
in the coal-powered generating station that fuels its operations. 
One person was killed. Thirteen were in critical condition this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	If production at the parts plant doesn't resume quickly,  
officials said the company would slow production at 16 of the 
company's 20 North American assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're bringing in generators,'' Rouge complex site manager Art  
Janes told The Detroit News for an article published Tuesday. ``We 
have several plants we need to get up very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Priorities include the complex's stamping plant, engine plant  
and glass and frame plants. The stamping operation supplies 
stampings to 16 plants, and the frame plant supplies parts to three 
other plants, Ford officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday evening, the company already had decided first-shift  
workers at four assembly plants -- Wixom; Oakville and St. Thomas, 
Ontario; and Lorain, Ohio -- would work fewer hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	One plant in the complex builds frames for the Lincoln Town Car,  
which is assembled in Wixom, and the Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford 
Crown Victoria, which are built in St. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouge Steel, independently owned and employing 3,000 of the  
10,000 workers at the complex, makes flat rolled sheet metal for 
body panels and other parts, and serves other automotive customers 
besides Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Skilled tradesmen and management were asked to return to work  
today at the complex, but production workers were not called back. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Edison Co. has two power connection lines that tie into  
the Rouge power plant. But utility spokesman Lew Layton said Edison 
doesn't know if those connections or the switches that let them 
work have been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility might not be able to operate fully even if Detroit  
Edison can supply electricity, because the plant also produces 
steam and that capability was damaged, Layton told the Detroit Free 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, work began on a new power plant. CMS Energy Corp. and  
DTE Energy Co. plan to build a $240 million plant to supply 
electricity and steam to the complex. It's scheduled to begin 
operating by 2001, replacing the coal-fired plant that exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had crews inspecting damage to the site, adjacent  
to the Rouge complex.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' McCarty Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Celtics forward Walter McCarty has signed a  
contract extension that reportedly will run for three years 
starting with the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics, who announced the deal but none of its details on  
Tuesday, now have McCarty, Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson and Paul 
Pierce signed to long-term deals. They are expected to turn their 
attention now to Ron Mercer, entering his second NBA season and 
becoming eligible for an extension next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who played for Boston coach Rick Pitino when both were  
at Kentucky, averaged 9.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 
28.5 minutes last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in all 82 regular-season games, starting 64 of them  
after a preseason trade brought him from the New York Knicks. 
Boston also obtained John Thomas and Dontae Jones, neither now with 
the team, for Chris Mills and two second-round draft choices.

<HEADLINE> Judge Seeks Ban on Legal Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge in Dallas says he plans to ban  
the sale of self-help legal software in Texas, claiming it amounts 
to the unauthorized practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders issued a summary judgment  
on Jan. 22 to prevent Parsons Technology Inc. from distributing 
future copies of Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer 
'99 in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Products already in stores apparently are unaffected by the  
ruling. An injunction to enforce the ruling could be issued within 
the next two weeks, lawyers involved in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing Parsons said they are planning to  
challenge the ruling and will ask the judge to place the ban on 
hold, pending a decision from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and industry experts blasted the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can quote me: This is sick. This reeks of greed,'' said  
Ann Stephens, president of PC Data, a company that tracks the sale 
of software for personal computers. ``Boy, these lawyers are 
sticking up for their own, aren't they? I don't think they're 
representing you or me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Schenck, an appellate lawyer representing Parsons  
Technology, said that eight states have considered cases against 
self-help legal publishers, but Texas is the first to opt for a 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texas is apparently alone in banning books and software  
according to the judge's ruling,'' Schenck said. ``Our opinion is 
the Texas statute doesn't reach that far and if it did it would 
violate the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The do-it-yourself products sell for under $30, and the latest  
versions offers more than 100 legal forms and instructions on how 
to file a will, prenuptial agreement, employment contract, real 
estate lease or similar document.

<HEADLINE>  Food Low At Colombia Quake Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Emergency food supplies are dangerously  
low for the more than 200,000 people left homeless by last week's 
earthquake in Colombia, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said private donations were dropping off  
precipitously, and appealed for more aid to fill the gap between 
what Colombians need and what the government and international 
relief agencies have rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid officials were trying to avoid a repeat of the first few  
days after the Jan. 25 earthquake, when food shortages were 
widespread due to the magnitude of the devastation and bureaucratic 
delays. Frustration over those shortages fueled waves of looting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have food for four or five more days,'' said Juan Manuel  
Urrutia, head of the Colombian Institute for Family Well-Being, a 
government agency. ``We're working to avoid a food crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highest priority for aid are children, he said. About 25,000  
children were receiving milk and basic foodstuffs in Quindio -- the 
state most severely affected by the magnitude-6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. World Food Program was distributing about 25,000 food  
rations packets a day, he said. And a plane from Italy stocked with 
portable kitchen gear, generators and $200,000 worth of beans was 
expected at Armenia's airport on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strong foreign donations, Urrutia said the cash-strapped  
Colombian government would have to begin purchasing food, in part 
to make up for a falloff in donations by private Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the central donation center in Bogota, where as many as 6,000  
people arrived daily to donate supplies during the first days after 
the quake, only 400 showed up Monday with boxes and shopping bags 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake survivors need to get enough calories not only to  
survive but to return to work or begin rebuilding their shattered 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cost as much as $950 million to rebuild and repair the  
estimated 35,000 homes rendered uninhabitable by the earthquake, 
two-thirds of them in Armenia, Colombia's planning director Jaime 
Ruiz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 people were killed in the state capital, Armenia,  
a city of 300,000 residents that now is largely in ruins. Calarca, 
a town 15 minutes from Armenia, had at least 110 deaths in the 
earthquake and more than 200 people were killed elsewhere in the 
coffee-growing region.

<HEADLINE> After Loss, UConn Faces Tough Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- With two key starters injured, Connecticut  
went nowhere against Syracuse and became the last of the unbeatens 
to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't get any easier for the No. 1 Huskies: Next up is No.  
4 Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt to watch,'' said star forward Richard Hamilton, who  
had started 86 straight games for UConn before being sidelined 
Monday night. ``I hate to lose and I hate not playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (19-1, 11-1 Big East) put on one of the worst  
offensive performances in 27 years in their 59-42 loss to the No. 
16 Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the reigning Big East Player of the Year, is out with  
a thigh bruise, but is expected to be ready for Stanford on 
Saturday if he responds to treatment. His 22 points per game was 
sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the team's leading rebounder, has a more serious  
injury, a stress fracture of the left foot. The 6-foot-11 junior, 
who had started 85 consecutive games at center before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Voskuhl, averaging 7.2 rebounds, had a similar injury in high  
school. Out indefinitely, he flew home to Texas on Tuesday to be 
examined by the orthopedic surgeon who treated him in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Baxter of Houston physician has treated other  
prominent athletes such as Christian Laettner, Grant Hill and Carl 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries hit the team a week before the Huskies travel to  
Stanford (18-3). The last meeting was a 20-point UConn win in 
Storrs last February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're playing a team as good as UConn I don't think  
you'll need additional motivation,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects his team will have to contend with Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that Hamilton will be back and be every bit as  
effective as he can be,'' Montgomery said. ``You put an 
All-American back in the lineup. That's huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal are led by 6-8 junior forward Mark Madsen,  
averaging 12.9 points and 7.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Hamilton and Voskuhl, coach Jim Calhoun was forced to  
change his starting lineup Monday for the first time in 36 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies struggled against Syracuse's zone, shooting just 36  
percent, including 3-for-15 from 3-point range. The 42-point total 
was their lowest since a 41-39 overtime loss to Boston College in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss snapped UConn's 16-game Big East winning streak and its  
31-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life brings you many things,'' Calhoun said. ``Injuries are a  
part of athletics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the winningest coach in school history could not hide his  
disappointment over the way his team lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with our record or program, but there  
was a lot wrong with how we played (Monday),'' he said. ``We didn't 
get any loose balls and players other than Hamilton and Voskuhl are 
allowed to get loose balls.''

 *Marion Boyars    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Marion Boyars, one of Britain's first women  
publishers who built up a stable of writers that included five 
Nobel Prize winners, died Monday at age 71. The cause of death was 
not given. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Boyars bought into independent publisher John Calder's  
business in 1964 to create Calder and Boyars, a publishing house 
that prospered in London until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair gained worldwide attention in 1966 when they were taken  
to court on obscenity charges for publishing ``Last Exit to 
Brooklyn'' by Hubert Selby Jr., a case they eventually won on 
appeal in 1968. They also published the long-banned Henry Miller 
novel, ``Tropic of Cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After parting ways with Calder, Mrs. Boyars built up her own  
publishing house in New York. In all, she published about 500 
titles, including bestsellers such as Ken Kesey's ``One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ed Herlihy, a radio announcer who was the voice

</P>
<P>
	In 1947, Herlihy began radio work with Kraft, and continued the  
relationship on television in the 1950s, when the company sponsored 
``Kraft Television Theater,'' a live drama series. He was known for 
ad-libbing during commercials when programs ran too long or too 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	Herlihy's voice also was heard in numerous 1930s and 1940s radio  
shows, including ``America's Town Meeting,'' a public-affairs 
program; ``The Falcon'' and ``Mr. District Attorney,'' both crime 
dramas; and ``Just Plain Bill,'' a soap opera about a barber in a 
small town. His voice also told 1940s moviegoers about the battles 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	His television credits include Sid Caesar's ``Show of Shows,''  
``As the World Turns'' and ``All My Children.'' He worked for Woody 
Allen in the 1980s in such films as ``Hannah and her Sisters,'' 
``Zelig'' and ``Radio Days.''

</P>
<P>
	Jahn held the rare rank of rear admiral in the U.S. Maritime  
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	His World War II exploits included being torpedoed off Hawaii a

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paul Mellon, whose inherited fortune enabled  
him to provide Americans with Van Goghs and Cezannes, the Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina and beautification of 
a park across the street from the White House, died Monday. He was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
	His most enduring legacy may be the East Building of the  
National Gallery of Art, an expansion of the Pennsylvania Avenue 
museum founded by his father, industrialist Andrew W. Mellon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's wide-ranging philanthropy included a $5 million  
endowment of the symphony orchestra of Pittsburgh, a contribution 
that made possible the purchase of the Cape Hatteras National 
Seashore and patronage of the Royal Veterinary College at the 
University of London. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he gave $409,000 to spruce up Lafayette Park across the  
street from the White House. Sky Meadows State Park in Virginia was 
another gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon was also a lifelong horseman and fox hunter, and a  
successful horse breeder. His Sea Hero won the Kentucky Derby in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Forbes magazine rated him the 124th richest American,  
worth $1.4 billion. His fortune was inherited from his father and 
built on holdings in banking, coal, railroads, steel and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's 913 gifts to the National Gallery of Art included Paul  
Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat'' and Edgar Degas' original wax 
sculpture of the ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer.'' He also gave works 
by contemporary American artists, including Mark Rothko and

vice chief of naval operations during a 42-year Navy career and 
bolstered the use of submarines as a crucial part of the nation's 
nuclear deterrent, died Monday of congestive heart failure. He was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 25 years aboard submarines, from World War II to  
Vietnam, and influenced the development of the ballistic missile 
submarine force. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, he took part in a war game in which he acted as  
commander of the Soviet Union's submarine fleet. During the 
simulated attack, he virtually eliminated the U.S. Strategic Air 
Command by taking out much of the United States' air bombers and 
land-based missiles. Officials then realized that the nation's 
defense had vulnerabilities and that submarines could play an 
important part in warding off an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He was promoted to rear admiral in 1967 and served as director  
of antisubmarine warfare. He became full admiral in 1974, when he 
was named commander in chief of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe. The 
following year, he was named vice chief of naval operations, a job 
he held two years, the normal tour of duty. After that, he was 
commander in chief of Allied Forces in Southern Europe until his 
retirement in 1980.

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors Question Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors questioned presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan on Tuesday and drew concessions they hope will 
bolster their case for live witnesses at the impeachment trial. 
Senators also viewed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped deposition and 
suggested they were underwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a Washington power broker, asserted again in his  
testimony that President Clinton was directly behind his efforts to 
find Ms. Lewinsky a job but that the effort was never designed to 
buy her silence, sources familiar with the testimony said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged for the first time that the former intern  
called him to discuss her affidavit denying a sexual relationship 
with the president and conceded he likely had a breakfast meeting 
with her that House prosecutors have sought to corroborate, the 
sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	On the affidavit, Jordan said he listened to Ms. Lewinsky and  
suggested she talk to her private attorney. But Jordan asserted he 
had no reason to believe the affidavit was false because he never 
believed she had a sexual relationship with the president, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential confidant had testified last spring he never  
had breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky; the former intern testified last 
summer she had such a breakfast on Dec. 31, 1997, at a Washington 
hotel. She said she remembered it in part because at that time 
Jordan suggested she should destroy drafts of her love letters to 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr sent to Congress a  
receipt from the breakfast. Under questioning Tuesday by House 
prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, Jordan said his recollection had been 
refreshed since his earlier grand jury appearance and he conceded 
the breakfast likely occurred, according to several sources 
familiar with his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan remained adamant he never instructed or suggested  
that Ms. Lewinsky destroy any letters, the sources said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that Jordan 
had told her to ``go home and make sure they're not there.'' At the 
time, the letters were covered by a subpoena issued to Ms. Lewinsky 
in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan deposition at the Capitol was conducted in a secure  
room usually reserved for intelligence briefings. The session gave 
House prosecutors an opportuntity to question Jordan about facts 
that emerged from testimony Ms. Lewinsky gave last summer after 
Jordan had completed his own appearances before a federal grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers asked only two questions at the end of the  
session, which last about three hours, the sources said. 
Presidential lawyers had asked no questions of Ms. Lewinsky a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The same sources said Jordan made clear in his latest testimony  
that the president was behind his efforts to find a job in New York 
for Ms. Lewinsky and that he gave it attention because he did not 
want to disappoint Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan's name first surfaced in the Lewinsky controversy,  
he issued a statement in January 1998 saying he conducted the job 
search at the behest of Oval Office secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first grand jury appearance, in March, Jordan stuck to  
his account about Mrs. Currie. But in later appearances, he 
conceded that ``I do believe that'' the president told Mrs. Currie 
to ask for the job help and that Clinton ``knew that I had gotten 
her a job, he knew that I had gotten her a lawyer. ... He was 
interested in this matter. He is the source of it coming to my 
attention in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are hoping such evolutions or changes in  
testimony will bolster their case as they make one last-ditch 
effort to persuade senators to call witnesses for live testimony in 
the well of the Senate before the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be our intention to request live witnesses,'' said  
head prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., but none beyond the three who 
are providing depositions. White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will 
be questioned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said the Lewinsky and Jordan testimony had ``strengthened  
some points'' of the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators got their first chance Tuesday to see Ms. Lewinsky's  
videotaped testimony at four closed Capitol sites and came away 
suggesting there was little or nothing new, seemingly dimming the 
chance that she will be called to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new. If there  
in fact is nothing new, I would not expect her to be called'' to 
testify in person, said Robert Bennett, a Republican from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	And Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Republican leadership,  
responded ``probably not'' when asked whether there was anything to 
be gained in calling Ms. Lewinsky to appear before the Senate after 
the trial resumes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate's 45 Democrats oppose live testimony, as expected,  
only six Republicans would have to join them to move the trial 
toward beginning closing arguments as early as this weekend. The 
goal of both parties is to vote on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges by Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator who viewed the Lewinsky videotape, Orrin  
Hatch of Utah, said he believed it would be helpful to have her 
testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far better for the public to meet her and make up their  
own minds,'' Hatch said. ``Personally, I found her to be young, 
vulnerable and credible. I think she'd make a very effective 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Bayh, D-Ind., after watching the tape, suggested the  
decision on whether to call her to testify wasn't a major issue. 
``It won't rank among the great constitutional struggles in the 
history of our country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, senators and the White House were talking about a  
Republican proposal to allow some sort of trial statement that 
would declare Clinton had done wrong but would not remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	That found no favor among the Clinton defenders. Such a  
``finding of facts,'' said White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart, ``violates directly the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said such a statement or a censure resolution, which  
would need only a simple majority, should be separate from the 
trial -- which should end with a vote requiring a two-thirds 
majority for conviction. Democrats have demonstrated in several 
votes that they have the strength to keep the Republicans well 
short of the 67 votes needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who made an unsuccessful motion to  
dismiss the trial earlier, told CNN on Tuesday that ``there's no 
question about (Clinton) having given false testimony under oath 
and he did that more than once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the senior Senate Democrat said he would not vote to  
convict because he doesn't believe Clinton should be removed from 
office.

<HEADLINE> Broncos, Fans Hold Rally in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- At the end of a day, a distinct chant emerged from  
the din made by the throng of fans who came to see the NFL 
champions come home: ``One more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd at Monday's parade and rally for the Denver Broncos  
voiced a collective plea to quarterback John Elway, asking him to 
play for one more year before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	And behind that hope was a hunger for an unprecedented third  
consecutive Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come back because he wants to be the only quarterback  
to three-peat,'' Cindy Unrein Chengery, a season ticket holder like 
her parents before her, said of Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Elway's teammates had said they expect him to retire,  
but that was before Sunday night's 34-19 victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons. Elway was named the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the crowd after doing a little dance to Billy Idol's  
``Rebel Yell'' when he was introduced, Elway gave the fans a spark 
of hope that he could be back for more -- but no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``That three-peat does sound interesting,'' Elway said. ``But  
we'll talk about that, but right now we're going to enjoy this win 
we had last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Coach Mike Shanahan, who usually avoids putting any public  
pressure on his quarterback, urged Elway to stay, saying ``One more 
time for Elway'' and starting a crowd chant of ``One More Year, One 
More Year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway would say nothing more about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought last year was great, this year was even better,''  
the quarterback said. ``As I said two weeks ago, I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's exuberant festivities were in direct contrast with  
Sunday night's violent post-Super Bowl celebrations, which resulted 
in at least 20 arrests and dozens treated for tear gas exposure. 
Property damage was estimated at $160,000 after the crowd turned 
over trash cans and cars, broke windows and set off bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could have been a lot worse,'' Andrew Hudson, a  
spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb, said Monday. ``I think if 
police had not done as well in organizing their efforts, a lot more 
people would have gotten hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's parade and rally wasn't all about Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just Elway anymore. We have a whole team now,''  
Chengery said. ``Terrell Davis, Bill Romanowski, Rod Smith ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were filled with pride for the whole team.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't call them the donkeys anymore,'' said Fran Cronin,  
40, a Denver native and lifelong Broncos fan who watched her team 
lose four Super Bowls before finally winning two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos initially said they wanted only a rally because nine  
players needed to get to Honolulu for the Pro Bowl by Tuesday. But 
fans and Mayor Webb convinced the team to hold a parade, saying 
they should show some gratitude to the city that voted last 
November to give them a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos traveled down Broadway on fire trucks and in buses,  
starting downtown and continuing about a mile to Civic Center Park 
for the rally. Police and a spokesman for the mayor estimated the 
crowd size at 375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were small children, some doing their best imitation of  
running back Davis, whose jersey they wore, as they zigged and 
zagged to get away from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	So many thousands of people crowded into the 16th Street Mall  
that shuttle buses had to stop running. The city took on an almost 
medieval air with hawkers selling every kind of Bronco 
paraphernalia, and others offering to paint fans' faces blue and 
orange for $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd sat for several hours or more -- with a strong  
north wind dropping the wind chill into the 20s -- to hear their 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to say that this year I think is a little bit  
more special than last year,'' Davis told the crowd. ``I think the 
road to getting back here was a little tougher. But my teammates 
and I, we got together ... and we got another one, baby. Thanks a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parade route was much shorter than last year, when 650,000  
people turned out to celebrate the end of Denver's 37 years in 
football's wilderness. That rally was held several days after the 
Super Bowl on a sunny day when temperatures hit 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had gone to the Super Bowl four times, losing by large  
margins in all of them, and after their first victory they drew 
nearly twice as many to their parade as had gathered to see Pope 
John Paul II celebrate mass in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans, their hearts broken so often, took to calling them  
the ``Donkeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was the quarterback in the last three losses. Last year,  
he became the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, in a 31-24 
victory over Green Bay, at age 37, in his 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to say that after 14 years I thought it could get  
better, 15 it was great, and after 16 to win two in a row, it's 
been unbelievable,'' Elway told the crowd. ``And we all up here owe 
you a bunch because without you it's not all possible. So we up 
here thank you.''

<HEADLINE> Polo Ralph Lauren Closing 9 Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. is closing nine stores  
and cutting about 250 jobs in an effort to slash expenses and boost 
its sluggish profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The fashion house announced the reorganization today while  
reporting a 13.5 percent drop in profits for its fiscal third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts represent about 4 percent of Polo's 5,800-person  
work force. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough year for Polo, one of the best-known brands in  
the world of fashion today. Its merchandise is found in the most 
upscale country clubs and corporate boardrooms as well as on the 
streets of urban centers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	While expenses have risen, Polo has been hit by a sharp sales  
decline at the nation's outlet centers, where it operates about 89 
stores. In addition, business at department stores, where Polo 
sells much of its merchandise, has been less than stellar. 
</P>
<P>
	Polo reported today it earned $25.4 million, or 25 cents per  
share, in the three months ended Dec. 26, down from $29.3 million, 
or 29 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue 
rose 9.6 percent to $447.5 million from $408.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While the latest quarter's profits matched analysts'  
expectations, Polo's troubles have come as somewhat of a surprise 
to Wall Street. Analysts expected its financial health to largely 
go the way of its fashions -- classic designs that weathered 
ever-changing trends. 
</P>
<P>
	But Polo never became the darling of investors. Like other  
Seventh Avenue giants -- Donna Karan and Guess -- its performance 
fell short of investors' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outlet sales are slowing. Men's wear sales are slowing.  
Women's sales are slowing,'' said Jennifer Secallus, an analyst at 
Atlantis Research in Parsippany, N.J. ``Polo is a great brand, but 
I don't think the growth is really there for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Polo said today that outlet, men's and women's sales all  
increased in the third-quarter compared to year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement provided details for Polo's previously  
announced plans to cut costs. After reporting lower-than-expected 
second-quarter earnings in November, New York-based Polo said it 
would implement moves to save $10 million to $15 million in its 
fiscal year 2000, which begins April 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for the company's fourth quarter ending April 3 will be  
reduced by $65 million before taxes to pay for the restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Study Delves Into Cervical Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A large study of Canadian women says very few  
cases of mild cervical abnormalities detected by Pap smears 
progress to cervical cancer, a finding that may affect how women 
with the condition are treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 million women in the United States get a Pap smear every  
year, a simple test that can detect precancerous cell changes 
before they turn into cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paps detect mild abnormalities, called ``mild dysplasia,'' as  
well as severe lesions that are poised to become cancerous 
imminently. Regardless of the degree of dysplasia, women often are 
referred for more in-depth testing called colposcopy, or even a 
biopsy. But doctors have questioned how necessary the extra -- and 
expensive -- care is for women whose dysplasia is mild. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Toronto study published in this week's Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute concluded the risk of mild 
dysplasia progressing into more severe abnormalities or cancer was 
only 1 percent per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study should put to rest the widespread fear that women  
with mild dysplasia need immediate referral'' for in-depth care, 
instead of just monitoring with repeat Pap smears, University of 
Washington epidemiologist Cathy Critchlow concluded in an 
accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian study examined the records of almost 18,000 women  
diagnosed with dysplasia between 1970 and 1980, and tracked their 
health through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after the initial diagnosis, 29 percent of women with  
mild dysplasia were the same or had worsened. In contrast, women 
with moderate or severe dysplasia were 2.5 times to 4.2 times more 
likely to have progressed to worse dysplasia or cancer, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	During 10 years, over 60 percent of the women with mild  
dysplasia had their abnormal cells revert to normal, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Better understanding of how precancerous lesions progress is  
important as new technologies, like a next-generation Pap and 
computerized Pap screenings, make cervical testing even more 
sensitive, Critchlow wrote.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Chief Zings IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The U.S. anti-drug chief tore into  
the IOC today, saying its legitimacy has been damaged by ``alleged 
corruption, lack of accountability and the failure of leadership'' 
in the Olympics bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``These events have tarnished the credibility of the movement,''  
Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National 
Drug Control Policy, told the opening of an anti-doping conference. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey and European government officials demanded that a  
proposed anti-doping agency be kept out the control of the 
scandal-tainted IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	German Interior Minister Otto Schily suggested that Juan Antonio  
Samaranch quit as president of the International Olympic Committee 
and called the organization a harmful ``constitutional monarchy in 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schily, in an apparent reference to Samaranch, said on German  
television, ``everyone must know when it's time to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's plan to develop uniform drug-related sanctions for all  
Olympic federations suffered another setback, as even one IOC 
executive committee member saying that such a system would not 
stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening address to the three-day conference, Samaranch  
called for a new drive to wipe out ``this odious and unhealthy form 
of cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he could not avoid the focus of attention being turned on  
the corruption scandals, which have plunged the IOC into the worst 
crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled for receiving  
cash payments, gifts and other favors stemming from Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. But representatives 
of several governments said the core of the IOC's credibility had 
been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey urged the IOC ``to consider institutional reform, open  
books and financial records.'' He called for ``an elected 
membership that is accountable and responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British sports minister was equally blunt.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their internal system of organization and election must be  
based on democracy, accountability and honesty,'' Tony Banks said. 
``The British government expects the IOC to clean up its act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government officials repeatedly said the proposed  
anti-doping agency must be fully independent and not controlled by 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the agency should be ``autonomous.'' Over the  
weekend, he proposed that the Olympic drug chief Prince Alexandre 
de Merode head the agency on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe the IOC should be that agency. The issue of  
doping goes beyond the IOC,'' said Banks, who suggested the body be 
created under the aegis of the United Nations or World Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	On the controversial issue of drug sanctions, proposals of an  
IOC working group to streamline drug policies around the globe 
already ran into obstacles and a plethora of different views were 
put forward at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the objections and reservations of several  
international federations, IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge 
also came out against a uniform agreement binding all federations 
to abide by a unified medical code. The IOC proposal includes a 
minimum two-year suspension for serious doping offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be reasonable. This is not a debate in black and  
white,'' said Rogge. ``You cannot compare athletes. Some careers 
span eight years, some span 20 years. Sanctions have to be adapted 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In case of an imposed uniform code, ``civil courts would never  
accept this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel proposed that athletes face lifetime suspensions  
and fines of up to $1 million for serious cases of ``intentional 
doping'' and suggested selective bans for some first-time 
offenders. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stay Requested in Columbia/HCA Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a judge on  
Tuesday to stay its civil lawsuit against the nation's largest 
private hospital chain, saying the case could hurt the government's 
criminal investigation into the chain's billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil lawsuit is separate from a wide-ranging federal fraud  
investigation targeting Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. Investigators 
are looking into whether Columbia overbilled government health care 
programs. Four Columbia executives charged with conspiring to 
defraud the government of $2.8 million have pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion, filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, also says the  
government is in settlement negotiations with Columbia/HCA. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to stay came shortly after the government filed an  
amended civil complaint detailing Medicare fraud allegations 
against Columbia/HCA and another hospital group. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Nashville, Tenn.-based company did not  
immediately return a call for comment Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The amended complaint filed Tuesday alleges Columbia's hospitals  
and those owned by Brentwood, Tenn.-based Quorom Health Group Inc. 
routinely submitted false documents to Medicare, Medicaid and 
CHAMPUS, an insurance program for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation also was made in a whistleblower lawsuit the  
Justice Department joined last year. However, the new complaint 
accuses the hospital groups of falsifying claims in every report 
submitted since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Quorom has asked to be severed from the civil case against  
Columbia/HCA, but the Justice Department said Tuesday that attempts 
to settle the case with Quorom have failed.

	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit  
filed by a man who accused his girlfriend of breaking a promise by 
getting pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Trade Caps Padres' Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Kevin Brown took his hired gun and left town  
for a staggering $105 million. Steve Finley and Ken Caminiti got 
more money elsewhere. Joey Hamilton found the satisfaction of a 
multiyear deal in the other league. 
</P>
<P>
	And Greg Vaughn?  
</P>
<P>
	Like the 50 homers he hit last year, he's outta here.  
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in a five-player deal  
Tuesday, a startling conclusion to the retooling of the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months ago the Padres were in the midst of a stirring  
playoff run that got them to the World Series. Their fans threw a 
love fest even though they were swept by the New York Yankees, then 
overwhelmingly approved a new downtown ballpark, which management 
said was necessary to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are three seasons to play before the Padres can start  
tapping the money streams from that ballpark, and three position 
players and two starting pitchers from the NL championship team are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this should in any way, shape or form be  
considered a fire sale,'' said general manager Kevin Towers, who 
dealt popular players Vaughn and Mark Sweeney, a left-handed 
hitting utility player, for injury-prone outfielder Reggie Sanders, 
utility infielder Damian Jackson and minor league pitcher Josh 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've been trying to do, and we've been saying this all  
along, is get younger,'' Towers said. ``We're trying to add some 
youth to the ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres, who also gain speed, are moving the 33-year-old  
Vaughn at the height of his trade value, Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the Padres' star power has become startlingly thin.  
Callers to talk radio shows were comparing it to a fire sale, like 
the one the Padres had in 1992-93 and the Florida Marlins had after 
winning the World Series in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Larry Lucchino bristled at such suggestions,  
saying the Padres will go into next season with a payroll of 
roughly $45 million, or the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fire sale goes down to $10 million or $12 million,''  
Lucchino said. ``We're not even reducing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vaughn deal, like the loss of Brown, Finley and Caminiti via  
free agency, has serious salary overtones. While other teams spend 
lavishly, the Padres, who play in a small broadcast market, 
obviously are retrenching after claiming to have lost $50 million 
since John Moores and Lucchino bought the team in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, due to make $5.75 million this year, will be eligible  
for free agency after 1999. If he has a season that approaches his 
remarkable comeback year of 1998, when he set the club record with 
50 homers and had a career-high 119 RBIs, his salary likely would 
increase dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders will make $3.7 million this year, and the Padres have an  
option for 2000, also at $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That salary fits in very well to the structure of all our  
other players, so we can stay competitively balanced throughout our 
25-man roster,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Padres got rid of their best power hitter for Sanders,  
who they think can hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases, although he 
hasn't come close since hitting 28 homers and stealing 36 bases in 
1995. Sanders, who's split time between center and right field, 
told reporters he's never played left field, where he's slated to 
take over for Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the Padres organization say privately that they don't  
think Vaughn would have duplicated his 1998 numbers had he stayed 
in San Diego, partly because he won't have the same protection in 
the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although outfielder Ruben Rivera has power potential, San  
Diego's leading returning home run hitter is now Tony Gwynn, who 
had 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer and fall, the Padres told the voters they needed a  
new ballpark to remain competitive, particularly in their quest to 
keep free agents Brown, Finley, Caminiti, Wally Joyner and Carlos 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	They got the ballpark, but succeeded in keeping only Joyner and  
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucchino said Tuesday that the ballpark push wasn't necessarily  
to keep specific free agents, but to save big league baseball in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``To that extent, people who voted `yes' got exactly what they  
wanted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Vaughn said that even the players felt misled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone I talked to was a little disappointed in the fact  
that all we were told is, if we got the stadium, we could be kept 
together to compete, be right there,'' he said. ``Then all of a 
sudden now, it's like it's a whole new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One caller to XTRA radio said: ``We gave you your stadium, don't  
give us a bad team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Padres given Brown, Finley and Caminiti the same money  
they got elsewhere, they'd be paying them a combined $19.75 million 
in salary in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you are a small to middle market, it's often  
difficult to chase the market and meet the market,'' Towers said. 
``To stay competitive, you've got to distribute the dollars around. 
If you put it all into one guy or two guys, you're going to have a 
hard time staying competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are still trying to dump reliever Randy Myers, who  
was ineffective after his midseason acquisition and is due $6 
million this year.

<HEADLINE> NY Transit Agency Studies Napping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The transit agency is considering whether a  
staple of kindergarten -- nap time -- is the answer to reducing 
fatigue among train and bus operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a joke. This is not about building in nap time,''  
Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Tom Kelly said 
Tuesday. ``You are not going to be walking into a crew room and 
finding everyone sound asleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, however, has not ruled out naps on the job, though  
they would be allowed only during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The MTA oversees the city's subway and bus systems, Metro-North  
Railroad, the Long Island Rail Road and numerous bridges and 
tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency says there is no evidence that fatigue is responsible  
for a disproportionate number of accidents. Instead, it says the 
move is part of a larger mandate to improve safety among agency 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	MTA officials are searching for sleep consultants to review its  
work practices. The key element of any plan, officials say, is to 
launch a public awareness campaign among employees that fatigue 
problems can be reduced only by adequate sleep and consistent work 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the possibility of MTA-sanctioned ``power napping'' during  
employee breaks and other downtime that has grabbed the attention 
of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for a train at a subway station in midtown Manhattan,  
43-year-old Mike Rodriguez said: ``The jerky way these guys drive 
trains, skip stops, do whatever they please, you'd think sleeping 
was already an option.''

<HEADLINE> Payton Treated for Medical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- NFL great Walter Payton is receiving treatment  
for an unspecified medical condition that is not life-threatening, 
his brother said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of the 44-year-old Hall of Famer has been in question  
since he appeared gaunt at his son Jarrett's news conference last 
week to announce he would play football for the University of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, the NFL's career rushing leader, had lost a great deal  
of weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Payton, the golf coach at Jackson State, did not want to  
say what was wrong with his brother until an afternoon news 
conference. He did say, however, that it is ``nothing that he's 
contracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he called the news conference is because he wanted  
to get the right information out. All the rumors that (it) could 
possibly be, it's not,'' Eddie Payton said. ``It's something that's 
not immediately life-threatening and he wouldn't mind talking about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if someone had asked Payton what was wrong, he probably  
would have told them, Eddie Payton said. Instead, people talked 
among themselves and the rumors spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time someone loses a little weight, people think the  
worst. It's not the worst,'' Eddie Payton said. ``He's getting 
treatment for it and he'll recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Payton talked with his brother Sunday night, and said  
Payton and his family are upbeat. His brother is getting the best 
medical treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, the Chicago Bears' first-round draft pick in 1975, holds  
the NFL rushing record with 16,726 yards. He was named to the Pro 
Bowl nine times in his 13-year career, and was inducted into the 
Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. He was placed on the NFL's 75th 
Anniversary All-Time team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the team after the 1987 season, but remains a  
member of the Bears board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jackson State, Payton set nine school records, was a two-time  
All-American and held the NCAA record for points with 464. In 1987, 
the Division I-AA MVP trophy was named for him.

<HEADLINE> The Return of Hollywood Squares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Hollywood Squares'' is tick-tack-toe with a  
wardrobe budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It's nine Skinner boxes with celebrities inside. When the stars  
are fed a question, they respond by showing off. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a shopworn exercise with delusions of grandeur. Just get a  
load of the opening visual: a computer-generated gala sprawled 
across Hollywood, with acres of revelers plus searchlights, 
confetti and helicopters hovering above a giant game board. This 
would dwarf Mardi Gras and the pyramids of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Oversold? Never mind. With ``Hollywood Squares,'' disinformation  
is the stock in trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A trivia question posed by host Tom Bergeron (``What's the  
happiest place on earth?'') will trigger a jokey comeback from the 
occupant of the chosen square (``It's the proving ground for 
Viagra''). 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when the swells of laughter subside, the celebrity will  
tender the official answer (Disneyland). But is this the truth or a 
bluff? That's what Contestant X or O must correctly judge to claim 
that square. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the biggest bluff by these celebrities is their own  
conviviality, as if their ``Squares'' appearance were only for fun. 
</P>
<P>
	As the show wears on, you can imagine each of them -- whether  
Jenna Elfman, Estelle Getty, Coolio, a pair of Baldwin brothers, or 
some celebrity you'd never seen or heard of before -- reminding 
themselves why they came: to gain a wider audience, to promote a 
current project, or maybe just to savor a pause in an inexorable 
plunge back to obscurity. No, this is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiering last fall, the current ``Hollywood Squares'' revives  
what in 1966 began a 14-year run with chipmunk-faced Peter Marshall 
playing host to personalities like Rose Marie, Wally Cox and Paul 
Lynde. 
</P>
<P>
	But the corny charm of the original -- with its $1.50 daytime-TV  
look and its gang of has-beens on their last roundup -- is absent in 
this early evening '90s rehash. (Check local listings for station 
and time.) 
</P>
<P>
	Now everything is too glitzy, too self-aware, too exaggerated.  
(In the cavernous studio, Bergeron and the contestants are poised 
on a riser so high it looks like they're expecting a flash flood.) 
In short, too Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing, however, hasn't changed. It's still fun to see how  
dumb certain contestants can be. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Laura (who is O) picks the square inhabited by  
Bronson Pinchot, to whom Bergeron directs this question: ``If you 
combine boric acid and silicone oil, what do you get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pamela Anderson's breasts,'' Bronson Pinchot quips. But,  
seriously, folks: ``Bleach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura agrees. Uh-oh. ``You get Silly Putty,'' Bergeron  
discloses. X gets the square. 
</P>
<P>
	Next turn, Laura picks the square with Katsy Chappell, for whom  
the most obvious question might be, ``Who's that?'' Instead, 
Bergeron asks, ``What famous brothers are named Leonard, Julius, 
Herbert and Adolph?'' 
</P>
<P>
	To this, Katsy Chappell answers: ``The Brothers Karamazov.''  
Laura agrees. Oops. Turns out these are the real names of the Marx 
Brothers. X gets the square. 
</P>
<P>
	For Laura and any alert viewers, there's a valuable lesson here:  
Don't place your faith in celebrities; star worship can lead you 
astray. But that's not the only principle at work on ``Hollywood 
Squares'' in its current incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's how we play our game,'' Bergeron began one recent  
edition. ``First of all, we don't alienate the center square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center square, of course, is the permanent address of Whoopi  
Goldberg, and it's Whoopi who rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Come what may.  
</P>
<P>
	Question: Two male fish give birth to their young. One is the  
pipefish. What is the other? Whoopi: ``The blowfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Question: How is the speed of a boat measured? Whoopi: ``By the  
number of barf bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As glib as she is tacky, she holds sway in the center square  
with the sense of entitlement befitting an executive producer of 
the show, as well as its designated star. (Host Bergeron is only 
second-billed.) 
</P>
<P>
	Even as contestants choose other squares and their resident  
celebrities, viewers get frequent reaction shots of Whoopi. Just to 
stay current on how she's doing. Whose importance, as you are 
forever reminded, surpasses all else. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Luke Perry is asked, ``What powerful underworld figure did  
both Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro play?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Chewbacca,'' cracks Luke Perry.  
</P>
<P>
	One, two, three. From an audience so jazzed it would laugh at a  
10-car pileup ... dead silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ho-kay,'' sighs Whoopi, not to be bothered.  
</P>
<P>
	You lose. ``Squares'' gets the X.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...

	`48 HOURS': ``My Daughter's Killer'' profiles Paula Kurland,  
whose daughter Mitzi was murdered in 1986. For that murder, 
Jonathan Nobles was arrested and sentenced to death. Then, for 12 
years, Kurland sought to purge herself of the hatred she felt for 
Nobles by confronting him -- in person -- with her rage and pain. But 
he always refused to meet with her. Two weeks before his execution, 
however, he finally consented. ``48 Hours'' cameras captured the 
remarkable meeting. Reported by correspondent Bill Lagattuta, it

<HEADLINE> Report: Olympic Booster Pushed Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A top Olympics booster pressured his copper  
mining company's suppliers to donate money to Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 1998 Winter Games, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the former president and chief executive officer  
of Kennecott Corp. in Salt Lake, urged business associates to 
contribute to the bid and targeted companies that spurned him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that Joklik, who later led the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Games, got 12 of 
Kennecott's suppliers -- including Caterpillar Inc., Ingersoll-Rand 
Co. and Bechtel Co. -- to contribute to the unsuccessful bid for the 
1998 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, two weeks after Salt Lake lost the 1998 Games to  
Nagano, Japan, Joklik took aim at the companies that did not donate 
to the bid, including Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. and Denver &AMP; Rio 
Grande Western Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of people we do business with gave generously to the  
Olympic bid at our request,'' Joklik wrote in a two-page memo on 
Kennecott letterhead to eight of his senior managers. ``A number of 
companies turned us down. All other things being equal, bids by 
these companies should be declined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the companies that made donations, Joklik instructed the  
managers: ``In your future purchases of equipment and services, I 
would ask you, all other things being equal, to give preferences to 
these companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, 70, who resigned Jan. 8 as president of the Salt Lake  
organizers amid the bribery scandal that has rocked the 2002 Games, 
told the Journal the signed memo was not an attempt to discriminate 
against companies that didn't help with the 1998 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Bernhisel, Kennecott's former vice president of finance and  
law, said Joklik took the loss of the 1998 Games personally. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik ``was putting a lot of his personal time into fund  
raising, and he got mad and said, `Damn it, you've got to help your 
friends,''' Bernhisel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC today cleared Sydney of any wrongdoing in connection  
with financial inducements offered on the eve of Sydney's selection 
as host of the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was legal, legitimate and according to the rules,'' said  
Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive board member with oversight over 
the 2000 Games. ``There is absolutely no problem in the way it was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympics chief John Coates disclosed 10 days ago that  
he had offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members 
the night before the 1993 vote on the 2000 host city. Sydney beat 
Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Washington Post reported today that an ethics panel  
investigating the bribery scandal plans to disclose that knowledge 
of payments to IOC members was confined to a small number of bid 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing an unidentified source, said investigators  
found that Tom Welch, the former bid committee president, and Dave 
Johnson, the former vice president, acted nearly independently in 
many instances involving IOC members. Craig Peterson, a vice 
president of administration who signed bid committee checks, and 
Stephanie Pate, Welch's secretary, also are believed to have had 
access to the bid committee's inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some of the investigators believe high-ranking bid  
committee members might have attempted to conceal their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mitt Romney, a former Republican Senate hopeful from  
Massachusetts, is in the running to replace Joklik as head of the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, The Salt Lake Tribune quoted 
unidentified sources as saying. Romney is the son of Utah native 
and former Michigan Gov. George Romney and was president of a 
Mormon group of congregations in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times identified a second relative of an IOC  
member who was employed by First Security Bank of Utah. It said a 
son of Lamine Keita of Mali was offered a summer job in 1995. A son 
of Mongolian IOC member Shagdarja Magwan also worked for the bank 
prior to 1995, when Salt Lake secured the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Nelson, who was president of the bank at the time, told  
The Tribune that he hired the pair after they were referred to him 
by the bid committee. He said Spencer Eccles, chairman and CEO of 
First Security Corp., was unaware of the hires until after they 
were made. Eccles was a member of the bid committee board and is on 
the SLOC board.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Regrets Antichrist Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell apologized  
Tuesday for saying last month that the Antichrist is a Jewish man 
who probably is alive today. 
</P>
<P>
	During an unscheduled appearance at the 18th International  
Christian Prayer Breakfast, Falwell said he ``should have known 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to my Jewish friends here and around the world and  
I apologize to the Christians here for having created any kind of 
rift,'' Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast was billed as a prayer for peace in Jerusalem and  
honored several Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize not for what I believe, but for my lack of tact  
and judgment in making a statement that served no purpose 
whatsoever,'' Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bible, the Antichrist will spread universal  
evil before the end of the world but will be finally conquered at 
the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 14, Falwell told a conference on evangelism that he  
believes the Second Coming probably will occur within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Antichrist, ``if he's going to be the counterfeit of  
Christ, he has to be Jewish,'' Falwell said. ``The only thing we 
know is he must be male and Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell is the chancellor of Liberty University in Lynchburg,  
Va., and founder of the now-defunct Moral Majority.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Murderer Captured in Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATURVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A murderer who police say dressed as  
a guard and got a correctional officer to escort him out of a state 
prison during a shift change over the weekend was captured Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Britt, 25, was arrested about 15 miles from the South  
Central Correctional Facility from which he fled Saturday. He was 
taken to a county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	A resident spotted Britt hiding behind a barn, was suspicious  
and called authorities, said David Maness, chief deputy for the 
Decatur County Sheriff's Department. Britt ran into woods when a 
deputy drove up, but gave up before he got far. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked kind of scruffy, like he'd been toughing it out in  
the woods or something,'' Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine McClain, 41, a guard at the prison operated by  
Corrections Corporation of America, was arrested on a felony charge 
of aiding an escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Britt pleaded guilty in 1990 to killing Kenny Oakley, the  
husband of a teacher's aide with whom Britt began an affair when he 
was 15. He was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.

<HEADLINE> Ford Fire Slows Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. scrambled to bring in  
generators Tuesday and get its River Rouge complex back in 
operation after a deadly explosion halted work there and slowed 
production at other Ford plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	River Rouge contains a Mustang assembly plant as well as parts  
factories that make such things as engines, doors, hoods and glass. 
If production doesn't resume quickly, work will be slowed at 16 of 
the No. 2 automaker's 20 North America assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion at a power station Monday killed one person.  
Fifteen other workers remained in critical condition Tuesday. The 
cause of the blast was under investigation, but authorities 
suspected a boiler explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 10,000 workers at River Rouge awaited word on when  
they could return to work. Ford assembly plants in several other 
cities were also asked to scale back production. 
</P>
<P>
	River Rouge manager Art Janes wouldn't speculate on when  
production at the complex might resume. ``I just can't tell you 
until we push the button and see if it works,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to get at least part of the complex restarted, Ford  
hauled in six generators at its key stamping plant and four at its 
engine plant. 
</P>
<P>
	An automotive analyst said Ford, like other automakers, has a  
contingency plan to get parts from outside suppliers. That could 
minimize the production slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I foresee really no impact on Ford's earnings,'' said Richard  
Hilgert of First of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the explosion's effects were becoming more evident  
at Ford production sites elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford cut the eight-hour shifts to four hours at its suburban  
Detroit plant in Wayne, where Escorts are built; at the Wixom 
plant, where the Town Car and Lincoln Continental are made; and at 
its assembly plant at Lorain, Ohio, where Ford Econoline vans are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other plants -- in Kansas City, Mo., Norfolk, Va., and  
Oakville, Ontario -- that largely make Ford F-150 series trucks also 
were ordered to halt overtime shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre River Rouge complex was once the world's largest  
auto plant. Henry Ford built it in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in  
Dearborn, about seven miles west of Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Feds Give $3B for Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Agency for International Development  
said Tuesday it has provided more than $3 billion over the past 
five years to family planning and reproductive health programs in 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistance is part of a 20-year Program of Action agreed to  
by 180 nations at the 1994 International Conference on Population 
and Development in Cairo, Egypt. The program is designed to achieve 
gender equity, improve reproductive health and stabilize population 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	AID's report was released in an advance of a follow-up  
population conference that will open in The Hague, Netherlands, 
next Monday. The federal agency is the largest government donor of 
population and reproductive health assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs the foreign aid agency supports include expanding  
the choice of contraceptive methods, promoting improved quality 
care in family planning and reproductive health services, providing 
emergency treatment for the complications of unsafe abortions and 
developing new approaches to prevent and manage HIV/AIDS and other 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Duff Gillespie, deputy assistant administrator for population,  
health and nutrition at AID, said the most important achievement 
since the Cairo conference has been a shift in the way AID and the 
international health community view population. 
</P>
<P>
	``This different view ... looks at population not simply in  
terms of births, of deaths, of migrations which has been the 
traditional way of looking at it but as a much more complex 
relationship that entails all aspects of reproductive health,'' 
said Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of that shift, many of AID's programs have evolved  
into a much broader focus, said Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, rather than looking just at family planning  
services the agency now also looks at other aspects of reproductive 
health, such things as sexually transmitted disease and the 
nutrition status of women and children, said Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation to the conference will include  
representatives from AID, the State Department, the Department of 
Health and Human Services and four nongovernment organizations. 
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will deliver the keynote address 
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed at Phoenix Open Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Although an armed man was wrestled to the ground  
within yards of Tiger Woods, investigators don't believe he was 
stalking the PGA superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just let poor sense get the best of him,''  
Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said Monday. ``He got a little 
mouthy, was told to calm down and he didn't heed the officer's 
warnings,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dirren said the Maricopa County attorney's office would be asked  
to review charges of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct 
against Brian K. Murphy, 40, of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was detained briefly in the Scottsdale city jail after he  
was cited Sunday, then was released without bond. In order to face 
the charges, he must be indicted or be formally charged by county 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the county attorney's office,  
said the process would take several days because cases involving 
jailed defendants must be handled before others. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy did not return messages left on the answering machine at  
his listed telephone number, and FitzGerald was unable to say 
whether Murphy had retained an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the incident, general chairman Ray Artigue said,  
the tournament will post signs prohibiting guns in the future. 
Anyone ignoring the sign could be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault count stems from an altercation between Murphy and  
officer Rob Rucker, part of a police detail assigned to shadow 
Woods. Officers on the course wore modified uniforms to blend with 
the crowd but had their mace and service pistols in plain view on 
their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, Murphy had followed the final threesome  
for several holes and kept yelling Woods' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the fan to be quiet, and he said, `I've got a gun,  
too,' and squared off on me,'' Rucker told The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	After the two began grappling, they fell over a rope around the  
tee, and Murphy pulled Rucker's jacket over his head. Another 
officer and a spectator joined in, pinning the burly Murphy to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found a loaded semiautomatic handgun in a backpack,  
Dirren said. Murphy later produced a permit, issued through the 
state Department of Public Safety, that allows him to carry a 
concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirren said Murphy was released because, although the assault  
charge is a felony, authorities considered it a minor incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, these charges didn't warrant him being held  
before a judge,'' Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods, a 23-year-old sensation who finished third on his  
second trip to the tournament, was noncommittal on whether he would 
return to the TPC of Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said metal detectors might be useful at tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
	``Especially when you have this many people doing the things  
they're doing out there on a golf course, with all the (alcohol) 
consumption,'' Woods said. ``People come out here not to watch 
golf. The majority come out here to have a good time.''

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Highlighting Budget Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used a forum with  
stressed-out working moms to highlight proposals in the president's 
$1.77 trillion budget that would help women balance work and family 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president unveiled a balanced budget that puts families  
first through a package of initiatives that will help parents 
struggling to meet their responsibilities to their jobs and even 
more important, to their families,'' the first lady told 300 people 
gathered Tuesday at a YMCA in New York City's gritty 
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In a round table discussion, Mrs. Clinton heard from women  
struggling to balance their jobs with caring for children or 
elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelina Charriez told Mrs. Clinton that her 67-year-old mother  
suffered from a mental ailment and could not take care for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We almost lost our home. We lost our car because we couldn't  
make the payments. I can't work full time and take care of my 
mother and my child,'' she said as she wiped tears from her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton put her hand on Mrs. Charriez's shoulder and  
promised to follow up with her and the other women who spoke during 
the panel discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to really confront this issue because  
people are living longer and longer,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget would invest $6.2 billion over five years  
-- including $5.5 billion to provide a $1,000 tax credit -- for 
families caring for disabled relatives, Mrs. Clinton said. The 
budget also includes a $250 tax credit for stay-at-home parents 
caring for a child under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Quinones, a 33-year-old single working mother, told Mrs.  
Clinton that she was unable to find child care for her 18-month-old 
toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of my income, I make too much money to qualify for  
subsidies and not enough money to pay for it myself,'' she said. 
The cheapest child care available cost $800 a month, Quinones said. 
As a result, she said, her baby stays with her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said Ms. Quinones' problem was not unique.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have these very arbitrary rules about who can qualify for  
subsidies,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``One of the hopes I have is that 
with the president's budget... you would be able to increase the 
limit of income to qualify (for child care subsidies).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's comment was met with a standing ovation in the  
gymnasium full of cheering mothers, many of whom brought their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending about an 1 1/2 hours with the mothers, at one point  
taking a moment to play with a crying 9-month-old baby, she headed 
for a Democratic National Committee dinner with her husband at 
Manhattan's posh Le Cirque restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Senators Review Lewinsky Deposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators got their first chance to see Monica  
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony Tuesday and came away underwhelmed, 
seemingly dimming the chance that she will be called for 
questioning in person on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	While the tapes were being played at four closed Capitol sites  
for senators and their aides -- printed transcripts were available 
as well -- House prosecutors were questioning presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan about his assistance for the onetime White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	But more of the talk at the Capitol was about Ms. Lewinsky, who  
had been questioned on tape a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new. If there  
in fact is nothing new, I would not expect her to be called'' to 
testify in person, said Robert Bennett, a Republican from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	And Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Republican leadership,  
responded ``probably not'' when asked whether there was anything to 
be gained in calling Ms. Lewinsky to appear before the Senate after 
the trial resumes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate's 45 Democrats oppose live testimony, as expected,  
only six Republicans would have to join them to move the trial 
toward beginning closing arguments as early as this weekend. The 
goal of both parties is to vote on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges by Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator who viewed the Lewinsky videotape, Orrin  
Hatch of Utah, said he believed it would be helpful to have her 
testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far better for the public to meet her and make up their  
own minds,'' Hatch said. ``Personally, I found her to be young, 
vulnerable and credible. I think she'd make a very effective 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the House prosecutors kept up their push.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be our intention to request live witnesses,'' said  
head prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., but none beyond the three 
providing depositions. Hyde said the Lewinsky and Jordan testimony 
had ``strengthened some points'' of the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Bayh, D-Ind., after watching the tape, suggested the  
decision on whether to call her to testify wasn't a major issue. 
``It won't rank among the great constitutional struggles in the 
history of our country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, while not expecting Ms. Lewinsky to be called in person,  
said that if all or portions of the videotape were shown ``in no 
way would it offend the sensibilities of the American people, nor 
would it offend the decorum of the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, senators and the White House were talking about a  
Republican proposal to allow some sort of trial statement that 
would declare Clinton had done wrong but would not remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	That found no favor among the Clinton defenders. Such a  
``finding of facts,'' said White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart, ``violates directly the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said such a statement or a censure resolution, which  
would need only a simple majority, should be separate from the 
trial -- which should end with a vote requiring a two-thirds 
majority for conviction. Democrats have demonstrated in several 
votes that they have the strength to keep the Republicans well 
short of the 67 votes needed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Capitol on Tuesday, four locations were set up as  
videotape screening rooms, and senators were given headsets to 
watch Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. Jordan's will be available starting 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must decide whether to call Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and  
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal -- whose deposition is Wednesday 
-- before the Senate and whether to make the videotapes publicly 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was questioned in a secure room, off-limits to the public  
and media, by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., for the House 
prosecutors. White House lawyers David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and 
Cheryl Mills were there for the president, but asked only a 
question or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said afterward that he was ``satisfied that we  
covered the areas that we needed to cover'' in the Jordan 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, one of Clinton's best friends, began a job search effort  
for Ms. Lewinsky -- an effort that House prosecutors contend was 
intensified after the former intern appeared on the witness list in 
the Paula Jones civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jordan was making that effort, he also found an attorney  
for Ms. Lewinsky and spoke with her about an affidavit she prepared 
that denied an affair with Clinton. The affidavit was false, 
although Jordan said he didn't know it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Jordan, there was no connection between the job  
search and the affidavit. In her previous testimony, Ms. Lewinsky 
said she was never promised a job for her silence, and testified 
she lied to her friend Linda Tripp when telling her that she held 
back signing the affidavit until the job search was successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who made an unsuccessful motion to  
dismiss the trial earlier, told CNN on Tuesday that ``there's no 
question about (Clinton) having given false testimony under oath 
and he did that more than once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the senior Senate Democrat said he would not vote to  
convict because he doesn't believe Clinton should be removed from 
office.

<HEADLINE> Kid Chimes In on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As punishment for bad behavior, Richard  
Anderson Jr.'s father would make him watch CNBC, a financial news 
station on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	He preferred cartoons, but now says he has no regrets because  
he's learned the value of saving and investing money early in life. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's only 6.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I am happy that my father punished me that way because  
now I know about the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks, mutual funds 
and my dad's favorite subject -- what makes a good company,'' 
Richard said Tuesday at a House subcommittee hearing on the Social 
Security system's effects on children. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a lesson he and his father want others to pick up on, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to retire, you must save and invest. If you don't,  
you might have to work all your life. No one wants that,'' added 
Richard, who rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange 
last April when he was 5, becoming the youngest person to do so. On 
request, he also recites an alphabetized list of the 30 corporate 
stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance before the House Ways and Means subcommittee that  
oversees Social Security also made Richard the youngest person to 
ever testify before Congress, said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., 
the panel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security needs to be shored up for the coming retirement  
of 76 million baby boomers. Congressional Republicans and President 
Clinton plan to set aside trillions of dollars from projected 
budget surpluses to save it, but have yet to agree on how. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has proposed that the government invest some of  
those funds in the stock market to try to increase them, but 
Republicans object on grounds that politics would inevitably 
corrupt free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard's father, Richard Anderson, also objects to government  
investing money on behalf of individuals. He said they need to 
learn to do it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis is upon us and only a concerted and committed  
effort to educate our nation, especially our youth, about saving 
and investing can avert a potential disaster,'' said Anderson, a 
certified financial planner and president of his own firm, Anderson 
Financial Services of Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	As a possible solution, he urged the panel to ``seriously  
consider making the introduction of saving and investment education 
a part of every school curriculum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Kramer, representing a nonprofit youth group called the 2030  
Center, testified that said she favors President Clinton's Social 
Security proposal but opposes plans that substitute Social Security 
for private investment accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to jeopardize our economic security with a  
risky and costly imitation of Social Security,'' Kramer, 24, said. 
``Now is the time to strengthen Social Security for our generation 
and for generations to come.''

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales Slide in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home purchases slipped slightly in  
December from the red-hot pace the month before but easily set a 
record for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of 978,000 in December, down 3.6 percent from a record 1.02 
million rate in November, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But, for the entire year, they bought 888,000 new homes, up 10.4  
percent from 1997 and the highest annual total since the department 
began tracking sales in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing home sales, tracked by the National Association of  
Realtors, also set a record in 1998 -- 4.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing -- and related purchases such as furniture and appliances  
-- have helped the American economy weather spillover from the 
global economic slump that has spread from Asia to Russia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have been supported by low mortgage rates -- averaging  
under 7 percent during the last half of 1998, the longest such 
stretch since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, jobs were plentiful and the nation's unemployment rate  
averaged 4.5 percent last year, a 29-year low. The stock market 
spurred some sales, especially vacation homes. With inflation low, 
wage gains gave many Americans increased purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Conference Board, a private research group,  
reported today in New York that its Index of Leading Economic 
Indicators rose 0.3 percent in December, signaling above-average 
economic growth in the months to come. The index rose from a 
revised level of 106.2 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	By region in 1998, new home sales jumped 5.1 percent to 82,000  
in the Northeast, 18.6 percent to 166,000 in the Midwest, and 9.4 
percent in both the South -- to 397,000 -- and the West -- to 244,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of a new home last year -- meaning half sold for  
more and half for less -- was $151,600, up 3.8 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tips To Avoid Credit Repair Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Advice from the Federal Trade Commission on how to avoid a  
credit repair scam. 
</P>
<P>
	If you decide to respond to a credit repair offer, beware of  
companies that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Want you to pay for credit repair services before any services  
are provided. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do not tell you your legal rights and what you can do for free.  
</P>
<P>
	--Recommend that you not contact a credit bureau directly.  
</P>
<P>
	--Suggest that you try to invent a ``new'' credit report by  
applying for an Employer Identification Number to use instead of 
your Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
	--Advise you to dispute all information in your credit report.  
</P>
<P>
	By law, credit repair organizations must:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Give you a copy of the ``Consumer Credit File Rights Under  
State and Federal Law'' before you sign a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Give you a written contract that spells out your rights and  
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Outline the payment terms for services, including their total  
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Provide a detailed description of the services to be performed  
and how long it will take to achieve the results. 
</P>
<P>
	A credit repair company may not:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make false claims about their services.  
</P>
<P>
	--Charge you until they have completed the promised services.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Perform any services until they have your signature on a  
written contract and have completed a three-day waiting period. 
During this time, you can cancel the contract without paying any 
fees.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Accused About Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic courtroom confrontation, the  
government today accused Microsoft Corp. of falsifying a video 
demonstration aimed at showing severe performance problems after 
government attempts to modify its popular Windows 98 software. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe from what I've seen here is, they filmed the wrong  
system,'' said James Allchin, a senior vice president and top 
computer scientist at Microsoft. He later added: ``I'm not sure 
they would do anything like that'' to mislead the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies stopped the video  
demonstration in midframe to show a subtle inconsistency: a 
software title bar that suddenly changes in the middle of the test. 
The video had been played in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies charged -- and Allchin acknowledged -- the change indicated  
that the test actually was completed using a version of Windows 
unaffected by the government's modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This video you brought in here and showed for the court, that  
you checked it ... and that's just wrong, right?'' Boies snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this particular case, I do not think the (government)  
program had been run,'' Allchin conceded. But he insisted that 
performance problems exist: ``I personally tested this, and I know 
the problem exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the courtroom where the government's antitrust suit  
against the software giant is being heard, Microsoft's lawyers 
looked crestfallen. A spokesman, Tod Nielsen, rushed into the 
hallway with a cellular telephone. Boies appeared jubilant as he 
pressed onward: ``How in the world could your people have run this 
program? ... You do understand you came in here and swore this was 
accurate?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably filmed it, grabbed the wrong screen shot,''  
Allchin answered. ``What's on the screen is the truth. Obviously, 
there were mistakes done there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Computer scientist Edward Felten of Princeton University  
testified previously for the government that he was able to disable 
Microsoft's Internet software included within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin responded that the government's efforts slowed some  
functions sevenfold and prevented other programs from running at 
all. He derided Felten's attempts as a ``Rube Goldberg mechanism'' 
that made Windows ``effectively useless in a commercial sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that under federal ``tying'' laws,  
Microsoft's design forces consumers who use Windows also to use its 
browser, discouraging them from using popular rival software from 
Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has steadfastly denied charges that it illegally  
bundled its Internet browser into newer versions of Windows to 
trounce Netscape. It maintains that it can't be guilty of ``tying'' 
those products because its browser is a component of Windows, not a 
separate software program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could be in for additional challenges. It must  
square that legal defense with an apparently inconsistent admission 
by some of its own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In paperwork for an obscure U.S. patent awarded in August 1998 --  
months after the government launched its landmark antitrust case -- 
Microsoft lawyers wrote: ``It should be understood by those skilled 
in the art that a Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator or 
Internet Explorer, ... is separate from the operating system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies said the government learned about the patent application  
over the weekend and likely would confront Allchin with the 
document later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies noted that the filing came from the company's patent  
lawyers, who aren't involved in formulating its antitrust defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it shows is that when people are off doing their work,  
not related to this lawsuit, they know they are separate 
products,'' Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Mark Murray said patent lawyers were referring  
to alternate versions of Microsoft's browser designed to run on 
rival operating systems, such as on Macintosh or Unix computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The patent filing, involving online banking, also describes  
software programs asking the operating system to retrieve data from 
a particular Internet address -- a technique Microsoft says is 
consistent with its notion of an Internet-savvy Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who has read the document would understand it supports  
our case,'' Murray said.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. plans to acquire 10  
percent of Tokyo's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. in a complex 
deal that will shake up the global tire industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, expected to be announced Wednesday in New York,  
Goodyear will form six joint ventures with Sumitomo around the 
world, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. 
Goodyear will pay the highly leveraged Sumitomo $1 billion for its 
role in the joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear, the world's third-largest  
automobile tire maker, will acquire about 10 percent of Sumitomo's 
outstanding shares while Sumitomo, the fifth-largest tire maker, 
will get a smaller stake in Goodyear. The stock swap is worth about 
$88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Sumitomo spokesman Katshuiro Katafuchi  
confirmed the companies were talking but declined to go into any 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now our negotiation is at its final stage,'' Katafuchi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at Goodyear, which will release its earnings  
report Wednesday morning, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry,  
will control about 22 percent of the market once the deal is 
completed. That will make Goodyear the largest tire maker in North 
America and second-largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA, the top two  
respectively, have dominated the tire industry for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the joint ventures will take place in the United States,  
while two others will take place in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also plan to combine research and purchasing  
activities in joint ventures. The purchasing joint venture and 
other restructuring could save a combined total of $300 million a 
year by the third year of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear shares finished at $50.37 1/2, up 12 1/2 cents on the New  
York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> More Drug Tests Pushed for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Professional athletes should face  
year-round drug testing if they want to compete in the Olympics, 
U.S. drug officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug chief Barry McCaffrey said the Olympic movement  
needs to create an independent anti-doping agency that would carry 
out mandatory out-of-competition testing on all potential Olympic 
competitors -- including pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see testing in these professional leagues,''  
McCaffrey said. ``I think some of the pro leagues are already going 
in that direction and I think you'll hear more from the U.S. 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes need to be subjected to testing every year. The  
independent agency might have to rely on national labs, accredited 
and certified of course, but ultimately the tests would have to 
meet the codes and standards that will be set up by the independant 
agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would mean NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball players  
wishing to compete in the games would be subjected to year-round 
random testing. None of those sports have such testing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pre-requisite for competition,'' said Robert Housman, a  
McCaffrey aide. ``If you are going to compete in the Olympics 
you've got to submit to the testing regime no matter whether you're 
an NBA athlete or mailman that moonlights as an elite world- class 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegates proposed that athletes would have to announce  
their intent to compete at the Olympics at a certain set date 
before the games. They would then undergo random testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You figure out what the trigger time is, the window the  
scientists tell us we need,'' Housman said. ``At that point in time 
the national committees go to their athletes and put out an 
announcement and say those people who think they're going to be 
Olympians have got to get into the system now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housman said that even though team rosters were not unveiled  
until just before the games, national Olympic teams knew in advance 
which athletes were likely to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne Gretzky doesn't just pop up on an Olympic roster and we  
knew a long time before Michael Jordan was going to be an 
Olympian,'' Housman said. ``At that level we know far in advance 
who is going to be playing or at least asked.''

<HEADLINE>  Fears of Violence Grow in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- One month ago, armed men roamed through a  
village in East Timor, firing in the air, beating residents, 
burning houses and stealing goats and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	An account of the Jan. 3 attack on Manutasi, told today by a  
farmer who fled the village, indicated that tensions are rising in 
the former Portuguese territory, which was invaded by Indonesia in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people in the troubled territory fear such attacks will  
escalate as rival factions spar over whether East Timor should be 
granted independence or remain under Indonesian authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of East Timorese separatists gained momentum last week  
when Indonesia said it would consider ceding control if the East 
Timorese rejected an autonomy proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, pro-autonomy East Timorese have warned that civil war  
could break out if Indonesian troops leave. The territory was riven 
by internal conflict when former President Suharto sent in forces 
more than two decades ago after Portuguese colonizers left hastily. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence activists, in turn, have demanded that  
Indonesia disarm government-backed civilian security forces that 
are suspected of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's best that everyone disarm and that includes  
paramilitaries who want to stay with Indonesia,'' said Mauhunu, a 
former separatist rebel who left his comrades in the jungle and 
became a Dili businessman. He now sells marble and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel fighting and human rights abuses have plagued the  
territory ever since Indonesia invaded. But there has been a surge 
in violence in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime De Jesus, a 23-year-old farmer from Manutasi, said he and  
other male villagers were ordered to leave the village by armed men 
whom he suspected were pro-Indonesian militia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are for independence and they are pro-integration,'' said  
De Jesus, who fled to Dili and hasn't seen his family since the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, about 200 separatists waved rebel flags during a  
protest today in Dili. They met at Santa Cruz cemetery, where 
Indonesian troops fired on separatists in 1991, killing dozens and 
drawing international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and Portugal, which the  
United Nations still considers the administering power, gained 
momentum after the May ouster of the authoritarian Suharto.

	Vernon Jordan Is Questioned  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As House prosecutors questioned Vernon Jordan  
for nearly three hours today, senators watched Monica Lewinsky's 
videotaped deposition to decide whether the former White House 
intern should testify in person at President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. A few Republicans said they saw little reason to summon her 
to the Senate floor. But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who viewed the 
tape himself, said he believed it might be helpful to have Ms. 
Lewinsky testify from the Senate floor. ``It's far better for the 
public to meet her and make up their own minds,'' he said. 
``Personally, I found her to be young, vulnerable and credible. I 
think she'd make a very effective witness.''

government-appointed panel of experts said the French branches of 
Chase -- now Chase Manhattan Bank -- J.P. Morgan, Guaranty Trust Co. 
of New York, Bank of the City of New York and American Express for 
turning over about 100 accounts belonging to Jews.

	Anti-Abortion Web Site To Pay $100M  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The authors of a Web site and ``wanted  
posters'' listing abortion doctors' names and addresses must pay 
damages of more than $100 million, a federal jury ruled today, 
calling the site and the posters ``death threats.'' The verdict 
could redefine what is considered constitutionally protected 
political speech. The anti-abortion materials contained no explicit 
threats of violence, only veiled messages, such as crossing through 
the names of abortion providers who were killed. ``This is 
terrorism,'' plaintiffs' attorney Maria Vullo said. ``The message 
is, `Stop performing abortion or wear a bulletproof vest.'''

study anecdotal reports of racism. It would come up with a way 
measure the impact of racial bias in everyday life. As part of his 
fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton proposed that the money go to various 
federal agencies that collect or use population data, from the 
Justice Department to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

legal software. U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders says the

United States compensate them for their losses. Some 25 relatives, 
gathering in Italy one year after the tragedy, complained that the 
United States allocated $20 million to the ski resort town, while 
failing to give enough compensation to them. ``It is clear that the 
United States is responsible for this accident, and it is only fair

warning strikes. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged both sides to 
hammer out a ``sensible accord that respects the wider economic

	BIG CITY PRICES: It's no wonder visitors to New York City blanch  
when they see the prices -- a fast-food meal that costs an average 
of $4.20 in Memphis goes for an average $5.68 in the Big Apple. 
That was the finding of the management consulting firm Runzheimer 
International, which surveyed prices in cities across the country 
for a meal consisting of a quarter-pound cheeseburger, large fries

	THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT REVIVES: The healthy economy is  
prompting more out-of-work executives to start their own 
businesses, finds Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a Chicago-based 
employment consultancy. In a survey of 3,000 job seekers, the 
company found that during the fourth quarter, 11 percent of 
managers and executives who had lost their jobs decided to go into 
business for themselves. That's up from 8 percent in the third 
quarter, and 5 percent in the second quarter of last year, when the 
growing world economic crisis made many business people uneasy. 
Challenger Gray says high levels of consumer confidence and plenty 
of available venture capital are helping many executives decide to 
become entrepreneurs. Having a working spouse also makes it easier 
for people to take risks.

	WHEN IT'S ALL OVER, HEAVE A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF: So, you have a  
big presentation to make in 10 days, and you're trying to prepare. 
Have you thought about reading a storybook aloud or drinking more 
water? Executive Communications Group, a New Jersey-based 
consulting firm, has suggestions to help the prospective public 
speaker that you probably never thought of. For instance, 10 days 
before the big event, start doing 20 minutes of daily vocal 
exercise to help you speak louder and longer. Read books aloud that 
will you change your pitch, volume and pace, such as children's 
stories. With eight days to go, get a haircut and pick out the 
clothes you'll wear (and take them to the cleaners). With six days 
to go, start drinking eight to 10 glasses of water each day; it'll 
help you feel better. Cut down on caffeine and alcohol. The day 
before, start resting your voice. On the big day, keep on avoiding 
caffeine -- and now's the time to cut back on all that extra water 
you've been drinking.

<HEADLINE> Ford Fire Could Affect Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A prolonged shutdown of Ford Motor Co.'s  
Rouge complex after a deadly explosion and fire could affect other 
plants in the automaker's North American production system. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprawling complex closed Monday after an explosion and fire  
in the coal-powered generating station that fuels its operations. 
One person was killed and 14 were in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex contains both an assembly plant and parts plants. If  
production at the parts plants doesn't resume quickly, officials 
said the company would slow production at 16 of the company's 20 
North America assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``our first priority is our people and working with the  
union to resolve this crisis as soon as possible'' site manager Art 
Janes said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamping operation supplies stampings to 16 plants, and the  
frame plant supplies parts to three other plants, Ford officials 
said. Frames built at the complex include the Lincoln Town Car, 
which is assembled in Wixom, and the Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford 
Crown Victoria, which are built in St. Thomas, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday evening, the company already had decided first-shift  
workers at four assembly plants -- Wixom; St. Thomas and Oakville, 
Ontario; and Lorain, Ohio -- would work fewer hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we get into the power plant, we don't know if the next  
shift will come in today,'' Janes said. ``We don't know ... the 
extent of damage in that power plant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skilled tradesmen and management were asked to return to work  
today at the complex, but production workers were not called back. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Edison Co. has two power connection lines that tie into  
the Rouge power plant. But the utility doesn't know yet if those 
connections or their switches had been damaged, spokesman Lew 
Layton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	And the complex might not be able to operate fully even if  
Detroit Edison can supply electricity, because it needs steam that 
also was produced by the power plant, Layton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, CMS Energy Corp. and DTE Energy Co. started work on a  
new power plant next to the Rouge complex. The $240 million plant 
will replace the Ford power plant that exploded, but it isn't 
scheduled to begin operating until 2001. The companies sent crews 
to inspect damage to the site today.

<HEADLINE> Mattel's 4Q Earnings Fall 69 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s earnings fell nearly 69 percent  
in the fourth quarter, with its profits especially hurt by a 
drastic change in buying practices from many of its most important 
retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing down its results was a $31 million charge to cover  
costs associated with a toy recall and a litigation settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest toymaker, best known for its Barbie and Hot  
Wheels brands, said Tuesday that it earned $59.5 million, or 20 
cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 
$195 million, or 66 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's results were in line with Wall Street analysts'  
estimates. El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel has warned of lower 
earnings in December after many retailers cut back their orders and 
asked for delivery of inventory closer to the time that they wanted 
to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel shares rose 31 1/4 cents to close at $25.37 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to 1999, Mattel chairwoman and chief executive officer  
Jill Barad said the toy giant will reduce costs in an attempt to 
boost profits. The company will also concentrate on expanding its 
interactive offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Mattel purchased of The Learning Company, one of  
the nation's top software companies. That should help Mattel 
quickly step up its already success CD-ROM business, which brought 
in $100 million in sales last year, up 20 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel will also increase its Internet presence. It already  
operates ``My Design'' Barbie, which allows a person to create a 
Barbie online. In 1999, a number of its other popular brands, 
including the American Girl line, is expected to be available on 
the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results include a $27 million after-tax charge stemming  
from the recall of up to 10 million battery-run Power Wheels 
ride-on toys because they posed a serious fire risk. In addition, 
Mattel took a $4 million charge for an expected settlement of 
litigation over a Federal Trade Commission dispute involving Toys 
'R Us. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Mattel earned $332.2 million, or $1.11 per  
share, compared with $285 million, or 96 cents per share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year were $4.78 billion, down from $4.83 billion a  
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Series Wants Cuba Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The president of the Caribbean  
Baseball Federation wants Cuba to return to the Caribbean Series 
for the first time since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba was host for the first Caribbean Series in 1949 but left  
the federation after Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- a former pitcher -- 
abolished professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I am seeing, I believe that in the coming years we  
are going to have Cuba once again in the Caribbean Series,'' Juan 
Francisco Puello said Monday. ``We have to look for a rapprochement 
with Cuba because major league baseball has already taken these 
steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba and the Baltimore Orioles are attempting to plan a  
home-and-home exhibition series at Havana in March and Camden Yards 
in April. The plan awaits approval from the U.S. government, which 
doesn't want any of the money going to organizations controlled by 
the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	Puello, who is from the Dominican Republic, plans to travel to  
Cuba this year with representatives of organized baseball from 
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later this is going to happen and the Cubans are  
going to leave behind the isolation they have been in for so 
long,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report Card in on Gov't Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although its future is a question mark, the  
day-to-day operations of the Social Security Administration are 
among the best in government, a private study says. 
</P>
<P>
	While Congress and the political parties debate how best to  
guarantee the financial stability of Social Security into the 21st 
century, the agency offers efficient customer service and is on top 
of the computerized information systems needed to do its mammoth 
job, the survey says. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, it gets the checks -- millions and millions of  
them -- in the mail on time. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the Federal Aviation Administration which runs the  
air traffic control system, and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, which patrols the nation's borders, get much lower 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions are part of the first government-rating survey  
by the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse 
University. It analyzed and ranked 15 federal agencies and all 50 
states with the help of a $2.5 million, four-year grant from the 
Pew Charitable Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Government Performance Project gave four states top grades --  
Missouri, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Virginia emerged as the 
top-ranked state with a composite grade of A-. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concluded that strong leadership still works to  
``transform government from a creaky engine to a well-oiled 
machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These are the survey's grades for all 15 agencies: Social  
Security Administration, A; Food and Nutrition Service, B; Food and 
Drug Administration, B; Federal Emergency Management Agency, B; 
Food Safety and Inspection Service, B; Veterans Health 
Administration, B; Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 
B-; Patent and Trademark Office, B-; Environmental Protection 
Agency, B-; Federal Housing Administration, B-; Internal Revenue 
Service, C; U.S. Customs Service, C; Health Care Financing 
Administration, C; Federal Aviation Administration, C; and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, C-.

<HEADLINE> GOP Slams Clinton's Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's Pentagon budget proposal  
fails to meet the military's needs, Republican lawmakers said 
Tuesday, even though it calls for the first rise in defense 
spending in more than a decade. They also gave a cool response to 
his request for new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just fear what we will discover is that for every step the  
president wants us to believe he has taken forward, the hard 
reality of the budget will represent two steps backwards,'' said 
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, defending the day-old budget in  
an appearance before the committee, conceded that the budget falls 
short of what the military service chiefs had told Congress they 
needed. ``But this does in fact meet their most-pressing 
requirements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan includes a 4.4 percent across-the-board pay increase  
for the military. But the Senate is soon to debate legislation that 
would give the military an even bigger raise -- 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen defended anew his administration's request for two new  
rounds of base closings, insisting it would save $20 billion, plus 
$3 billion annually once the additional bases are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that two more rounds are in fact necessary,'' Cohen  
said. The administration wants the closings in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last round in 1995, Congress has rejected several  
administration attempts to close other bases it considers 
unnecessary. Republicans have accused the administration of trying 
to politicize the process -- trying to protect certain bases in 
high-electoral vote states like California and Texas, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of trust from the last go-around,'' Rep.  
James Hansen, R-Utah, told Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	And Spence, the committee chairman, suggested that even with the  
base closings the administration seeks, military needs would not be 
met. He said the budget ``appears to rely heavily on assumed 
savings, spending cuts and outlay gimmicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence also complained that the budget rescinds $900 million  
agreed to last fall, in an emergency funding bill, for expanded 
intelligence and a national missile defense. The administration is 
spending the money instead, he said, on payments to Israel and the 
Palestinians to carry out the Wye peace agreement, Spence said. The 
administration says it will find money for the intelligence and 
missile defense later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
the committee previously that the administration's budget, while 
meeting the Pentagon's most pressing immediate requirements, still 
fell short of its long-term needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that basic message Tuesday. ``I am concerned about  
the high impact the tempo of operations is having on our people, 
their families, and our aging equipment,'' Shelton testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration bills the 2000 spending plan as an increase  
of $12 billion, with a total increase of $112 billion through 2005. 
But the $12 billion represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes to spend. Much of the $12 billion is actually 
savings from lower-than-expected inflation, not new money.

<HEADLINE> NJ College Ends Record Loss Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When he arrived home an hour after Monmouth College ended the  
nation's longest Division I losing streak, coach Dave Calloway's 
telephone answering machine was blinking away with 16 messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have call waiting on the answering machine, and as one  
person was leaving a message you could hear it beep in,'' Calloway 
said Tuesday, a little more than 12 hours after his Hawks defeated 
Wagner 66-61 to end a 22-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were just calling one after another, and when I got in  
this morning I had another eight or nine more here,'' the youngest 
coach in Division I basketball added. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the calls were from friends, fellow coaches, alumni and  
family -- the same people who had called before to tell Calloway to 
hang in there as the losses piled up through this season's first 19 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm feeling is relief -- it just hits you,'' Calloway  
said. ``After that, you're just happy for the kids because it could 
have been very easy to pack it in, especially the young guys. They 
could have said we'll do it next year. This has been a tough time, 
but we have continued to work and we've been right there the last 
couple of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the final seconds ticked off Monday night, many in the crowd  
of 1,117 inched closer to the floor. At the final buzzer, they 
celebrated wildly, reminiscent of three years ago when the Hawks 
beat Rider to win the Northeast Conference tournament and their 
first NCAA Tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that clicked in me after we got the win is that it  
took me 20 games to get that feeling,'' said freshman Alpha 
Bangura, whose four free throws iced the victory, the Hawks' first 
since Feb. 16, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was a disappointment on Tuesday, Calloway said, it was  
in not being able to get right back to work. Under NCAA rules, 
players have to have at least one day off a week, and the Hawks 
(1-19) were off with games on tap Thursday, Saturday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys realize all that work paid off, so we have to keep  
working,'' said Calloway, who now has a 4-29 record as a head 
coach, with three wins coming against Wagner. ``It's not like now 
that we got a win we can ease up. Now they have seen it and got the 
taste in their mouths we have to continue to go from there and 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway is used to that. He has not stopped since taking over  
as head coach at the West Long Branch, N.J., school after Wayne 
Szoke resigned on Jan. 17, 1998, after losing 13 of 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks went 3-10 the rest of the season with Calloway as  
interim coach. He got the job outright after the season, but 
encountered more problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, three players, including two projected starters, were  
dropped from the team for violating the university's code of 
conduct. Another starter transferred before the season, leaving a 
roster suddenly filled with freshmen and inexperienced 
upperclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been paying attention to our losing streak or anyone  
else's,'' Calloway said. ``I've been more concerned with our guys. 
I knew we had some talent, but we hadn't been able to get the win. 
We just needed something to get us over. Last night, when the 
adversity hit, we stepped up and made the plays.''

<HEADLINE> Tipper Knocks Mental Illness Stigma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tipper Gore says people with mental  
illness deserve the same level of treatment, insurance and support 
as those with physical illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of Vice President Al Gore said Monday that research is  
helping to dismantle the stigma of mental illness and encourage 
people to seek treatment for disorders ranging from depression to 
autism. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, a policy adviser to President Clinton on mental  
illness, spoke to a forum attended by about 200 mental health 
professionals at Vanderbilt University's Peabody campus. Mrs. Gore 
received her master's degree in psychology at the school, then 
Peabody College, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The event is part of a series of discussions moderated by Mrs.  
Gore nationwide to prepare for a White House conference on mental 
illness in May. 
</P>
<P>
	About 51 million Americans experience a mental illness each  
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore announced that the White House will ask Congress for a  
$5 million spending increase for a program to help homeless people 
with severe mental illness or substance abuse disorders. The 
program, called Projects for Assistance in Transition from 
Homelessness, now gets about $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned that getting people off the streets does mean  
more than putting a roof over their heads,'' Mrs. Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore said homeless people with mental illness need a  
``continuum of care'' including job training, child care, substance 
abuse treatment and mental health services.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates the 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans launched a barrage  
of criticism today at President Clinton's $1.77 trillion budget, 
declaring it was riddled with questionable accounting gimmicks and 
seriously flawed by not including broad tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other administration  
witnesses were told by GOP-controlled committees that the budget 
Clinton unveiled Monday would be substantially rewritten to trim 
his proposed spending increases and free money for a significant 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. William Roth, said  
he found it incomprehensible that Clinton's budget would project 
$4.8 trillion in surpluses over the next 15 years and still not be 
able to produce any broad-based tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Americans should have to wait at least 15  
years for a tax cut,'' Roth, R-Del., told Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the budget marked the start of a  
great national debate that would clearly show the differences 
between Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``America can only benefit by the competition of ideas and this  
ought to be one of the highest quality debates in Congress in many 
years,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans in both the House and Senate have signaled  
their support for a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income 
tax rates, which could cost as much as $800 billion over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told the Finance Committee that the administration opposed  
an across-the-board tax cut because two-thirds of the relief would 
go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. He said the 
administration's targeted proposals for increased child care 
benefits and retirement accounts represented a more equitable and 
less costly way to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans who criticized Clinton's budget on the issue of  
tax relief said they support his general goal of using 62 percent 
of future surpluses to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But they asserted that the specific plan Clinton advanced in the  
budget to accomplish this was riddled with accounting gimmicks and 
that a much more straightforward approach should be employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's complex proposal would essentially issue two sets of  
bonds that would be held by the Social Security system. The 
administration argued that this accounting process would serve as a 
``lockbox'' to ensure that politicians were not tempted to divert 
to tax cuts and other uses the financing Social Security will need 
to meet the needs of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said Clinton's plan snared general  
tax revenues to support both Social Security and Medicare, 
something the government has so far avoided doing, preferring 
instead to trim benefits when necessary to keep Social Security and 
Medicare costs in line with the payroll taxes collected to support 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we look to the general fund to take care of these  
shortfalls, all the incentives to make the tough decisions for 
Social Security and Medicare will evaporate,'' Chafee told Rubin 
and Deputy Budget Director Sylvia Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said the administration had put forward a fiscally  
sound document that protects Social Security and Medicare, pays 
down the national debt and supplies funding increases for national 
priorities such as education and child care. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget projects that last year's surplus of $69.2 billion,  
the first in 29 years, will be followed by a rising tide of black 
ink over the next 15 years, an assumption that economists say could 
be wiped out quickly if the current healthy U.S. economy suddenly 
dips into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that tensions between the two parties have already been  
heightened by the impeachment battle, this year's budget battle in 
an era of surpluses is shaping up to be every bit as contentious as 
the monumental fights during two decades of soaring deficits that 
often produced gridlock and government shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my days in Congress, I've never seen such a  
kitchen-sink approach to government. The budget contains something 
for everyone and that's what's troubling,'' the House Ways and 
Means Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, complained 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the  
Republican chairmen of the budget committees of Congress, said at a 
joint news conference Monday that the GOP had surmounted the 
differences on tax policy that last year kept Republicans from 
presenting a unified front. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici, who had been reluctant to go along with House  
Republicans' calls for big tax cuts, said he was firmly behind 
efforts to get across-the-board reductions in rates.

<HEADLINE> Canada Groundhog Dies Before Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIARTON, Ontario (AP) -- The crowd at Canada's top Groundhog Day  
festival got worse news Tuesday than a bad weather forecast: They 
learned that star groundhog Wiarton Willie had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some children among the 200 people burst into tears.  
</P>
<P>
	Willie died of natural causes Sunday night, but his death was  
not disclosed until Tuesday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really know what to do,'' said Sam Brouwer, Willie's  
caretaker for the past 10 years. ``We were absolutely devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willie was lying in a pine coffin for a public viewing Tuesday  
morning. His paws were crossed, pennies were placed over his 
eyelids and he was clutching a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brouwer said the albino groundhog died at the age of 22, much  
longer than most groundhogs in the wild survive. He had been in 
failing health when he went into hibernation last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Willie wasn't on hand to make his last weather  
prediction, local officials said the ``spirit'' of Willie indicated 
there would be an early spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The area has had a Groundhog Festival for 43 years, and Wiarton  
Willie has been the main event for the past decade. A search will 
be conducted for a successor, to be named Wiarton Willie Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	According to folklore, if the sun was out when Willie peeped his  
head up from winter on Groundhog Day, it meant six more weeks of 
cold weather. If it was a gray day, with no shadow, it meant an 
early spring. 
</P>
<P>
	His handler said Willie was right 90 percent of the time, but  
not everybody was happy. A few years ago, Willie got death threats 
when he predicted an especially bad winter would last six more 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Kendall Accuses Starr of Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge is being asked to widen an  
investigation into whether Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
office has improperly leaked grand jury information in the Monica 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The new request Monday by President Clinton's lawyer, David  
Kendall, was prompted by a weekend report that Starr had concluded 
a federal grand jury has the constitutional authority to indict the 
president while he is in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall asked U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to  
order Starr to show why he and his staff should not be held in 
contempt for improper violations of grand jury secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told reporters that Starr's office ``engaged in illegal  
and partisan leaking'' related to the weekend report in The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr released a statement saying he was ``deeply troubled'' by  
the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office has no desire to inject itself into the  
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' the independent 
counsel said, adding that he was investigating to determine whether 
anyone in his office improperly disclosed information to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home whether he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson last year appointed an investigator to look into  
Kendall's previous allegations that Starr's office was responsible 
for leaks of grand jury material in the investigation of whether 
Clinton illegally tried to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Starr contended the White House and defense lawyers were the prime 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grand jury secrecy rule bars prosecutors, grand  
jurors and court personnel from disclosing grand jury information. 
An appeals court in Washington, D.C., said last year that protected 
information ``includes not only what has occurred and what is 
occurring, but also what is likely to occur,'' including the 
investigation's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, witnesses who testify before a grand jury are allowed  
to disclose what is said inside the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	The news report that Starr has concluded Clinton can be indicted  
in office drew criticism from senators as the Senate tries to find 
a way to end the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal scholars differ over whether a sitting president can be  
indicted. The Constitution makes clear that federal officials 
ousted through impeachment can be charged with a crime, but it does 
not spell out whether removal from office must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicting a president would ``seriously interfere with the  
ability of the president to govern,'' said New York University law 
professor Burt Neuborne. ``The time to indict him is after he 
leaves office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1997 that sitting  
presidents can be forced to face civil lawsuits over their 
unofficial acts. And some federal judges and members of Congress 
have been prosecuted while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar contends the  
president is unique because he is the sole head of the executive 
branch of government. If Starr obtained an indictment of Clinton, 
``he would be claiming for himself the power to imprison the chief 
executive officer,'' Amar told Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel suggested a  
president could be charged and perhaps even forced to go to trial 
while in office, but there was a ``strong argument'' that he could 
not be imprisoned until after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine University law professor Doug Kmiec said he believes  
the Constitution does allow a sitting president to be indicted. 
However, once a prosecutor has referred a case to Congress for 
impeachment, Kmiec said he believed it would be unwise to pursue it 
in criminal court as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's made his choice of avenues. I think he should  
rest with it,'' Kmiec said.

<HEADLINE> Bonus Used To Recruit Mass Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The enticing ads have been appearing in college  
newspapers around the country: Teach in Massachusetts and earn a 
$20,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the responses are pouring in as a result of the highly  
unusual cross-country blitz by the state's Department of Education 
to woo the best teachers to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sweeping the country for the cream of the crop,'' Alan  
Safran, the DOE's chief of staff, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While most school districts typically hire local candidates,  
Massachusetts has gone national to pick 50 aspiring teachers for 
the state's new bonus-paying program. 
</P>
<P>
	On one day last week, the education department's job application  
Web site received 500 hits. Some 60 calls have been flooding the 
telephone hot line every two hours. And scores of students have 
been filling recruitment sessions held so far in Boston, New York 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus program and the national recruitment drive have put  
Massachusetts on the cutting edge of teacher hiring, said Michelle 
Rhee, partnership director for the New York-based New Teacher 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, school districts are very reactive in their  
recruiting. They go to college fairs that they're invited to around 
the area and they just work with the candidates who put in 
applications,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts and states should be chasing new teachers as  
aggressively as any major corporation recruits its employees, said 
Rhee, whose organization has been working with Philadelphia and 
Austin, Texas, on new hiring methods. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $30,000 recruitment budget, Massachusetts has placed  
advertisements in 48 college newspapers and is hosting information 
sessions in more than a dozen states, including California, 
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maine and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants need to be among the best to even make the first cut:  
a ranking in the top 10 percent of the graduating class; a minimum 
of a 3.5 grade point average; a ranking in the top 10th percentile 
on a nationally recognized exam designated by the education 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The state also is encouraging mid-career professionals and  
leaders -- not just teachers, but engineers, housewives and business 
people -- to apply by the March 1 deadline. Their eligibility is 
based on work experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed into law with a $60 million endowment last summer, the  
bonus program was designed to recruit new blood for the state's 
neediest urban communities, where teacher shortages are the 
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also an attempt to elevate the profession's beleaguered  
reputation. Massachusetts teachers became the butt of jokes last 
year after hundreds of aspiring educators failed a basic literacy 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome that they're finally recognizing how important  
teachers are, and that they're trying to solve the problems in the 
education system,'' said Boston College senior Haemin Kwan, who 
attended a campus information session last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While only 50 of the anticipated 1,000 applicants will get the  
signing bonus, officials are hopeful the candidates who aren't 
chosen will still opt to teach in Massachusetts, where the average 
teacher's starting salary is about $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But some educators are questioning whether the recruitment  
campaign puts other states at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that in the long-term the solution for the  
Massachusetts teacher shortage or the national teacher shortage is 
for recruiters to spread out across the country and raid one 
another's teaching pool,'' said Segun Eubanks, a vice president at 
Recruiting New Teachers in Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommye Hulto, spokeswoman for the California Teachers  
Association, said her state must hire an estimated 300,000 new 
teachers over the next decade, and can do without the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, she said, ``We always hear about baseball  
signing bonuses. It would be nice for teachers if that kind of 
thing were prevalent.''

<HEADLINE> Man Jailed for Beheading Wife's Cat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- A man got 60 days in jail for cutting the  
head off his estranged wife's cat and using it like a paperweight 
to hold down a threatening note to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Anthony Looper, 31, was sentenced on Friday for cruelty to  
animals and terroristic threatening. He was also put on probation 
for a year and ordered to pay $510 in fines and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Looper, 23, reported that someone broke into her house while  
she was gone Thursday and that she found the cat's head in her 
vehicle, with a note that read in part, ``I'm going to give you a 
birthday like you never will forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looper told police that he had had 14 beers in three hours and  
did not remember hurting the cat, but admitted the handwriting on 
the note looked like his. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Looper's birthday was Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives, GOP Hopefuls To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of conservative leaders summoned  
Republican presidential hopefuls to private interviews Wednesday, 
seeking a candidate who can win the presidency without forsaking 
the party's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,  
activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and 
broadcaster Alan Keyes are expected to be interviewed for an hour 
each in a downtown hotel, according to several people involved with 
organizing the private auditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle will talk with the group by  
telephone from a rally in Indiana, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership group, which includes activists Phyllis Schlafly  
and Paul Weyrich, is the same loose coalition of social 
conservatives who helped promote the potential candidacy of Sen. 
John Ashcroft. The Missouri lawmaker decided at the last minute not 
to run, leaving an opening for conservative candidates seeking 
credibility and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important step in a much larger process of reaching  
out to the conservative base of the party,'' said Ralph Reed, a 
political strategist and former director of the Christian 
Coalition. He is not taking part in the job interviews, but is 
familiar with politics in the party's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it remains to be seen whether or not this particular  
group can put together a coalition of conservative groups like the 
Christian Coalition or the Eagle Forum that can actually deliver 
large numbers of votes in primary states.'' Reed said. ``But even 
if they don't, these are important individuals with important 
constituencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also remains to be seen whether the group could ever agree to  
endorse one GOP hopeful, increasing its own influence and the 
presidential prospects of its anointed candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see a consensus emerging (Wednesday), which has been  
the problem all along,'' said Schlafly, the Eagle Forum leader. 
``We would like to have a consensus instead of being split all over 
the place. But, obviously, we're split all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ashcroft had the backing of Schlafly and others in the  
group, even he was not unanimously endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition, will question  
the candidates though he also wonders whether a consensus 
conservative can emerge from the meeting. ``The real questions is, 
Can the candidate inspire grassroots activists to the polls? No 
meeting in Washington is going to answer that question,'' Tate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Tate, Schlafly and Weyrich, who runs the Free  
Congress Foundation, the group includes Mike Farris of the Home 
School Defense Association, Paige Patterson of the Southern Baptist 
Convention and activist Tim La Haye 
</P>
<P>
	Rallying behind one candidate can be dangerous for the group and  
the candidate, Reed cautioned. If the candidate loses, the group's 
influence will be questioned. If the candidate is nominated, 
Democrats will label him a tool of the religious right, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting will not include Texas Gov. George W. Bush or former  
Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, two Republicans showing the most 
promise in early polling. The more moderate or establishment 
Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, were not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the gathering was welcomed by potential candidates vying  
for the support of social conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant group of conservatives who want to hear  
their opinions on various issues,'' said Bill Dal Col, strategist 
for Forbes.

	Senators See Lewinsky Deposition  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aides to some Republican senators who today  
watched a tape of Monica Lewinsky's deposition said they saw little 
reason to summon her to the Senate. ``There is nothing new'' on the 
tape,'' Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. Asked whether there was 
anything to be gained in calling Ms. Lewinsky for live testimony 
based on what is in the videotape, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said 
``probably not.'' Meanwhile, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan is 
being questioned by House managers about his efforts to find Ms. 
Lewinsky a job and a lawyer.

	Gephardt Won't Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, one of  
Vice President Al Gore's most formidable political rivals, is 
expected to announce tomorrow that he will not seek the Democratic 
presidential nomination, The Associated Press has learned. Gephardt 
has decided to concentrate instead on helping the party gain 
control of the House in 2000, several allies to the Missouri 
lawmaker said. As the House's top Democrat, Gephardt almost 
certainly would become speaker if Republicans lose the House in 
2000.

	Tipper Knocks Mental Illness Stigma  
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tipper Gore says people with mental  
illness deserve the same level of treatment, insurance and support 
as those with physical illness. The wife of Vice President Al Gore 
said that research is helping to dismantle the stigma of mental 
illness and encourage people to seek treatment for disorders 
ranging from depression to autism. About 51 million Americans 
experience a mental illness each year, she said. Mrs. Gore 
announced that the White House will ask Congress for a $5 million 
spending increase for a program to help homeless people with severe 
mental illness or substance abuse disorders.

Netanyahu has been pressuring the United States to demand that the 
Palestinians crack down on Islamic militants.

	LONDON (AP) -- Australian nanny Louise Sullivan received a  
suspended 15-month sentence today for shaking to death an infant 
girl in her care. Miss Sullivan pleaded guilty last month to 
manslaughter in the death of 6-month-old Caroline Jongen. She said 
she had shaken Caroline forcefully during a feeding because she 
thought the baby was having a fit. The nanny's lawyers had argued 
for a suspended sentence, pointing to psychiatric reports that 
showed she had a below-average IQ and needed counseling.

the Internet provider's rules. Derrick Wolbert said he sent an 
e-mail to a friend claiming he was an ``agent'' for AOL. A 
spokeswoman for the online service said impersonating an AOL 
employee is an ``absolute violation of our terms of service.'' 
People posing as AOL employees frequently try to persuade others to 
tell them passwords or credit card numbers, she said. But Wolbert's 
father complained to the state's attorney general, and AOL 
relented.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes 71.58 Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks prices declined Tuesday as investors,  
worried that higher interest rates could drag corporate earnings 
lower, took profits for the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.58 to 9,274.12,  
extending Monday's 13-point loss. The Dow was down 147.53 points 
before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well, led by technology  
shares. The Nasdaq composite declined 46.67 to 2,463.42. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 lost 11.01 to 1,261.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices began falling early on Wall Street after Japan's  
interest rates rose to their highest levels since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher Japanese rates sent the dollar and U.S. bond prices  
lower in New York, as U.S. investors anticipated that their 
Japanese counterparts, important buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds, 
would begin routing some of their funds away from U.S. securities 
and into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/8 point.  
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.24 
percent from 5.18 percent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates reminded stock investors that companies will have  
to rely on strong earnings -- and not lower interest rates, as they 
did last year -- to keep their stock prices aloft, said Tom Galvin, 
a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a tough transition point,'' he said, because while  
fourth-quarter earnings have been generally strong, ``most 
investors don't have a lot of confidence in earnings'' going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates also make corporate borrowing more expensive, which  
can hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of higher interest rates were further stoked by a report  
from Conference Board, a private research group, that its Index of 
Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, which signals above-average growth in the months to  
come, was stronger than economists had expected. Following on the 
heels of Monday's report of a pickup in manufacturing, it fueled 
concern among some investors that the Fed's next move might be to 
raise rates to cool economic growth and rocket-high stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed began two days of policy meetings Tuesday, but  
economists don't expect the bankers to make a move on rates just 
yet because they are mindful of the potential impact of economic 
troubles overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 4 7/8  
to 77 1/16. Dell Computer led Nasdaq stocks lower for most of the 
session but recovered late in the session, ending up 5/8 at 108 5/8. 
Cisco Systems, however, dropped 2 39/64 to 112 25/64 in heavy 
volume in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq rose 9/16 to 47 7/16 in  
leading volume, after the computer maker introduced a new line of 
business software. But shares of Internet service provider America 
Online dropped 3 11/16 to 167 1/2, also in heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners had a 7-to-4 lead on advancers on the Big Board, but  
trading volume was heavy at 1.01 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In other New York action, the NYSE composite index fell 3.36 to  
594.10, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.00 
to 709.63. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.31 to 
421.77. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Differ on How To Fix Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With one-third of America's schools in urgent  
need of repair, the Clinton administration wants to raise nearly 
$25 billion for renovations through tax credits for bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who run Congress support the idea in general,  
but they say too much of President Clinton's plan targets 
inner-city schools. The GOP wants more of the money spent in 
growing suburbs and neglected rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little question about the need. The American Society of  
Civil Engineers last year gave public schools an F in a survey of 
the nation's greatest infrastructure problems. It was the only 
sector to get the lowest possible grade. 
</P>
<P>
	That report found a third of all elementary and secondary  
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class 
in substandard buildings. Almost half lacked the wiring to 
accommodate computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some recent examples: A high school track team in suburban  
Burnside, Ill., held practices at a prison with better facilities. 
At some New York City schools, urinals were hidden behind plywood 
so bathrooms could become classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our school buildings are literally crumbling,'' said Luther W.  
Graef, president of the engineers' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimated renovation and repair of America's schools  
would cost $112 billion, with another $60 billion needed to provide 
space for an expected 3 million new students over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than asking Congress for sharp increases in direct  
spending -- something the GOP is reluctant to do -- Clinton proposed 
Monday in his fiscal 2000 budget the creation of tax credits aimed 
at spurring investors to buy two types of bonds that would raise 
almost $25 billion over two years for school repair and 
modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	Total cost of the tax credits is pegged at $3.7 billion over  
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the National School Boards Association in a speech  
Monday that the credits would help provide money to fix up 5,000 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many schools I've been in where there were as  
many kids back in the house trailers as there were in the regular 
classrooms,'' Clinton said. ``I don't know how many I've been in 
where there were rooms closed off because the buildings were 
breaking down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One type of bond would raise $22 billion over two years, with  
tax credits paying the interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the money would be set aside for up to 125 school  
districts with the most low-income students. The other half would 
be divvied up among the states -- again based on the number of 
low-income students statewide -- for state officials to spend as 
they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $400 million would be set aside for certain needy Native  
American schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials say the arrangement should blunt  
GOP criticism that the bond proceeds would benefit primarily big 
cities -- often Democratic Party territory -- instead of addressing 
growth in the suburbs where more Republicans live. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal would address both of those problems,'' said  
department spokeswoman Julie Green. ``The way we're submitting the 
proposal, the bonding authority would be split half and half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans do not see it that way. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman  
of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is considering 
an alternative that would relax certain federal bond rules to make 
existing tax-exempt bonds for school construction more attractive 
to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, R-Texas, says his approach would spread the money more  
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids in rural America and suburban America need new schools,  
too,'' Archer wrote to colleagues last year. ``Indeed, suburban 
areas may need new schools the most since population growth in 
suburbs continues to explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP also is questioning the second part of Clinton's  
proposal that would raise an estimated $2.4 billion over two years 
by expanding an existing program providing tax credits to bond 
investors for projects that include matching money from private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Such bonds, begun in 1997, have not proven popular on Wall  
Street, mainly because they are hamstrung by complex restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only been a couple of deals,'' said John Vogt, vice  
president of the Bond Market Association. ``Our priority is to 
emphasize the existing municipal bond market. We think that's an 
effective part of a school modernization program.''

<HEADLINE> Cal Ripken Card Hearing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A hearing to decide who owns a copy of the lineup  
card used when Cal Ripken Jr. broke baseball's consecutive-game 
record was delayed Tuesday after no one showed up to represent 
former Orioles manager Phil Regan, who claims he owns the card. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hearing was scheduled for March 9.  
</P>
<P>
	Regan filled out the original card Sept. 6, 1995, inserting  
Ripken into the lineup for his 2,131st consecutive game, which 
broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game playing streak. He also made 
five carbon copies of the card and kept one for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he contacted North Shore Sports to sell his copy, the  
Orioles sued the Chicago auction company to stop the sale, saying 
the team owns all copies of the card. 
</P>
<P>
	A Baltimore collector bid $35,650 for the copy in December,  
mistakenly thinking it was the original. The sale is on hold 
pending the outcome of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	George Pappas, the attorney representing North Shore Sports, on  
Tuesday said Regan must hire an attorney and join the fight. Pappas 
asked that the hearing be delayed, saying North Shore has no direct 
interest in ownership of the card and is stuck in the middle of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get him in the suit,'' Pappas said. ``If not, we  
will give the card back; we'll turn it over to the judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Orioles attorney said he might file a motion for default --  
asking the judge to rule in the team's favor -- because Regan hasn't 
responded to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chicago attorney Thomas Royce said Regan plans to hire him  
and fight for the card. He said Regan, a pitching coach for the 
Cleveland Indians, has been preoccupied with spring training 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan did not return a telephone message left Tuesday at his  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles attorneys have said they want to set a precedent that  
ball clubs own anything that is part of official league business. 
</P>
<P>
	The team doesn't have the other four other carbon copies,  
either. The plate umpire for the game gave his to Bowling Green 
State University; the Babe Ruth Museum has one; Marcel Lachemann, 
the California Angels manager at the time, gave his copy away; and 
the final copy went to Ripken.

<HEADLINE> Catcher Ausmus Extends Tigers Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Catcher Brad Ausmus, obtained by Detroit from  
Houston last month, agreed Tuesday to a contract extension that 
guarantees him at least $12.75 million over the next four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus, 29, originally agreed to a $7.5 million, three-year deal  
that guaranteed him $1.5 million last season, $2.5 million this 
season and $3.5 million in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	His new contract calls for salaries of $2 million this year, $4  
million in 2000 and $4.25 million in 2001. Detroit has an option 
for 2002 at $5 million but if the Tigers decline it, Ausmus gets a 
$2.5 million player option. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the new deal allows him to earn $500,000 in  
bonuses, up from the $400,000 he could have earned during the 
remainder of the original contract. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Ausmus gets a no-trade clause for the next  
two seasons and the right to demand a trade prior to the 2001 
season. If he demands a trade, the Tigers would have until the 
following March 15 to deal him or he would become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus has gone from San Diego to Detroit to Houston and back to  
Detroit during his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .269 with 45 RBIs for the Astros last season and threw  
out 36 percent of the runners attempting to steal. He was second in 
voting for the Gold Glove award. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus and left-hander C.J. Nitkowski, another former Tiger,  
were acquired from Houston last month for catcher Paul Bako, 
right-handers Dean Crow and Brian Powell, minor league third 
baseman Carlos Villalobos and minor league right-hander Mark 
Persails.

<HEADLINE> Parties Remain Split on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The budget landscape has suddenly been  
transformed from the deep valleys of deficits to the mountain tops 
of surpluses projected to run for as far as the eye can see. But 
one thing hasn't changed -- the deep divide between Democrats and 
Republicans over budget priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties are pledging to use 62 percent of the $4.85  
trillion in surpluses Clinton's budget is projecting over the next 
15 years to protect the government's biggest benefit program -- 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But they disagree on the best way to do that. And they have even  
bigger differences on just about everything else in Clinton's $1.77 
trillion budget for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the increased spending on a range of programs and  
targeted tax cuts that Clinton proposed in the budget he released 
Monday, the Republicans who control Congress favor across-the-board 
tax cuts totaling as much as $800 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget projects that last year's surplus of  
$69.2 billion, the first in 29 years, will be followed by a rising 
tide of black ink over the next 15 years, an assumption that 
economists say could be wiped out quickly if the current healthy 
U.S. economy suddenly dips into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that tensions between the two parties have already been  
heightened by the impeachment battle, this year's budget battle in 
an era of surpluses is shaping up to be every bit as contentious as 
the monumental fights during two decades of soaring deficits that 
often produced gridlock and government shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Top members of the president's economic team, including Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin and Budget Director Jacob Lew, were 
preparing to defend the president's spending blueprint before 
skeptical congressional committees today. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my days in Congress, I've never seen such a  
kitchen-sink approach to government. The budget contains something 
for everyone and that's what's troubling,'' complained House Ways 
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton's budget projects that the government will  
collect almost $1.9 trillion in taxes from the American people (in 
2000) and then proposes a new spending program for just about 
everyone,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the GOP office 
holders considering a run for the White House next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the  
Republican chairmen of the budget committees of Congress, said at a 
joint news conference that the GOP had surmounted the differences 
on tax policy that last year kept Republicans from presenting a 
unified front. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici, who had been reluctant to go along with House  
Republicans' calls for big tax cuts, said he was firmly behind 
efforts to get across-the-board reductions in rates. He and many 
other Senate Republicans favor a 10-percent reduction in rates, 
while Kasich said he favored at least that level, if not more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be working together,'' Domenici said of House  
and Senate Republicans. ``I am hopeful that in the end we may be 
able to work out something with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But given the wide differences that exist and the fact that both  
parties are trying to position themselves for the 2000 presidential 
and congressional campaigns, the chances for big agreements this 
year on Social Security or taxes appear slim to many observers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget is largely for positioning purposes,''  
said Stanley Collender, a budget expert at Fleishman-Hillard Inc. 
``More important for him than winning is to show his party's core 
constituencies what they would get if Democrats were in charge of 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans want to use 38 percent of future surpluses to  
cut income tax rates, the president proposes using the money to 
shore up Medicare, the government's second-biggest benefit program, 
provide increased spending on defense and a variety of domestic 
programs and create new ``Universal Savings Accounts'' to bolster 
the retirement nest eggs of low and moderate-income Americans.

<HEADLINE> Florida Won't Play Powerball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Scratch Powerball from Florida's  
lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is pulling out of a contract to become the 21st state to  
join the multi-state lottery, Gov. Jeb Bush announced Tuesday. He 
said Powerball is of ``debatable effectiveness'' and would only 
hurt the state lottery's chances of achieving long-term stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's lottery needs to create a plan for sustained sales  
growth, and a rushed decision to join Powerball would contradict 
that goal, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former lottery Secretary Marcia Mann signed the contract Nov. 6  
to join Powerball, less than a week after Bush was elected, saying 
it would give a major boost to a state lottery that has seen its 
revenues sag. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing governor, the late Lawton Chiles, decided to hold  
off on a final decision until the department could study it 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mann, who was replaced last month, said Bush's decision went  
against every study she conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big mistake,'' she said. ``I never believed that  
Powerball was the answer forever, but I certainly think it would be 
the answer for the next couple of years when revenues are flat.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ford Said To Halt Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor  
Co. on Tuesday agreed to suspend the dismissal of 2,800 workers, 
ending an impasse that forced it shut down its plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leader Joao Ferreira Passos said the automaker agreed to  
let the workers, laid off shortly before Christmas, to return to 
their jobs and has also instituted a voluntary retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each worker who resigns will receive 41.5 percent of his  
monthly wage multiplied by the number of years he has worked at 
Ford, and full health benefits until April,'' Passos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, which has said the job cuts were necessary due to reduced  
demand, was not available for immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 18, Ford and union leaders will meet again to see how  
many workers took early retirement and begin discussing ways to 
lower production costs, Passos said. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost two weeks in early January, the laid-off workers  
showed up inside the plant to pressure the company to reconsider 
their dismissal. On Jan. 17, Ford shut down the factory, saying it 
would resume production on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at Ford has been stopped since Dec. 21, when year-end  
vacations began. It was supposed to resume Jan. 4, but because of 
the daily presence of the laid off workers inside the factory, the 
company refused to activate the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet because of the  
global economic turmoil. Sales in 1998 dropped 27.5 percent, 
according to the National Association of Vehicle Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories of unsold cars today stand at more than 100,000  
vehicles parked in factory yards and on dealers' lots.

<HEADLINE> Paramedic Wins Parental Leave Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A state police paramedic who said he was denied  
parental leave because his wife wasn't ``dead or in a coma'' was 
discriminated against because he's a man, a federal jury ruled in 
awarding $375,00 in damages to the man Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury agreed with Kevin Knussman's claims that he was  
deprived of his 14th Amendment right to equal protection and was 
illegally denied 12 weeks of leave guaranteed by the Family Leave 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing the Maryland State Police said they would  
file a motion asking U.S. District Judge Walter Black to examine 
the verdict to make sure the jury followed instructions correctly. 
Then they will decide whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict was read, Knussman hugged his attorneys and  
his wife, Kimberly, who wept quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we lost, it was a big win because we brought forth the  
treatment that I received in this process and we made those people 
accountable,'' Knussman, 41, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman, a 22-year state police veteran, sued the agency, three  
superiors and an administrator in 1995, alleging gender 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman, who claimed he was told only mothers are considered  
``primary care givers,'' said he was his newborn daughter's primary 
care giver because his wife was near death from childbirth 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This verdict sends a clear message it's illegal to deprive  
fathers of their rights,'' said Knussman's attorney, Sara 
Mandelbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman testified that he was told by Jill Mullineaux, the  
state police's manager of leave and benefits and a defendant, that 
he couldn't get additional leave unless his wife were ``dead or in 
a coma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman was given 10 days leave in December 1994 after his  
daughter, Paige, was born, and unsuccessfully sought more time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Betty Stemley Sconion, arguing for  
the state police, said during her closing arguments that the 
federal leave law didn't apply because Knussman wanted only paid 
sick leave while the Family Leave Act grants unpaid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman wasn't given more time off because he had exhausted his  
sick leave allotment for the year, she said.

<HEADLINE> UNLV Hot After Slow Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Things had gotten so bad for UNLV's Bill Bayno  
early this season that his point guard was being booed at home and 
another guard couldn't stop complaining every time he was taken out 
of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, the Runnin' Rebels were 4-6 and seemingly headed  
nowhere, despite having a ton of talent. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot can change, though, in just a month in college basketball.  
And it has in this gambling city where the Rebels are on a roll and 
Bayno is already making a pitch for them to get a bid to the NCAA 
postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind that this team can play with  
anyone in the country, bar none,'' Bayno said. ``If we can keep 
playing like this, there's no way the (selection) committee can 
look at us and say we can't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After sputtering through a tough early schedule that included  
losses to Cincinnati and UCLA, UNLV has won nine of its last 10 
games to get to a respectable 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Mark Dickel has recovered to lead the team through  
its winning stretch, even going so far as to take a punch in the 
face from Texas Christian's Lee Nailon to help UNLV win a crucial 
road game. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup guard Greedy Daniels isn't complaining quite as much  
about his playing time, and the rest of the Rebels seem to be 
coming together into a cohesive unit just in time to make a late 
bid for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've improved our defense and our chemistry has continued to  
get better every game,'' Bayno said. ``We've turned it on and 
gotten it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With seven games left in the regular season, UNLV has an outside  
chance to hit the magic 20-win mark before going into the 
postseason Western Athletic Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rebels had to win the WAC tournament at home last year,  
beating No. 3 Utah in the process, to get their first bid to the 
NCAA tournament since the days when Jerry Tarkanian was the coach. 
It didn't last long, with UNLV losing to Princeton in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are different this year, Bayno says, even though UNLV has  
followed the same script of playing erratically early only to gel 
coming down the stretch when center Keon Clark left the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We struggled a little but not the way we did last year,''  
Bayno said. ``We didn't have to deal with suspensions and kids 
coming back like we did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rebels have gotten strong games from sophomore center  
Kaspars Kambala, averaging 14 points and seven rebounds a game, and 
touted transfer Shawn Marion has been all he was supposed to be at 
18 points and nearly nine rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has been the emergence of Dickel, booed at home early in  
the season for inconsistent play, that has made the difference, at 
least in the eyes of his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent two-game home stand, Dickel had 19 assists and only  
one turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a guy who takes abuse because he's not flashy  
and not a good shooter,'' Bayno said. ``He takes the blame when 
it's not really warranted. But he's been the catalyst of this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no ranked teams among UNLV's final seven regular-season  
opponents, the Rebels have a chance to win 20 games. That might be 
enough to get into postseason play, even if UNLV can't repeat what 
it did last year in winning the WAC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our strength of schedule will help us,'' Bayno said.  
``We could have scheduled a season so we were 17-3 now instead of 
13-7. We could have just played two Top-25 teams and then play 
teams we can beat like a lot of other schools do.''

	LONDON (AP) -- Henry Winkler gave the thumbs up Tuesday to a  
stage version of his leather-clad king of '50s cool.

<HEADLINE> Ford Scrambles After Deadly Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. scrambled to bring in  
generators Tuesday and get its River Rouge complex back in 
operation after a deadly explosion halted work there and slowed 
production at other Ford plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	River Rouge contains a Mustang assembly plant as well as parts  
factories that make such things as engines, doors, hoods and glass. 
If production doesn't resume quickly, work will be slowed at 16 of 
the No. 2 automaker's 20 North America assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion at a power station Monday killed one person.  
Fifteen other workers remained in critical condition Tuesday. The 
cause of the blast was under investigation, but authorities 
suspected a boiler explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 10,000 workers at River Rouge awaited word on when  
they could return to work. Ford assembly plants in several other 
cities were also asked to scale back production. 
</P>
<P>
	River Rouge manager Art Janes wouldn't speculate on when  
production at the complex might resume. ``I just can't tell you 
until we push the button and see if it works,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to get at least part of the complex restarted, Ford  
hauled in six generators at its key stamping plant and four at its 
engine plant. 
</P>
<P>
	An automotive analyst said Ford, like other automakers, has a  
contingency plan to get parts from outside suppliers. That could 
minimize the production slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I foresee really no impact on Ford's earnings,'' said Richard  
Hilgert of First of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the explosion's effects were becoming more evident  
at Ford production sites elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker started trimming work hours at some of its other  
assembly plants in Wayne; Wixom; Lorain, Ohio; and St. Thomas, 
Ontario, Ford said in a statement Tuesday night. Of those sites, 
only Wixom would not return to full production Wednesday, Ford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime shifts were halted Tuesday at four other plants -- in  
Kansas City, Mo., Norfolk, Va., Oakville, Ontario, and St. Paul, 
Minn. -- that make Ford pickup trucks, Ford said. Of them, only the 
St. Paul plant would resume overtime shifts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre River Rouge complex was once the world's largest  
auto plant. Henry Ford built it in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in  
Dearborn, about seven miles west of Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Tim Dwight Heads Back to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Tim Dwight had better remember the  
limousines and the star treatment he received as a Super Bowl 
player for the Atlanta Falcons because all that is about to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight, a rookie who set a Super Bowl record with a 42-yard  
average on five kick returns -- including a 94-yard touchdown dash -- 
is returning to Iowa to finish up his degree and run track one more 
time for coach Larry Wieczorek. 
</P>
<P>
	When he played football at Iowa, Dwight also was a sprinter for  
the track team in the spring. This time, though, he's returning 
with celebrity status after his performance last Sunday in 
Atlanta's 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be interesting when we get him back here and we  
throw him in our gray-issued practice uniforms, put him in the back 
of a van, take him on a five-hour bus ride and give him $15 meal 
money that he has to sign for,'' Wieczorek said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then we put three track guys in a room. He'll draw the cot  
in the motel room. That'll be his welcome back,'' he said. ``We've 
got to humble him first, get him back to reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wieczorek was only kidding. He knows that Dwight won't raise a  
fuss and isn't looking for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing about him is that he'll take all that  
right in stride, at least he has in the past. I don't think they've 
spoiled him yet. He was a big star anyway when he was here, and he 
never asked for anything special,'' Wieczorek said. ``He was just 
one of the guys, so I'm sure he'll probably fall right back into 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight is enrolled at Iowa, the registrar's office said,  
although he is taking a mini-vacation before returning to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA requires athletes to take a minimum of 12 semester  
hours unless an athlete is in his last semester. Then, as in 
Dwight's case, they only need to finish up the courses that are 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is taking the right number of semester hours to be  
eligible,'' said Mary Lou Miller, assistant to the registrar. 
</P>
<P>
	Wieczorek said he expects Dwight to run in the outdoor season  
that begins in March, although he may not start competing until 
early April. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Dwight finished second in the Big Ten in the  
100-meter dash, fourth in the 200-meter event and led off Iowa's 
4X100 sprint relay team, which won the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be a Big Ten contender in the 100 and the 200, and he'll  
make our 4X100 real good, too,'' Wieczorek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight, who finished third in the 100-meters two years ago, was  
nosed out last year by Minnesota's Fred Rodgers, who also plays 
cornerback for the Golden Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Tim will be ready to go when he gets here. He  
wouldn't be coming back unless he really had some high 
aspirations,'' Wieczorek said. ``I'm sure he feels like he feels 
he's got some unfinished business to do here, some goals that are 
unaccomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Super Bowl, Dwight caught the opening kickoff and  
returned it 31 yards. Later in the first quarter, he rushed for 
five yards on a busted option pass. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, he had a gain of 18 yards on one kickoff  
and a 42-yard return on another. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, Dwight had a 25-yard kickoff return and  
then, with 11:01 to play, he fielded a kickoff on the 6, headed 
right, cut back left and sprinted through traffic on his way to the 
end zone for the Falcons' first touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dwight played for the Hawkeyes, much was made of the  
enthusiasm and intensity he brought to practice and games. 
</P>
<P>
	Wieczorek says Dwight brings the same spirit to the track squad.  
</P>
<P>
	``He does take it to another level, especially at those big  
meets,'' the coach said. ``His work ethic is just outstanding, as 
is his competitive ability and his enthusiasm for it all. It 
certainly does rub off on the other guys.''

<HEADLINE> Groundhog Predicts Early Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) -- Thousands of winter-weary people who  
waited through a rainy night were rewarded this morning: Groundhog 
Punxsutawney Phil didn't see his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	That means, according to legend, that spring is just around the  
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	A cheer went up as members of the local Groundhog Day club made  
the announcement, shortly after dawn. If Phil had seen his shadow, 
it would have meant six more weeks of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will feel winter's wrath, but spring is coming,'' said Bill  
Cooper, president of the Inner Circle, the club that stages the 
annual midwinter festival. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the same cheery news -- if you believe in such things -- in  
Lilburn, Ga., where Georgia's groundhog forecaster, Gen. Beauregard 
Lee, also failed to see his shadow. Cloudy skies shadows away when 
the 9-year-old rodent came out of his small mansion at 7:34 a.m., 
said Ruth Letowsky, a spokeswoman for the Yellow River Game Ranch, 
where Gen. Lee lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Groundhog Day tradition is rooted in a German superstition  
that if an animal casts a shadow on Feb. 2 -- the Christian holiday 
of Candlemas -- bad weather is coming. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the 110 years since German farmers began the festival in  
Punxsutawney, the morning of Feb. 2 has evolved into an elaborate 
show of hoodwinkery. 
</P>
<P>
	In years past, members of the club voted the night before  
whether or not Phil would see his shadow, rain or shine. Despite 
overcast skies last year, the club announced the shadow appeared. 
They set off fireworks to simulate a sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, club members insisted, they did not decide what  
Phil's decision would be until they actually approached his burrow. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement this morning estimated the crowd at just 15,000.  
Bad weather and a Groundhog Day in the middle of the week kept 
attendance down, but the crowd was full of enthusiasm for Phil. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Simmons made a four-hour trip from the town of Tunkhannock  
to be here. Asked why, he said: ``I have no idea. For the 
absurdity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something unusual,'' offered his friend, Sandra Peoples  
of Scranton. ``Something you can say you did once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And only once,'' added Simmons' wife, Jackie.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Ford Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The explosion rocked the massive Ford  
Motor Co. River Rouge Complex, then plunged it into darkness. Fire 
shot up into the sky as workers scrambled for safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were dead because of the way the stuff fell on us  
and pushed us to the ground,'' worker Brian Papke said. ``It was 
black and hard to breathe and the debris -- I didn't think we were 
going to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and 12 critically injured in the explosion  
Monday in the coal-powered generating station that fuels the 
sprawling complex's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen something like that since my days in Vietnam,''  
said Jerry Sullivan, president of the local chapter of the United 
Auto Workers. ``I saw people that were severely burned, severe 
abrasions all over their bodies. It was a terrible thing to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one workers were initially treated at Oakwood Hospital,  
said spokeswoman Jennifer George Robinson. Three were released and 
three others were in stable condition. The rest, including the 
critically injured, were transferred to other hospitals because of 
the severity of their burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of these gentlemen were thrown by the blast and  
suffered various head injuries,'' said Dr. Gary Christopher, 
director of emergency services at Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion at the No. 3 boiler was not  
immediately known, Ford officials said. ``The building shook, we 
thought it was an earthquake,'' said Art Janes, site manager for 
the complex, which makes the Mustang model. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. said gas was  
shut off at the complex, a standard procedure, and there was no 
evidence the explosion was gas-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services sent  
two inspectors to the site, spokeswoman Maura Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't make any assumptions,'' said Art Janes, Ford  
site manager. ``At this point in time, we have no idea what caused 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dearborn Fire Chief Jack McArthur said the debris at the scene  
would complicate the investigation. ``There's a lot of rubble, a 
lot of falldown,'' he said. ``This is going to be a complex kind of 
scenario to reconstruct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant generates enough power to serve a city the size of  
Boston, Ford spokesman Michael Vaughn said. It produces electricity 
for a complex that includes six different sites, including 
assembly, engine, tool and die, glass, stamping and frame plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the roof of the 78-year-old red brick building, which is  
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was gone and 
only metal girders remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Most windows were broken and blackened, and the ground around  
the plant was covered with twisted metal doors, debris and ash. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 employees were in the complex at the time, said Ford  
spokesman Jim Vella. About 10,000 people work at the six Ford 
factories still in operation at the Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched the building twice Monday, including once  
with state police dogs, for other victims. Another search was 
planned today. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem at the power station could cause a ripple effect  
that could be felt throughout Ford, Janes said. The stamping plant 
supplies 16 different assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto  
plant. Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst day of my life,'' Chairman William Clay Ford  
Jr. said. ``It's awful. Everyone who works at Ford is an extended 
member of the family.''

<P>
	SHELBYVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A man whose 6-year-old son was shot to  
death in the back seat of their car while the father was allegedly 
buying crack in a drug-infested Indianapolis neighborhood was 
arrested Tuesday on murder and neglect charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kile, 37, surrendered to authorities in the shooting  
Jan. 4 of his son, William. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the boy was shot by a drug dealer who fired at  
Kile's car during an argument with Kile over $20 worth of crack. 
The boy died eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Police contend Kile was responsible for the boy's death because  
he was committing a crime at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kile could get up to 89 years in prison if convicted on the  
charges, which also include supplying false information to police. 
Kile told police he had been looking for a puppy when his son was 
shot.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Fight Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deal to strengthen Social Security's  
finances is far from done, but Republican lawmakers and President 
Clinton have agreed to set aside a large chunk of government 
surpluses to pay for fixing the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	How to repair the fund that millions of Americans rely on still  
has to be hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heavy lifting on Social Security hasn't even begun,'' said  
Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and Means 
subcommittee that oversees Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw and other influential Republicans have been critical of the  
specifics of a Social Security plan Clinton outlined in the fiscal 
year 2000 budget he sent to Congress on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, said he believes agreement is possible this  
year ``if we work together across partisan lines and make some 
tough but fully achievable choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal, first announced in his State of the Union  
speech, would use 62 percent of the government surpluses expected 
over the next 15 years to beef up Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than $2.7 trillion by the latest projections, and  
could push the cash shortage now expected in 2032 back by more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have agreed to set that money  
aside for now. But the bipartisan accord on Social Security ends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants the government to invest a quarter of the  
$2.7 trillion in cash into the stock market to try to increase the 
money's value. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans strenuously object, saying that if the government  
becomes a Wall Street player, politics would inevitably corrupt 
free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rest of the money, Clinton would use a complicated  
accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt 
and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the president's fancy bookkeeping just compounds  
debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the 
government, without saying how they will ultimately be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling for negotiations to come up with a plan  
everyone can agree on. But both Democrats and Republicans have thus 
far avoided any discussion of the most difficult choices that may 
be needed -- whether to raise Social Security taxes or to cut 
retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible area of compromise: Clinton's proposal to use an  
additional 12 percent of the surplus to start new 401(k)-style 
investment accounts for most American workers. Essentially, the 
government would help subsidize people's own retirement savings, 
giving more money to low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would do nothing to fix Social Security, but could provide  
a cushion for future retirees if benefit cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans would eventually like to see some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks diverted into 
such accounts. That way, they say, the retirement program could 
benefit from stock market investments controlled by individuals, 
not controlled by the government.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Airline Posts 3rd-Qtr Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines posted a  
loss of 29 million guilders, or $14.8 million, in the latest 
quarter, citing weak global economic conditions and increased 
competition in North Atlantic service. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM said many airlines transferred flights from Southeast Asian  
routes to the North Atlantic following the financial turmoil in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, European Union antitrust investigators disclosed  
Tuesday they are taking a more detailed look into KLM's plans to 
raise its stake in the Dutch charter carrier Martinair Holland NV 
to a majority interest. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM's loss for the third fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 contrasted  
with a profit of 46 million guilders in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenue dropped to 3.1 billion guilders, or $1.6  
billion, from 3.2 billion guilders a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that performance in mainland Europe was  
``relatively strong,'' citing improved labor productivity and cost 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brusssels, the European Commission said it found ``grounds  
for serious doubts'' about whether KLM's plans to raise to 75 
percent its current 50 percent stake in the Martinair carrier would 
be compatible with the EU's fair trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch transport company Koninklijke Nedlloyd NV currently  
owns the remaining 50 percent of Martinair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission's main concern is charter flights from the  
Netherlands to Mediterranean vacation destinations where Martinair 
competes with KLM subsidiary Transavia. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also concerns about some regular flights from the  
Netherlands to the United States where KLM and Martinair are the 
principal or only carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under EU rules, the Commission investigates all major mergers  
and can block or demand changes to those judged to reduce 
competition unacceptably. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest inquiry into the Dutch airlines deal could last up to  
four months.

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Davis Avoids Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA's Baron Davis avoided being suspended by  
the Pacific-10 Conference on Tuesday by issuing a public apology 
for comments he made about the officiating after his team's 93-83 
loss at Washington two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a sophomore point guard, fouled out of the game with 4:34  
remaining and 13th-ranked UCLA trailing the Huskies 77-70. 
</P>
<P>
	After being called for his fifth foul, Davis was called for a  
technical foul after throwing his mouthpiece, and said after the 
game he believed the Bruins ``got cheated'' by referee Terry 
Christman. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA coach Steve Lavin excoriated Christman after the technical  
foul was called on Davis, and received two technicals and an 
ejection himself. Washington's Deon Luton then made 5-of-8 foul 
shots to give Washington an 82-70 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to apologize to basketball official Terry  
Christman and the Pacific-10 Conference for my comments following 
our game in Seattle on Sunday afternoon,'' Davis said in his 
statement, distributed to the media by the UCLA sports information 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game was a very emotional one for our team and I was very  
frustrated when the game ended. I said some things I shouldn't have 
said and I am sorry for my comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, from its office in Walnut Creek, Calif., the  
Pac-10 issued a public reprimand of Davis, placed him on probation 
for the rest of the season, and required him to make a public 
apology.

	Failure to apologize, Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said, would

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall as Dollar Loses Ground / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Tuesday as the dollar fell  
sharply against the yen and expectations heightened that the 
Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when its two-day 
policy-making meeting ends Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 7/8  
point, or $8.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.24 percent from 5.18 percent on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell Monday after an index compiled by the National  
Association of Purchasing Management showed manufacturing declined 
for the eighth consecutive month in January, but at a slower rate 
than during the previous seven months. The recovery was larger than 
economists had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	There was further evidence of a stronger economy on Tuesday, as  
the Conference Board reported a bigger-than-expected increase in 
its Index of Leading Economic Indicators in December, signaling 
above-average growth in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh signs of economic strength dampened hopes that the Fed  
on Wednesday would not need to stimulate the economy by lowering 
interest rates any further. There are worries, too, that the Fed's 
next move might be to raise rates to prevent the resilient economy 
from reviving inflation. Higher interest rates hurt the value of 
bonds and other investments that pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was boosted by rising interest rates in Japan and  
comments from a Japanese financial official who said his country's 
financial sector was set to improve as banks acquire public funds 
and restructure their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	With the yen more attractive and returns rising on Japanese  
investments, there was an incentive for some traders to pull money 
out of U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/8 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 1/4 point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index fell 4.05 points  
to 1,312.13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.51 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction to 4.41 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.56 percent, as the discount rose 
0.02 percentage point from the weekly auction to 4.41 percent. 
One-year yields were 4.58 percent as the discount rose by 0.03 
percentage point from late Monday to 4.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.50 percent from 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 125 1/4 from 125 5/8 late Monday. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.13 percent from 5.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Flyers Chase Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- General manager Bob Clarke deflects credit  
for creating the monster that is the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Neilson, the quirky coach with '60s hair and a sarcastic  
wit, can't find the words to explain the streak in which 
Philadelphia is unbeaten in 21 of 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers used to be simple to figure. Now, there's a lot more  
to Broad Street Bullying than Eric Lindros and John LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to play a more consistent game than last year,''  
Neilson said. ``We wanted to play better defensively. We wanted to 
be able to play a strong game, night after night, instead of ups 
and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be only a question of how far the Flyers can go.  
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia is 15-1-6 since Dec. 10 and 22-4-7 since stopping a  
seven-game winless streak Nov. 14. The Flyers beat Los Angeles 4-2 
Monday night for their sixth straight victory, moving five points 
ahead of New Jersey in the Atlantic and within three points of 
Dallas for the best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're feeling pretty good about ourselves,'' said  
Lindros, the once-uptight captain who is much more relaxed now that 
he doesn't have to carry the team. ``We're playing pretty decent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decent? Tell that to some of the Flyers' victims.  
</P>
<P>
	``They pretty much just toyed with us,'' Kings defenseman Rob  
Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three months of dominance can be traced directly to a  
series of controversial moves by Clarke, the captain on the Flyers' 
last Stanley Cup championship team in 1975 who is now the GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with the mix in the locker room, Clarke reacquired two  
former Flyers -- Mikael Renberg and Karl Dykhuis -- while unloading 
Chris Gratton, Mike Sillinger and popular defenseman Petr Svoboda. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, whose reign in Philadelphia appeared to be in jeopardy  
after last year's first-round playoff loss, wondered what was going 
on. Svoboda was a close friend with years of dedication to the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykhuis, who had a nondescript first tour with Philadelphia from  
1994-97, is leading a faster, younger, more aggressive defensive 
corps that isn't coughing up leads in the third period like last 
season. His nifty pass set up Keith Jones, another newcomer in a 
trade with Colorado, for a goal that put the Flyers ahead 3-1 on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Petr got traded, we talked about that and the deals that  
were made,'' said Lindros, whose 27 goals tie him for second in the 
league to linemate John LeClair (31). ``I think with our team, it's 
worked out well with what's gone on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone Clarke has acquired is contributing, including Valeri  
Zelepukin (nine goals) and Daymond Langkow (eight goals, 14 
assists). How did he know all the changes would work? 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't even know how to answer that,'' said Clarke,  
shrugging off the question as he scurried back to the owner's box 
during a recent game. ``I didn't do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke's boldest move was kicking Alexandre Daigle off the team  
because the 23-year-old forward nixed a trade to Edmonton for 
Andrei Kovalenko by refusing to sign a $1 million contract 
extension with the Oilers. Clarke quickly worked out another deal 
in which the Flyers got Kovalenko after all, and Daigle ended up 
with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko's arrival was delayed by visa problems, but the  
talented forward was expected to practice with the team for the 
first time on Wednesday. As for where he fits in, nobody seems 
worried. Everything else Clarke has done this season worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trades happen,'' Lindros said. ``Clarke makes trades because  
he feels it's going to better the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' newfound scoring depth has taken pressure off  
Lindros to carry this team back to the Stanley Cup finals, where 
Philadelphia was swept by Detroit in 1997. The defense is solid -- a 
hallmark of Neilson's teams -- and the offseason acquisition of 
goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck proved to be another great move. The 
Flyers have killed 41 of their last 43 power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always admired the strength of John and Eric, and Rod  
(Brind'Amour) as well, '' said Jones, who has thrived as the right 
wing for LeClair and Lindros. ``But I didn't realize the amount of 
talent that they have and the depth of players here. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing about this stretch here is, when we win the  
game, we get ready for the next one. We don't gloat about it or 
think we're better than we are.''

<HEADLINE> Jailed Abortion Seeker Gives Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A forger who claims a judge sentenced her to  
prison so she couldn't have an abortion has given birth to a girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuriko Kawaguchi had the child Monday in the San Francisco area,  
where her mother and sister live, said one of her lawyers, George 
Carr. She and the baby were doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawaguchi, 21, was arrested in May and pleaded guilty to forgery  
after she was caught buying computer equipment with fake credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced Oct. 6, when she was about 22 weeks pregnant,  
and released on bail Oct. 13, but she decided she was too far along 
to seek an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio law allows the procedure after 22 weeks only in unusual  
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pending lawsuit, Kawaguchi accuses Cuyahoga County Common  
Pleas Judge Patricia Cleary of violating her rights by imposing the 
sentence -- with credit for 4 1/2 months already served -- specifically 
to keep her from getting an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	During Kawaguchi's sentencing, the judge questioned her at  
length about the pregnancy and at one point said, ``I'm saying she 
is not having a second-term abortion.''

<HEADLINE> NKorea Said Increasingly Volatile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea's military discipline appears to  
be eroding, but there is no reduction in the massive threat the 
communist nation poses to U.S. and South Korean forces, the 
nation's top intelligence officials told lawmakers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging hearing, the officials named Korea, Iraq and  
international techno-terrorism as the key national security 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can hardly overstate my concern about North Korea,'' CIA  
Director George Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
``In nearly all respects, the situation there has become more 
volatile and unpredictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wretched living conditions deteriorate further, food shortages  
are acute, and few heavy industrial plants make anything, according 
to U.S. intelligence. Crime and a lack of discipline, even in 
military ranks, are more common and citizens are more likely to 
blame North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, for systemic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes, head of the Defense Intelligence  
Agency, cited intelligence reports that describe North Korean 
soldiers out of uniform, marketplace activity going on without 
governmental control, and frequent disruptions in the course of a 
military unit's training. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this will encourage the North to rely still more  
heavily on risky brinkmanship in its dealings with the United 
States,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, North Korea continues to expand its conventional military  
forces and its ballistic missile capability. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence is closely following a massive North Korean  
construction project at Kumchang-ni, an underground complex large 
enough to house facilities for making plutonium and other 
weapons-grade material for nuclear weapons, Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned that North Korea has a covert  
program,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyongyang is also developing a longer-range missile, the Taepo  
Dong 2, that could carry heavy payloads to Hawaii and Alaska and 
lighter-weight weapons to parts of the rest of the United States, 
Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Tenet nor Hughes see any reduction in tension with the  
Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. Though hampered by international 
sanctions, Iraq could, under the right circumstances, develop a 
large inventory of weapons of mass destruction, cruise missiles and 
short- and medium-range missiles and could expand its air and 
ground forces dramatically by 2020, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absent a fundamental change in governance, uncertain  
circumstances and a revitalization of military capability will be 
Iraq's direction,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared text submitted to the committee, Tenet described  
Saddam as ``more frustrated and desperate to break out of (U.S.) 
containment'' but cautioned that he maintains a firm grip on power, 
``leaving few vulnerabilities that can be exploited by those 
opposed to his rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is under increasing pressure from Congress to develop  
covert strategies aimed at toppling Saddam, though most Iraqi 
experts give the effort little chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrorism remains a key national security concern and Tenet said  
Americans and American interests are increasingly the target of 
international terrorists. Attacks by the suspected terrorist Osama 
bin Laden, believed responsible for last summer's U.S. embassy 
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, ``could occur at any time,'' Tenet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And terrorists use increasingly sophisticated techniques,  
including cyber-terrorism capable of wreaking havoc in America's 
increasingly computer-dependent society, Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two intelligence officials repeated their concerns about  
leaks of classified intelligence information to the news media and 
said the FBI is seeking to find the source of these leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our government is hemorrhaging (sensitive information) in a  
way that I have never seen in my lifetime,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	One underlying context of the sweeping and, at times, alarming  
assessment offered by Tenet and Hughes was a plea for bigger 
intelligence budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sticking my hand out for money today,'' Tenet said.  
But he added, ``You will always hear me being an unabashed 
advocate'' for devoting greater resources to intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Congress and the Clinton administration appear to support  
increased spending on intelligence. But in a hearing Tuesday of the 
House National Security Committee, Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the 
panel's chairman, noted that President Clinton's defense budget 
proposes cutting nearly $900 million added to last year's budget 
for missile defense and intelligence.

<HEADLINE> IOC Clears Sydney of Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
today cleared Sydney of any wrongdoing in connection with financial 
inducements offered on the eve of Sydney's selection as host of the 
2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive board member with oversight  
over the 2000 Games, reviewed the documents of Sydney's bid with 
Australian Olympics chief John Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is clear,'' Rogge said. ``It was legal, legitimate  
and according to the rules. There is absolutely no problem in the 
way it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No cash money was given, no under the table payment,'' Rogge  
said. ``Everything was straightforward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates disclosed 10 days ago that he had offered $70,000 in  
inducements to two African IOC members the night before the 1993 
vote on the 2000 host city. Sydney beat Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were made to bolster sports in Kenya  
and Uganda as part of an African aid program. The offer, made to 
the two IOC members from Kenya and Uganda, was contingent on Sydney 
winning the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations came amid the bribery scandal surrounding Salt  
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC said it 
would examine the Sydney bid but stopped short of opening a formal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``No single dollar was paid to Kenya before the election of  
Sydney in Monte Carlo in 1993,'' Rogge said. ``Everything was done 
afterwards, so there is absolutely no link between money being 
given and the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney did nothing illegal, and Sydney did what the other bid  
committees did. There's no difference in what Sydney did and the 
other bids. All the other bids had an NOC (national Olympic 
committee) support scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the Australian Olympic Committee had a program to  
provide scholarships to athletes and coaches from 11 African 
countries. As of Dec. 31, 1998, scholarships had been provided for 
56 athletes and 46 coaches at a cost of nearly $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns have been raised over Australia's payments to the  
Kenyan Olympic Committee, whose IOC delegate Charles Mukora has 
been ousted in connection with the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said two payments totaling $13,146 had been transferred  
to help fund junior Kenyan track and field teams in Australia. A 
third payment of $7,996 had been transferred to an account set up 
in the name of the Charles Mukora Sports Foundation in 1997, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the AOC was still trying to ascertain what the third  
payment had been spent on. He said the remaining money would be 
withheld if there is no clear explanation from the Kenyan Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC should now review the whole question of aid  
offered through Olympic bid committees. He suggested the 
possibility of prohibiting financial assistance to countries with 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rogge said he would go ahead with his trip to Sydney  
later this month. The visit had been intended, in part, as a 
mission to gather facts about the Sydney bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to Sydney as a gesture of showing commitment from  
the IOC,'' Rogge said. ``There is no inquiry whatsoever. I've 
cleared everything with John. There is no further need to look into 
papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was greeted with relief by Kevan Gosper, the  
IOC executive board member from Australia who had initially 
suggested the inducements could be viewed as a serious breach of 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy this has been resolved to clarify that the  
rules weren't broken by the Sydney bid team, and that it's off the 
agenda,'' Gosper said. ``It eliminates any doubt about an inquiry 
extended to Sydney. It will enable Sydney and Australia to get its 
focus on the preparations for the Olympic Games.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco's 2Q Profits Fall 37 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems reported $606 million in  
second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, a 33 percent increase from 
1997. The report barely edged Wall Street expectations, and share 
prices fell in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time expenses of $349 million related to four  
acquisitions, the computer networking giant earned 36 cents per 
share. Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted 35 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from continuing operations rose 40 percent to $2.83  
billion, up from $2.02 billion a year ago. Writeoffs from the 
acquisitions drove Cisco's actual net income for the three months 
ended Jan. 23 down 37 percent to $288 million, or 17 cents per 
share, from $457 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released after the markets had closed. Cisco's  
stock, which has nearly tripled since the market began rebounding 
in early October, fell $2.62 1/2 to $112.37 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares continued to fall in after-hours trading, suggesting  
that investors were disappointed that Cisco, one of the most 
popular technology stocks, didn't beat expectations by a wide 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, the world's biggest maker of equipment linking computers  
in networks, acquired Summa Four, Inc., Clarity Wireless Corp., 
Selsius Systems, Inc. and PipeLinks, Inc. for a combined purchase 
price of $537 million during the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Snowmobile Breaks Ice; Man, Son Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) -- A 46-year-old man and his 6-year-old son  
died after their snowmobile strayed onto treacherous ice and 
plunged into Lake Winnebago. 
</P>
<P>
	A snowmobile carrying another father and son who rushed to help  
also cracked through the ice Monday but they managed to clamber out 
of the frozen water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fog was a big contributing factor in this accident,''  
sheriff's Lt. Michael Powers said. ``The first snowmobile broke 
through and the second went to try and help but also broke 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Douglas B. Dochterman of Oshkosh  
and his son, Daniel. Their would-be rescuer, John Leyhe, 41, was in 
good condition today at Mercy Medical Center at Oshkosh. His son 
Martin, 7, was in good condition at another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Balgie said she was going out with her family when she  
stepped outside and heard the victims screaming for help at the 
mouth of the Fox River, about 45 miles southwest of Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to go shopping, but as soon as we got out of the  
house we could hear someone screaming, `Help me!' `Help me!''' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran as fast as we could, and my mom called 911. We could  
hear the little boy crying, too, but it was real faint and didn't 
last for long,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyhe said the group had been returning home from ice fishing,  
according to Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Jones. The man said he and his son 
were following the other pair when the group became disoriented in 
the fog. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Wesenberg, a member of the Otter Street Fishing Club,  
said the accident happened on a part of the lake where the currents 
make it dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We normally tell people to steer clear of that area,''  
Wesenberg said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Rules on Infant Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man who shook his crying 4-month-old son  
said he had no idea baby-shaking was dangerous, even possibly 
lethal. The California Supreme Court said only his actions 
mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously Monday that a parent or caretaker  
who directly harms a child can be convicted of felony abuse, 
punishable by up to six years in prison, if a jury finds the action 
posed a risk of serious injury or death. The parent's ignorance of 
the danger is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing intrinsically distinct about the act of  
violently shaking a vulnerable infant that separates it from other 
methods of direct child abuse,'' said the opinion by Justice Janice 
Rogers Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Bill Lockyer said the ruling allows prosecutors  
to ``better protect California's most vulnerable citizens.'' The 
crime is defined as willfully inflicting unjustifiable pain and 
suffering on a child under circumstances likely to cause great 
bodily harm or death. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Barry A. Zimmerman said the ruling appears to  
allow felony convictions in borderline cases, where a parent's 
conduct ``does not rise to the level of a vicious assault'' but has 
unexpectedly bad consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next case that comes up is going to be a parent that  
disciplined the child... spanking or slapping,'' Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case bore some similarity to the Massachusetts case of au  
pair Louise Woodward, convicted of murdering an 8-month-old by 
violently shaking him and slamming his head into a hard object. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge reduced the conviction to manslaughter and freed her,  
ruling that her actions, while unjustified, were not so dangerous 
that a reasonable person would have thought they were likely to 
cause death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the California case, 4-month-old Michael D. Sargent Jr. was  
found unconscious and not breathing on the floor of the family's 
Marysville apartment in August 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Michael Sr., first told police the child had fallen,  
but later admitted shaking him twice that day after losing his 
temper. He said he hadn't intended to hurt the baby and had no idea 
shaking could do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The child has fully recovered, Zimmerman said, quoting Sargent.  
</P>
<P>
	Sargent was convicted of felony child abuse and sentenced to 11  
years in prison, the maximum six years for the crime and five years 
for a previous felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeal overturned the felony  
conviction in December 1997, ruling 2-1 that the charge required 
proof Sargent knew or should have known how dangerous his conduct 
was. That ruling would have reduced the conviction to a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the so-called shaken-baby syndrome -- medical  
findings that shaking can cause serious injury to children up to 18 
months or 2 years old -- was developed only recently by doctors and 
was not widely known to the public in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's high court said Sargent was properly convicted  
because he deliberately shook the child without justification. The 
jury, not the parent, decides whether the act posed a risk of 
serious injury or death, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> ML Team Can Negotiate With Quezada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An unidentified major league team has acquired the  
negotiating rights for Dominican Republic outfielder Alejandro 
Quezada from Japan's Hiroshima Toyo Carp, a spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The major league team will pay $400,000 to the Carp if Quezada  
agrees to sign with the American club, Carp spokesman Takashi 
Hamada said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carp have not been informed which major league team bid for  
the rights to negotiate for Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quezada deal is the first under a new agreement that  
facilitates trades between the major leagues in America and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system allows major league clubs to bid for exclusive  
negotiating rights to any player made available by a Japanese club. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, players under contract with Japanese teams who  
wanted to move to the majors had to be released by their club or 
wait until they were eligible for free agency.

<HEADLINE> House Quietly Returns To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freed from the impeachment process now  
weighing down the Senate, the House begins its legislative year 
hoping to produce more laws and less political rancor. 
</P>
<P>
	The House ended the 105th session of Congress in December by  
impeaching President Clinton on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges. It gets back to work today on a far more ordinary note, 
amending a trade bill that will suspend duties on cancer and AIDS 
drugs and extending normal trade status to Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 106th session of Congress formally began on Jan. 6, but  
except for getting sworn in and listening to President Clinton's 
State of the Union address, House members have mostly stayed home 
while the Senate was preoccupied with the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The new House will be led by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who  
has promised a more bipartisan approach than that taken by his 
predecessor, Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are reduced to a smaller majority, with 222  
Republicans facing 211 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning 
independent, and Hastert will have little choice but to cooperate. 
A solidly Republican district near Atlanta will hold a special 
election this month to fill the seat vacated when Gingrich 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these bills are going to be bipartisan bills,'' John  
Feehery, spokesman for Hastert, said of the initial legislation 
before the House. ``We're trying to send a signal that we want to 
work with Democrats who want to work with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among bills on the House floor this week, the House will  
reauthorize a program to insure commercial aircraft flying troops 
and cargo into war zones and approve a six-month reauthorization of 
the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa.,  
proposed the short-term FAA measure to give him and Senate Commerce 
Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., time to work out 
differences in their approaches to the future of the aviation 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster wants to ensure that all airport taxes go to airport  
improvement programs, while McCain's emphasis is on improving 
services to smaller markets, and adding flights out of airports in 
Washington, New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also plans to take up a bill that would require cost  
analyses of bills that create financial burdens on citizens or 
small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The main GOP objectives this year are to save Social Security  
for future generations and reform health care, improve education 
and spend more on the military. The administration agrees with all 
those objectives, although with largely different approaches that 
will make compromise difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The main responsibility of Congress in the early days of the  
session is to consider the fiscal year 2000 budget submitted by 
Clinton Monday, and already political strains were showing. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said Monday  
that Republicans will insist on using future budget surpluses for 
tax cuts rather than the new spending sought by the president. 
Clinton's budget, he said, is ``completely in the wrong direction'' 
and is the ``first of what will be several lameduck budgets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders have also been trying to show they can do more  
than try the president, with the Senate Armed Services Committee 
moving last week to approve a 4.8 percent across-the-board pay 
raise for military personnel. This week the panel plans to vote on 
a national missile defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet talks to both House and Senate panels  
this week about threats to national security, and a Senate 
Appropriations hearing on fighting terrorism will hear from 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno 
and FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriations and tax committees hold hearings on the year 2000  
budget, with Defense Secretary William Cohen testifying to the 
House Armed Services Committee today and Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin talking taxes on both sides of Capitol Hill.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Mason Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Already faced with playing as many as 20  
games without leading scorer Glen Rice, the Charlotte Hornets 
learned Tuesday night that top rebounder Anthony Mason will miss 
the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason left practice Monday with what was originally diagnosed as  
a hyperextended right elbow. When the injury did not respond to 
initial treatment, he was sent Tuesday for a magnetic resonance 
imaging test, which showed a ruptured biceps tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery is being recommended to repair the damage, and it likely  
will take 4-6 months for rehabilitation, said Dr. Glenn Perry, the 
Hornets' lead physician. 
</P>
<P>
	New center Derrick Coleman rolled his eyes when asked about  
Charlotte's chances of contending in the Eastern Conference without 
Mason and Rice, who is recovering from elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There goes the season,'' Coleman said. ``It's going to be  
tough. I was looking forward to getting out there and playing with 
those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, signed at the start of camp, was expected to play a  
complementary role on a team that advanced to the Eastern 
Conference semifinals last season largely on the strength of Rice 
and Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rice, who was sixth in the NBA last season with a scoring  
average of 22.3 points, underwent an arthroscopic clean-out 
procedure late last month after a bone chip was discovered in his 
right elbow. He could miss the first five weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason, who last season averaged 12.8 points and was seventh in  
the league with a rebound average of 10.2, hyperextended his elbow 
while battling through a pick in practice Monday. The team 
originally thought he would not miss any significant amount of 
practice or game time, but the elbow did not respond to treatment 
and he was unable to work out Tuesday, so additional tests were 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating because those are our two best  
players,'' said coach Dave Cowens, whose team opens the regular 
season Friday night at home against Philadelphia. ``They're the 
guys who have been carrying us. They're a very important part of 
what we've done in the past. Now we just have to weather the 
storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice's small forward spot would likely be filled temporarily by  
either Chuck Person or Chucky Brown. Cowens said J.R. Reid would be 
the most likely candidate to take over for Mason at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever's in there is going to have to get the job done for us  
to be competitive,'' Cowens said. ``They'll have to play hard. 
They'll probably have to overachieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, who had spoken in recent weeks of hopefully being able  
to compete for a title, said he was not yet ready to give up those 
hopes because of the injuries to Rice and Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot harder. We can still do it, but it's  
going to be an awful lot harder,'' Cowens said. ``You're going in 
and you're not really whole like you planned on being when you 
started.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Leaders Closer to Stadium Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, House  
legislative leaders and team owners reached an accord Tuesday that 
could lead to $320 million for stadium construction in Philadelphia 
and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams would not have to repay the money, although they would  
have to collect an equal amount in state taxes during the next 30 
years. If that tax revenue falls short, team owners would have to 
pay the difference out of their own pockets at 10-year intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a day of negotiations, Ridge and House leaders said a  
vote on the proposal is likely Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers and Pirates in Pittsburgh and the Eagles and  
Phillies in Philadelphia seek new ballparks.

<HEADLINE> 'She's All That' Opens at No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the battle of the teen-age flicks at the  
box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That,'' about an attempt to turn a high school art  
geek into the prom queen, bumped the adolescent football movie 
``Varsity Blues'' from the No. 1 spot, according to final figures 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pygmalion-style story opened with $16.1 million, while  
``Varsity Blues'' dropped to third with $5.9 million. Overall 
business was down nearly 32 percent from the same weekend last year 
when there was no Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' remained in second place with $6 million, and  
``A Civil Action'' was fourth with $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' got a boost from its Jan. 24 Golden  
Globes wins, including best comedy or musical film, best screenplay 
and best actress in a comedy, Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	With added screens and business, the fictional tale about The  
Bard grossed $4 million for fifth place. After eight weeks in 
release, ``Shakespeare'' maintained a strong $5,320-per-location 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom'' was sixth with $3.6 million, ``The Thin Red Line''  
seventh with $3.3 million, ``You've Got Mail'' eighth with $3 
million, ``At First Sight'' ninth with $2.7 million and ``The 
Prince of Egypt'' 10th with $2.6 million.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lots of boxers talk a good fight. David Reid  
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I should lose, which I hate to say, it would be a learning  
experience,'' Reid said of his challenge to WBA super welterweight 
champion Laurent Boudouani of France on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Come again? Fighters don't talk about learning, they talk about  
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, listen to this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got us 50-50 (to win),'' said Al Mitchell, Reid's trainer.  
Aren't trainers supposed to say how their man will ``moider the 
bum?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, are these guys con artists?  
</P>
<P>
	Refreshingly, they are being honest.  
</P>
<P>
	Both know the 25-year-old Reid has the ability to take the  
154-pound title from the 32-year-old Frenchman. They also know the 
unbeaten Philadelphian will be fighting professionally for only the 
12th time, while it will be Boudouani's 42nd fight and his fifth 
title defense. His record is 38-2-1, 32 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing in this bout is speed,'' said Mitchell, in New  
York with Reid Tuesday to help promote the HBO-televised fight at 
Bally's Park Place in Atlantic City, N.J. ``If he can't handle 
David's speed, we'll win. If he can, we're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his brief career, Reid has been faced with a multitude of  
styles, and has shown he can win on points -- having gone the 
distance five times, including 12 rounds with James Coker in his 
last fight Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	It is power, however, that made Reid a celebrity. Trailing badly  
in the third round of the 156-pound final against Alfredo Duvergel 
at the Atlanta Olympics, Reid knocked out the Cuban with a right to 
the jaw. He was the only U.S. boxer to win a gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call that punch anything you want -- a money punch, a  
big punch,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was a money punch. He signed a five-year contract  
with America Presents that included a $1 million signing bonus. 
After going 7-0, Reid signed a multi-fight deal with HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Reid beat Boudouani, he would be the third member of the  
1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team to win a world title. Floyd 
Mayweather is the WBC super featherweight champion. Fernando Vargas 
is the IBF 154-pound champion.

<HEADLINE> Reggie White Wavers on Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- As Reggie White walked off the practice field  
Tuesday, he emphasized once again that the Pro Bowl is his football 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few moments later, as he made his way along the sidewalk  
to the all-stars' luxurious hotel, White added an ``unless ... '' 
of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was leaving the door cracked for the possibility of  
returning to play for the Green Bay Packers' new coach, his pal Ray 
Rhodes, for one more season, White smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a crack in my door when God talks,'' said  
White, an ordained minister. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who retired last April only to change his mind 48 hours  
later, said he had made the decision to retire this time after much 
consideration and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Rhodes took the Packers' job, causing White to ponder  
what it would be like to play for his former defensive coordinator 
at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already carefully considered everything, and I'm  
retiring,'' White said on the Pro Bowl practice field adjacent to 
the teams' hotel. ``Ray and I have talked, but at this point, I 
have made up my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While on the Green Bay staff, Rhodes helped convince White to  
sign with the Packers as a free agent in 1992. The arrival of the 
great defensive end proved the beginning of the team's return as an 
NFL power. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes undoubtedly would like to lure White back for one more  
go-around, since White, although 37, still led the league with 16 
sacks this season and was named the NFL's defensive player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said recently he doesn't think  
White was going to change his mind about retiring this time, Rhodes 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
	With or without him, White believes Rhodes is a good match for  
the Packers, who lost coach Mike Holmgren to Seattle after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really respect the type of person and the type of coach Ray  
is,'' White said. ``And sometimes, a change is good for a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, who has been a record 13-time Pro Bowl pick but missed  
two of the games with injuries, is scheduled to make his record 
11th appearance in Sunday's all-star game at Aloha Stadium. Ronnie 
Lott, Mike Singletary and Lawrence Taylor also played in 10 games.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants Halt to BellSouth Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has asked federal regulators to  
stop BellSouth Corp. from continuing to market a prepaid card that 
people can use anywhere in the country to make long-distance and 
other phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T contends the arrangement violates a provision of a 1996 law  
that bars BellSouth and the nation's four other regional Bell 
telephone companies from providing long-distance service to their 
local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth defended the legality of the card, which the company  
began marketing inside and outside the company's nine-state local 
phone region in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is completely legal,'' said Jim Harralson, general counsel  
for BellSouth Long Distance. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has been selling various forms of popular prepaid  
cards since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance service for the card is being provided by an  
unaffiliated company, U.S. South Communications, although the card 
is being marketed by BellSouth, said BellSouth spokesman Bill 
McCloskey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey did not know how many of the disputed cards, which  
people also can use for local and other phone services, the company 
has sold since December. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed its complaint to the Federal Communications  
Commission on Jan. 29, but announced the action Monday. It was 
filed under a new process to quickly resolve disputes. Under that 
process, the FCC must resolve the complaint by March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law says a Bell company must open its market to  
competitors and get FCC approval before it may provide 
long-distance service to local customers. No Bell has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC declared that separate marketing alliances US  
West Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp. -- both Bell companies 
-- had with long-distance company, Qwest Communications Corp., 
violated the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pacts, Qwest paid US West and Ameritech an undisclosed  
recruiting fee for each client in the Baby Bells' local phone 
regions that chose Qwest for long-distance service.

<HEADLINE> College of Charleston Back in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Charleston is back in style.  
</P>
<P>
	The College of Charleston has had this most Southern city of  
sweet tea, antebellum homes and debutante cotillions dancing to 
college basketball success the past decade with three NCAA 
appearances and five Trans America Athletic Conference crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Cougars (19-2), who defeated Georgia Southern 66-41  
Monday night, are back in the national spotlight, ranked No. 22 in 
The Associated Press college basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a mid-level program, to achieve a top 25 status is a dream  
come true for the players and the fans,'' Charleston coach John 
Kresse said. 
</P>
<P>
	An undefeated season was a dream that ended for No. 1  
Connecticut, now 19-1 after a 59-42 loss Monday night to Syracuse. 
The Huskies had been voted the top spot for the 10th straight week, 
but played without stars Richard Hamilton and Jake Voskuhl and fell 
for the first time in 16 Big East games. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1), voted No. 2 for the eighth consecutive poll, could  
take over the top spot if it gets by No. 7 Maryland and Georgia 
Tech this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Connecticut's loss, Duke and the College of Charleston are  
tied for the nation's longest winning streak at 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse was schooled by St. John's greats Joe Lapchick and Lou  
Carnesecca and has added a fast-moving offense to Charleston's 
chest-to-chest defensive style. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Cougars, whose streak began against No. 12 North  
Carolina on Dec. 5, appear headed for their third straight NCAA 
tournament and fourth appearance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, personally, the chance to do the Charleston again in  
the Big Dance is what it's all about,'' said Kresse, whose thick 
New York accent seems to fit down here a little bit better with 
every 20-win team he fields. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Cougars were moving up, Kansas fell out of the poll  
for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut got 52 first-place votes and 1,756 points, while  
Duke had the remaining 19 No. 1 votes for 1,720 points from the 
national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse and the Cougars last cracked the rankings in 1996-97,  
when they were on their way to the Trans America Athletic 
Conference title and a first-round NCAA upset of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The College, which went from NAIA to NCAA status in 1990, romped  
through the TAAC with an 80-6 mark and five straight titles from 
1994-98. The Cougars' 125-23 mark during that span -- the fewest 
losses of any Division I team -- included headline-grabbing wins 
against Georgia Tech, Arizona State and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the tougher and deeper Southern Conference, Charleston  
is showing the same dominance. It beat Massachusetts and North 
Carolina before Christmas and has started 11-0 in its new league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that we would definitely be in there a week or two  
after the North Carolina game,'' forward Carl Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been waiting and waiting and just seeing how the  
lower teams in the top 25 did,'' said guard Danny Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford fell one  
place to fourth. Kentucky and Auburn each moved up one, while 
Maryland dropped from fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the top 10 was Michigan State, St. John's and  
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances since Jan. 29, 1991, was the third longest current 
streak behind the 156 of North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) reentered the Top 25 after its 11th straight  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6), No. 24 last week, and Florida, No. 25 a  
week ago, both lost two straight to drop from the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Kresse said the Cougars hoped to make the top 25, but there are  
other, more important goals ahead, like a Southern Conference title 
and an NCAA tournament run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like this is one of the better teams we have been a  
part of,'' said Johnson, who transferred from Clemson two years 
ago. ``We feel we can do some damage. You just can't write us down 
as a loss when we get to the (NCAA) tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Kendall Accuses Starr of Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge is being asked to widen an  
investigation into whether Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
office has improperly leaked grand jury information in the Monica 
Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The new request Monday by President Clinton's lawyer, David  
Kendall, was prompted by a weekend report that Starr had concluded 
a federal grand jury has the constitutional authority to indict the 
president while he is in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall asked U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to  
order Starr to show why he and his staff should not be held in 
contempt for improper violations of grand jury secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told reporters that Starr's office ``engaged in illegal  
and partisan leaking'' related to the weekend report in The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr released a statement saying he was ``deeply troubled'' by  
the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office has no desire to inject itself into the  
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' the independent 
counsel said, adding that he was investigating to determine whether 
anyone in his office improperly disclosed information to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home whether he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson last year appointed an investigator to look into  
Kendall's previous allegations that Starr's office was responsible 
for leaks of grand jury material in the investigation of whether 
Clinton illegally tried to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Starr contended the White House and defense lawyers were the prime 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grand jury secrecy rule bars prosecutors, grand  
jurors and court personnel from disclosing grand jury information. 
An appeals court in Washington, D.C., said last year that protected 
information ``includes not only what has occurred and what is 
occurring, but also what is likely to occur,'' including the 
investigation's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, witnesses who testify before a grand jury are allowed  
to disclose what is said inside the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	The news report that Starr has concluded Clinton can be indicted  
in office drew criticism from senators as the Senate tries to find 
a way to end the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal scholars differ over whether a sitting president can be  
indicted. The Constitution makes clear that federal officials 
ousted through impeachment can be charged with a crime, but it does 
not spell out whether removal from office must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicting a president would ``seriously interfere with the  
ability of the president to govern,'' said New York University law 
professor Burt Neuborne. ``The time to indict him is after he 
leaves office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1997 that sitting  
presidents can be forced to face civil lawsuits over their 
unofficial acts. And some federal judges and members of Congress 
have been prosecuted while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar contends the  
president is unique because he is the sole head of the executive 
branch of government. If Starr obtained an indictment of Clinton, 
``he would be claiming for himself the power to imprison the chief 
executive officer,'' Amar told Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel suggested a  
president could be charged and perhaps even forced to go to trial 
while in office, but there was a ``strong argument'' that he could 
not be imprisoned until after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine University law professor Doug Kmiec said he believes  
the Constitution does allow a sitting president to be indicted. 
However, once a prosecutor has referred a case to Congress for 
impeachment, Kmiec said he believed it would be unwise to pursue it 
in criminal court as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's made his choice of avenues. I think he should  
rest with it,'' Kmiec said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pondering `Fact-Finding' Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, pondering an end to  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, are weighing a formal 
declaration that he ``willfully provided false and misleading 
testimony'' to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury last 
summer, congressional sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Republicans are laboring over a draft ``fact-finding'' document 
that also says that Clinton engaged in a course of conduct designed 
to ``alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of 
evidence and testimony'' in the sexual harassment lawsuit that 
Paula Jones filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft is subject to change, according to several officials,  
who said Republicans hope to attract the support of at least a few 
Democrats. In fact, it currently exists in two separate forms. One 
is a bare-bones recitation of the findings; the other employs 
identical language but refers to specific acts to buttress the 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither makes a finding that Clinton committed perjury or  
obstructed justice, as alleged in the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the emerging GOP strategy, the fact-finding declaration  
would be voted on before a final vote on the two articles of 
impeachment, which stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton is expected to be 
acquitted handily on both articles of impeachment, with virtually 
unanimous support among Democrats and the backing of some 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart attacked the GOP plan,  
telling reporters it sounded like ``going around the 
Constitution.'' Lockhart said senators have only two options in the 
trial, either to vote on the articles of impeachment themselves or 
to vote to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the White House remains receptive to a censure of the  
president, but only after the impeachment trial has ended. Some 
Democrats, including California's Sen. Dianne Feinstein, are 
working on censure proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	That distinction -- whether the formal criticism of Clinton is  
voted before or after the trial ends -- is shaping up as a crucial 
one in the political struggle between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials want any censure to occur outside the  
trial. Republicans want it voted on as part of the proceedings, in 
part to blunt any claims by the White House that the entire 
impeachment proceedings were a partisan effort by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans discussed the proposed findings in a closed-door  
session. The impeachment trial is in recess until Thursday, so key 
individuals in the case, Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney 
Blumenthal, can be questioned under oath by lawyers for the House 
prosecutors and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a GOP timetable in effect, debate and votes on a formal  
finding of fact could occur as early as next week. Any Republican 
proposal would be subject to amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The language in the current GOP draft says that Clinton swore to  
``tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth'' when 
called to testify before Starr's grand jury last Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully  
provided false and misleading testimony to the grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also says that with regard to the second article of  
impeachment, the Senate finds that Clinton ``engaged in a course of 
conduct designed to alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the 
existence of evidence and testimony related to a duly instituted 
federal civil rights action and a federal grand jury 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longer version of the draft cites numerous acts by Clinton  
in support of the two findings. 
</P>
<P>
	It says he provided false and misleading testimony about the  
nature and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, about 
prior ``false and misleading testimony'' in a deposition in the 
Jones lawsuit and about his efforts to ``shape the testimony of'' 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	In support of the claim that he sought to conceal evidence, it  
lists several points, including that Clinton encouraged Ms. 
Lewinsky to submit a false affidavit and sought to conceal his 
gifts to her.

<HEADLINE> 'Relativism' Comes to Stock Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The name may be the same, and the management  
team too, but there may be something different these days about the 
way your stock mutual fund is managed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a subtle distinction, not easily pinned down -- and many  
fund managers insist they haven't changed a thing. Yet several 
respected commentators have spoken up on the subject lately, and 
the issue merits your attention if you have any serious interest in 
stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The phenomenon is sometimes called ``closet indexing,'' or  
``benchmarking,'' or ``investment relativism,'' to use the phrase 
of John Bogle, senior chairman of the Vanguard Group, which runs 
the nation's second-largest fund family. 
</P>
<P>
	It refers to a tendency to manage a stock portfolio not for  
absolute return, but constantly against the model of the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500-stock composite index, a market standard that has been 
hard to beat in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	As the blue chip stocks that dominate the S&AMP;P 500 have  
flourished, most fund managers who own portfolios laden with 
smaller and medium-sized stocks have failed to keep pace. Motivated 
by self-preservation instincts, at least some of those managers 
seem to have adapted their style to keep their portfolios more 
closely attuned to the 500, hoping to beat it by a few percentage 
points over any measuring period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managers are extremely benchmark-sensitive, because they have  
learned that the S&AMP;P 500 is a formidable opponent,'' says Byron 
Wien, the well-known U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have also learned that funds that beat the index enjoy  
healthy flows of new cash, and those that lag seriously behind 
suffer redemptions. So it is good business to be aware of the 
fund's positions relative to benchmark weightings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Portfolio managers used to pick stocks in order to achieve  
superior absolute performance, thinking that if they were good they 
would have no trouble beating the index,'' Wien observed in a 
recent commentary. ``Now many keep a substantial portion of their 
portfolios in line with the index, while investing 25 percent to 50 
percent creatively depending on their level of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are right, they can pick up a few percentage points of  
relative performance and compare favorably with their competitors. 
If they are wrong, they shouldn't fall too far behind the index.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wien sees both good and bad in all this. ``Money management has  
become much more of a business and less of an art form. Since you 
are dealing with people's retirement assets, this is perhaps as 
constructive as it was inevitable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wonders, however, whether it might drive the most talented  
managers away from mutual funds toward other fields, such as hedge 
funds, where they could enjoy greater freedom to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle, famous for his outspokenness, takes a negative view. ``In  
the long run, investors will not be well served,'' he writes in his 
forthcoming book, ``Common Sense On Mutual Funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The benchmark supplants judgment. Portfolio managers invest  
not on the basis of analysis and conviction, but in relation to a 
market standard, gingerly shading the weights of their portfolio 
holdings somewhat higher or lower than those of the benchmark. In 
recent years, it seems to me, this strategic approach has become 
almost tacitly accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that philosophy the antithesis of professional  
investment management? Yet hasn't it become the formula followed by 
nervous portfolio managers anxious to hold their jobs? Isn't it the 
result of the marketing department's holding sway over the 
investment department? In each case, my finding would be: Guilty as 
charged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever you think of this trend, it's easy to see how it came  
about. Fund managers' customers, competitors and the financial news 
media are constantly holding them to the standard of the S&AMP;P 500, 
applying pressure that is almost impossible to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Closet indexers may run into trouble if the day ever comes when  
S&AMP;P 500-type stocks lag the rest of the market, and independent 
thinking starts taking the performance prizes again. But for now, 
it seems, they are only giving the customers what they demand.

<HEADLINE> Two Monks Charged With Indecency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLANCO, Texas (AP) -- In their flowing black robes and matching  
hats, the bearded monks of Christ of the Hills Monastery were for 
years merely a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	The faithful at the only Russian Orthodox monastery in Texas  
lived on a hilltop outside of town, welcomed outsiders who came to 
see their weeping icon of the Virgin Mary, and said little when 
they ventured into Blanco to buy groceries or mail letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, though, the monastery's quiet world of worship has been  
shaken and its relationship with Blanco townspeople strained by a 
sex scandal involving two monks. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel A. Greene Jr., 54, known as Father Benedict, and Jonathan  
Hitt, 37, known as Father Jeremiah, have each been charged with 
three counts of indecency with a child. The charges involve a male 
religious student who was living at the monastery in 1997. His age 
was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The monks, both Americans, were arrested in January and could  
get up to 20 years in prison. They are scheduled for arraignment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, of course, sad. But we know everything is in God's  
hands. He permits persecution and things to befall us as he sees 
fit,'' said Father Pangratios, a spokesman for the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the prosecutor nor the attorney for the monks returned  
calls for comment. Father Pangratios would not discuss the 
allegations, citing a gag order imposed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Hughes, an attorney for the Russian Orthodox Church Outside  
of Russia, said the church suspended the two monks in late 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very unfortunate situation, but the presumption of  
innocence is still in place,'' Ms. Hughes said. ``The church is 
very concerned for the welfare of everyone involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both monks are free on $50,000 bail and continue to live at  
Christ of the Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen people, ages 16 to 98, live at Christ of the Hills,  
maintaining a life of work and worship. They take vows of chastity, 
poverty and obedience and help sustain their community financially 
by making incense, mounting religious icons and selling candles and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
	Christ of the Hills was founded in 1967 and later became  
associated with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. The 
monastery moved from the San Antonio area to its site near Blanco 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, the monks have said a flat, wooden image of the  
Mother of God has wept tears of myrrh. Word of the weeping icon 
spread -- with the help of pamphlets and coupons -- drawing thousands 
of visitors each year, many of whom put something in the donation 
box or buy a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who come to see the icon must cover their heads with a  
scarf. If they are wearing pants, they must don one of the 
wraparound skirts the monks provide. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Blanco residents who have directed visitors to the  
monastery are upset over the charges and say they don't know what 
to tell tourists, many of whom also visit Blanco to shop and stroll 
the historic downtown square in this town of 1,300 people not far 
from President Lyndon B. Johnson's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just sad that it happened,'' said Judy Dorsett. ``You  
don't want to hear things like that, especially in a small town.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Gettysburg Tower Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A privately owned observation tower  
overlooking the Gettysburg battlefield would be purchased and torn 
down under the Clinton administration's budget proposal, the 
National Park Service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Preservationists opposed the construction of the tower in 1972  
and have advocated its removal ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5.7 million would go toward buying land around the  
battlefield, including the parcel on which the 310-foot tower sits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no better symbol for the need to preserve the  
Gettysburg battlefield than taking down this tower,'' Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's agency includes the National Park Service, which  
operates Gettysburg National Military Park. The 1863 battle fought 
there helped turn the tide of the Civil War in favor of the North. 
</P>
<P>
	The tower, which stands near the spot where President Lincoln  
delivered the Gettysburg Address four months after the battle, is 
owned by Overview Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the partnership could not be reached Tuesday for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Globe Reassigns 12 Editors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In changes he said were aimed at introducing  
``fresh blood and fresh ideas'' to The Boston Globe, editor Matthew 
Storin has reassigned 12 editors at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Storin announced the middle-management changes at a staff  
meeting on Monday. The reassignments are effective March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Assistant city editor Joe Williams will become city editor,  
taking over from Peter Canellos, who will become assistant managing 
editor for metropolitan news. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Assistant managing editor for metro news Teresa Hanafin will  
become assistant managing editor for technology, a new position. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Political editor Doug Bailey will take over as senior  
assistant metro editor and business editor Larry Edelman will be 
political editor. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Executive editor Helen Donovan, who now oversees the daily  
Globe, will switch responsibilities with managing editor Gregory 
Moore, who oversees the Sunday paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Storin said the Globe needed to take on challenges such as  
reversing a decline in circulation. The Globe's Sunday circulation, 
for example, dropped 1 percent over the six months ending Sept. 30. 
He attributed part of the drop to a price increase.

	Meanwhile, a friend of Ms. Edwards testified that Lyons' alleged  
mistress was living in Milwaukee without a bank account and 
worrying she'd be kicked out of her modest home for not paying 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The portrait of Ms. Edwards' dual lives emerged Monday in the  
racketeering trial against her and Lyons, president of the 
Nashville, Tenn.-based National Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair is accused of swindling more than $4 million from  
corporations seeking to do business with the powerful black church 
group, using the money to finance their own lavish lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	Josephine Hicks, a Milwaukee diner owner, said she loaned Ms.  
Edwards $3,000 for taxes she owed on her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she was in a bad situation at that time, around  
Christmas time,'' Ms. Hicks testified about the woman she knew as 
Bree Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hicks also cashed checks for Ms. Edwards because she did not  
have a bank account of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Ms. Hicks opened a bank account under the name J &AMP; H  
Associates so she would not have to cash the checks though her 
business account, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say more than $1.6 million was funneled through that  
account. Ms. Hicks said she was unaware of that, but was informed 
by the bank when a deposit exceeding $200,000 was made to the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked, 'Is it legal? Where did it come from?' My social  
security number is on that account and I don't want to be involved 
with the IRS,''' she told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hicks believed the money was coming from Ms. Edwards' job as  
public relations director for the convention, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxi cab driver Bud Kline, who met Ms. Edwards shortly before  
she and Lyons closed on a home, testified he drove her to 
department and jewelry stores for shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	She always paid, he said, with large amounts of cash she kept in  
her purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
about $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
intended to rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces another trial this spring on 54 federal charges of bank  
fraud, wire fraud, extortion and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' lawyers have said his failed business deals are not  
criminal matters.

<HEADLINE> Black MDs Won't Meet in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An association that represents black doctors  
pulled its 2001 convention out of Seattle on Tuesday because of the 
state's recent passage of an anti-affirmative action measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such legislative enactment is counter to the basic tenets upon  
which the National Medical Association was founded more than 100 
years ago,'' said Lorraine Cole, the organization's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 8,000 and 10,000 people usually attend the convention,  
said NMA spokeswoman Tomeka Rawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington, D.C.-based association, which represents 20,000  
black physicians, listed Denver, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, 
Baltimore, Nashville, Tenn., and Orlando, Fla., as potential new 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, nearly 60 percent of Washington state voters  
approved Initiative 200, although a majority within Seattle voted 
no. It bars state and local governments from giving preferential 
treatment to women and minorities in contracts, jobs or public 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Paul Schell plans to ask the association to reconsider,  
spokeswoman Vivian Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carlson, who headed the drive to put the initiative on the  
ballot, said the medical association's decision is ``their loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless their organization was founded on the tenets of racial  
quotas and preferences, they are seriously misreading Initiative 
200 because that's all that prohibits,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Who's Giving What to Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study of 16 of the most competitive  
congressional races last fall found political parties and outside 
interest groups spent almost as much as the candidates did. 
</P>
<P>
	The study funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts found the parties  
and interest groups spent at least $67 million. The 32 major party 
candidates in the 16 races spent $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters in competitive contests will be inundated with  
communications by mail, phone, print ads, and radio and television 
ads about the candidates,'' said David Magleby, chairman of the 
political science department at Brigham Young University and the 
project's principal investigator. ``Voters find it hard to 
distinguish candidate ads from those run separately by their 
parties and also assume many issue advocacy ads are also candidate 
commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was an attempt to document the millions of dollars  
spent on congressional races outside of the candidates' own 
campaigns. Since most of this money does not have to be reported to 
election regulators, the study sometimes did not include the cost 
of some efforts, such as a mailing or a get-out-the-vote drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic and Republican parties spent millions of dollars  
on behalf of their nominees, and transferred millions more to the 
state parties in key battlegrounds. Most of the money that went to 
the states was so-called soft money, donations from labor unions, 
corporations and individuals that are not subject to federal 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spent  
more than $560,000 on television ads in support of its nominee for 
Senate, Rep. Scotty Baesler, in Kentucky. The Kentucky Democratic 
Party, which received $1.5 million from the national party, spent 
another $1.7 million in TV ads. Baesler lost to Republican Rep. Jim 
Bunning, who was helped by $1.5 million in TV commercials paid for 
by the Kentucky GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Christian Coalition, the National Right to  
Life Association and the Campaign for Working Families ran ads, 
mailed literature, distributed voter guides and made phone calls in 
support of Bunning by focusing on Baesler's support of abortion 
rights. The AFL-CIO, on the other hand, ran a get-out-the-vote 
effort on behalf of Baesler. And Campaign for America, a group that 
supports campaign finance reform, spent $325,000 on television ads 
attacking Bunning.

<HEADLINE>  Soaring Flyers Chase Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- General manager Bob Clarke deflects credit  
for creating the monster that is the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Neilson, the quirky coach with '60s hair and a sarcastic  
wit, can't find the words to explain the streak in which 
Philadelphia is unbeaten in 21 of 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers used to be simple to figure. Now, there's a lot more  
to Broad Street Bullying than Eric Lindros and John LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to play a more consistent game than last year,''  
Neilson said. ``We wanted to play better defensively. We wanted to 
be able to play a strong game, night after night, instead of ups 
and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be only a question of how far the Flyers can go.  
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia is 15-1-6 since Dec. 10 and 22-4-7 since stopping a  
seven-game winless streak Nov. 14. The Flyers beat Los Angeles 4-2 
Monday night for their sixth straight victory, moving five points 
ahead of New Jersey in the Atlantic and within three points of 
Dallas for the best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're feeling pretty good about ourselves,'' said  
Lindros, the once-uptight captain who is much more relaxed now that 
he doesn't have to carry the team. ``We're playing pretty decent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decent? Tell that to some of the Flyers' victims.  
</P>
<P>
	``They pretty much just toyed with us,'' Kings defenseman Rob  
Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three months of dominance can be traced directly to a  
series of controversial moves by Clarke, the captain on the Flyers' 
last Stanley Cup championship team in 1975 who is now the GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with the mix in the locker room, Clarke reacquired two  
former Flyers -- Mikael Renberg and Karl Dykhuis -- while unloading 
Chris Gratton, Mike Sillinger and popular defenseman Petr Svoboda. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, whose reign in Philadelphia appeared to be in jeopardy  
after last year's first-round playoff loss, wondered what was going 
on. Svoboda was a close friend with years of dedication to the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykhuis, who had a nondescript first tour with Philadelphia from  
1994-97, is leading a faster, younger, more aggressive defensive 
corps that isn't coughing up leads in the third period like last 
season. His nifty pass set up Keith Jones, another newcomer in a 
trade with Colorado, for a goal that put the Flyers ahead 3-1 on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Petr got traded, we talked about that and the deals that  
were made,'' said Lindros, whose 27 goals tie him for second in the 
league to linemate John LeClair (31). ``I think with our team, it's 
worked out well with what's gone on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone Clarke has acquired is contributing, including Valeri  
Zelepukin (nine goals) and Daymond Langkow (eight goals, 14 
assists). How did he know all the changes would work? 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't even know how to answer that,'' said Clarke,  
shrugging off the question as he scurried back to the owner's box 
during a recent game. ``I didn't do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke's boldest move was kicking Alexandre Daigle off the team  
because the 23-year-old forward nixed a trade to Edmonton for 
Andrei Kovalenko by refusing to sign a $1 million contract 
extension with the Oilers. Clarke quickly worked out another deal 
in which the Flyers got Kovalenko after all, and Daigle ended up 
with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko's arrival was delayed by visa problems, but the  
talented forward was expected to practice with the team for the 
first time on Wednesday. As for where he fits in, nobody seems 
worried. Everything else Clarke has done this season worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trades happen,'' Lindros said. ``Clarke makes trades because  
he feels it's going to better the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' newfound scoring depth has taken pressure off  
Lindros to carry this team back to the Stanley Cup finals, where 
Philadelphia was swept by Detroit in 1997. The defense is solid -- a 
hallmark of Neilson's teams -- and the offseason acquisition of 
goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck proved to be another great move. The 
Flyers have killed 41 of their last 43 power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always admired the strength of John and Eric, and Rod  
(Brind'Amour) as well, '' said Jones, who has thrived as the right 
wing for LeClair and Lindros. ``But I didn't realize the amount of 
talent that they have and the depth of players here. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing about this stretch here is, when we win the  
game, we get ready for the next one. We don't gloat about it or 
think we're better than we are.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Boots Central Bank President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The Finance Ministry today replaced  
Francisco Lopes as president of Brazil's Central Bank, less than 
one month after being nominated to the post and devaluing the 
country's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Lopes will be replaced by Arminio Fraga, a former aide  
to billionaire financier George Soros. Fraga, who has a doctorate 
from Princeton University, was called ``one of Brazil's best 
economists'' in a news conference today by Finance Minister Pedro 
Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry said the government decided to overhaul the  
Central Bank to strengthen the institution following the recent 
shift in Brazil's foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Central Bank formally adopted a policy allowing  
the local currency, the real, to float freely against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since restrictions were lifted on Brazil's foreign exchange  
trading, the real has depreciated 32 percent against the dollar. 
The real weakened further today on news of the change at the 
Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The real had opened stronger this morning and had risen to 1.75  
to the dollar from the 1.91 at Monday's close. It dropped as far as 
1.84 after the announcement, then stabilized at around 1.80 to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened up  
1.5 percent but then dropped 3.43 percent by midday with traders 
using the announcement as an excuse to take profits after Tuesday 
8.8 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said the foreign exchange market is relatively  
calm, awaiting further details of the changes, as well as 
developments on the talks between the International Monetary Fund 
and the government's economic team, led by Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reorganization of the central bank board of directors  
represents no change in the free-float forex policy, nor in the 
general direction of the government's economic policy, which will 
be maintained with determination,'' the Finance Ministry said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said that both he and Lopes had offered to step down amid  
the economic turmoil facing the country, but that President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso wouldn't accept the finance minister's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga was a managing director at Soros Fund Management, a  
private New York-based investment management firm, where his main 
responsibility was investing strategies for emerging markets. He 
also has worked for the New York investing firm of Salomon Brothers 
and as chief economist at Banco de Investimentos Garantia in Rio De 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	He teaches at Columbia University's School of International and  
Public Affairs and has taught at other universities in the United 
States and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga also has served as a member of the board and a director of  
international affairs for Brazil's Central Bank, and was involved 
in previous negotiations with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's business community supported Fraga's appointment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a Central Bank president who knows both sides of  
the coin. He knows how to play against the Central Bank and not to 
give in to those who want to make easy money,'' said Mario 
Bernardini, vice-president of Sao Paulo Center of Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment should calm criticism that Central Bank  
doesn't know how to operate on foreign exchange markets, Bernardini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy, has been in  
talks with the IMF over the release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Fraga is confirmed, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho of the  
Central Bank will serve as interim president. Pending confirmation, 
Fraga will serve as a special advisor to Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry statement made it clear that Fraga is no longer  
associated with Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said that Fraga's views don't necessarily correspond with  
those of Soros, who has been a sharp critic in recent days of 
Brazil's decision to maintain high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after being appointed as Central Bank president on  
Jan.13, Lopes effectively devalued Brazil's currency, the real, by 
about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar by widening the range the 
two currencies could trade before the government intervened in 
foreign exchange markets to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later he allowed the real to be traded freely on  
foreign exchange markets. At one point last week, the real sank 
below two to the dollar for the first time since it was established 
in July 1994, representing a drop of more than 40 percent since 
devaluation.

<P>
	Malan said that both he and Lopes had offered to step down amid  
the economic turmoil facing the country, but that President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso wouldn't accept the finance minister's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga was a managing director at Soros Fund Management, a  
private New York-based investment management firm, where his main 
responsibility was investing strategies for emerging markets. He 
also has worked for the New York investing firm of Salomon Brothers 
and as chief economist at Banco de Investimentos Garantia in Rio De 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	He teaches at Columbia University's School of International and  
Public Affairs and has taught at other universities in the United 
States and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga also has served as a member of the board and a director of  
international affairs for Brazil's Central Bank, and was involved 
in previous negotiations with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's business community supported Fraga's appointment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a Central Bank president who knows both sides of  
the coin. He knows how to play against the Central Bank and not to 
give in to those who want to make easy money,'' said Mario 
Bernardini, vice-president of Sao Paulo Center of Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment should calm criticism that Central Bank  
doesn't know how to operate on foreign exchange markets, Bernardini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy, has been in  
talks with the IMF over the release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Fraga is confirmed, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho of the  
Central Bank will serve as interim president. Pending confirmation, 
Fraga will serve as a special advisor to Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry statement made it clear that Fraga is no longer  
associated with Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said that Fraga's views don't necessarily correspond with  
those of Soros, who has been a sharp critic in recent days of 
Brazil's decision to maintain high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after being appointed as Central Bank president on  
Jan.13, Lopes effectively devalued Brazil's currency, the real, by 
about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar by widening the range the 
two currencies could trade before the government intervened in 
foreign exchange markets to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later he allowed the real to be traded freely on  
foreign exchange markets. At one point last week, the real sank 
below two to the dollar for the first time since it was established 
in July 1994, representing a drop of more than 40 percent since 
devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Lawyer Seeks Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge has denied a defense lawyer's bid to  
declare a mistrial in a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco 
industry, despite an anti-tobacco ad that aired in Florida during 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second ad featured canned laughter alongside images of  
tobacco executives downplaying the dangers of smoking while 
testifying before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial ran during halftime Sunday only in Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	A defense attorney representing Phillip Morris Inc. in the  
lawsuit, which is the first by smokers to reach the trial stage, 
expressed concerns Monday that the ad, as well as news stories 
about the spot, may have tainted the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a line that gets crossed somewhere,'' Robert Heim told  
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Robert Kaye. ``The issue is whether we 
have crossed that line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Rosenblatt, the lawyer representing an estimated  
half-million Floridians who say smoking made them sick, called 
Heim's motion ``hypocritical beyond belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblatt noted the campaign that produced the spot is financed  
with funds from Florida's $13 billion settlement with tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you accept their argument, no case could ever go to trial  
because there will always be something,'' said Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Heim previously had expressed concerns about the jury's  
integrity Jan. 20 after President Clinton announced during his 
State of the Union address federal plans to sue cigarette makers 
for the costs of caring for sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did at that time, Kaye asked jurors if they had seen or  
read anything about the tobacco issue that might influence their 
deliberations. Those who had seen the beginning of the Super Bowl 
commercial said they had avoided viewing all of it and assured the 
court they were still impartial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to avoid everything that's out there,''  
said one juror, who told Kaye he went to the kitchen for a snack 
when he realized the nature of the Super Bowl spot. ``But I do my 
best to block it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pleased with the panel's responses, Kaye denied the mistrial  
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are seeking at least $200 billion in damages.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Philip Morris, the defendants are R.J. Reynolds  
Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco 
Co., Liggett Group Inc., and Miami's Dosal Tobacco Corp., as well 
as the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Boots Central Bank President </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The Finance Ministry today replaced  
Francisco Lopes as president of Brazil's Central Bank, less than 
one month after being nominated to the post and devaluing the 
country's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A note distributed by the Finance Ministry said the replacement  
was part of the ``changes being made in the Central Bank's board of 
directors to strengthen the institution in view of the recent 
changes made in the country's foreign exchange policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note said Lopes' replacement does not ``represent any

overall economic policy guidelines, which will be maintained.''

<HEADLINE> Scandal Aside, Most Favor Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans show overwhelming support for Olympic  
athletes and the corporations that pay their way to the games 
despite the Salt Lake City corruption scandal, according to a 
survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents in the survey requested by the U.S. Olympic  
Committee also said that major changes were needed in the system 
for selecting Olympic host cities and that greater oversight was 
necessary of groups planning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1,000 people questioned by Wirthlin Worldwide, an independent  
research firm, 73 percent said Olympic sponsors deserved their 
support and 74 percent said their view had not changed since the 
bribery scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games broke late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling, conducted last Thursday through Sunday, also found  
that 83 percent viewed the Olympics positively and 19 percent were 
more positive about U.S. Olympians than before the scandal. Three 
percent said they were more negative about Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, with a sampling error of plus or minus 3  
percent, were welcomed at the USOC's headquarters, where there has 
been concern that the scandal would turn off both 
multimillion-dollar sponsors and individuals who routinely account 
for up to 18 percent of the committee's four-year, $400 million 
budget through direct-mail and fundraising donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are not only encouraging for sponsors but express  
the public's support for U.S. athletes,'' USOC president Bill Hybl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the USOC's marketing chief and deputy general  
secretary whose office arranged the survey, said the results were 
in line with previous samplings that found Olympic athletes highly 
regarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more a reaffirmation than a surprise, but it comes at  
a time when we all need some good news,'' Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the USOC and its teams came off virtually unscathed in the  
survey , the International Olympic Committee and its site-selection 
process did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found 73 percent said ``significant changes'' were  
needed in the IOC's host-city selection program and 83 percent said 
Olympic organizing committees should be watched more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that reflects what we expect to see happen -- that  
there will be serious reforms on the part of the IOC,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled in a continuing  
investigation of the Salt Lake scandal, in which bidders handed out 
cash, scholarships and lavish gifts to try to lure votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that conducted the survey for the USOC is run by  
Richard Wirthlin, a member of the hierarchy of the Salt Lake-based 
Mormon church. Krimsky said Wirthlin Worldwide, with headquarters 
in Washington, was recommended to him by Burson &AMP; Marsteller, a New 
York-based public relations firm.

<HEADLINE> Antibiotics Ward Off Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- People who have taken two kinds of common  
antibiotics are less likely to suffer heart attacks, according to a 
study that bolsters the tantalizing theory that infections may be 
an important cause of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were quick to emphasize that people shouldn't start  
taking antibiotics to prevent heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is just another piece of evidence in the puzzle,''  
said Dr. Hershel Jick, a Boston University professor and author of 
the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The known contributors to heart attacks -- such as high blood  
pressure, high blood cholesterol and smoking -- fail to account for 
many cases, so doctors believe other causes are probably lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that unseen infections cause inflammation of the  
heart arteries, allowing fatty deposits to find a better foothold. 
</P>
<P>
	That may explain why aspirin is so good at preventing heart  
attacks. Besides interfering with blood clotting, aspirin relieves 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	In this study, two types of antibiotics -- tetracyclines and  
quinolones -- were associated with a lower risk of heart attack. 
Other antibiotics -- penicillins, macrolides, sulfonamids and 
cephalosporins -- were not. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings make sense because the germ suspected of causing  
heart disease, Chlamydia pneumoniae, is most vulnerable to 
tetracyclines and quinolones, Jick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug -- which is in the same family as the bacteria that cause  
the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia -- usually attacks the 
lungs, causing illnesses ranging from mild bronchitis to pneumonia. 
But many people have the germ and aren't sick. 
</P>
<P>
	To tease out the possible role of infection, the researchers  
analyzed the medical records of 3,315 British patients who suffered 
heart attacks but had no known risk factors for heart disease. The 
researchers studied Britons because their national health system 
tracks all prescriptions and diagnoses. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with 13,139 patients who had never suffered heart  
attacks, the heart-attack subjects were only 70 percent as likely 
to have taken tetracyclines and 45 percent as likely to have taken 
quinolones in the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart  
Association, said it is much to early to consider prescribing 
antibiotics to people at risk of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He said people should focus instead on the known strategies for  
lowering the risk of a heart attack -- quitting smoking, keeping 
blood pressure and cholesterol levels down, eating well and getting 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jick also echoed many doctors' concerns that overuse of  
antibiotics could increase the problem of drug-resistant bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Seventh Chicago Alderman Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A seventh Chicago alderman was indicted Tuesday  
on charges of taking payoffs in the federal government's undercover 
sting operation called Silver Shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	Percy Z. Giles, 47, is expected to be the final City Council  
member indicted in the investigation, which went public three years 
ago, U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles said he is ``totally innocent'' but declined to comment  
further. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other Chicago aldermen have been indicted in the  
investigation in which an admittedly corrupt contractor, John 
Christopher, acted as a mole for the FBI and made 11,000 tape 
recordings of talks with politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of them have been convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Giles is charged with racketeering, extortion, mail fraud and  
filing false tax returns, among other charges. The indictment says 
he took $10,000 from Christopher in exchange for promising to help 
a Christopher company get business. A former Giles aide already in 
prison was also indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 18 people have been charged in Silver Shovel.

<HEADLINE> Credit Repair Scam Grows Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Solomon Bradford and his wife thought  
they found the answer to their financial problems: a business 
promising to fix their credit record for $250. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the advice of the credit repair company, the Bradfords  
went to the bank and got a loan for a new home -- something they had 
been denied in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also unwittingly committed a federal crime:  
substituting their Social Security number with another number so 
their credit record would come up clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no free lunch,'' says Bradford, a Baptist minister in  
Columbia, S.C., who realized something was wrong when the credit 
repair company gave them a different Social Security number to use. 
``There is no quick fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford, who is blind, said his disability makes him  
particularly wary of people who might take advantage of him. ``One 
thing I don't like is being preyed on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of consumers, eager to believe promises that they  
can ``erase'' their bad credit, have fallen for credit repair scams 
which actually turn them into criminals by advising them to use a 
false identification number to apply for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and National Association of  
Attorneys General announced legal action against 43 such scams 
operations Tuesday, and warned consumers against handing over money 
to businesses that claim to provide ``brand new'' credit files. 
</P>
<P>
	``They prey on people who are plagued by poor credit -- people  
who may be desperate to develop a clean credit history so they can 
get a loan, get a job or buy a car,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who chairs NAAG's  
consumer protection committee, calls these cases ``just the tip of 
the iceberg'' for a fraud being spread far and fast on the Internet 
and in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation works like this: Businesses seek out consumers who  
have been denied loans or credit cards based on poor credit 
histories, sometimes sending letters to people who have filed for 
bankruptcy. For anywhere from $29.95 to $400, the companies promise 
to provide consumers with instructions on how to develop a new 
credit identity, through a process called ``file segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies then sell consumers instructions on how to apply  
to the Internal Revenue Service for an employer or taxpayer 
identification number. These numbers are intended primarily so 
businesses can set up a tax account for their filing purposes. And 
in fact, the IRS on the application form offers this warning: ``An 
EIN is for use in connection with your business activities only. Do 
NOT use your EIN in place of your Social Security number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the scam operations tell consumers to do exactly that -- use  
the numbers instead of their Social Security number in credit 
reports or loan applications, enabling them to start a fresh, new 
credit record. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of the Treasury's inspector general for tax  
administration has already conducted 108 investigations of 
individuals who sold or used the employer identification numbers to 
defraud creditors, resulting in 58 indictments or guilty pleas on 
charges including misrepresenting a Social Security number, mail 
fraud and conspiracy. The office is investigating an additional 205 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The scams are expensive for both businesses and consumers. The  
Treasury's tax administration inspector general estimates that as 
much as $400 million in fraudulent loans and credit has been 
established across the country, a cost that often is absorbed by 
the businesses providing credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from file segregation, other credit repair scam operations  
have managed to defraud consumers by promising to clean up credit 
histories for exorbitant prices. In 1998, consumers on average lost 
$725 to telemarketers promoting fraudulent credit repair services, 
up from $568 in 1997, according to the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, consumers can obtain information about their credit  
history and correct inaccuracies for free. Legitimate companies 
also can counsel consumers on how to fix errors in their report and 
how to rebuild their credit, but they can't simply erase a poor 
credit history, warns Susan Grant, director of the National Fraud 
Information Center, a program of the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not inaccurate, it can't be fixed,'' she said.

<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Japan's Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone  
Corp. has agreed to raise its stake in Smart Communications Inc., 
the Philippines largest mobile phone company, a major shareholder 
of Smart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholder Metro Pacific said NTT had agreed to pay $215  
million for an additional 22 percent stake in Smart, increasing the 
Japanese company's interest in the mobile phone provider to 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Pacific said it would sell some of its shares to NTT,  
reducing its stake in NTT would fall to 38 percent from 46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Pacific's parent, First Pacific Co. and other First  
Pacific affiliates will also sell some of their Smart shares to 
NTT. NTT will also acquire some newly-issued shares of Smart, Metro 
Pacific said 
</P>
<P>
	Smart's senior financial adviser Peter Lawrence said the  
transactions are expected to be apporoved by NTT's board later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deals, the combined shareholding of the First Pacific  
group would still be a controlling 56 percent of Smart. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart now claims 50 percent share of the Philippine mobile phone  
market, with its subscriber base of 791,000. It also operates a 
fixed-line network with 110,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart has postponed several times its plan to hold an initial  
public offering of shares due to poor market conditions.

<HEADLINE> NHRA's Larry Dixon in Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- The way Larry Dixon and his crew opened  
last season, many felt the addition of new crew chief Dale 
Armstrong was the key to a championship-winning season for Don 'The 
Snake' Prudhomme's Top Fuel team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon, from San Diego, defeated Jim Head to win NHRA's  
season-opening event at Pomona Raceway one year ago in a thrilling, 
side-by-side finish. It was an emotional victory for the 
second-generation driver: His father also is a past Winternationals 
Top Fuel winner (1970). 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was perfect about that weekend,'' Dixon said. ``It  
was quite an emotional weekend all around. It couldn't have turned 
out any better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, the victory celebration was short-lived. At Phoenix, Dixon  
was a first-round loser. At Gainesville, Fla., he appeared in his 
only other final round of the season, a runner-up effort to Kenny 
Bernstein. What followed was an onslaught of first-round losses and 
missed opportunities. Dixon finished seventh for the second year in 
a row in the series sponsored by Winston. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon says the quick win at Pomona was merely a mirage.  
</P>
<P>
	``It made it look like since Dale came aboard that he was the  
missing piece of the puzzle and we were going to be really strong 
in 1998,'' Dixon said. ``As it turned out, we struggled with the 
summer combination and fell behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had problems getting the car down the track. But after Dale  
and the guys developed the five-disc clutch we started to run well 
during the last part of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon recorded a career-best elapsed time of 4.562 seconds at  
the Revell Nationals, and the team seemed to have a winning 
combination figured out following semifinal efforts at the fall 
event in Dallas and the Winston Finals. Dixon hopes the momentum 
gained during the final half of the season will provide a boost as 
the team enters the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	It begins Thursday with the Winternationals 4-7 at Pomona  
Raceway. The $1.7 million race is the first of 22 events. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the offseason we tried to make some gains from 1998,''  
said Dixon, who posted a 4.53 second run during pre-season testing 
in Tucson, Ariz. ``Dale and the guys worked to fine-tune the 
five-disc clutch combination and focused some on engine 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a year to grow as a team with Dale on board and I  
think we'll see some positive results this season. We're excited 
about the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon says the strategy for winning races hasn't changed, it's  
only got quicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to winning now is running quick,'' he said. ``It's  
hard to believe, but 4.65 (seconds) isn't going to win races 
anymore. You've got to be able to run 4.50s to get the job done.''

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm To Lay Off Nearly 700 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Telecommunications company Qualcomm Inc. will  
lay off nearly 700 people because of slow sales of its digital 
phone technologies in the poor-performing economies of Latin 
America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the current reduction, combined with other  
cost-cutting measures, is necessary to assure our competitive 
position in the rapidly growing wireless communications market,'' 
Qualcomm founder and Chairman Irwin Jacobs said in statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 6 percent of Qualcomm's total work  
force of more than 11,000, which ballooned from 1,000 employees in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts were made at all levels, but most were in the company's  
Wireless Infrastructure Division, which was recently combined with 
the Communications Systems Divisions to create Qualcomm Wireless 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will provide severance packages and career  
counseling to 350 full-time employees at the company's headquarters 
in San Diego, 110 full-time employees at the company's 
international offices and 220 temporary employees. Another 250 
employees will be reassigned to other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm spokesman Jeff Felk would not disclose details of  
severance packages, but he said the company estimates it will take 
a $20 million charge in the second quarter as a result of the 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the company reported first-quarter revenues of $941  
million, the highest in its 13-year history and a 20 percent 
increase over the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Murderer Saved by Pope in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- With help from Pope John Paul II,  
convicted murderer Darrell Mease got taken off death row. The move 
may be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are considering additional murder charges against  
Mease, who was sentenced to die for the fatal shooting of a 
paraplegic man, only to be saved last week when Gov. Mel Carnahan 
commuted his sentence at the urging of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my boss tells me to sic 'em, I'll go get him,'' said  
prosecutor Jim Justus, who handled the case in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease was convicted of gunning down 19-year-old William  
Lawrence. He also was charged with murdering Lawrence's 
grandparents, but was never tried for the two killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier stories, The Associated Press erroneously reported  
that Mease was convicted of all three murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began reviewing the case Monday after two members of  
the victims' family pleaded for new charges. A daughter, Rosemary 
Brown, met with prosecutors for over an hour Monday, and did not 
return a call Tuesday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Justus said the family, which is large and scattered, was split  
on whether to try Mease again after Carnahan commuted his sentence 
to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them have been just vehemently against it, saying `No  
it's behind us,''' Justus said. ``Some don't care, as long as he 
never gets out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor drew widespread criticism last week when he  
commuted Mease's sentence after a meeting with the pope. Carnahan 
has insisted that he is not bound by his ``act of mercy'' for 
Mease. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's spokesman, Chris Sifford, said it was ``highly  
unlikely'' that the governor would ever again be faced with a plea 
from the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	``That in itself would be extraordinary,'' Sifford said. ``It  
would be impossible for me to speculate on what he would do.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Settles Molestation Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines settled a lawsuit Tuesday  
filed on behalf of a 6-year-old boy who said he was molested by a 
teen-ager during an overnight layover between flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement are confidential, both sides said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection for a trial had begun Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope and pray that I have made a difference and we  
continue to make a difference and this does not happen to anyone 
else's child,'' said the boy's mother, identified in court 
documents under a fictitious name to protect her son's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy said a 14-year-old boy sexually assaulted him when the  
airline put them up in the same hotel room after they missed 
connecting flights at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International 
Airport during a blizzard Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Both children were flying alone under the airline's  
unaccompanied minor program and did not know each other. The 
airline no longer puts unrelated minors in the same room, even with 
parents' consent, said Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager, who denied wrongdoing, was not charged.  
Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue 
criminal charges because of the children's ages and the 
circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Philanthropist Paul Mellon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paul Mellon, a renowned philanthropist who  
donated hundreds of works of art to the National Gallery of Art and 
other museums, died Monday at his home in Upperville, Va. He was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1964, Mellon and his wife had given 913 works of art to  
the gallery by artists that include Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, 
Auguste Renoir, Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Pablo Picasso and 
Vincent van Gogh. Among the most famous: Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red 
Waistcoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon was the son of Andrew W. Mellon, the industrialist and  
financier who in 1937 founded the museum on the national Mall in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon's birth in 1907 into one of the nation's wealthiest  
families allowed him to pursue his interests in art and 
philanthropy and also a successful stint as a championship 
horse-breeder. His horse, Sea Hero, won the Kentucky Derby in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine last year estimated Mellon's wealth at $1.4  
billion, ranking him as the 124th richest American. 
</P>
<P>
	A private service will be held at an undetermined date in  
Upperville and the gallery also plans a memorial service, museum 
officials said. The gallery also will organize a memorial 
exhibition presenting his legacy of gifts to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modest and kind, he was one of the greatest philanthropists of  
our time and a gentleman in every sense,'' said Earl A. Powell III, 
the gallery's director. ``He leaves an extraordinary legacy to 
future generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon contributed to a wide variety of charitable  
organizations, but especially supported higher education, the arts 
and humanities, conservation and veterinary research. He helped 
create the gallery's soaring, modern East Building and the Yale 
Center for British Art in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon also contributed toward the purchase of Cape Hatteras  
National Seashore in North Carolina and gave the land for Sky 
Meadows State Park to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon and his sister, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, were their family's  
second generation of major benefactors to the national gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Mellon, the gallery's founder who donated his famous art  
collection to the nation, was a Pittsburgh industrialist and 
financier. He also served as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1931 
and as U.S. Ambassador to Britain from 1931 to 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon is survived by his wife of 50 years, ``Bunny,'' the  
former Rachel Lambert Lloyd. Other survivors include his daughter, 
Catherine Conover, and son, Timothy, from his first marriage to 
Mary Conover Brown, who passed away in 1946; and three 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE>  World Cup Ski Race Sees Rare Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Hermann Maier of Austria and Lasse  
Kjus of Norway skied to an unprecedented tie for the gold medal in 
the men's super-G on Tuesday as the World Alpine Ski Championships 
got off to a roaring start. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Knauss of Austria was the unluckiest man of the day,  
finishing a mere hundredth of a second off the lead only to have to 
settle for a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	First-place ties have occurred seven times in the history of  
World Cup ski racing, and there have been other races in which the 
top three were separated by a hundredth of a second. But neither 
had ever occurred before in a world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, last year's super-G World Cup champion and winner of  
three of four super-Gs this season, started eighth and thrilled a 
jubilant Austrian contingent with a first-place time of 1 minute, 
14.53 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The next racer, Knauss, pressed Maier's pace all the way down  
the Birds of Prey course, only to miss the gold by the narrowest of 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	What was already the closest world championship race ever got  
even closer when Kjus, who started 12th, closed the margin at every 
interval on the way to the finish. The crowd gasped as his time was 
posted and Maier and Knauss shook their heads in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	The race more than made up for Monday's snowstorm that wiped out  
what was to have been the opening event of these championships, the 
women's super-G at nearby Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who won the Olympic super-G last winter, now has gold  
medals in the two most important ski competitions while Kjus 
improved one spot from his silver-medal performance in the 1997 
world championships super-G at Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Norway's third straight gold in the event, after Atle  
Skaardal won the super-G in the 1996 and 1997 worlds. The super-G 
was canceled because of bad weather in the 1993 worlds at Morioka, 
Japan.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Lower; Dow Falls 137 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower this afternoon, as  
rising in U.S. interest rates were seen as compromising future 
corporate earnings, at the same time investors were taking profits 
for the second day in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 137.23 at 9,208.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well, led by technology  
stocks , with the Nasdaq composite down 54.78 at 2,455.34, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite off 21.32 at 1,251.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses on Wall Street began early in the session after Japanese  
stock prices declined in overnight trading, as interest rates in 
Japan rose to their highest levels since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher Japanese rates sent U.S .bond prices lower on the  
anticipation that investors would begin routing some of their funds 
away from U.S. securities and into Japanese fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 25/32 point, and  
its yield, which moves opposite the price, rose to 5.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in domestic interest rates occurred just as the Federal  
Reserve began two days of policy meetings. Fed watchers do not 
expect the central bankers to change interest rates in this 
meeting. Recent evidence of robust domestic growth would argue 
against raising them, but the risks posed by financial turmoil 
overseas would be a reason not to lower them, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the higher rates today reminded stock investors that  
companies are going to have to rely on strong earnings -- and not 
lower interest rates -- to keep their stock prices aloft, said Tom 
Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a tough transition point,'' he said, because while  
fourth-quarter earnings reports were generally strong, ``most 
investors don't have a lot of confidence in earnings'' going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors took profits in technology stocks. The Dow  
industrials were led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 4 3/16 at 77 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was leading Nasdaq stocks lower and down 1 7/16 at  
106 9/16, while on the New York Stock Exchange, America Online was 
down 4 11/16 at 166 1/2 in heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, investors got more evidence that the economy is  
strong when the Conference Board, a private research group, 
reported that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 
percent to 106.5 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, which signals above-average growth in the months to  
come, was stronger than economists had expected, and it fueled 
worries that not only is the Fed unlikely to ease any time soon, 
but it might actually raise interest rates in a bid to cool the 
strong economy and rocket-high stock prices. Higher interest rates 
would raise corporate borrowing costs and could dampen earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 11 to 5 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 670.14 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Self-Help Legal Software Faces Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Do-it-yourself lawyering is under attack in Texas,  
where a federal judge says he will ban the sale of some self-help 
legal software. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders says the software amounts  
to the unauthorized practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas court battle has national implications for law  
practice and software authorship, and the issue could wind up 
before state legislatures and the U.S. Supreme Court, lawyers said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Texas has become the first state in the nation to move  
toward outlawing such ``cyberlawyer'' software, others have 
considered action against publishers of self-help legal manuals 
that provide assistance with wills, prenuptial agreements and other 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion that is sparking the debate came from Sanders, who  
said he plans to bar Parsons Technology Inc. from distributing 
future copies of Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer 
'99 in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders determined late last month that Quicken's law program  
goes beyond merely distributing blank legal forms and ``falls 
within the range of conduct that Texas courts have determined to be 
the unauthorized practice of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected the Iowa company's arguments of free expression.  
</P>
<P>
	``Texas is the only state that has taken a position that a book  
or a software program can constitute the practice of law,'' said 
Darrell E. Jordan, who represents Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company will seek a rehearing once Sanders' opinion  
is final and appeal his judgment to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Dorner, a lawyer in Londonderry, N.H., and a member of the  
American Bar Association Governing Council of the Law Practice 
Management Section, said Texas is apparently the first state to 
aggressively pursue action against do-it-yourself law materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They then found it necessary to go to federal court and a  
judge has agreed with them. That seems to sound like they are on 
reasonably solid ground,'' Dorner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Warner, publisher of Berkeley, Calif.-based Nolo Press,  
said he would consider a ban on his company's manuals ``taking a 
step back 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fundamentally, half the people in Texas can't afford all the  
legal help they need and one-quarter can't afford it at all,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolo lawyer Peter Kennedy in Austin said the ruling did not show  
anyone has been harmed by legal software. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long before Texas was a republic, settlers came to this state  
carrying their lawbooks with them -- not lawyers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> VRomney Eyed for Salt Lake IOC Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mitt Romney, a millionaire venture  
capitalist with Utah roots, is the front-runner to take over 
leadership of the besieged committee organizing the 2002 Winter 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who has dabbled in politics while helping to build Bain  
Capital Inc. in Boston, has been approached about the job, a source 
knowledgeable about the search for a new Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gov. Mike Leavitt is not yet ready to say Romney is the  
person who will help steer the committee away from the scandal 
enveloping the Olympics, he and SLOC chairman Robert Garff are 
preparing to announce a reorganization of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes could be expanding the committee's board of  
trustees ``to add more voices,'' as well as changes in the ethics 
policy, said Vicki Varela, Leavitt's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization would include a new executive committee of  
the board that does not include longtime members Spence Eccles and 
Verl Topham, two prominent executives that were enlisted during 
Salt Lake's bidding for the games to watch over staffers now blamed 
for excesses, said another knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization also likely will add a chief operating  
officer to SLOC's management ranks so the job of organizing the 
games can remain on track while the new chief executive works to 
restore faith in Salt Lake's ability to manage the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Jackson, who held a similar job during Calgary's 1988  
Winter Games and serves on the IOC Coordination Commission 
overseeing preparations for 2002, is considered the front-runner 
for that chief operating officer job. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senior Vice President Dave Johnson, forced to resign on  
Jan. 8 because of his role in the bid effort, had performed much of 
that job. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Massachusetts  
Democrat Ted Kennedy for his U.S. Senate seat in 1994, would 
replace Frank Joklik, who stepped down as chief executive during 
the Jan. 8 housecleaning. His father was the late George Romney, 
governor of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, was traveling and did not immediately return phone  
calls left at Bain Capital on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prefers not to comment at this point,'' said Charley  
Manning, a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik has said he knew nothing about the lavish spending by  
fellow bid boosters that triggered what has become the Olympic 
movement's biggest corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have turned up at least $1 million worth of cash  
payments, scholarships, travel and medical expenses, and gifts 
given to members of the International Olympic Committee before it 
voted in 1995 to give Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik remains as acting president until a new chief executive  
takes over, but will leave under a cloud after a report that he 
used his position as chief executive of Kennecott Corp. to pressure 
suppliers to donate to Salt Lake's Olympic bid and to snub those 
that did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday disclosed details of a memo  
Joklik, serving as volunteer chairman of the bid committee, wrote 
to Kennecott employees in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is particularly attractive to Leavitt and the Olympic  
community because his background was scoured by Republicans and 
Democrats in his 1994 senatorial race and was found untarnished by 
impropriety, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The descendant of early, prominent Mormons, Romney has served in  
the lay clergy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
presiding over a group of congregations in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is a graduate of Brigham Young University, Harvard  
Business School and Harvard Law School and lives in Belmont, Mass., 
and Park City. He has five sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond finding someone skilled in business, two criteria have  
been key in the search for a new chief executive: that he has a 
reputation for integrity and the personality to rally Utah 
residents bruised by the scandal. Seventy percent of the state's 
residents are members of the Mormon church, based in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is on the board of directors for the Boy Scouts of  
America and is a vice chairman of the National Points of Light 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone of the stature of Mitt Romney were willing, we'd be  
thrilled,'' said Henry Marsh, a SLOC board member. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--The White House led the call for the scandal-plagued IOC to  
clean up its act on the opening day of the IOC drug summit in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. Barry McCaffrey, a White House adviser on 
drug policy, and British Sports Minister Tony Banks called for 
reform and most speakers demanded that a proposed international 
anti-doping agency be independent of the IOC. President Juan 
Antonio Samaranch has proposed that he oversee the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax records show that in the two years before Atlanta won the  
1996 Olympics, its bid team spent $7.8 million to lobby IOC 
members. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution detailed the payments on 
Tuesday, but said it was not suggesting the millions spent by 
Atlanta's bid team were improper. 
</P>
<P>
	--A survey of 1,000 Americans showed overwhelming support for  
Olympic athletes and the corporations that pay their way to the 
games despite the Salt Lake City corruption scandal. Respondents to 
the survey, requested by the U.S. Olympic Committee and conducted 
by research firm Wirthlin Worldwide, also said major changes were 
needed for selecting host cities and how they plan the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--The USOC has been served a subpoena from the U.S. Justice  
Department, which is investigating the Salt Lake bid. Spokesman 
Mike Moran said investigators want documents, and USOC will deliver 
them. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC cleared Sydney of any wrongdoing in connection with  
financial inducements offered on the eve of Sydney's selection as 
host of the 2000 Summer Games. Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive 
board member with oversight over the 2000 Games, concluded the 
$70,000 in inducements were within the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said no additional action would be  
taken against Kenyan IOC member Charles Mukora, who confirmed a 
grant from Sydney went into his personal trust rather than to help 
Kenyan sports. Mukora resigned after being expelled from the IOC 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	--The city board in Lillehammer, Norway, moved to protect the  
image of its 1994 Winter Olympics by voting to open sealed records 
from its 1992 and 1994 bids and appoint a commission to study them. 
Lillehammer insists it has a clean record and does not want it 
tainted by the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Utah's House of Representatives voted 60-14 for a bill that  
would establish a special Olympic oversight committee consisting of 
a dozen legislators to review the 2002 Olympic budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jordan Tanner, R-Provo, said the intent was not to manage  
the Olympics, but to ensure taxpayer money invested in the games is 
paid back. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russia's Olympic chief said Russian sport is in ``grave  
danger'' because of the prolonged investigation into his alleged 
involvement in the Salt Lake City scandal. Vitaly Smirnov has 
denied any wrongdoing in receiving a Browning rifle and arranging 
free medical treatment in Utah for a former Soviet ice hockey star. 
He is one of three IOC members still under investigation by an 
internal panel. 
</P>
<P>
	--Memos revealing the contents of a destroyed accounting book of  
Nagano's expenditures in its winning Winter Olympic bid have been 
discovered, according to a Japanese news report Wednesday. The 
Nagano bidding committee spent $17.9 million to secure the 1998 
Games, including $45,000 for a chartered train ride for IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, the mass-circulation Mainichi 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes duplicate parts of a 90-volume accounting book that  
was ordered burned in 1992, reportedly because it contained 
``secret information,'' the Mainichi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano officials said they were unable to confirm that such  
memos exist.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Close Cold War-Era Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's ``greatest need right now'' is  
to rid itself of Cold War-era bases that are consuming money better 
spent on troops and weapons, Defense Secretary William Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen was testifying before the House Armed Services Committee  
today, arguing for Congress to give him the base-closing authority 
it denied him the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was making a case for President Clinton's proposed $261  
billion defense budget, which asks Congress to authorize military 
base closings in 2001 and 2005. It makes no mention of how many 
bases, or which ones, ought to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The last round of base closings was in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our greatest need right now is for congressional approval of  
two additional rounds'' of closings, Cohen said at a Pentagon news 
conference Monday. He said the closings would begin generating 
savings by 2005 and would ultimately save more than $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cohen himself acknowledged Monday, base closings are a hard  
sell in Congress. Lawmakers are wary of upsetting constituents in 
communities that fear losing the economic benefit of military 
activity. In each of the past two legislative sessions Cohen asked 
for base closings and Congress said no. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Defense Department budget for 2000 is $261 billion,  
compared with the $264 billion projected to be spent in the current 
budget year. The 1999 budget includes $4.5 billion in extra money 
Congress appropriated to improve overall military preparedness and 
to pay for the Bosnia and Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Monday a key goal of the 2000 defense budget is to  
improve conditions for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting harder to recruit and harder to retain quality  
people in this very strong economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposes a 4.4 percent military pay raise in  
2000, but Senate Republicans already are pushing for a bigger 
increase. The Senate Armed Services Committee last week recommended 
a 4.8 percent raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending plan is roughly in line with Republican calls for  
increased spending to modernize the military's weaponry, improve 
troop living conditions and invest in a national defense against 
missile attack.

<HEADLINE> Women's Super-G Postponed in Vail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- In preparing for her second appearance in the  
World Alpine Ski Championships, Monika Kovacs planned on a quick 
run down the super-G course followed by quick getaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs and the 42 other super-G racers were forced to change  
their plans Monday as the first event of the championships was 
postponed until Wednesday because of poor visibility caused by 
blowing snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' Kovacs said. ``I wanted to start today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs, the only Hungarian competing in the women's super-G, had  
reason to be anxious after the delay was announced. Scheduled as 
the 43rd and final racer, she was worried she might not get to 
compete at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old skier and her father, Barnabas, had planned to  
leave Colorado today because they didn't not know if they would be 
able to get another flight to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kovacs were able to adjust their travel plans, and race  
organizers are hoping they have similar success with the weather 
heading into today's men's super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the right decision,'' said Svein Mundal, technical  
director for the International Ski Federation (FIS). ``Poor 
visibility, a lot of snow made it hard to hold a good line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs acknowledged that taming the technically demanding  
International super-G course would have been difficult because of 
the snow flurries that continued throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Though flat at the top, the mile-long course features several  
steep drops, including Pepe's Face, where American Picabo Street 
suffered a season-ending knee injury during downhill training in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't see,'' Kovacs said. ``You couldn't see the little  
jumps. It's impossible to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kristine Kristiansen also applauded the decision to  
reschedule the super-G. Slated to be the eighth racer down the 
hill, she faced slow conditions in the fresh powder. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this weather, it's just as well there's no race,'' she  
said. ``I would've been a snowplow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postponement dampened an otherwise spirited day as the  
championships returned to Vail for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten-year-old skiers were honored before the race, and an  
international blend of fans rang cowbells and blew horns for two 
hours before the first forerunner left the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine splashed the finish line for about five minutes but  
quickly disappeared for good, leaving race favorites Alexandra 
Meissnitzer of Austria, Regine Cavagnoud of France, and the German 
duo of Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl on ice until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of skiing,'' Canada's Sara-Maude Boucher said. ``If  
you get in a bad mood because of that...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Boucher, Kovacs is not among the favorites but is taking a  
positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs, who has been training at the Bartsch Academy in Austria,  
finished 41st in the super-G and 27th in the giant slalom at the 
1997 championships in Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	She has not competed in a World Cup event this season, instead  
focusing on the less-demanding FIS circuit.

<HEADLINE> China To Close Major Trusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China said today it will shut down five  
of its biggest state investment trusts as part of a plan to 
overhaul dozens of troubled financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The shaky finances of Chinese trusts were highlighted last month  
when one of the biggest went bankrupt with $4.3 billion in debts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the state newspaper China Securities News, the  
trust subsidiaries of China's four biggest state banks and its 
government insurance company will close. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper did not say what would happen to the staff and  
assets of the companies, including 160 securities trading outlets 
owned by the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Such state-owned trusts were created in the late 1980s to drive  
market-oriented economic reforms. But many became mired in debt 
after indulging in stock and real-estate speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the country's 240 trusts are on the verge of bankruptcy,  
according to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials say they are trying to protect the country's  
financial system by separating trust companies from state bank 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Securities News, the companies affected will be  
Dongfang Trust and Investment, owned by Bank of China; Huarong 
Trust and Investment, of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of 
China; Changcheng Trust and Investment, controlled by Agricultural 
Bank of China; China Construction Bank's Xinda Trust and Investment 
and the investment arm of People's Insurance Co. of China. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms have two months to close operations, the newspaper  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Lower; Dow Falls 137 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower this afternoon, as  
rising in U.S. interest rates were seen as compromising future 
corporate earnings, at the same time investors were taking profits 
for the second day in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 137.23 at 9,208.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well, led by technology  
stocks , with the Nasdaq composite down 54.78 at 2,455.34, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite off 21.32 at 1,251.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses on Wall Street began early in the session after Japanese  
stock prices declined in overnight trading, as interest rates in 
Japan rose to their highest levels since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher Japanese rates sent U.S .bond prices lower on the  
anticipation that investors would begin routing some of their funds 
away from U.S. securities and into Japanese fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 25/32 point, and  
its yield, which moves opposite the price, rose to 5.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in domestic interest rates occurred just as the Federal  
Reserve began two days of policy meetings. Fed watchers do not 
expect the central bankers to change interest rates in this 
meeting. Recent evidence of robust domestic growth would argue 
against raising them, but the risks posed by financial turmoil 
overseas would be a reason not to lower them, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the higher rates today reminded stock investors that  
companies are going to have to rely on strong earnings -- and not 
lower interest rates -- to keep their stock prices aloft, said Tom 
Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a tough transition point,'' he said, because while  
fourth-quarter earnings reports were generally strong, ``most 
investors don't have a lot of confidence in earnings'' going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors took profits in technology stocks. The Dow  
industrials were led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 4 3/16 at 77 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was leading Nasdaq stocks lower and down 1 7/16 at  
106 9/16, while on the New York Stock Exchange, America Online was 
down 4 11/16 at 166 1/2 in heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, investors got more evidence that the economy is  
strong when the Conference Board, a private research group, 
reported that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 
percent to 106.5 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, which signals above-average growth in the months to  
come, was stronger than economists had expected, and it fueled 
worries that not only is the Fed unlikely to ease any time soon, 
but it might actually raise interest rates in a bid to cool the 
strong economy and rocket-high stock prices. Higher interest rates 
would raise corporate borrowing costs and could dampen earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 11 to 5 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 670.14 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes $10M Bigotry Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to examine how bigotry  
affects people through a $10 million research program that will 
study anecdotal reports of racism and come up with a way to measure 
the impact of racial bias in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton proposed that the  
money go to various federal agencies that collect or use population 
data, from the Justice Department to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. The goal is to convert anecdotes into a set of facts 
that can help calculate how racism affects people when they seek 
jobs, housing, insurance, medical care and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start with a better understanding of the facts,''  
said Harvard University law professor Christopher Edley, who is 
advising Clinton as he drafts a report on race in America. ``Too 
many people mistakenly think that discrimination is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the agencies would look to measure straightforward  
discrimination, then expand into hard-to-measure forms of bigotry. 
For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would 
try to assess discrimination in rental housing, then expand into 
looking at whether property insurers avoid writing policies on the 
basis of race or residence in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Labor Department could begin by collecting  
information on what happens when people of different races seek 
their first jobs, then advance into researching how employment 
practices are used to exclude minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies, Edley said, are a natural vehicle for the  
research because they already collect reams of data. The job would 
be too costly for private entities, such as foundations or 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government publishes authoritative data on  
everything from the size of soybeans to the wage rates in the 
clothing industry. We need authoritative data measuring the extent 
of discrimination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10 million is a direct response to a recommendation from  
the seven-member advisory board that conducted Clinton's ``One 
America'' national dialogue on race, which ended last September. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory board suggested that Clinton create an index called  
``Citizens' Indicators of Racial Disadvantage'' to measure the 
presence of bias by analyzing data on discrimination in housing, 
hiring, education and credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the social science data needed to create such an index do  
not yet exist. Current government research, gathered mainly through 
census data, measures little more than general disparities between 
racial groups in areas such as income or education. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton wants to be able to quantify something more  
elusive, such as differences in treatment according to race, gender 
or other variables when it comes to issues such as obtaining health 
care, applying for an apartment or getting an entry-level job. 
</P>
<P>
	Edley said he hopes for a strong bipartisan consensus ``that  
scientific evidence on this topic is a critical ingredient'' but 
added that the White House is vulnerable before Congress that is 
eager to approve a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, budget politics will determine the outcome,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> `Dragging Death' Judge Issues Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Demonstrators will be barred within a  
two-block radius of the courthouse when testimony begins in the 
trial of a white man accused in the dragging death of black man, a 
judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Joe Bob Golden's ruling bars the display of  
firearms or other conduct that might ``intimidate, influence, or 
otherwise disrupt or endanger the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anything to impair the verdict,'' Golden said.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony is scheduled to begin Feb. 16 in the trial of John  
William King. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, and two other white men are accused of killing James  
Byrd Jr., 49. The three allegedly beat Byrd then chained him to a 
pickup truck and dragged him nearly 3 miles to his death on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the men's arrest last summer, Jasper's courthouse square  
has been the scene of two Ku Klux Klan demonstrations as well as 
marches by black activists. Confrontations never went beyond heated 
words. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no groups have contacted Jasper officials about  
organized protests or demonstrations, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
	King faces the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Trials have not yet been scheduled for the other two defendants  
-- Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 23.

<HEADLINE> AOL To Buy MovieFone for $388M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc., with an eye on the rapidly  
growing online entertainment market, plans to purchase the nation's 
largest movie listing guide and ticketing service for about $388 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's acquisition of New York-based MovieFone Inc., announced  
Monday, will help support its local, interactive service known as 
Digital City, where customers can get information about a specific 
region of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	MovieFone carries movie listings for 17,000 screens in 42  
markets, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The company 
sells tickets for films appearing on 3,000 screens. There is no 
need to stand in line and tickets can be purchased in advance by 
telephone or online. 
</P>
<P>
	``As consumers increasingly seek more convenience in  
entertainment information and ticketing, AOL brands, with MovieFone 
as a core product, will become even more valuable to our members 
and other Internet users,'' Bob Pittman, president of Dulles, 
Va.-based America Online, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like AOL have been snapping up smaller Internet  
service companies in order to provide customers a one-stop shopping 
environment. The longer consumers stay on AOL's sites, the longer 
AOL can study their shopping habits and work with retailers to 
target their advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's deal is the 43rd Internet-related acquisition this  
year, according to Securities Data Co., and follows last week's 
announcement that Yahoo! Inc., an Internet search and directory 
service, would pay $5 billion for GeoCities Inc., an Internet firm 
that helps people create their own Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact terms of the transaction will be determined by  
dividing $29.25 by AOL's average price during a specified period 
prior to the merger's effective date. But MovieFone shareholders 
will get at least 0.1670 share of AOL and up to 0.2259 share for 
each MovieFone share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, MovieFone served 250 million movie-goers, or 20  
percent of the market. MovieFone charges a fee of between $1 to 
$1.50 on ticket sales. Callers have to listen to a 20-second 
advertisement on its automated telephone system, and the company 
also posts advertisements on its Web site (www.MovieFone.com). 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1998, the company's loss narrowed to  
$890,000 from $2.4 million in the same 1997 period. In that same 
period, its sales surged 27 percent to $17.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Wednesday  
morning as Tokyo stocks fell almost across the board amid Japan's 
rising long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.29 yen, down 0.89 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo but higher than its level of 112.05 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 198.22 points, or 1.35 percent, to  
14,151.61 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the index 
shed 115.35 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was lower against the yen on  
profit-taking by overseas traders as well as investors' selling 
euros to buy yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. players came in to sell the dollar against the yen, while  
Japanese institutional investors sold euros for yen, pushing the 
dollar down,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange 
manager at ABN-Amro Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar drifted higher from its New York levels after a  
top Japanese Ministry of Finance official voiced concern over the 
weakening of the U.S. currency against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stability in foreign exchange markets is desirable, as I've  
always said, and excessive yen strength or weakness is 
undesirable,'' Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's 
international bureau, said at a regular news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Unconfirmed rumors that Japan's central bank was checking  
exchange rates also made some traders cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's recent strength was based on rising long-term interest  
rates in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates here make the yen more attractive,  
although they are seen as bearish for the stock market because they 
can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing money. 
A stronger yen can lower earnings from exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield of the 10-year government bond stood at 2.430 percent,  
up from Tuesday's finish of 2.310 percent, the highest level since 
July 1997. Its price slipped to 95.19 yen from 96.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the fall in bond prices to concern over the  
government's planned massive bond issue in the next fiscal year 
starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the yield rose further following comments Tuesday  
by government ministers indicating that they weren't too concerned 
about the recent rise in yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players worry that higher interest rates will damage  
profits and borrowing at Japanese companies and hurt the economy. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vega Pushes for Anti-Stalking Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Suzanne Vega, who addressed the issue of  
child abuse in her 1988 hit song ``Luka,'' is once again using 
music to highlight a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, with guitar in hand, went to New York's state  
Capitol Tuesday to push for anti-stalking legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to change things is not only by writing songs, it's  
really by passing the laws because that's where you get the 
protection from,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-nominated singer said she had been stalked several  
times, both before and after becoming famous. Once a death threat 
forced her to wear a bulletproof vest during a performance in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Vega sang and delivered mostly  
lighthearted remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had thought about doing a cover of `I'll Be Watching You' by  
Sting, but it occurred to me that it might be inappropriate and I 
didn't know the chords,'' Vega said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Super-G Postponed in Vail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- In preparing for her second appearance in the  
World Alpine Ski Championships, Monika Kovacs planned on a quick 
run down the super-G course followed by quick getaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs and the 42 other super-G racers were forced to change  
their plans Monday as the first event of the championships was 
postponed until Wednesday because of poor visibility caused by 
blowing snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' Kovacs said. ``I wanted to start today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs, the only Hungarian competing in the women's super-G, had  
reason to be anxious after the delay was announced. Scheduled as 
the 43rd and final racer, she was worried she might not get to 
compete at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old skier and her father, Barnabas, had planned to  
leave Colorado today because they didn't not know if they would be 
able to get another flight to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kovacs were able to adjust their travel plans, and race  
organizers are hoping they have similar success with the weather 
heading into today's men's super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the right decision,'' said Svein Mundal, technical  
director for the International Ski Federation (FIS). ``Poor 
visibility, a lot of snow made it hard to hold a good line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs acknowledged that taming the technically demanding  
International super-G course would have been difficult because of 
the snow flurries that continued throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Though flat at the top, the mile-long course features several  
steep drops, including Pepe's Face, where American Picabo Street 
suffered a season-ending knee injury during downhill training in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't see,'' Kovacs said. ``You couldn't see the little  
jumps. It's impossible to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kristine Kristiansen also applauded the decision to  
reschedule the super-G. Slated to be the eighth racer down the 
hill, she faced slow conditions in the fresh powder. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this weather, it's just as well there's no race,'' she  
said. ``I would've been a snowplow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postponement dampened an otherwise spirited day as the  
championships returned to Vail for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten-year-old skiers were honored before the race, and an  
international blend of fans rang cowbells and blew horns for two 
hours before the first forerunner left the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine splashed the finish line for about five minutes but  
quickly disappeared for good, leaving race favorites Alexandra 
Meissnitzer of Austria, Regine Cavagnoud of France, and the German 
duo of Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl on ice until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of skiing,'' Canada's Sara-Maude Boucher said. ``If  
you get in a bad mood because of that...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Boucher, Kovacs is not among the favorites but is taking a  
positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs, who has been training at the Bartsch Academy in Austria,  
finished 41st in the super-G and 27th in the giant slalom at the 
1997 championships in Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	She has not competed in a World Cup event this season, instead  
focusing on the less-demanding FIS circuit.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Regrets Antichrist Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell says he regrets  
saying the Antichrist is a Jewish man who probably is alive today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have known better,'' Falwell said Tuesday at the 18th  
International Christian Prayer Breakfast, held in conjunction with 
the National Religious Broadcasters Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast was billed as a prayer for peace in Jerusalem and  
honored several Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to my Jewish friends here and around the world and  
I apologize to the Christians here for having created any kind of 
rift,'' Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize not for what I believe, but for my lack of tact  
and judgment in making a statement that served no purpose 
whatsoever,'' Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bible, the Antichrist will spread universal  
evil before the end of the world but will be finally conquered at 
the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 14, Falwell told a conference on evangelism that he  
believes the Second Coming probably will occur within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Antichrist, ``if he's going to be the counterfeit of  
Christ, he has to be Jewish,'' Falwell said. ``The only thing we 
know is he must be male and Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell is the chancellor of Liberty University in Lynchburg,  
Va., and founder of the now-defunct Moral Majority.

<HEADLINE> Jaggers Prepare for Divorce Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reports say she may unleash American divorce  
lawyers in search of a massive payout. He still maintains they were 
never legally married. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hall's woebegone expression last week during a Paris  
shopping spree said it all: Her divorce fight with Rolling Stone 
Mick Jagger, the man she lived with for 21 years and married in 
1990, promises to be down and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
	The feisty Texas-born model put up with years of infidelities,  
but apparently considered it too much to bear when newspapers 
reported 29-year-old Brazilian model Luciana Giminez Morad was five 
months pregnant with Jagger's child. 
</P>
<P>
	One consolation: The public -- and the British tabloids --  
certainly seem to be on Ms. Hall's side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jumping Jack Cash and the art of being a cad, cad, cad,'' The  
Express said in one headline, over a column that began, ``Why is 
Mick Jagger so hell-bent on showing everyone what a complete pig he 
is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail ran a grim and grimacing picture of the  
55-year-old Jagger next to a headline posing the question, ``Is 
this the stingiest old man in Britain?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossipmongers reported this week that Ms. Hall, 42, is  
investigating Jagger's activities in Los Angeles, where he often 
has spent time at a mansion the couple owns there. 
</P>
<P>
	That's giving rise to speculation that she might be attempting  
to ferret out information damaging to her fizzled flame in the 
hopes of moving her divorce hearing from Britain to the United 
States, where even those who merely cohabit can claim as much as 50 
percent of their partner's income. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's to say? Neither party is entertaining questions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely no comment,'' a spokeswoman for Hall insisted this  
week. Publicists for Jagger did not return several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger and Ms. Hall -- who have four children, the youngest 1  
year old -- also own homes in London, New York, France and on the 
West Indian island of Mustique worth a total of more than $16 
million, though it has not been disclosed whose names are on the 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The considered opinion is that she is after a suitable slice of  
his wealth -- perhaps $48 million out of what is rumored to be a 
$240 million fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's for sure: She will not settle for the $1 million  
awarded to her predecessor, Bianca, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger is contesting Ms. Hall's petition on the grounds that the  
couple's Hindu marriage ceremony on the island of Bali was simply a 
religious ceremony carrying no civil weight. 
</P>
<P>
	To represent him in the divorce battle, he is reported to have  
appointed Rolling Stones lawyer Joyce Smyth, a tax expert with 
little experience with litigation or divorce cases. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Ms. Hall has hired the high-profile firm of Mishcon  
de Reya, which handled Princess Diana's 1996 divorce from Prince 
Charles and won her a $27 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based laywer Raoul Felder, who has been hired by the  
Brazilian model for undisclosed reasons, has speculated that Hall 
will ``have a hard time arguing that her main residence is in 
America. ... It is clear their home is in London.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Stephens, an international litigation expert with the  
London firm Stephens Innocent, said that might not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the domicile of her birth and she has property there,  
which will help,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings' Gill Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings defenseman Todd Gill is out for  
four to six weeks with a fractured forearm and defenseman Larry 
Murphy is day-to-day with a mild concussion, the team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were injured in a 2-2 tie against New Jersey on  
Monday. Both injuries were results of hits by New Jersey's 
Krzysztof Oliwa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, 33, was claimed by the Red Wings in December off of  
waivers from the St. Louis Blues as Detroit attempted to shore up 
its defensive corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, 37, was injured early in the first period, moments after  
tying Tim Horton for games by a defenseman with 1,446. Murphy was 
knocked to the ice by Oliwa. Both players slid across the ice into 
the side boards and Murphy was hurt when his head was slammed into 
the boards by Oliwa's hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined Murphy on Tuesday and recommended that he sit  
out Wednesday's game against the New York Islanders as a 
precautionary measure. Murphy sat out practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wings have recalled defenseman Yan Golubovsky from the  
Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Loses Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal jury ruled Tuesday that a Web  
site and ``wanted'' posters listing abortion doctors' names and 
addresses amounted to death threats, ordering the site's authors to 
pay damages of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking a blow to militant online tactics in the fight against  
abortion, the verdict could redefine what is considered 
constitutionally protected political speech. The anti-abortion 
materials contained no explicit threats of violence, only veiled 
messages, such as crossing through the names of abortion providers 
who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury saw the posters for what they are -- a hit list for  
terrorists,'' said Gloria Feldt, the president of Planned 
Parenthood, the main plaintiff in the case. ``Whether these threats 
are posted on trees or on the Internet, their intent and impact is 
the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants had said that they would not pay any damages, no  
matter what the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the defendants, Catherine Ramey, sobbed as the verdict  
came in, after 4 1/2 days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a moral and constitutional outrage,'' Ms. Ramey said  
afterward. She criticized the key ruling by the judge, that defined 
threat as something that could be taken as a threat by a 
``reasonable person,'' rather than as something that made lawless 
action ``imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no threat and they knew it,'' Ms. Ramey said. She  
had testified that she would not so much as offer a tissue to an 
abortion provider if he or she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was the ``The Nuremberg Files'' Web site, which lists  
hundreds of ``baby butchers'' and invites readers to send in such 
personal details as their home addresses, license plate numbers and 
even the names of their children. The similar Wild West-style 
posters offered a $5,000 reward for information about the ``Deadly 
Dozen'' doctors branded ``Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors whose names appeared on the list were  
killed, most recently last October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was 
gunned down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. His 
name on the Web site was promptly crossed through. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three-week trial, held under tight security,  
abortion doctors on the list testified that they lived in constant 
fear, used disguises, bodyguards and bulletproof vests, and 
instructed their children to crouch in the bathroom if they heard 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrorism,'' plaintiffs' attorney Maria Vullo said in  
closing arguments, pointing to a timeline of the four doctors and 
two clinic workers killed since 1993. ``The message is, `Stop 
performing abortion or wear a bulletproof vest.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for more than a dozen defendants, including the  
anti-abortion umbrella group American Coalition of Life Advocates, 
contended their clients were peaceful protesters engaged in a 
vigorous political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the stand, defendant Andrew Burnett, publisher of Life  
Advocate Magazine, conceded that doctors may have reason to fear 
the Web site because of the extent of anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was an abortionist,'' he said, ``I would be afraid.''  
</P>
<P>
	Defendants had indicated that no matter what the verdict, their  
tactics would not change. They also said any monetary award would 
have nothing more than a symbolic impact because they have 
transferred their assets to make themselves ``judgment-proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs sued under federal racketeering statutes and the  
1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it 
illegal to incite violence against abortion doctors and their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While the law has been used often against people who have  
firebombed clinics or attacked doctors, this case, filed in 1995, 
was believed to be the first not to result from a violent 
confrontation or a direct, person-to-person threat.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped in Wash. Baby Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Cheers erupted in a courtroom after a  
second-degree murder charge was dropped against a veteran 
pediatrician accused of blocking a 3-day-old boy's breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by prosecutors to drop the charge against Dr.  
Eugene Turner, 62, came Monday, as his trial was set to begin. A 
tearful Turner then was embraced by many in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he would ever do anything like that ever.  
Ever,'' said Kim Williams, a young mother and a Turner supporter. 
Placards in support were quickly put up in this north Olympic 
Peninsula town of 20,000, and party balloons were delivered to his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's parents, Martin and Michelle McInnerney, were  
planning to file a negligence lawsuit against Turner, said their 
lawyer, Matthew Knopp. The McInnerneys were not in court when the 
decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The McInnerneys' son, Conor, was rushed to Olympic Memorial  
Hospital last January after he stopped breathing at home. Emergency 
workers overseen by Turner tried to revive the baby, but he was 
showing no signs of recovering, so the parents agreed to halt life 
support. Conor was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the McInnerneys went home, a nurse found Conor  
turning pink and gasping. Turner worked to revive the child for 
another two hours. However, witnesses say he then declared the baby 
brain dead and put his hand over the child's nose, blocking his 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said the breathing he stopped was reflexive ``agonal  
breathing'' that is a sign of imminent death. 
</P>
<P>
	In his motion to dismiss the criminal charge, deputy prosecutor  
Jim Townsend said there was no evidence Conor's death was caused by 
``any criminal or even negligent act by any other human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said he considered lesser charges of first- or  
second-degree manslaughter, but concluded a court could not make 
those charges stick. ``The expert testimony on this issue is not 
consistent,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Knopp said the parents ``are going to be haunted forever by the  
image of what Dr. Turner did while he was alone with Conor that 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe that justice requires that they file a civil  
action in order to... make sure this type of thing doesn't happen 
again,'' Knopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner still faces a May hearing before the state Medical  
Quality Assurance Commission for alleged unprofessional conduct in 
the baby's death. The panel allowed Turner to keep his medical 
license until his case is heard, but ordered another doctor be 
present any time he attempts a resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner voluntarily surrendered his hospital privileges but  
continued to operate his Peninsula Children's Clinic. He said he 
believes evidence gathered for the trial will help his case before 
the medical commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can have some evidence to bring forth to the state  
board to indicate that things were maybe not as bad as they 
originally thought they were,'' Turner said.

<HEADLINE> Once Strong Nissan Hits Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- For decades, Nissan Motor Co. was an icon of  
Japan's entrepreneurial success, a savvy technological innovator 
standing in counterpoint to the lumbering titans of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the company is wallowing in debt, struggling with  
overcapacity and shrinking sales -- and wooing overseas partners 
just to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong?  
</P>
<P>
	Company executives confess they misread or ignored consumer  
trends in Japan and the United States, allowing rivals to surpass 
them with numerous innovations since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's rigid corporate policies and its overemphasis on  
maintaining market share at the expense of innovation have become 
the source of soul-searching in boardrooms across Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mistakes that Nissan made can really be said of Japanese  
industry in general,'' said Takuya Nozaki, an analyst at Teikoku 
Data Bank, a major private Japanese research company. 
</P>
<P>
	After grabbing the imagination of the American consumer in the  
1970s with its Datsun Z series of sports cars, Nissan has since 
acquired a different, less flattering image among the public: 
reliable, but boring. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a marketing perspective, we've been out of touch with  
consumer desires for a long time,'' admitted Nissan spokesman 
Masataka Saito. ``There were serious problems with the designs and 
practicality of our vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When new vehicle-types like the sports-utility vehicle suddenly  
became popular in Japan, Nissan's domestic rivals were quick to 
seize the opportunity and roll out attractive models. Nissan tried 
to play catch up and never made it. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned more with maintaining market share than staying  
profitable, Nissan spread itself thin financially by churning out 
new models to match Toyota Motor's rapidly expanding product range. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need to maintain a full model line-up caused Nissan's  
product balance to crumble,'' said Tateo Takasugi, president of 
Japanese auto industry think-tank Fourin Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Nissan pushed the Maxima to compete with  
Toyota's big-selling Camry and Honda's Accord, but failed to make 
an impact because it lacked a strong product identity. 
</P>
<P>
	With fewer resources than its larger rival, Nissan could not  
afford to pour in the same amount of money and manpower needed to 
produce competitive vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's resources have also been severely strained by its  
expansion in the North American car-leasing business, where it lost 
almost $2 billion last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, rather than maintaining its market share, has seen it  
erode. It now holds 20 percent of the Japanese market, down from 30 
percent in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S., the company now has about 4 percent of the market,  
compared with 5.6 percent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has posted losses in five of the past six years, and  
has debts estimated at nearly $30 billion, an amount roughly equal 
to its annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	And though it is still Japan's No. 2 carmaker in sales, Nissan  
has already begun talks with German auto giant DaimlerChrysler on a 
merger, and it makes no secret of its desire to find an outside 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we'll need to find an overseas partner in order to  
survive,'' said Saito. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have gotten so bad that Nissan has announced it will sell  
a chunk of its headquarters in the posh Ginza district of Tokyo as 
part of a far-reaching retrenching drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's long economic slump and the Asian economic crisis have  
hit the country's entire auto industry hard, and Toyota and Honda 
have also suffered steep losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan's predicament runs deeper than Japan's general  
economic malaise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan's troubles cannot be blamed on the bursting of Japan's  
economic bubble,'' said Fourin Inc.'s Takasugi. ``It has had 
serious organizational problems.''

<HEADLINE> Accountancy Firm Fined Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, the accounting firm that  
advised the late media baron Robert Maxwell, was fined a total of 
$5.8 million on Tuesday for failures in its auditing of his 
sprawling publishing empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine was the biggest ever levied by the accountants'tribunal  
called the Joint Disciplinary Scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals involved and the firm, now merged with a rival  
company to form PriceWaterhouseCoopers, admitted to 59 charges of 
breaking regulatory rules, according to the regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell disappeared in mysterious circumstances at sea off his  
yacht in 1991. Earlier that year, his empire had collapsed, leaving 
its pension funds $660 million short. 
</P>
<P>
	Coopers &AMP; Lybrand had acted as auditors of nearly all the  
Maxwell-controlled companies and their pension funds beginning in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long-awaited report, the tribunal said the firm failed to  
consider whether there was ``evidence of fraud, other 
irregularities, defaults or unlawful acts'' at Maxwell's businesses 
that would merit ``whistleblowing'' to the proper authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complaints reveal shortcomings in both vigilance and  
diligence and a failure to achieve an appropriate degree of 
objectivity and skepticism, which might have led to an earlier 
recognition and exposure of the reality of what was occurring,'' it 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its criticisms, the report said the auditors were not  
directly responsible for financial losses or the collapse of the 
Maxwell empire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept that we fell short of the very high standards we set  
ourselves,'' said Peter Smith, senior partner at 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. ``This is a matter of deep regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that the report made clear the auditors were  
the ``victims of deliberate deceit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our own concern at the distress caused to the Maxwell  
pensioners was recognized in our substantial contribution to enable 
the obligations of the pension funds to be met in full,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell used the pension funds held in a number of investment  
companies he set up as collateral for loans to his other divisions. 
A significant chunk of the funds also were used to buy shares in 
Maxwell-controlled companies.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Riot Said Handled Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The mayor's spokesman says Denver police acted  
appropriately by using tear gas and riot gear to break up an unruly 
crowd of post-Super Bowl celebrators ``hell-bent on causing 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were arrested and dozens were treated for  
tear gas exposure in the aftermath of the violence in downtown 
Denver on Sunday. Property damage was estimated at $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Hudson, a spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb, said the  
crowd was smaller than in the previous year, but was more 
aggressive. They tipped over trash cans and cars, broke windows and 
set bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could have been a lot worse,'' Hudson said Monday.  
``I think if police had not done as well in organizing their 
efforts, a lot more people would have gotten hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this was a crowd that had no respect for other  
people's property. They were hell-bent on causing trouble,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver was one of several cities statewide that reported  
problems with rowdy fans after the Denver Broncos defeated Atlanta 
to win their second consecutive NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	From Coors Field to the Capitol, pockets of fans tipped over  
trash cans and cars, broke windows in dozens of buildings, spilled 
newspaper boxes, ripped down street signs and lit bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas, horseback patrols and other  
riot-prevention measures to break them up. Officers in full riot 
gear banged nightsticks on shields and walked side by side through 
the streets to force the crowds to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rowdy and the police acted with as much restraint as  
they could,'' Hudson said. ``They also effectively used tear gas 
where it got really out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Colorado, police officers in Greeley also used tear  
gas to disperse crowds. Three people were arrested and two 
hospitalized for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 Fort Collins officers used pepper spray and batons to  
control a crowd of up to 4,000 revelers, who were mostly students 
at nearby Colorado State University. One man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of several  
hundred. There were three arrests and minor injuries to some police 
officers, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Junction, officers tried dogs and tear gas before  
resorting to water streaming from fire hoses to break up fans tying 
up traffic by packing a main street. At least five people were 
arrested but there were few reports of vandalism, said police 
spokeswoman Shari Zen.

<HEADLINE> John Lithgow Eyes Singing Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's conquered film, stage and television. Now  
John Lithgow has decided to chart untested waters with a singing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' is releasing his first  
album next month, ``Singin' in the Bathtub.'' The collection of 
swing style tunes will be aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor said singing to kids is natural for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the early 70s when my first son was born, I taught  
myself to play guitar because I loved the idea of playing and 
singing for my own baby,'' he said. ``Ever since then I've always 
sung for kids in classrooms, at benefits and at music festivals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow even wrote one of the songs for the album.  
</P>
<P>
	``'Big Kids' recollects when I was a very little kid and big  
kids terrified me. I find it completely amazing how children 
identify with this song,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new album is set for release March 9.

<HEADLINE> Fed Issues Banks Credit Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the heels on a report critical of how  
bankers dealt with hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, the 
Federal Reserve has issued guidelines to bankers and bank examiners 
aimed at reducing banks' credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the guidelines Monday, the Fed noted that the losses  
from the hedge fund debacle showed that ``basic credit 
risk-management policies, procedures and internal controls were 
insufficient at some (banks) to address the risks of new, 
fast-growing or evolving (financial) products and activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks must devote sufficient resources and attention to ensuring  
``the integrity and adequacy'' of their risk-management procedures, 
the central bank said. Similar guidelines were released last month 
by the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which 
regulates nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerage firms  
spent $3.6 billion to bail out Long-Term Capital, a high-risk hedge 
fund for wealthy investors that had nearly borrowed itself into 
extinction. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York helped arrange the 
private rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	After Long-Term Capital's managers bet big on interest-rate  
swings and lost, the fund's meltdown threatened to disrupt world 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a  
report that found a group of major U.S. and European banks had 
failed to adequately oversee their loans to and trading activities 
with Long-Term Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited what it said were lapses in judgment by the  
banks in their dealings with Long-Term Capital and other hedge 
funds. It also said such investment funds are very difficult to 
regulate and that lenders should be far more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential working group is looking at possible restrictions  
on bank loans to high-risk hedge funds in the aftermath of 
Long-Term Capital's near-collapse, a Fed official recently told a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve oversees the foreign and holding-company  
banks that invested in Long-Term Capital, including Citigroup, 
Chase Manhattan, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Britain's Barclays 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, several of the banks and investment firms --  
including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. -- formed a new group to 
develop risk standards for financial institutions extending credit 
in volatile global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their move was supported by Arthur Levitt,  
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

<HEADLINE> Jaggers Prepare for Divorce Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reports say she may unleash American divorce  
lawyers in search of a massive payout. He still maintains they were 
never legally married. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hall's woebegone expression last week during a Paris  
shopping spree said it all: Her divorce fight with Rolling Stone 
Mick Jagger, the man she lived with for 21 years and married in 
1990, promises to be down and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
	The feisty Texas-born model put up with years of infidelities,  
but apparently considered it too much to bear when newspapers 
reported 29-year-old Brazilian model Luciana Giminez Morad was five 
months pregnant with Jagger's child. 
</P>
<P>
	One consolation: The public -- and the British tabloids --  
certainly seem to be on Ms. Hall's side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jumping Jack Cash and the art of being a cad, cad, cad,'' The  
Express said in one headline, over a column that began, ``Why is 
Mick Jagger so hell-bent on showing everyone what a complete pig he 
is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail ran a grim and grimacing picture of the  
55-year-old Jagger next to a headline posing the question, ``Is 
this the stingiest old man in Britain?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossipmongers reported this week that Ms. Hall, 42, is  
investigating Jagger's activities in Los Angeles, where he often 
has spent time at a mansion the couple owns there. 
</P>
<P>
	That's giving rise to speculation that she might be attempting  
to ferret out information damaging to her fizzled flame in the 
hopes of moving her divorce hearing from Britain to the United 
States, where even those who merely cohabit can claim as much as 50 
percent of their partner's income. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's to say? Neither party is entertaining questions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely no comment,'' a spokeswoman for Hall insisted this  
week. Publicists for Jagger did not return several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger and Ms. Hall -- who have four children, the youngest 1  
year old -- also own homes in London, New York, France and on the 
West Indian island of Mustique worth a total of more than $16 
million, though it has not been disclosed whose names are on the 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The considered opinion is that she is after a suitable slice of  
his wealth -- perhaps $48 million out of what is rumored to be a 
$240 million fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's for sure: She will not settle for the $1 million  
awarded to her predecessor, Bianca, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger is contesting Ms. Hall's petition on the grounds that the  
couple's Hindu marriage ceremony on the island of Bali was simply a 
religious ceremony carrying no civil weight. 
</P>
<P>
	To represent him in the divorce battle, he is reported to have  
appointed Rolling Stones lawyer Joyce Smyth, a tax expert with 
little experience with litigation or divorce cases. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Ms. Hall has hired the high-profile firm of Mishcon  
de Reya, which handled Princess Diana's 1996 divorce from Prince 
Charles and won her a $27 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based laywer Raoul Felder, who has been hired by the  
Brazilian model for undisclosed reasons, has speculated that Hall 
will ``have a hard time arguing that her main residence is in 
America. ... It is clear their home is in London.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Stephens, an international litigation expert with the  
London firm Stephens Innocent, said that might not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the domicile of her birth and she has property there,  
which will help,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Liberal Group Takes Justice to Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas will  
appear to be politically partisan if he speaks at a Lincoln Day 
gathering sponsored by a conservative organization with close ties 
to the Republican Party, a liberal advocacy group said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' planned speech Saturday to the Claremont Institute's  
event ``will appear to be inflammatory no matter what words are 
said,'' Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and 
State contended as he made public a letter urging the justice to 
cancel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no comment,'' Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg  
said when asked for Thomas' response. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn called the speech's timing ``genuinely appalling'' and told  
reporters, ``The partisanship in this city has perhaps never been 
higher in modern American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that four major issues involving the president's legal  
liability already have been the subject of Supreme Court rulings, 
and said the Senate trial could generate new disputes for the 
highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	His letter to Thomas said Claremont Institute ``is currently  
waging a campaign seeking the ouster of President Bill Clinton by 
either impeachment or resignation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn added that people would construe Thomas' speech as ``a  
high-level endorsement of the group and its goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claremont President Larry Arnn denied any close link between his  
organization and the GOP. ``We happen to love the Republican Party 
that Abraham Lincoln started,'' he said. ``As for the contemporary 
Republican Party, we criticize it as much as we praise it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claremont Institute, based in Sacramento, Calif., generally  
espouses politically conservative views on church-state relations 
and other issues. It was founded in 1979 as a tax-exempt research 
and education organization but also engages in legal advocacy.

<HEADLINE> Elway Never Expected MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Throughout his remarkable 16-year career, John  
Elway reminded us that nothing was impossible, that no achievement 
was ever beyond his go-for-broke grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is what made his observation on Monday so startling.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than 12 hours after his Denver Broncos clinched their  
second straight Super Bowl title and he won the MVP award, Elway 
surprised the assembled media by insisting he ``never thought this 
would happen to me. I really never thought I would be standing up 
here the morning after a Super Bowl as the MVP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why, he said, ``After you lose three Super Bowls in a row,  
you're just hoping your team can win. So this (award) is a bonus. 
It's really one of the great thrills of my career, and I've had 
many of them. It's a special moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After what was clearly the best performance of his five Super  
Bowl appearances, Elway won the MVP award in what may be his final 
trip to the NFL's ultimate game. He completed 18 of 29 passes for 
336 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the Broncos' 
34-19 romp over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	His reward? A trophy and a new car.  
</P>
<P>
	The perfect gift for an auto tycoon. Elway recently sold his  
seven Denver auto dealerships for $82 million, currently is the 
front man for 17 dealerships, and owns a stable of cars at home. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue joked about the odd  
circumstances as he introduced Elway at a Monday morning press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the choice of a Ford Mustang or Expedition, Elway chose  
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that a car was an incentive to win,'' Tagliabue  
quipped. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff met last night to try to come up with something that  
would give John an incentive to play another season. The best they 
could come up with was the idea that you have a chance to be the 
first player in NFL history to be the MVP in two different 
centuries. We decided not to offer that to you because it might 
emphasize your age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, spent an agonizing four months following last year's  
Super Bowl victory before deciding to return for the 1998 season. 
He expects to make a somewhat quicker decision about playing in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although believed to be leaning toward retirement, he admitted  
that the opportunity for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl 
title would affect his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' he said.  
``But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level that I'm 
playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment. At 38 and in the  
twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the now and 
not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said he will seek the counsel of his wife and four  
children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and Broncos 
owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Elway said he was 99.9 percent certain that 1998  
would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' he said. ``You can't  
start in July and expect to have a good year. People think that we 
just go out and play on Sunday, but that's not the way it works. 
Our season starts April 1 (with off-season conditioning), and it's 
a nine-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can I compete for an entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the  
time working on what we do offensively from a mental standpoint? It 
was a long haul for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually durable Elway missed all or parts of six games this  
season with hamstring, back and rib injuries. Still, he had the 
best passer rating (93.0) of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, my heart is going to tell me if I can make  
that commitment or not,'' he said. ``If I do, I'm going to make it 
so I can play at the level that I want to play at. I don't want to 
come back and just go through the motions. If I come back, it's 
going to be full bent, trying to repeat.''

<HEADLINE> Post Office Ends Year With Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Postal Service had a $550 million  
surplus at the end of the fiscal year, its fourth straight year in 
the black, according to the agency's annual report released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency handled 198 billion pieces of mail in the fiscal year  
that ended last September, or approximately 376,712 items per 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 41 percent of the world's mail, the post office said. The  
second busiest postal service, in Japan, handles 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot to be proud of. Our service performance is  
outstanding and customer satisfaction is at an all-time high,'' 
Postmaster General William Henderson said in a letter accompanying 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Total income of the post office in fiscal 1998 was just over $60  
billion, with expenses of $59.5 billion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $550 million surplus follows years in which the post office  
had surpluses of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That income has permitted the agency to purchase costly  
equipment to speed the sorting and handling of the mail while 
reducing its long-term debt. The agency's debt now totals $6.4 
billion, down from $9.9 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office raised the price of sending a letter a penny, to  
33 cents, on Jan. 10, citing rising costs and the need to avoid 
falling into the red while still struggling to pay off its past 
debt.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Times To Switch to Mornings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Times, an afternoon newspaper that  
remained dominant while others struggled or failed, said Tuesday it 
will switch to morning publication and compete head-to-head with 
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will occur within two years as part of a restructured  
joint operating agreement between the Seattle Times Co. and the 
Hearst Corp., which owns the Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring gives the Post-Intelligencer a larger share of  
profits and removes barriers that prevented it from posting news on 
its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``To sustain our success and future growth, it isn't feasible  
for The Seattle Times to continue publishing an afternoon paper,'' 
said Mason Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been successful in bucking the trends with an evening  
newspaper because of the quality of our product, but we now are at 
a point where we must respond to the community's clear preference 
for a morning paper,'' he said. ``By doing so, we are ensuring that 
The Seattle Times can continue to thrive as one of America's last 
locally owned metropolitan newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sizemore said no date had been set for the conversion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will start planning immediately,'' he said. ``My hope is  
that we can do it much sooner than two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times has a daily circulation of about 230,000 and a Sunday  
circulation of about 504,000. The P-I has a daily circulation of 
about 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although several larger U.S. newspapers publish multiple  
editions through the day, The Seattle Times is the nation's largest 
with an evening-only edition Monday through Friday. The Times and 
the P-I publish morning editions on Saturday. The Times publishes a 
Sunday morning edition that includes a section produced by the 
Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint operating agreements, in which newspapers of different  
ownership compete editorially but share advertising, circulation 
and production resources, exist in 16 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In none of them do the newspapers compete head-to-head, although  
The Detroit News -- while technically an afternoon newspaper -- 
publishes a morning edition that competes in some parts of Michigan 
with the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real winners in this new arrangement are Seattle-area  
newspaper readers,'' said J.D. Alexander, editor and publisher of 
the Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see some of the fiercest newspaper  
competition that you'll see in any city anywhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers have operated under a JOA since 1983. Discussions to  
change the agreement and allow the Times to publish in the morning 
began in 1990, Sizemore said. The talks intensified as the 
Post-Intelligencer sought a way to post news to its Web site -- 
something the Times believed wasn't allowed under the original JOA. 
</P>
<P>
	The amended agreement allows for expansion of the Web site,  
which the Post-Intelligencer implemented immediately by posting 
Tuesday's top news stories. Until Tuesday, the Web site had been 
prohibited from posting same-day news. It also provides The Hearst 
Corp. with right-of-first-purchase of the Times should its owners 
decide to sell and includes a 50-year extension of the JOA to Dec. 
31, 2083. 
</P>
<P>
	Sizemore said the Blethen family, which owns 50.5 percent of the  
Times, has no plans to sell the newspaper. Knight Ridder owns the 
remaining 49.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Food Low At Colombia Quake Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Emergency food supplies are dangerously  
low for the more than 200,000 people left homeless by last week's 
earthquake in Colombia, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said private donations were dropping off  
precipitously, and appealed for more aid to fill the gap between 
what Colombians need and what the government and international 
relief agencies have rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid officials were trying to avoid a repeat of the first few  
days after the Jan. 25 earthquake, when food shortages were 
widespread due to the magnitude of the devastation and bureaucratic 
delays. Frustration over those shortages fueled waves of looting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have food for four or five more days,'' said Juan Manuel  
Urrutia, head of the Colombian Institute for Family Well-Being, a 
government agency. ``We're working to avoid a food crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highest priority for aid are children, he said. About 25,000  
children were receiving milk and basic foodstuffs in Quindio -- the 
state most severely affected by the magnitude-6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. World Food Program was distributing about 25,000 food  
rations packets a day, he said. And a plane from Italy stocked with 
portable kitchen gear, generators and $200,000 worth of beans was 
expected at Armenia's airport on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strong foreign donations, Urrutia said the cash-strapped  
Colombian government would have to begin purchasing food, in part 
to make up for a falloff in donations by private Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the central donation center in Bogota, where as many as 6,000  
people arrived daily to donate supplies during the first days after 
the quake, only 400 showed up Monday with boxes and shopping bags 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake survivors need to get enough calories not only to  
survive but to return to work or begin rebuilding their shattered 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cost as much as $950 million to rebuild and repair the  
estimated 35,000 homes rendered uninhabitable by the earthquake, 
two-thirds of them in Armenia, Colombia's planning director Jaime 
Ruiz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 people were killed in the state capital, Armenia,  
a city of 300,000 residents that now is largely in ruins. Calarca, 
a town 15 minutes from Armenia, had at least 110 deaths in the 
earthquake and more than 200 people were killed elsewhere in the 
coffee-growing region.

<HEADLINE> AOL Rescinds Lifetime Ban on Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- When a 10-year-old boy broke America  
OnLine's rules, the giant Internet provider came down hard. It 
banned him -- and his family -- for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Wolbert and his family were a bit surprised. ``I  
e-mailed a kid,'' the fifth-grader told The Buffalo News on Sunday, 
smiling and shrugging his shoulders. ``I said I was, like, an AOL 
agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL refused to reconsider, said Derrick's father, Dennis. The  
more he thought about it, the angrier he got. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do I get banned for life, too?'' Wolbert asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after Wolbert complained to the state attorney  
general's office and the News began pursuing the story, AOL 
relented and reinstated the account. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone impersonating an America Online employee is an  
absolute violation of our terms of service, whether it's someone 10 
years old or 80 years old,'' said AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose. 
</P>
<P>
	People posing as AOL employees frequently try to persuade others  
to tell them passwords or credit card numbers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Primrose said AOL didn't know what was in the e-mail; she  
said AOL knew about it only because the recipient of the message 
lodged a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	She said an AOL representative talked with Derrick's father  
about guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Mother-Son Slaying Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A suspect in the slaying of a woman and  
her 8-year-old son, who was a witness for the murder trial of the 
suspect's brother, was ordered held in lieu of $2 million bond on 
an unrelated charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bail was set on an escape charge Monday after prosecutors said  
Adrian Peeler, 22, was both a suspect and a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler has been questioned by Bridgeport police in the Jan. 7  
slayings of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown Jr., 8, and his mother, Karen 
Clarke, 29. The boy was scheduled to testify in the upcoming murder 
trial of Peeler's 27-year-old brother, Russell Peeler. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler was arrested Jan. 21 in Charlotte, N.C., on a  
fugitive warrant related to his escape last April from a Hartford 
halfway house. He had been serving a 30-month sentence on charges 
of sale of narcotics and risk of injury to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have also called Russell Peeler a possible suspect in the  
shooting death of the boy and his mother. Russell Peeler's lawyer 
said his client had nothing to do with the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler faces trial in the May 1998 shooting death of  
Rudolph Snead Jr., the fiance of Leroy's mother. Nine months before 
the killing, Leroy allegedly witnessed an attempt to kill Snead. 
The boy was killed before he could testify at Russell Peeler's 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler was free on $750,000 bail at the time of the  
shooting, but was monitored by an electronic bracelet. He faces a 
firearms charge related to a stolen shotgun found in his father's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler also faces firearms charges related to the same  
shotgun.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaving one less hurdle for Al Gore, House  
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has decided to skip the 2000 
presidential campaign and try instead to win control of the House 
and become speaker, several allies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will announce his decision Wednesday in a meeting of House  
Democrats, most of whom urged the Missouri lawmaker to remain in 
Congress and help eliminate the Republicans' paper-thin hold on the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take back the House, but it's going to take all of our  
attention and all of our money,'' said Democratic strategist Dane 
Strother. ``Now we don't have to worry about any of that being 
diverted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now Gore doesn't have to worry about Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	With his own fund-raising operation and network of allies,  
Gephardt stood as the greatest threat to the vice president's White 
House ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can interpret this as anything but good news  
for Gore,'' said Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. 
``Anytime your most serious adversary says, `Sayonara,' it's a good 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a great shot at being speaker,'' said Gore  
strategist Bob Squier. ``This has got to be very good news for the 
Democratic Party and it's good news for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore withheld comment until Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's decision was not a surprise. He was less inclined to  
run for the White House after Democrats fared surprisingly well in 
the November elections and pulled to within six seats of regaining 
control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies of Gephardt, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
determined that winning back the House was as important to 
Democratic initiatives as retaining the White House. And he worried 
that a divisive primary would hurt the party's chances in both. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also realized he had a better shot at becoming speaker  
than president, several Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to be daunting for Gephardt to see Gore sitting in his  
way,'' Strother said. ``We've never not nominated a sitting vice 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has most of the advantages of an incumbent: He flies Air  
Force Two from coast to coast, meets with a network of activists 
and donors beholden to the White House and taps President Clinton's 
political operation at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore will not be unopposed. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, a Hall of Fame professional basketball player, is 
challenging Gore for the nomination. Sen. John Kerry of 
Massachusetts and civil rights activists Jesse Jackson are 
considering races. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats suggested Bradley could benefit by Gephardt's  
withdrawal if no other Democrat enters the race to split any 
anti-Gore votes. The vice president's advisers say the sentiment 
against Gore isn't strong enough to buoy Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gore should win the nomination but lose the White House,  
Gephardt realizes he would be the party's leader -- especially if he 
manages to win back the House, allies say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore will be the picture of unity when he bows out  
Wednesday and sets his sights on the speakership. Gephardt will 
meet privately with the vice president first thing in the morning, 
and Clinton later in the day, to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gephardt-Gore relationship, damaged in their unsuccessful  
1988 presidential campaigns, has improved in recent months, say 
aides for both. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, praised Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could do practically any job in American he chose. If he  
chooses to stay in the House and seek to be speaker, I'll do 
everything I can to help him be speaker,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's spokesman said the senator will base his decision about  
a presidential run on a number of political and personal factors, 
including, in a small way, Gephardt's decision.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A plane crashed in central Brazil,  
killing the president of the nation's Federal Indian Bureau and 
three other people on board, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan Silvestre, 37, was traveling Monday night from the  
capital, Brasilia, to Goiania, 100 miles southwest, when the 
twin-engine Seneca airplane crashed into a house about two miles 
short of the landing strip, said Antonio Regis, the bureau's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvestre was traveling to a meeting with an Indian tribe.  
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were one of Silvestre's advisers, Luciano Ribeiro  
Neves, pilot Agmar Domingos Rosa and passenger Adao Fernandes 
Sobrinho. 
</P>

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Hundreds of unemployed workers  
and retirees marched through downtown Buenos Aires on Tuesday, 
demanding that the government create new jobs and that supermarkets 
hand out free food. 
</P>
<P>
	The march organizers, a left-wing trade union group, planned to  
hold rallies in front of supermarkets, but hundreds of police in 
anti-riot gear guarded the shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The marchers presented a petition at the presidential office  
building, demanding that the government create 5,000 new jobs and 
that supermarket chains hand out 55 tons of food a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr President, we are not delinquents, we are hungry,  
unemployed workers,'' the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Castells, a leader of a retirees' group, was arrested last  
week after an attempt to raid a supermarket.

crowds raided supermarkets for food.

``Fortunately there were no fatalities, but we know of tens of 
injured people.''

<HEADLINE> How Budget Will Impact You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers would pay 55 cents more, or an average  
of $4 a pack, if Congress approves requests in President Clinton's 
budget for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But soldiers looking for a raise, students in cramped classrooms  
and stay-at-home moms and dads would benefit from the president's 
spending blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster youths on the verge of adulthood and legal immigrants  
also fare well in the $1.77 trillion budget proposal the president 
sent to Capitol Hill on Monday. So do children in Head Start and 
Social Security recipients of today and tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	There's money to speed the development of lightning-fast  
supercomputers to help scientists provide earlier tornado warnings 
and design fuel-efficient autos. There's more money for the 
Pentagon and for AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more to hire teachers and put extra police officers  
on the beat in rough neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget, prepared at a time when federal coffers  
are overflowing with surplus money from the booming economy, has 
morsels for almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican Congress, which has rejected many of  
Clinton's ideas in the past, is not likely to look kindly on many 
of his provisions this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans agree that 62 percent of the projected  
budget surpluses -- $4.85 trillion during the next 15 years -- should 
be set aside to save Social Security. But they're at loggerheads 
over what to do with the other 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use the rest of the surplus to make Medicare  
solvent for 20 years and set up new subsidized retirement accounts 
for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposes to increase spending for scores of domestic  
programs and give the Pentagon $261 billion in new spending, 
including a 4.4 percent pay raise for military members in 2000, 
followed by five annual increases of 3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, on the other hand, want to use the rest of the  
money, after Social Security, for a 10 percent across-the-board tax 
cut. Clinton's budget is a spending smorgasbord, said Sen. Phil 
Gramm, R-Texas. ``If you live in this galaxy ... he has got a 
program for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton counters: If money is not spent on thorny domestic  
problems during prosperous times, then when? 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other tidbits the president seeks:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $250 tax credit for stay-at-home parents caring for a child  
under age 1 -- up to $500 for two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit to help patients, families and caregivers  
cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money to send another 42,000 children to Head Start, and money  
to let foster care children keep their public health insurance when 
they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another $22 billion in school construction and modernization  
bonds to ease overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Triple the money for after-school programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--Money to recruit and prepare thousands more teachers.  
</P>
<P>
	--For the college-bound, a $125 increase in the maximum Pell  
grant to $3,250. Post-college, Clinton would let taxpayers deduct 
interest on their student loans for the life of the loan, not just 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money to restore food stamps for 15,000 legal immigrants who  
are 65 and came to the United States before Aug. 22, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	--Funds to pay for hiring or retaining 30,000 to 50,000 police  
officers to work in pockets of high crime. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger, Clinton proposes $82 billion in  
new or increased taxes, in addition to the 55 cent increase in the 
cigarette tax. The budget would close 16 loopholes in tax laws, and 
propose 79 new or increased taxes, mostly on business. Industry 
spokesmen say some of those increased costs may get passed on to 
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Fight Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deal to strengthen Social Security's  
finances is far from done, but Republican lawmakers and President 
Clinton have agreed to set aside a large chunk of government 
surpluses to pay for fixing the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	How to repair the fund that millions of Americans rely on still  
has to be hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heavy lifting on Social Security hasn't even begun,'' said  
Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and Means 
subcommittee that oversees Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw and other influential Republicans have been critical of the  
specifics of a Social Security plan Clinton outlined in the fiscal 
year 2000 budget he sent to Congress on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, said he believes agreement is possible this  
year ``if we work together across partisan lines and make some 
tough but fully achievable choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal, first announced in his State of the Union  
speech, would use 62 percent of the government surpluses expected 
over the next 15 years to beef up Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than $2.7 trillion by the latest projections, and  
could push the cash shortage now expected in 2032 back by more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have agreed to set that money  
aside for now. But the bipartisan accord on Social Security ends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants the government to invest a quarter of the  
$2.7 trillion in cash into the stock market to try to increase the 
money's value. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans strenuously object, saying that if the government  
becomes a Wall Street player, politics would inevitably corrupt 
free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rest of the money, Clinton would use a complicated  
accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt 
and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the president's fancy bookkeeping just compounds  
debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the 
government, without saying how they will ultimately be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling for negotiations to come up with a plan  
everyone can agree on. But both Democrats and Republicans have thus 
far avoided any discussion of the most difficult choices that may 
be needed -- whether to raise Social Security taxes or to cut 
retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible area of compromise: Clinton's proposal to use an  
additional 12 percent of the surplus to start new 401(k)-style 
investment accounts for most American workers. Essentially, the 
government would help subsidize people's own retirement savings, 
giving more money to low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would do nothing to fix Social Security, but could provide  
a cushion for future retirees if benefit cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans would eventually like to see some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks diverted into 
such accounts. That way, they say, the retirement program could 
benefit from stock market investments controlled by individuals, 
not controlled by the government.

<HEADLINE> The CIA's Budget? Sorry It's Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the torrent of budget details from the  
federal government Monday, the billions of dollars President 
Clinton seeks for spying were conspicuously missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the budget request for national intelligence programs  
would give potential adversaries valuable information about the 
United States' sources, methods and priorities, CIA director George 
Tenet says. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite pressure from liberal lawmakers and public interest  
groups, the CIA appears to be moving toward releasing less, not 
more, information about its budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The total that Clinton seeks for national intelligence is  
believed to be near $29 billion, based on previously released 
figures and interviews with congressional staffers. That's almost 9 
percent higher than intelligence spending for the fiscal year that 
ended last Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp increase is a key reason why Tenet opposes releasing  
any details. Two years ago, pressured by a lawsuit by the 
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington watchdog group, the 
CIA released the spending figure on national intelligence for 1997: 
$26.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And last March, Tenet released the 1998 total of $26.7 billion.  
The bulk of that pays for spy satellites, eavesdropping and 
military intelligence. It also includes the CIA budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet decided he could make the totals public precisely because  
the numbers were so close. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, however, Congress approved an ``emergency'' increase  
of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. The exact figure was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure of any increases, Tenet argued in a December court  
filing, ``adds a piece to the intelligence jigsaw puzzle'' and 
could help adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federation of American Scientists argues that if the CIA can  
release the spending total at the end of the budget debate, it 
should release the president's request at the beginning. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Meteor Streaks Across Western Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A small meteor streaked across the Western  
sky this morning, startling people from San Francisco to Las Vegas, 
more than 400 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bright and blue and really fantastic,'' one caller told  
San Francisco radio station KCBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio stations in several other cities, including Santa Barbara  
and San Bernardino in Southern California, also had people calling 
in about the mysterious light. 
</P>
<P>
	People reported seeing it for about five seconds, at about 6  
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The object was probably a fireball, or ``bolide,'' according to  
Jose Olivarez, director of the Chabot Observatory and Science 
Center in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the description, I'd say it was simply a small meteorite  
that entered the atmosphere,'' he said. ``It's not unusual, but it 
was clear last night so a lot of people saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivarez said he didn't see the meteor himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Callers said the bright light zipped across the sky, moving from  
East to West and vanishing over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes missile launches have been mistaken for meteors, but  
the Air Force said it had not launched a missile at Vandenberg Air 
Force base.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a complex deal that will shake up the global  
tire industry, Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. plans to acquire 10 
percent of Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and gain control 
of the Japanese manufacturer's U.S. and Western European 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, which is expected to be announced today,  
Goodyear will form six joint ventures with Sumitomo around the 
world, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. 
Goodyear will pay the highly leveraged Sumitomo $1 billion for its 
contribution to the joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear, the world's third-largest  
automobile tire maker, will acquire about 10 percent of Sumitomo's 
outstanding shares while Sumitomo, the fifth-largest tire maker, 
will get a smaller stake in Goodyear. The stock swap is worth about 
$88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry,  
will control about 22 percent of the market once the deal is 
completed. That will make Goodyear the largest tire maker in North 
America and second-largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA, the top two  
respectively, have dominated the tire industry for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo spokeswoman Michiko Ichimiya said that while the two  
companies still are ironing out a final accord, simultaneous press 
conferences are planned today in Tokyo and New York. She did not 
offer additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	Naoto Saito, the president of Sumitomo, is in New York for the  
last-minute negotiations and was expected to attend the press 
conference there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at Goodyear, which will release its earnings  
report today, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, based in Kobe, Japan, is Japan's third-largest tire  
company. It has annual sales of about $4 billion but is saddled 
with about $2.8 billion in debt. Goodyear has annual sales of about 
$13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear and Sumitomo already have a manufacturing agreement,  
through which Sumitomo makes Goodyear-brand tires for Nippon 
Goodyear, and Goodyear supplies Dunlop-brand tires to Sumitomo's 
U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six joint ventures, the largest will combine 14 factories  
operated by the two companies in Western Europe, the source said. 
Goodyear will have 75 percent control of the venture, which 
generates about $4 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-largest alliance will take place in the United  
States, where Goodyear will take 75 percent control of Sumitomo's 
factories in Buffalo, N.Y., and Huntsville, Ala. The facilities 
have about $800 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other joint ventures will take place in Japan, where  
Goodyear has been striving to expand its presence. Both of these 
alliances will be controlled by Sumitomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also plan to combine research and purchasing  
activities in separate joint ventures. The purchasing joint venture 
and other restructuring could save a combined total of $300 million 
a year by the third year of the deal.

<HEADLINE> Philanthropist Paul Mellon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paul Mellon, whose inherited fortune enabled  
him to provide Americans with Van Goghs and Cezannes, the Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina and beautification of 
a park across the street from the White House, died Monday at his 
home in Upperville, Va. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's most enduring legacy may be the starkly modern,  
trapezoid-shaped East Building of the National Gallery of Art, an 
expansion of the Pennsylvania Avenue museum founded by his father, 
industrialist Andrew W. Mellon. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon, his sister Ailsa Mellon Bruce and the Andrew W.  
Mellon Foundation together covered its $94 million cost. But Mellon 
chose architect I.M. Pei to design it and supervised its 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's wide-ranging philanthropy included a $5 million  
endowment of the symphony orchestra of Pittsburgh, where he was 
born, a contribution that made possible the purchase of the Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore and patronage of the Royal Veterinary 
College at the University of London. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he gave $409,000 to spruce up Lafayette Park across the  
street from the White House. Sky Meadows State Park in Virginia was 
another gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been an amateur in every phase of my life,'' Mellon  
wrote in ``Reflections in a Silver Spoon,'' his memoirs, ``an 
amateur poet, an amateur scholar, an amateur horseman, an amateur 
farmer, an amateur soldier, an amateur connoisseur of art, an 
amateur publisher and an amateur museum executive. The root of the 
word 'amateur' is the Latin word for love ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called Mellon ``one of America's most  
dedicated philanthropists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His true recognition comes from the millions of people whose  
love of art his gifts inspired,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon was also a lifelong horseman and fox hunter, and a  
successful horse breeder. His Sea Hero won the Kentucky Derby in 
1993. At the Belmont Stakes, his Quadrangle won in 1964 and his 
Arts and Letters won in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've bred some very good horses,'' he said in a 1992  
interview. ``A hundred years from now, the only place my name will 
turn up anywhere will be the studbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Forbes magazine rated him the 124th richest American,  
worth $1.4 billion. 

</P>
<P>
	Mellon's fortune was inherited from his father and built on  
holdings in banking, coal, railroads, steel and aluminum. Andrew 
Mellon, who served as secretary of the Treasury and ambassador to 
Britain, died in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon's 913 gifts to the National Gallery of Art included  
Paul Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat'' and Edgar Degas' original 
wax sculpture of the ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer.'' He also gave 
works by contemporary American artists, including Mark Rothko and 
Alexander Calder. 
</P>
<P>
	His interest in art began with British painting -- he established  
the Center for British Art at Yale University, where he graduated 
in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon, who earned a degree from Cambridge University in  
Britain, also paid for the publication of the I Ching, an ancient 
Chinese classic; the collected works of C.G. Jung, his friend and 
former analyst; and art historian Kenneth Clark's ``The Nude'' as 
well as complete editions of Plato, and the 30 volumes of the 
British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 40, Mellon enrolled as a freshman at St. John's College  
in Annapolis, Md., because he wanted to learn classical Greek. 
</P>
<P>
	He established the Bollingen prize for poetry and awarded the  
first to Ezra Pound while Pound was under indictment for treason 
after his broadcast on behalf of Mussolini's Italy in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his interest in horsemanship, Mellon joined the  
cavalry on enlisting as an Army private when the United States 
entered World War II. He rose to the rank of major in the Office of 
Strategic Services, predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's Upperville home is in Virginia's horse country, about  
45 miles west of Washington. He also had homes in Washington; 
Paris; New York; Antigua, West Indies; Nantucket, Mass., and Cape 
Cod, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial services will be held in Upperville and at the National  
Gallery, which also plans a memorial exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon is survived by his wife of 50 years, Rachel Lambert  
Lloyd, known as ``Bunny.'' He is also survived by two children by 
his first wife, Mary Conover Brown, who died in 1946: Catherine 
Conover and Timothy Mellon -- and by three grandchildren: John W. 
Warner, the son of the senior senator from Virginia, Mary W. 
Greenway and Virginia Warner.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Riot Said Handled Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The mayor's spokesman says Denver police acted  
appropriately by using tear gas and riot gear to break up an unruly 
crowd of post-Super Bowl celebrators ``hell-bent on causing 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were arrested and dozens were treated for  
tear gas exposure in the aftermath of the violence in downtown 
Denver on Sunday. Property damage was estimated at $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Hudson, a spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb, said the  
crowd was smaller than in the previous year, but was more 
aggressive. They tipped over trash cans and cars, broke windows and 
set bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could have been a lot worse,'' Hudson said Monday.  
``I think if police had not done as well in organizing their 
efforts, a lot more people would have gotten hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this was a crowd that had no respect for other  
people's property. They were hell-bent on causing trouble,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver was one of several cities statewide that reported  
problems with rowdy fans after the Denver Broncos defeated Miami to 
win their second consecutive NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	From Coors Field to the Capitol, pockets of fans tipped over  
trash cans and cars, broke windows in dozens of buildings, spilled 
newspaper boxes, ripped down street signs and lit bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas, horseback patrols and other  
riot-prevention measures to break them up. Officers in full riot 
gear banged nightsticks on shields and walked side by side through 
the streets to force the crowds to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rowdy and the police acted with as much restraint as  
they could,'' Hudson said. ``They also effectively used tear gas 
where it got really out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Colorado, police officers in Greeley also used tear  
gas to disperse crowds. Three people were arrested and two 
hospitalized for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 Fort Collins officers used pepper spray and batons to  
control a crowd of up to 4,000 revelers, who were mostly students 
at nearby Colorado State University. One man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of several  
hundred. There were three arrests and minor injuries to some police 
officers, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Junction, officers tried dogs and tear gas before  
resorting to water streaming from fire hoses to break up fans tying 
up traffic by packing a main street. At least five people were 
arrested but there were few reports of vandalism, said police 
spokeswoman Shari Zen.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Reid Honest About His Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lots of boxers talk a good fight. David Reid  
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I should lose, which I hate to say, it would be a learning  
experience,'' Reid said of his challenge to WBA super welterweight 
champion Laurent Boudouani of France on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Come again? Fighters don't talk about learning, they talk about  
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, listen to this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got us 50-50 (to win),'' said Al Mitchell, Reid's trainer.  
Aren't trainers supposed to say how their man will ``moider the 
bum?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, are these guys con artists?  
</P>
<P>
	Refreshingly, they are being honest.  
</P>
<P>
	Both know the 25-year-old Reid has the ability to take the  
154-pound title from the 32-year-old Frenchman. They also know the 
unbeaten Philadelphian will be fighting professionally for only the 
12th time, while it will be Boudouani's 42nd fight and his fifth 
title defense. His record is 38-2-1, 32 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing in this bout is speed,'' said Mitchell, in New  
York with Reid Tuesday to help promote the HBO-televised fight at 
Bally's Park Place in Atlantic City, N.J. ``If he can't handle 
David's speed, we'll win. If he can, we're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his brief career, Reid has faced many styles and has shown he  
can win on points -- having gone the distance five times, including 
12 rounds with James Coker in his last fight Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	It is power, however, that made Reid a celebrity. Trailing badly  
in the third round of the 156-pound final against Alfredo Duvergel 
at the Atlanta Olympics, Reid knocked out the Cuban with a right to 
the jaw. He was the only U.S. boxer to win a gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call that punch anything you want -- a money punch, a  
big punch,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was a money punch. He signed a five-year contract  
with America Presents that included a $1 million signing bonus. 
After going 7-0, Reid signed a multifight deal with HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Reid beat Boudouani, he would be the third member of the  
1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team to win a world title. Floyd 
Mayweather is the WBC super featherweight champion and Fernando 
Vargas is the IBF 154-pound champion.
