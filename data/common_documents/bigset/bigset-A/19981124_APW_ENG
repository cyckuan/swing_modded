Blair aims for mix of constitutional reform and voter-friendly
</HEADLINE>
issues &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Queen's speech starts at 1100 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair wants to balance major
constitutional reform with ''bread and butter'' issues in the next
session of Parliament.
	   His government was expected to introduce up to 20 bills when
Queen Elizabeth II reads out the Labor Party's legislative program
at the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday.
	   The main bill _ the one likely to receive the most media
attention _ calls for abolishing the parliamentary voting rights of
hereditary peers, the mainly Conservative scions of ancient
blue-blood families. They sit alongside peers who are appointed for
life in the House of Lords.
	   But British newspapers said in Tuesday's editions that Blair
does not want that issue to obscure bills that more directly affect
voters; he has told lawmakers that he wants a ''bread and butter
program'' this session.
	   Among other laws which Blair plans to drive through are a major
shakeup of welfare benefits, reform of the legal aid system and
greater protections for rape victims.
	   The Labor government's program also was expected to include
local government reforms, including a bill to create an elected
mayor for London, and the strengthening of labor union rights.
	   Conservative party chairman Michael Ancram said he would be
judging the queen's speech on whether it ''addresses the priorities
of the public or just the priorities of the Labor party''
	   ``The fear must be that Labor's priorities will be fiddling
around with our constitution and introducing measures to appease
their own party, instead of tackling the priorities of the
public,'' Ancram said.

Dallas wins 3-2 over Sharks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Dallas, Grant Marshall capped Dallas' three-goal second
period with the go-ahead goal as the Stars rallied from a two-goal
first-period deficit for a 3-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on
Monday night.
	   The Sharks thought they'd gotten the tying goal on Ron Stern's
rebound with 22.5 seconds left, but the goal was disallowed because
teammate Stephane Matteau was in the crease.
	   Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk added second-period goals for
the Stars, 8-1-1 at home this season and 4-0-1 in their last five
games overall.
	   Bill Houlder and Stern scored in the game's opening 5:29 to give
the Sharks a quick 2-0 lead.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Flames 2
	   In Toronto, Defenseman Sylvain Cote scored at 7:15 of the third
period to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs over the Calgary Flames.
	   Cote drifted in from the point to take a centering pass from
behind the net from Fredrik Modin and beat rookie goaltender
Jean-Sebastien Giguere for his third goal of the season.
	   Steve Thomas and Derek King also scored for Toronto, which won
its fourth straight home game. Valeri Bure and Cory Stillman scored
for Calgary, which lost its third straight game _ all on the road.
 &UR; Senators 4, Canucks 3
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Andreas Johansson scored two goals,
including the winner midway through the third period, to lead the
Ottawa Senators over the Vancouver Canucks.
	   Johansson, who has nine goals, blasted a slap shot past
Vancouver goaltender Garth Snow at 11:18 of the third, giving coach
Jacques Martin his 150th NHL victory.
	   Shawn McEachern and Magnus Arvedson also scored for Ottawa just
31 seconds apart early in the first period. Bill Muckalt, Dave
Scatchard and Markus Naslund scored for the Canucks, who were
without injured star Alexander Mogilny.

Trial of 127 anti-government protesters fixed for February
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 9-10 to UPDATE with opposition comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of 127 people arrested
during a demonstration demanding the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will begin in February, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The protesters appeared in court on Oct. 21, four days after
their arrest during a huge rally in support of jailed opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim, who is on trial for 10 counts of corruption
and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest sparked angry protests in Malaysia. It
also triggered international outrage when he appeared in court with
a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was blindfolded by
police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   The trial of his supporters was initially set for May. But a new
judge appointed to hear the cases ruled on Monday that the date be
brought forward to Feb. 2 in ``public interest,'' the Star and New
Straits Times newspapers said.
	   Conviction for disobeying police orders carries a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a fine of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,600).
	   Police have arrested people each time groups sympathetic to the
ousted deputy prime minister have organized protests. But
protesters have often been released without being formally charged.
	   During the latest protest on Saturday, police arrested at least
four Anwar supporters, including opposition leader Tian Chua, a
human rights activist who heads up an opposition coalition founded
after Anwar's arrest.
	   They were remanded to eight days in jail on Monday pending
investigations against them. No charges have been pressed against
Chua or the other three.
	   The coalition on Tuesday demanded Chua's release. ``We believe
that Tian Chua is being persecuted because he dared to dissent.'' a
statement by the People's Coalition for Democracy said.
	   ``We also demand that the government reaffirm its commitment to
democratic principles by allowing people to freely and openly voice
their opinions,'' the statement said.

Board member resigns following infighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rod McGeoch, one of the prime movers in
bring the Olympics to Sydney in 2000, resigned Tuesday from the
Olympic organizing board, saying he believed there would be a
continuing period of destabilization against him.
	   In a letter to New South Wales Premier Bob Carr, McGeoch said it
was critical for Sydney and Australia that the Games were an
outstanding success and they should not be sullied by personal
agendas.
	   He said despite calls from Carr, Prime Minister John Howard and
Olympic Minister Michael Knight to stop the campaign of
destabilization against him, he did not believe the calls had been
heeded and it seemed that they would continue.
	   McGeoch was criticized last week for allegedly requesting an
8,000 Australian dollar (5,120 US dlrs) payment to make a speech to
an American delegation about the Games.
	   He denied making any such request.
	   On Sunday, Howard criticized the Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games, urging board members to stop their squabbling in
order to protect Australia's reputation.
	   Olympics Minister Michael Knight, who is also SOCOG president,
said Monday he would be talking to all 15 board members urging them
to ``take a deep breath, calm down and get back to working
together.''
	   ``The board will be one big happy family very quickly,'' he
said. (djp)

China's unemployment to worsen, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is unable to create enough jobs to absorb
growing numbers of laid-off workers and new entrants to the work
force next year, according to a researcher at a government
think-tank quoted in a state-run newspaper Tuesday.
	   ``China's unemployment picture for 1999 will be even more grim
than this year's,'' the Economic Information Daily quoted Yang
Yiyong, director of the State Development Planning Commission's
Economic Research Institute, as saying.
	   Reforms of state-owned enterprises are expected to leave about 3
million workers jobless next year. Another 1.67 million
civil-service workers are likely to be laid off in local and
central government restructuring, and about 1.33 million workers
will be laid off from non-profit institutions, Yang said.
	   China plans to lay off a total of 5 million local- and
central-government workers and 4 million workers from non-profit
institutions by 2000, the report said.
	   According to official statistics, in 1998 the number of urban
registered unemployed is expected to total 6.2 million, 420,000
higher than in 1997. The official urban unemployment rate is
projected to reach 3.3 percent, up 0.2 percentage points from 1997,
the report said.
	   In reality, tens of millions of workers have been laid off from
state-run firms and many city dwellers are either unemployed or
underemployed, often subsisting on meager stipends from their
former employers.

Defense accuses police of treating Anwar harshly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim accused authorities in court on Tuesday of
handling him harshly but treating his accusers gently.
	   Police broke down the door of the former deputy prime minister's
home to arrest him on Sept. 20, and Anwar later appeared in court
with a black eye and bruises. He has accused guards of beating him.
	   That treatment contrasts sharply with what happened last year,
when agents negotiated for four hours before apprehending two of
Anwar's accusers, said defense lawyer Christopher Fernando.
	   Fernando, questioning police officer Mazlan Mansor, suggested in
court Tuesday that the two accusers _ Ummi Hafilda and Azizan Abu
Bakar _ were treated softly because they were backed by men in
power.
	   The two ``were given special treatment and the police dared not
move in because there were people behind these people who have
clout,'' Fernando said.
	   The defense has earlier insinuated that there may have been a
conspiracy involving senior government officials to frame Anwar.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and arrested
after launching a reform campaign, is on trial on charges of sexual
misconduct and corruption.
	   Ummi and Azizan were arrested last year and forced to retract
their statements _ allegedly by police acting on Anwar's orders.
Prosecutors accuse him of using his power to cover up his misdeeds.
	   The arrests were delayed because the police had to negotiate
with the landlady, Restina Majid, for four hours, Mazlan testified
Tuesday. He was among a team of agents sent to arrest the two on
Aug. 18, 1997.
	   Mazlan disagreed that police offered any special treatment in
the arrest. Restina is the sister-in-law of Aziz Shamshuddin, press
secretary of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar's trial resumed Monday after a weeklong recess so it would
not interfere with last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Anwar was arrested two weeks after his firing by Mahathir
sparked massive anti-government protests. The current trial
involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on another
corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual misconduct, at a
later date.
	   The 51-year-old sacked deputy denies the charges, calling them
part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former boss.
	   So far, 10 police officers have testified in support of the
prosecution version that Anwar had forced the police to obtain
retractions from Ummi, the sister of his former secretary, and
Azizan, his former chauffeur.
	   Ummi had accused Anwar of having sex with her brother's wife;
Azizan claimed he was sodomized by Anwar.

TV report: DiMaggio has lung cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Baseball great Joe DiMaggio, who has been
hospitalized for more than a month, has lung cancer and suffered a
heart attack last week, TV station WPIX reported Monday night.
	   The station, which televised New York Yankees games for 48
years, cited three sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
WPIX news executives declined to elaborate on the sourcing.
	   The Yankees' Hall of Fame outfielder has been hospitalized in
Hollywood, Florida, since Oct. 12 for what his attorney Morris
Engelberg said was pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   However, WPIX said DiMaggio, who will be 84 on Wednesday, had a
tumor removed from his lung last month.
	   The television station reported that when Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner canceled a visit last week, he was told DiMaggio
``probably wouldn't have recognized him anyway.''
	   The report also said friends of DiMaggio were concerned about
who was in control of his estate, which WPIX said includes an
estimated dlrs 20 million collectible and memorabilia fortune.
	   Memorial Regional Hospital has not provided information on
DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators have even denied
DiMaggio is a patient.
	   During the past two weeks, Engelberg faxed two updates on
DiMaggio's condition to the media, the last of which said DiMaggio
was improving after being ``very ill.''
	   ``He is doing well,'' a spokeswoman for Engelberg told The
Associated Press on Friday. She was unable to provide details,
however.
	   Engelberg's wife returned a message left on her husband's
answering machine Monday night by saying he was asleep and couldn't
come to the phone.

Ailing Samoan leader replaced by deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   APIA, Samoa (AP) _ Samoa's 52-year-old deputy premier was sworn
in as the Pacific nation's prime minister on Tuesday after Tofilau
Eti resigned to battle cancer and heart disease.
	   The new prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele Maleilegaoi, was deputy
leader of the governing Human Rights Protection Party.
	   Tofilau, who held power for 16 years, said he will remain a
member of Parliament representing his home district.
	   Tofilau appeared in public for the first time in three weeks on
Monday after returning from cancer treatment in New Zealand. He
resigned while addressing a session of Parliament.
	   He spoke for about five minutes but was too weak to continue.
	   Tofilau has also had major heart surgery and been hospitalized
in New Zealand several times in recent years. He is the uncle of
American Samoa Gov. Tauese Sunia.
	   Tuilaepa is a former bureaucrat and trade official in Brussels.
He holds a masters of commerce degree from New Zealand's Auckland
University.
	   He entered the Western Samoan parliament in 1978 and became
finance minister in December 1982, a job he held until 1985.
	   In 1985, the Tofilau government fell after its budget and
several other bills were defeated in parliament by the coalition

Following Dow's lead, Asian stock markets open with big gains

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reacting to Wall Street's resurrection from last
summer's steep decline, Asia's top three stock markets followed
suit by opening sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But that didn't leave everyone optimistic. In fact, some
analysts said that even though the region's stock markets are
enjoying rebounds, too, their darkest days were so bad that
volatility and profit-taking remain significant risks.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 2.3 percent
to a new high on Monday, capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from
last summer's plummet.
	   Extending a nearly non-stop rally that began less than two
months ago, the average rose 214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the
July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The return to record terrain followed four months of volatility
that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to 7,467 on Oct.
8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil, and its spread around the world, would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   In Tokyo the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
211.85 points, or 1.43 percent, to 14,991.79 during Tuesday's
morning session. Earlier in the day, the index had climbed briefly
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level for the
first time since Sept. 9.
	   ``Shares are rising as expected on the strength of New York
shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, the general manager of the stock
division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Hope also is growing that Japan will expand its rescue efforts
beyond the dlrs 196 billion plan it announced this month in an
effort to help an economy with its worst recession in 50 years.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 187.34
points, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday morning, to 10,701.87. That jump
came atop Monday's gain of 2.7 percent.
	   Jason Tang, a broker at South China Brokerage Ltd., said the
rally was mostly due to the Dow's rise and gains by the Hong Kong
market's biggest listed company, banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index opened 2
percent, or 27.62 points higher, to 1,404.56, an improvement that
broke through the closely watched 1,400-point plateau.
	   One trader called the gain a ``knee-jerk reaction'' to the surge
in New York, and warned that profit-taking had already begun to set
in and could increase during the day. Like many market analysts in
Singapore, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the Asia
financial crisis hit about 17 months ago.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei has increased nearly 12 percent since it fell to
13,406.39, on Sept. 30, its lowest point in 12 years. Singapore's
key index, which dropped to a low of 800.27 on Sept. 4, has since
risen 72 percent to close at 1376.94 on Nov. 23.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on August 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng has gained 58 percent.
	   The markets in Asia's three hardest-hit countries _ Thailand,
South Korea and Indonesia _ also have improved, some even more
dramatically than those of Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   But that also has left analysts warning that the region's
economic outlook just can't justify these gains, and trying to
figure just how long the rebound can last.

Report: Russia to issue commitments to China over Taiwan ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Following Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Russia will
promise not to challenge China's claim to Taiwan or sell the island
weapons, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Russia will pledge not to recognize Taiwan's independence,
support Taiwan's entry into the United Nations or formally
recognize the political split between Taiwan and China, the United
Daily News reported, quoting Chinese news agency reports.
	   And Russia will promise not to sell weaponry to Taiwan _ a
symbolic concession _ in a joint statement that the two sides plan
to release, the newspaper said without indicating when the
statement was expected.
	   Taiwan traditionally relies on the United States for its defense
needs, with some additional purchases from other suppliers
including France and the Netherlands.
	   China, with its booming foreign trade, is a vital customer for
Russia's defense industry, which was left scrambling for business
following the collapse of the old Soviet Union.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang met Monday in Moscow to adopt a statement on
expanding their relations and defining the western stretch of their
lengthy border.
	   Apart from the commitment on arms sales, the statement on Taiwan
will virtually duplicate a pledge made by U.S. President Bill
Clinton during his visit to China in the summer, the reports said.
	   Washington claimed Clinton's statement indicated no change in
U.S. policy, but his words were widely viewed as adding leverage to
China's efforts to isolate Taiwan, which it claims as a breakaway
province. Washington says it maintains a strong commitment to
ensure Taiwan has an adequate military defense.
	   Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, and China has
threatened to use force to bring the island back under its
authority. Like most countries, Russia doesn't recognize Taiwan in
deference to China, but Moscow and Taipei have established healthy
unofficial relations and exchanged representatives.

Rocket hits Kabul hours after Taliban release 100 prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ An opposition rocket slammed into
Kabul shortly before dawn on Tuesday, but there were no immediate
reports of casualties.
	   The attack came just hours after the Taliban army announced the
release of 100 opposition prisoners ``as a gesture of good will''
according to Radio Shariat.
	   The prisoners were soldiers loyal to opposition leader and
former military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, the radio broadcast said.
	   The men had been held in the Pul-e-Charkhi jail on the outskirts
of the capital.
	   Opposition soldiers, holding positions barely 20 kilometers (12
miles) outside the capital, have not taken responsibility for the
rocket attack. However in recent days they have been targeting the
combined military and civilian airport with their rockets in an
attempt to stop the taking off of Taliban military jets from the
airport.
	   The Taliban army, which rules about 90 percent of the country,
is battling its northern-based opposition, which controls the rest.
	   Much of the fighting in recent days has been centered in Khinjon
district of Baghlan province, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) north
of Kabul. The area is important because it straddles the only major
supply road leading north to the border with the central Asian
nations.

Women prisoners demand right to sex with their partners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Demanding their right
to have sexual relations with their partners, 70 women inmates
created an uproar at a prison in the northern Dominican Republic.
	   The women launched a noisy protest Sunday, beating objects
against the rails of their overcrowded prison cell.
	   ``We want sex, that's our main demand, and we're going to fight
for it because we are human beings just as men are,'' Janet
Altagracia Sanchez, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said in a
telephone call Monday from Rafey Prison in Santiago.
	   Male prisoners in the Dominican Republic are allowed to have sex
with their partners, but judicial authorities had rejected the
women's demand, saying it would turn the prison into a maternity
home.
	   ``Don't they know there are ways to prevent pregnancy?'' she
asked.
	   There was no comment from Dominican officials on Monday.
	   The Dominican Commission for Human Rights, however, listened to
their grievance and promised to present their petition to prison
authorities.
	   ``The law permits inmates, without sexual distinction, to have
sexual relations with their partners,'' commission president
Porfirio Rojas Nina said.

Hong Kong's First Pacific completes 27.4 percent buy-in of
</HEADLINE>
Philippines' PLDT
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with First Pacific announcing buy-in &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., giving it management control of the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company.
	   First Pacific Managing Director Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino,
said he has been appointed chief executive officer and president of
PLDT, replacing Antonio Cojuangco in both posts.
	   Cojuangco was appointed PLDT chairman, replacing Roberto Romulo.
	   Under the agreement, which has kept the stock market on
tenterhooks for the past few months and triggered wild swings in
PLDT's share price, First Pacific paid dlrs 750 million for a 27.4
percent stake in PLDT, or 1,420 pesos (dlrs 35.85) per share.
	   PLDT closed Tuesday at 1,055 pesos, down 30 pesos from the
previous day.
	   Pangilinan said the PLDT stake will be held by First Pacific's
non-listed Philippine unit, Metro Pacific Asset Holdings Inc. Many
analysts had expected that listed Metro Pacific Corp. would have
incorporated the PLDT stake.
	   First Pacific said it financed the acquisition largely from the
sale of assets begun late last year and from bank loans.
	   In a complicated buy-in, First Pacific's stake in PLDT was
acquired by paying dlrs 552 million for a 52.7 percent shareholding
in the Cojuangco family's holding company, Philippine
Telecommunications Investment Corp., which holds a 21.5 percent
stake in PLDT, and by buying around 5.9 percent of PLDT on the
market for dlrs 197 million.
	   The transactions give First Pacific 27.4 percent of PLDT's
voting rights and make First Pacific the single largest
shareholder.

inaugurating the Palestinians' first gateway to the world to the
cheers of dozens of dignitaries waiting on the ground.
	   For many Palestinians, the opening of the airport marks an
important step forward on the road to independence.
	   However, Israel will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and
will have the right to keep people or goods out if it considers
them a danger to Israeli security.

retrenchment of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks with
another foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they will draw up
a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the Philippine flag carrier.
	   President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora,
said the two airlines have disagreed on how many of PAL's more than
8,000 workers should be laid off to make the airline viable.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that Hong Kong-based
Cathay Pacific wants to trim PAL's workforce to about 5,000 but PAL
chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan did not want to cut the
number of workers below 8,000 to avoid antagonizing the company's
unions.
	   Cathay Pacific also wants to lay off about 200 PAL pilots, a
proposal also opposed by Tan, Zamora said. Tan wants to retain the
200 pilots because they stood by him when the majority of PAL's
pilots staged a devastating strike in June.
	   Tan has gone to the United States to try to revive talks with
Northwest Airlines, which earlier expressed interest in investing
in PAL, Zamora said.
	   Zamora said Northwest was larger than Cathay Pacific ``and maybe
its first action would not be to fire employees.''
	   PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo did not comment on the reported
disagreement but said negotiations between the two companies were
continuing. He said Cathay Pacific is still studying PAL's
financial records.
	   Cathay Pacific officials in the Philippines declined to comment.
	   An analyst at Golden Sachs in Hong Kong, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said PAL might be using a renewal of talks with
Northwest as a bargaining tactic with Cathay Pacific.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.

	   At half-hour intervals, six more festive flights were to arrive
Tuesday from places including Morocco and Spain. The European
Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment and training, is
sending its Mideast envoy in a special plane.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week. Civil aviation contracts with other carriers are in the works
and expanded service plans include weekly flights to Cyprus and
Japan.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat will fly on his presidential plane for the
first time out of his homeland to Paris to meet with French
President Jacques Chirac. Until now, Arafat has had drive to Egypt,
where his plane was kept, and fly on from there.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and Arafat's autonomous government over
Israel's security role.
	   Israel will have a say over who and what enters Gaza, but the
Israeli monitors will operate discretely, behind one-way mirrors,
as they do now at two other crossings into autonomous Palestinian
areas. Israel will not interfere with departures from the airport.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River peace deal signed last month by Israel and the Palestinians.

Tigers sign free agent pitcher from Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Detroit Tigers' search for pitching help
stretched to Japan, where they signed right-hander Masao Kida to a
dlrs 3 million, two-year contract.
	   ``We scouted him three times this summer,'' Tigers general
manager Randy Smith said Monday. ``He's got good size, at 6-foot-3
(1.83 meters) and 210 pounds (95.26 kilos), and he's got a major
league arm.''
	   Smith traveled to Japan last week, dined twice with Kida and
obviously made a good impression. The deal was wrapped up by
telephone and fax over the weekend.
	   ``He's very poised, very level-headed,'' Smith said. ``Even with
the language barrier, we think he's going to be a good fit with our
ballclub.''
	   Kida, 30, who played last season for the Orix Blue Wave of
Japan's Pacific League, compiled a 54-64 record with a 3.81 ERA in
10 seasons in the Japanese leagues _ all but one with the Tokyo
Yomiuri Giants of the Central League.
	   Last season, Kida began as a starter but was switched to the
bullpen on Aug. 7. After that, he was one of the league's most
effective relievers, earning 16 saves _ third-most in the league _
with a 1.38 ERA and a 1-1 record in 22 games.
	   Including his starts, Kida was 4-7 with a 4.72 ERA overall last
season.
	   Because the Tigers already have Todd Jones and Doug Brocail,
they will probably give Kida a chance to make the rotation in
spring training.
	   ``That's a very strong possibility,'' Smith said. ``He has three
quality pitches _ fastball, slider and split-finger. We've clocked
him as high as 96 m.p.h. on the radar gun.''
	   Smith said Kida was consistently in the low- to mid-90's on the
gun.
	   For his career, Kida has averaged 7.6 strikeouts per nine
innings pitched.
	   Kida, used primarily as a starter early in his career, ranked
third in ERA in 1990 at 2.71 and seventh in 1993 at 3.35. He also
led the Central League with 182 strikeouts in 1990.
	   Kida is expected to visit Detroit early in December.
	   To make room for Kida on their 40-man roster, the Tigers
designated right-hander Greg Keagle for assignment. Keagle, 27,
picked most of the 1998 season at Triple-A Toledo of the
International League. In nine games with the Tigers, he was 0-5
with a 5.59 ERA.
	   Kida's signing highlights the trend of major league teams
turning to Japan to find new talent.
	   Japanese pitchers currently in the majors include Hideki Irabu
of the New York Yankees, Masato Yoshii of the New York Mets and
Shigetoshi Hasegawa of the Anaheim Angels.
	   The Tigers already have two Australian pitchers _ Russell Spear
and Rikki Johnston _ in the minors. They acquired Spear in a trade,
but signed Johnston as a free agent out of high school last spring.
	   The Tigers have been unable to sign a major-league free-agent
pitcher. They offered Todd Stottlemyre dlrs 32 million over four
years, but he turned them down, accepting a similar deal with the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Detroit did, however, sign third baseman Dean Palmer to a
five-year, dlrs 36 million contract.

Hong Kong government enters clemency plea for death row gangster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Amid criticisms that Hong Kong has refused to
help residents arrested across the border in China, the government
asked a mainland court to spare one man who got the death penalty
in a high-profile gangster trial, officials said Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong forwarded a clemency plea filed by the family of Chin
Hon-sau, 42, who is on death row in the southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou awaiting word on an appeal of his convictions, said Alex
Li, a Security Bureau spokesman.
	   Reputed Hong Kong mob boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big
Spender,'' and four accomplices, including Chin, were sentenced to
death two weeks ago in a crime spree that included a pair of
sensational kidnappings involving two Hong Kong tycoons and
arms-smuggling.
	   Two others were also given death sentences that were suspended
for two years, and more than 20 other gang members received jail
terms, some for life.
	   Chin's family was the only one to request a clemency plea from
Hong Kong authorities, Li said.
	   The government has come under fire for not asking for a transfer
of the case to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system and no
death penalty. The defendants were tried behind closed doors in
Guangzhou.
	   Li did not specify how vigorously Hong Kong would pursue
clemency for Chin, saying only that officials will now await
China's response.
	   Speaking for foreign reporters Monday, Secretary for Security
Regina Ip reiterated that the Hong Kong government did not have
enough evidence to press charges, mainly because the kidnappings,
reportedly of Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip Sun Hung Kai Properties, were
never reported to Hong Kong authorities.
	   She also said the government routinely forwards clemency pleas
for Hong Kong residents on death row in other countries.
	   Members of Cheung's gang was also convicted in the smuggling of
dynamite and guns from China into Hong Kong, seven armed robberies
at Hong Kong gold stores that netted U.S. dlrs 950,000 and the
theft of 277 tons of steel in Shenzhen, China.
	   One man was killed in the steel heist.

	   For the time being, airport operations will have to rely on a
good deal of improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including
the controls for the control tower and the computers for the
check-in counters, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Zeidan said Israel has been holding up the goods for over a
year, and was demanding 2.6 million shekels (dlrs 63,000) to
release them.
	   Other gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnetic equipment
were being inspected for safety standards by Israel, said Tomer
Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza.
	   Portable control equipment in a van was to guide Tuesday's
flights to a safe landing.
	   Despite its shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport
a big step toward independence. For those living in the small,
overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one
side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the
ever-present feeling of being trapped.
	   In the past, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed
permission to enter Israel and fly out of the international airport
near Tel Aviv. Israel rarely granted permission, however, forcing
Palestinians to travel through Israeli-controlled land routes to
Egypt or Jordan to catch flights.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, adding that
he plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
	   Palestinians from the West Bank, separated from Gaza by Israel,
will still need Israeli permission to travel to the Gaza airport.
	   Designed in an Oriental style with elaborate tiles imported from
Morocco, the airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a
three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall
poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   For the time being, Israelis will not be permitted to use the
airport because of security concerns. However, many believe Gaza
International will eventually rival Ben Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv.

Report: Taiwan aims for missile defense against China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan wants U.S. help in building a
missile defense system to protect its west coast from Chinese
attack and has already applied to buy advanced U.S. warships,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Taiwan wants to deploy the most advanced version of the U.S.
Patriot missile defense system to protect a huge swath around the
capital Taipei, as well as the major cities of Taichung and
Kaohsiung, the China Times said, quoting Tang Fei, chief of the
military's general staff.
	   Tang also said Taiwan has already formally applied to the United
States to purchase an unspecified number of advanced Aegis
guided-missile destroyers, the Liberty Times daily said in a
separate report.
	   If the United States agrees to the sale, the ships that cost
about U.S. dlrs 800 million each would be deliverable in 2006, the
paper quoted Tang saying.
	   The Defense Ministry's press office confirmed that Tang had
spoken to reporters at a luncheon Monday but declined to comment
directly on the reports.
	   A new Patriot system, estimated to cost more than U.S. dlrs 1
billion, would reinforce Patriots already being installed around
Taipei, the reports said. Taiwan is spending over U.S. dlrs 385
million to deploy 200 of the missiles, an improved version of the
weapons used in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The newer system would have a longer range and intercept
incoming missiles at a much higher altitude, improving their
chances of knocking them out of the sky, the reports said.
	   Taiwan might be able to buy the system, also known as theater
missile defense, or TMD, within three years, Tang was quoted
saying.
	   He conceded its development in the United States has yet to
achieve major breakthroughs, but predicted eventual success, the
report said. Taiwan is lobbying Washington to help it set up a
system to evaluate TMD's uses, he was quoted saying.
	   That follows the recent passage of a resolution in the U.S.
congress calling on the Pentagon to study Taiwanese involvement in
TMD, now being considered for eventual use by the United States and
Japan.
	   Taiwan is considered particularly vulnerable to missile attack
from China, which considers the island a breakaway province to be
reunited with with force if necessary. That threat was advertised
during Chinese test firings of its M-9 ballistic missiles in
1995-96 near Taiwan aimed at intimidating independence supporters
on the island.
	   Taiwan's own missile development program _ while chalking up
numerous successes _ still lags five years behind the United States
in technology, Tang was quoted saying. Costs of missile development
in Taiwan can be up to ten times those in the United States, he was
quoted saying.
	   Taiwan hopes to obtain considerable technology transfer as part
of a deal with the United States, allowing it to build at least
half the new Patriots here, Tang was quoted saying.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student demonstrators on
Tuesday demanded the ouster of Indonesia's military chief, who
warned that campus activists would continue anti-government
protests until general elections in mid-1999.
	   A newspaper, meanwhile, reported that Gen. Wiranto had jailed
163 soldiers who allegedly violated proper procedures during Nov.
13 clashes in which student protesters were killed.
	   The soldiers were imprisoned for three weeks and could face a
court-martial, the Media Indonesia newspaper quoted Maj. Gen.
Djusri Marin, chief of military police, as saying.
	   Wearing yellow jackets, about 300 students from the prestigious
University of Indonesia marched toward the presidential palace but
were blocked by security forces.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' they chanted.
	   In a separate protest, about 500 students pushed their way past
the gates of the office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to
demand a trial of former President Suharto on charges of corruption
and human rights abuses.
	   ``First Suharto has to be put on trial. Then it's the turn of
the other cronies. If not, we'll protest all the time,'' said
Samsuddin, an engineering student.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, some of whom occupied
the office lobby.
	   Suharto was ousted by riots and protests in May after 32 years
of authoritarian rule. His successor and former protege, President
B.J. Habibie, has promised democratic reforms but student activists
say he is not serious about political change.
	   Wiranto predicted that student protesters would continue to push
their demands, which include the ouster of Habibie and an end to
the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   The Nov. 13 clashes have tarnished the image of the military,
which has already faced a barrage of criticism for human rights
abuses committed during the Suharto era.
	   At least nine students died in the fighting during a
controversial government assembly on political reforms, one of
which set parliamentary elections for next year.
	   Although Wiranto had ordered riot officers to carry only blanks
and plastic bullets, hospital doctors said they found metal bullet
fragments in the some of the victims.
	   The clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta and a
total of 16 people died.
	   Violence erupted in the Indonesian capital again Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.
	   The violence this month comes amid Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as
inflation and unemployment rates soar.
	   Economic hardship sparked the citywide riots six months ago that
killed 1,200 people and helped dislodge Suharto.

Philippine president rejects foreign appeals to stop execution of
</HEADLINE>
rapist

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has turned
down appeals from the Vatican and other countries for the
Philippines to cancel its first execution in 22 years and repeal
the death penalty, his spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The Vatican, the European Union and Canada recently sent appeals
to the Philippine government arguing that the death penalty would
not reduce widespread crime, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
	   A Philippine judge has ordered prison authorities to execute Leo
Echegaray, convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old
stepdaughter, but ordered the execution date to be kept secret. The
scheduled execution has triggered a debate over the death penalty
that has divided many Filipinos.
	   ``President Estrada has a constitutional duty to see to it that
laws are faithfully executed and the law requires the execution. He
has to obey the law,'' presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said.
	   Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying the execution
would deter similar crimes.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said he has learned that
Echegaray may be executed sometime in January. He said he plans to
ask the Supreme Court to compel Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the
Quezon City Regional Trial Court to publicly reveal the exact date
of execution.
	   Under current government rules, authorities are forbidden from
informing Echegaray of his impending execution until after sunrise
on execution day. Cuevas, however, said the rules don't prohibit
the date from being disclosed publicly.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter crime, and that
crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

Cambodian opposition leader returns to show of police force

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Barricaded streets and hundreds of
police armed with assault rifles greeted opposition leader Sam
Rainsy upon his return Tuesday to Cambodia, two months after he
left over fears for his security.
	   Squadrons of police on motorbikes patrolled the capital in a
show of force unseen since leader Hun Sen ordered a crackdown in
early September on anti-government demonstrations organized by the
opposition.
	   The demonstrations, protesting Hun Sen's narrow victory in
parliamentary elections in July, were violently suppressed and Sam
Rainsy was publicly threatened with arrest.
	   Fearing for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his ally, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of
Cambodia. The prince and his FUNCINPEC party returned earlier this
month and agreed to a coalition government with Hun Sen.
	   With the opposition's boycott of parliament broken, Sam Rainsy
agreed to lead his lawmakers back to Cambodia for the first session
of the National Assembly, scheduled Wednesday.
	   Shortly after his arrival at the airport, police cut off
supporters following their leader's motorcade and beat them back
with batons, Sam Rainsy Party officials said.
	   ``People who wanted to accompany me got beaten by police,'' Sam
Rainsy said. ``It reminds me of the demonstrations, and it reminds
me of a climate of violence that I would like to see over in this
country.''
	   Sam Rainsy had planned to lay a wreath and speak to his
supporters outside the National Assembly, the center of
post-election protests and site of a March 1997 grenade attack
against a protest he was leading that killed at least 16 people and
injured more than 100.
	   Municipal authorities denied the party's request to stage the
welcoming rally on the basis that it could jeopardize security for
Wednesday's parliamentary session, Sam Rainsy Party spokesman Rich
Garella said.
	   Police blocked the streets around the assembly, forcing Sam
Rainsy to hold the rally at party headquarters.
	   Sam Rainsy and the other 14 lawmakers from his party will be the
parliamentary opposition after Hun Sen and Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13
to form a coalition with Hun Sen as prime minister. The prince will
be National Assembly president.
	   Sam Rainsy expressed guarded optimism to reporters that his
former ally and Hun Sen would carry out a joint political program
that is said to support administrative, financial and judicial
reforms.
	   But he later blasted Ranariddh's party in a speech to about 200
supporters, saying FUNCINPEC had betrayed its supporters by
abandoning its allegations of electoral fraud in favor of forming a
government.
	   ``The Sam Rainsy Party will not exchange the people's blood for
positions in the government,'' Sam Rainsy said.

Dollar, stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices in Tokyo soared Tuesday following a
new record high on Wall Street overnight. The U.S. dollar was
higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 384.70 points,
or 2.60 percent, to finish the session at 15,164.64, the index's
first close above 15,000 points since Aug. 25.
	   Markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday. On Friday,
the Nikkei had gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.32 yen, up 1.16 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also above its New York level of 120.99 yen late Monday.
	   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
214.72, closing at a new record high of 9374.27 points, boosted by
news of possible takeovers of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank and of
Netscape Communications by America Online. The Dow's previous
record was 9337.97 set in July.
	   The rally kept going in Tokyo.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, to 1155.61. The TOPIX
had climbed 26.74 points, or 2.42 percent, on Friday.
	   ``The Nikkei continued to advance reflecting the record high in
New York,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, manager at Chuo Securities.
	   Trading in futures and options on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
suspended Tuesday morning after a computer malfunction. Trading
resumed in the afternoon at 2:00 p.m. (0500 GMT).
	   On the foreign exchange market, increased confidence in the U.S.
economy after the Dow's dramatic surge lifted the dollar against
the yen.
	   But traders said that the greenback's advance was being capped
by the Tokyo stock market's gains in response to the rise on Wall
Street.
	   Japanese institutional investors and U.S. investors snapped up
dollars in early Asian trading, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.915 percent from Friday's finish of 0.900
percent, driving its price down to 107.78 yen from 107.92.

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Egypt Air passenger plane slowly
descended onto the tarmac of Gaza International Airport on Tuesday,
inaugurating the Palestinians' first gateway to the world to the
cheers of dozens of dignitaries waiting on the ground.
	   For many Palestinians, the opening of the airport marks an
important step forward on the road to independence.
	   However, Israel will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and
will have the right to keep people or goods out if it considers
them a danger to Israeli security.

	   At half-hour intervals, six more festive flights were to arrive
Tuesday from places including Morocco and Spain. The European
Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment and training, is
sending its Mideast envoy in a special plane.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week. Civil aviation contracts with other carriers are in the works
and expanded service plans include weekly flights to Cyprus and
Japan.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat will fly on his presidential plane for the
first time out of his homeland to Paris to meet with French
President Jacques Chirac. Until now, Arafat has had drive to Egypt,
where his plane was kept, and fly on from there.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and Arafat's autonomous government over
Israel's security role.
	   Israel will have a say over who and what enters Gaza, but the
Israeli monitors will operate discretely, behind one-way mirrors,
as they do now at two other crossings into autonomous Palestinian
areas. Israel will not interfere with departures from the airport.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River peace deal signed last month by Israel and the Palestinians.

	   For the time being, airport operations will have to rely on a
good deal of improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including
the controls for the control tower and the computers for the
check-in counters, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Zeidan said Israel has been holding up the goods for over a
year, and was demanding 2.6 million shekels (dlrs 63,000) to
release them.
	   Other gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnetic equipment
were being inspected for safety standards by Israel, said Tomer
Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza.
	   Portable control equipment in a van was to guide Tuesday's
flights to a safe landing.
	   Despite its shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport
a big step toward independence. For those living in the small,
overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one
side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the
ever-present feeling of being trapped.
	   In the past, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed
permission to enter Israel and fly out of the international airport
near Tel Aviv. Israel rarely granted permission, however, forcing
Palestinians to travel through Israeli-controlled land routes to
Egypt or Jordan to catch flights.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, adding that
he plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
	   Palestinians from the West Bank, separated from Gaza by Israel,
will still need Israeli permission to travel to the Gaza airport.
	   Designed in an Oriental style with elaborate tiles imported from
Morocco, the airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a
three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall
poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   For the time being, Israelis will not be permitted to use the
airport because of security concerns. However, many believe Gaza
International will eventually rival Ben Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv.

Prosecutors request three-year terms for two Korean arms dealers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors asked a court Tuesday to
sentence two South Korean arms dealers to three years each in
prison on charges of obtaining military secrets.
	   Shin Dong-yoon, 56, and Kim Jang-hwan, 51, were accused of
obtaining classified information on South Korea's plans to buy spy
planes, jet fighters, missiles and other modern weapons.
	   Four ``colonel-level'' Korean officers were arrested in
connection with the case and were awaiting trial, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   During Tuesday's hearing at the Seoul District Criminal Court,
the two arms dealers appealed for leniency, arguing that the
information they had obtained was only partial and was not valuable
enough to threaten national security.
	   The two allegedly passed the information to their U.S.-based
business partner, Linda Kim, 41, between February 1997 and last
March.
	   Linda Kim, who was not arrested, serves as a consultant for
E-Systems Inc. of Plano, Texas, prosecutors said.
	   South Korea is a major buyer of U.S. arms. It plans to spend
dlrs 33.6 billion on new weapons through 2004.

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Taking a major step toward
statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza
International Airport, their first gateway to the world.
	   An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in
the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt).
	   Palestinian Cabinet ministers lined up along a red carpet on the
airfield excitedly stood on tiptoes as Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat walked toward the plane to greet the first arrivals.
	   ``This is one of the statements of sovereignty,'' Finance
Minister Mohammed Nashashibi said proudly.
	   However, Israel will still have a role in operating the airport.
It will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and will have the
right to keep travelers or goods out if it considers them a danger
to Israeli security. Disputes over security arrangements had
delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents approached
the Egypt Air jet together and collected the passports of the
Egyptian passengers, including Cabinet ministers and comedian Adel
Imam, in white bags for stamping by a Palestinian official.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled
Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers
and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often
with difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad. Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed
permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International
airport near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to
Jordan and catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank will still need a special
permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is
expected to become easier once a land route between the West Bank
and Gaza opens next month.
	   For the time being, Israel's government does not permit Israelis
to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
	   The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the
accord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last
week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open
next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian
seaport in Gaza are continuing.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   On Tuesday, a total of seven flights were scheduled to land,
including an Israeli plane chartered by the European Union envoy to
the Middle East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week. Civil aviation contracts with other carriers are in the
works.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat will fly on his presidential plane for the
first time from Gaza International to Paris. Until now, Arafat has
had drive to Egypt, where his plane was kept, and fly from there.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on a
good deal of improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including
the controls for the control tower and the computers for the
check-in counters, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Fayez Zeidan, the head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation
Authority, said Israel has been holding up the goods for over a
year, and is demanding 2.6 million shekels (dlrs 630,000) to
release them.
	   Other gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnetic equipment
were being inspected for safety standards by Israel, Israeli
officials said.
	   Portable control equipment in a van was to guide Tuesday's
flights to a safe landing.
	   Despite its shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport
a big step toward independence. For those living in the small,
overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one
side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the
ever-present feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University. He said that he plans to fly
next month to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's
holiest site.

Thunderstorms save England from defeat

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Gusty subtropical thunderstorms may
have saved England from defeat in the drawn first Ashes cricket
test Tuesday, forcing play to be abandoned just prior to the final
session.
	   After bad light had stopped play 20 minutes before the scheduled
tea break, the heavens opened about an hour later and the deluge it
left forced umpires Darrell Hair and K.T. Francis to abandon the
test shortly before scheduled stumps.
	   Set to make 348 for an unlikely win, England was teetering on
179 for six with Dominic Cork and Robert Croft playing out 23
nerve-wrecking minutes in deteriorating light.
	   After three deliberations Hair and his Sri Lankan counterpart
Francis offered the light and the two batsmen gleefully accepted it
and walked off the ground for the last time.
	   Australia hit 485 in its first innings thanks to centuries by
Steve Waugh and Ian Healy and bowled England out for 375 after fast
bowler Glenn McGrath ran through the lower order with 6-85.
	   Michael Slater's bludgeoning 138-ball 113 runs enabled Australia
declare on 237 for three and give itself 99 overs to bowl England
out the second time.
	   England's hopes of salvaging a draw at the start of the
five-test series was first undermined by McGrath's psychological
hold on opener Mike Atherton and a series of poor shot selections
against leg spinner Stuart MacGill and part time off-spinner Mark
Waugh.
	   Left to bat out a minimum of 92 overs on the last day, England
lost Atherton in the first hour and Mark Butcher and skipper Alec
Stewart before lunch to slump to 108 for three.
	   MacGill and Waugh, bowling in tandem in the 100 minutes of play
possible after lunch, removed Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe and
Mark Ramprakash _ three chief contributors in the first innings.
	   Croft, England's batting hero against South Africa at Old
Trafford when he played out three hours and saved the test in July,
was unbeaten on four while Cork was on 21.
	   The pair came together at 161 for six.
	   Australia's effort on the last day extended its hold on England
and the Ashes which it has held over five series since winning in
1989 under Allan Border.
	   Although MacGill and Waugh shared five of the six wickets to
fall, it was McGrath's dismissal of Atherton that broke the
backbone of any intentions England had of playing out an easy draw.
	   Australia, undoubtedly the No. 1 test team in the world after
its historic success in Pakistan in September, never let England
off the hooks despite two catches being grassed.
	   Hussain, enjoying the two reprieves top scored with 47, but once
he played on to MacGill, off a wrong 'un, an England defeat looked
inevitable until the weather intervened.
	   His 149-minute presence included two sixes off Waugh and a
solitary boundary off 122 balls.
	   Butcher and Hussain shrugged off the early setback with a 50-run
second-wicket partnership until England lost two wickets in three
overs in the last 15 minutes lead up to lunch.
	   Butcher padded up to MacGill and was adjudged leg before wicket
and three overs later Stewart was caught by Ricky Ponting at silly
point off Waugh.
	   Butcher followed up his 116 in the first innings with 40 in the
second.
	   McGrath, with 185 wickets in 41 tests, has dismissed Atherton 11
times in 16 innings over eight tests.
	   The chief destroyer in the 1997 Ashes with 36 wickets, McGrath
extended his tally against England to 49 wickets in nine tests.

New Lebanese president taking over in rare peaceful transition

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In an orderly democratic transfer of
power rare in the Arab world, an outgoing Lebanese president left
office and another was being sworn in Tuesday.
	   The inauguration of Emile Lahoud and departure of Elias Hrawi,
whose nine-year extended term expired at midnight (2200GMT) Monday,
marked the first smooth transition in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly
three decades.
	   The last two presidents took over after assassinations.
	   Lahoud, who was commander of the Lebanese army, was elected by
Parliament on Oct. 15 after winning popular support and the
all-important approval of President Hafez Assad of Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. He has pledged to work to clean up
government and make the rule of law supreme.
	   Lahoud, a general who has commanded the army since 1989 and
rebuilt the force decimated by the 1975-90 civil war, was to be
sworn for a six-year term at the Parliament after 11 a.m.
(0900GMT).
	   He then moves to the presidential palace, and Hrawi leaves the
hilltop residence in suburban Baabda for the last time.
	   Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet
automatically resigns at the end of the presidential term. The
architect of Lebanon's reconstruction program, Hariri was expected
to be named again as prime minister by Lahoud.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, respects the
power-sharing arrangement based on religion established with the
1943 independence from France: the president is Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
The 128-member Parliament is divided equally between Muslims and
Christians.
	   Despite the criticism from opponents of Syria's dominance of
Lebanon over Lahoud's election with Assad's approval, Tuesday
marked a transformation for Lebanon as it recovers from civil war.
	   When Hrawi became president in 1989 the state was fractured and
battles raged between Christians and Muslims. Today, the country is
rebuilding itself, order has been restored and the armed forces
have re-established state authority.
	   ``It was my destiny to take over a state that was in collapse
and disarray and I hand over a unified nation,'' Hrawi said in a
televised farewell speech Monday night.
	   But Hrawi also said he remained distressed at Israel's continued
occupation of 10 percent of Lebanese territory. Israel has
controlled a border zone in the south since 1985, saying it was
necessary to protect its northern communities from cross-border
guerrilla raids.
	   The transfer of power Tuesday was unusual in the Arab world
where in many countries military leaders or dictators hold power
for decades.
	   Tuesday also marked the first orderly, non-violent transfer of
power in the downtown Parliament headquarters since 1970, when
Suleiman Franjieh was sworn in.
	   In 1976, President Elias Sarkis took office in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley town of Chtaura as Beirut was
engulfed in street fighting.
	   Bashir Gemayel, who was elected in 1982 with backing from
Israeli invading forces, was killed in a bomb explosion 10 days
before he was to take office. His older brother, Amin, became
president in a ceremony at a military base.
	   In 1988, Amin Gemayel left office without Parliament agreeing on
a successor, resulting in a divided government whose troops fought
each other.
	   Rene Mouawad was elected president in 1989 at a military base in
northern Lebanon but was assassinated in a bomb explosion about a
month later on Nov. 22 _ Independence Day.
	   Hrawi was elected two days later. His six-year term was extended
in 1995 by three years by constitutional amendment. The decision
came after Assad announced his approval in a newspaper interview.

Hong Kong's First Pacific completes 27.4 percent buy-in of
</HEADLINE>
Philippines' PLDT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., giving it management control of the country's largest
telecommunications company.
	   First Pacific Managing Director Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino,
said he has been appointed chief executive officer and president of
PLDT, replacing Antonio Cojuangco in both posts.
	   Cojuangco was appointed PLDT chairman, replacing Roberto Romulo.
	   Under the agreement, which has kept the stock market on
tenterhooks for the past few months and triggered wild swings in
PLDT's share price, First Pacific paid dlrs 750 million for a 27.4
percent stake in PLDT, or 1,420 pesos (dlrs 35.85) per share.
	   PLDT closed Tuesday at 1,055 pesos, down 30 pesos, or 2.8
percent, from the previous day.
	   Pangilinan said the PLDT stake will be held by First Pacific's
non-listed Philippine unit, Metro Pacific Asset Holdings Inc. Many
analysts had expected that listed Metro Pacific Corp. would
incorporate the PLDT stake.
	   In a complicated buy-in, First Pacific's stake in PLDT was
acquired by paying dlrs 552 million for a 52.7 percent share of the
Cojuangco family's holding company, Philippine Telecommunications
Investment Corp., which holds a 21.5 percent stake in PLDT, and by
buying around 5.9 percent of PLDT on the market for dlrs 197
million.
	   The transactions give First Pacific 27.4 percent of PLDT's
voting rights and make it the single largest shareholder.
	   First Pacific also said it has reached a preliminary agreement
for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to raise its stake
in Smart Communications Inc., the Philippines' largest cellular
telephone service provider, to 40 percent from 15 percent. No
financial terms were released.
	   First Pacific, which now holds 65 percent of Smart, will
transfer its diluted holdings in the company to PLDT in exchange
for new PLDT shares. This would further raise the stake of First
Pacific in PLDT.
	   This plan will be subject to regulatory and other approval and
will be submitted to the PLDT board next year, it said.
	   Pangilinan said they intend to bring Smart into PLDT, subject to
certain conditions.
	   ``For one, PLDT is listed and Smart is still part of Metro
Pacific, which is also listed,'' he said.
	   Pangilinan said PLDT's new management intends to focus initially
on domestic operations.
	   ``Then probably we will invest in the region,'' he said.
	   First Pacific is also open to the prospect of bringing new
partners into PLDT, especially if they can infuse new technology,
he said.
	   PLDT vice president Antonio Samson said no major personnel
changes at the telecommunications company are planned.
	   ``Only the chief financial officer, the chief executive officer
and the head of purchasing will be replaced,'' he said.
	   The entry of First Pacific into PLDT isn't expected to break the
foreign ownership limit imposed by the government on
telecommunication companies.
	   Under the law, foreigners are barred from acquiring more than 40
percent of companies involved in certain protected industries such
as telecommunications.
	   ``We're well within the limit, and even if new foreign investors
come into PLDT, we're confident we won't go beyond the limit and
that we won't have any constitutional problems,'' Samson said.
	   He said the company can easily issue new shares to maintain the
40 percent maximum limit for foreigners.

	   Palestinian Cabinet ministers lined up along a red carpet on the
airfield excitedly stood on tiptoes as Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat walked toward the plane to greet the first arrivals.
	   ``This is one of the statements of sovereignty,'' Finance
Minister Mohammed Nashashibi said proudly.
	   However, Israel will still have a role in operating the airport.
It will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and will have the
right to exclude travelers or goods it considers a danger to
Israeli. Disputes over security arrangements had delayed the
opening for more than two years.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents approached
the Egypt Air jet together and collected the passports of the
Egyptian passengers, who included Cabinet ministers and comedian
Adel Imam, in white bags for stamping by a Palestinian official.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will boost to the troubled
Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers
and farm produce that until now went via Israel, often with
difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad. Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed
permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International
airport near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to
Jordan and catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank will still need a special
permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is
expected to become easier once a land route between the West Bank
and Gaza opens next month.
	   For now, Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the
Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
	   The opening was negotiated during last month's U.S.-sponsored
Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel also
withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released
250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   Seven flights were scheduled to land on Tuesday, including an
Israeli plane chartered by the European Union envoy to the Middle
East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week. Civil aviation contracts with other carriers are in the
works.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat will fly on his presidential plane for the
first time from Gaza International to Paris. Until now, Arafat has
had drive to Egypt, where his plane was kept, and fly from there.
	   Despite its shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport
a big step toward independence. For those living in the small,
overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one
side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the
feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University. He said that he plans to fly
next month to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's
holiest site.

Singapore executives make more than U.S. counterparts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite the economic slowdown, top executives
in Singapore made more than their U.S. counterparts last year, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Chief executive officers working in the affluent Southeast Asian
city-state received an average of dlrs 178,451 in 1997, compared to
about dlrs 173,000 in the United States, The Business Times said.
	   Only top-level managers in Japan and Hong Kong earned more than
their Singapore-based equivalents, the report added. CEOs in Japan
took home an average dlrs 225,473 last year, while Hong Kong
executives enjoyed mean salaries of dlrs 200,582.
	   Singapore's more humble blue-collar workers currently receive
dlrs 6.70 an hour, compared to dlrs 18 an hour in the United States
and Japan, and dlrs 26 an hour in Germany, added the newspaper.
	   Singapore is expected to adopt painful wage cuts soon to combat
a developing recession and reclaim business competitiveness lost to
its regional neighbors.
	   Debate on the business cost-cutting package, under which average
Singaporean workers will bear the burden, has focused on deeper
government cutbacks and on more equitable wage reductions for
lower-income employees.

Imelda Marcos not interested in compromise settlement: Philippine
</HEADLINE>
official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos says she is not interested in compromising now with the
government over her husband's alleged ill-gotten wealth but has
left open the possibility of future negotiations, a senior official
said Tuesday.
	   Ronaldo Zamora, President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary,
said Imelda Marcos told him in a meeting late Monday that she is
prepared to fight the numerous civil and criminal charges against
her in connection with her husband's 20-year administration.
	   ``She doesn't want to talk about compromises,'' Zamora said.
	   Last month, the Supreme Court acquitted Mrs. Marcos of
corruption charges linked to the lease of government property, for
which she could have been jailed for up to 12 years.
	   Mrs. Marcos' statement appears to dash hopes of an early
recovery of the Marcos wealth, particularly dlrs 540 million in
Swiss bank accounts.
	   The money has been transferred to an escrow account in a
Philippine bank.
	   The government, which says the money was amassed illegally by
Marcos during his 20-year rule, is claiming the deposits. They are
also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action suit
for human rights violations against the Marcos estate and were
awarded dlrs 2 billion by a Hawaii court.
	   Zamora said Mrs. Marcos ``at some point'' may want to negotiate
with the government. If there are negotiations, she wants them to
be conducted formally with government representatives who are
appointed and authorized to deal with her, he added.
	   Mrs. Marcos, however, did not give any indication when she may
be willing to begin negotiations, Zamora said.
	   He said there have been ``preliminary discussions'' with the
Marcos children ``but basically, we have not talked about anything
serious.''
	   Zamora has said that the 5-month-old Estrada government favors
an out-of-court settlement with Mrs. Marcos since 12 years of
litigation have produced little in recovering her husband's wealth.
	   Marcos was toppled in a popular revolt in 1986. He died in exile
in Hawaii three years later.

Security ring around Indian states for provincial elections

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A noisy, colorful election campaign for
crucial state elections is over in India, and authorities are
girding for their next challenge: preventing violence at 100,000
balloting stations.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party because of anger at
soaring vegetables prices. The BJP, which also heads the federal
government, governs two of the four states, and Congress rules one.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said at a rally Monday the
election will not affect his 19-party coalition, although most
analysts see the vote as the first test of popularity for the
BJP-led government since it came to office in June.
	   If the BJP fares poorly, it could increase tension within the
alliance, where relations already are precarious.
	   More than 80 million voters are eligible to choose 626 state
legislators from among 5,000 candidates Wednesday in four of
India's 26 states. Elections frequently turn violent in India.
	   ``We have done everything we can, and we expect totally peaceful
elections,'' K.J. Rao, a senior official at the Election Commission
who looks after security arrangements, told The Associated Press on
Tuesday.
	   Tens of thousands of armed police are at balloting stations in
the northern state of New Delhi home to the nation's capital. Many
police were also deployed in Rajasthan in India's western desert,
in the central state of Madhya Pradesh and in the tiny northeastern
state of Mizoram.
	   Like most Indian elections, the campaign had its share of drama.
	   Opposition candidates weighed themselves in onions and several
leaders drove around Delhi wearing garlands of onions, their way of
protesting a 700 percent rise in the price of the staple vegetable
since September.
	   Political analysts said the electorate appeared apathetic.
``This is the most low-key provincial election in 40 years,'' said
N. Bhaskara Rao, whose Center for Media Studies carried out
pre-election surveys in the four states.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In an orderly democratic transfer of
power rare in the Arab world, an outgoing Lebanese president left
office and another was scheduled to be sworn in Tuesday.
	   The inauguration of Emile Lahoud and departure of Elias Hrawi,
whose nine-year extended term expired at midnight (2200GMT) Monday,
marked the first smooth transition in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly
three decades.
	   The last two presidents took over after assassinations.
	   Lahoud, who was commander of the Lebanese army, was elected by
Parliament on Oct. 15 after winning popular support and the
all-important approval of President Hafez Assad of Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. He has pledged to clean up government and
strengthen the rule of law.
	   Lahoud, a general who has commanded the army since 1989 and
rebuilt the force decimated by the 1975-90 civil war, was to be
sworn for a six-year term at the Parliament after 11 a.m. (0900
GMT).
	   He then moves to the presidential palace, and Hrawi leaves the
hilltop residence in suburban Baabda for the last time.
	   Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet
automatically resigns at the end of the presidential term. The
architect of Lebanon's reconstruction program, Hariri was expected
to be named again as prime minister by Lahoud.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, respects the
power-sharing arrangement based on religion established with the
1943 independence from France: the president is Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
The 128-member Parliament is divided equally between Muslims and
Christians.
	   Despite the criticism from opponents of Syria's dominance of
Lebanon over Lahoud's election with Assad's approval, Tuesday
marked a transformation for Lebanon as it recovers from civil war.
	   When Hrawi became president in 1989 the state was fractured and
battles raged between Christians and Muslims. Today, the country is
rebuilding itself, order has been restored and the armed forces
have re-established state authority.
	   ``It was my destiny to take over a state that was in collapse
and disarray and I hand over a unified nation,'' Hrawi said in a
televised farewell speech Monday night.
	   But Hrawi also said he remained distressed at Israel's continued
occupation of 10 percent of Lebanese territory. Israel has
controlled a border zone in the south since 1985, saying it was
necessary to protect its northern communities from cross-border
guerrilla raids.
	   The transfer of power Tuesday was unusual in the Arab world
where in many countries military leaders or dictators hold power
for decades.

Following Dow's lead, Asian stock markets run up big gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply
Tuesday, hours after Wall Street completed its resurrection from
last summer's steep decline.
	   But that didn't leave everyone optimistic.
	   Some analysts said that even though stock markets in the United
States and Asia were enjoying rebounds, volatility and
profit-taking remain significant risks.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average surged to a new
high on Monday, capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from last
summer's plunge.
	   Extending a nearly non-stop rally that began less than two
months ago, the average rose 214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the
July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The return to record terrain followed four months of volatility
that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to 7,467 on Oct.
8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   The rally came as a series of billion-dollar takeovers and
negotiations for two blockbuster deals signaled a return to the
merger frenzy that energized the market last spring and early
summer.
	   Financial shares rose as Germany's Deutsche Bank AG said it was
discussing the final details of a dlrs 9 billion deal to take over
Bankers Trust Corp., and Internet shares led the technology group
higher as America Online Inc. said it might buy Netscape
Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4 billion deal.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil and its spread around the world would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared 384.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to
15,164.64 Tuesday. It was the first time the index had finished
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug.
25.
	   On Friday, the Nikkei had climbed 425.48 points, and on Monday
it was closed because of a national holiday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rallied to a nearly
seven-month high. By midday, it stood at 10,796.13, up 281.60
points, or 2.7 percent, for its second big jump in two days.
	   ``The market is rising, following the better performance of
overseas markets,'' said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS
Securities Hong Kong Ltd.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index broke through
the important 1,400-point plateau, rising 44.62 points, or 3.2
percent, to 1,421.56 points by midday.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the
region's financial crisis struck about 17 months ago.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei has increased nearly 12 percent since it fell to
13,406.39 on Sept. 30, its lowest point in 12 years.
	   Singapore's key index, which dropped to a low of 800.27 on Sept.
4, has since risen 72 percent.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng has gained 58 percent.
	   The indexes in Asia's three hardest-hit countries _ Thailand,
South Korea and Indonesia _ also have improved, some even more
dramatically than those of Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   But that also has left analysts warning that the region's
economic outlook just can't justify these gains.
	   In Singapore, one trader called Tuesday's gain a ``knee-jerk
reaction'' to the surge in New York, and warned that profit-taking
had already begun to set in. Like many market analysts in
Singapore, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   On Wall Street, the rebound has been so continuous and so rapid
_ the Dow hasn't fallen as much as 100 points since Oct. 1 _ that
many analysts also are growing fearful of another sharp selloff.
	   ``We've got a mania for stocks right now, and you can't really
make a rational explanation for what we have witnessed over the
last six weeks,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at
Scott and Stringfellow in Richmond, Virginia.
	   Dickson noted that economic and financial instability overseas
still posed a big risk.
	   ``What has improved fundamentally enough to justify what is
close to a 30 percent gain from the market's lows?'' Dickson asked.
``Manias never end well.''

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ The Hartford-bound Patriots have a
few more years left in Foxboro. Suprisingly, they also have at
least a few more games in the NFL playoff race.
	   Drew Bledsoe, shaking off a jammed finger, upstaged Dan Marino's
late-game heroics with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Shawn Jefferson
with 29 seconds left, giving New England a 26-23 win over the Miami
Dolphins.
	   The crowd, supportive despite the prospect of being abandoned in
2001, went wild.
	   ``It was a very emotional win for us with all the controversy
about us moving,'' Bledsoe said. ``Hopefully, this will give us
some momentum.''
	   New England (6-5) won for just the second time in six games.
Miami (7-4), lost for the second time in six games and fell into a
three-way tie for the AFC East lead with Buffalo and the New York
Jets.
	   ``Every time we have an opportunity to separate ourselves from
the rest of the division, we just haven't been able to do it,''
Marino said.
	   The winning touchdown capped a 15-play, 80-yard drive in which
Bledsoe hurt his finger when he hit a Miami helmet midway through
the march. But he continued to throw and eventually found Jefferson
in the end zone. He also converted two fourth and 10s during the
drive.
	   Bledsoe said he was ``trying to make a decision whether I'd help
the team or hurt the team by staying in'' after jamming his finger
on an incompletion from the Miami 46 with just under two minutes
left.
	   ``He called a timeout, then came back and said, `I got to stick
it out,' '' Jefferson said.
	   Karim Abdul-Jabbar had scored on a 4-yard run with 3:22 left,
giving Miami a 23-19 lead. Marino, who holds the NFL record with 44
game-winning drives in the fourth quarter and overtime, sparked the
comeback with a 24-yard completion to Stanley Pritchett that put
the ball at the 4.
	   Yet the Patriots ended a distracting four days with a dramatic
finish. The stretch began with last Thursday's tentative agreement
to move the team from its bare-bones suburban stadium to Hartford,
Connecticut's capital city.
	   The crowd cheered the Patriots and some fans held signs. ``If
you build it, we won't come,'' one said. ``It's not too late to
save the Patriots. Call your representative,'' said another.
	   Adam Vinatieri appeared to have saved the Patriots, with his
fourth field goal, a 24-yarder that gave them their first lead,
19-17 with 9:01 left.
	   But that role was left to Bledsoe after Marino engineered the
48-yard drive ending in Abdul-Jabbar's touchdown.
	   Bledsoe completed 28-of-54 passes for 423 yards, just three
yards less than his career-high. He threw for two touchdowns and
two interceptions. Marino was 24-for-38 for 289 with two touchdown
passes to Oronde Gadsden and one interception.
	   Miami got the ball at its own 4 with 26 seconds left, and
Marino's 46-yard completion to Ed Perry got the ball to midfield.
But the game ended on the next play, a short completion to Gadsden.
	   Bledsoe's 8-yard scoring pass to Ben Coates had tied the game
7-7 after one quarter. Gadsden's second touchdown, an 11-yarder
following a 35-yarder in the first quarter, made it 14-7.

<TEXT>
	   APIA, Samoa (AP) _ A 52-year-old father of six was sworn in as
Samoa's new prime minister Tuesday following the resignation of
Prime Minister Tofilau Eti due to illness.
	   The new prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele Maleilegaoi, was deputy
leader of the governing Human Rights Protection Party and the
Pacific nation's deputy prime minister.
	   Tofilau, who held power for 16 years, said he will remain a
member of Parliament representing his home district.
	   Tofilau appeared in public for the first time in three weeks
Monday after returning from cancer treatment in New Zealand. He
resigned while addressing a session of Parliament broadcast live by
government-owned Radio 2AP.
	   He spoke for about five minutes but was too weak to continue.
	   Tofilau has also had major heart surgery and been hospitalized
in New Zealand several times in recent years. He is the uncle of
American Samoa Gov. Tauese Sunia.
	   Tuilaepa is a former domestic bureaucrat and trade official in
Brussels. He holds a masters of commerce degree from New Zealand's
Auckland University.
	   Tuilaepa entered the Western Samoan parliament in a by-election
in 1978 and became finance minister in December 1982, a job he held
until 1985.
	   In 1985, the Tofilau government fell after its budget and
several other bills were defeated in parliament by the coalition
opposition. Tofilau was returned to power in 1988.
	   In Wellington, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
was saddened by Tofilau's resignation.
	   ``Prime Minister Tofilau is one of the most respected and
admired statesmen of the Pacific, and has made a major contribution
to the social and economic advancement of his country,'' she said.
	   ``Over many years, Prime Minister Tofilau exercised inspired

Dallas wins 3-2 over Sharks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix dateline
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Grant Marshall capped Dallas' three-goal second
period with the go-ahead goal as the Stars rallied from a two-goal
first-period deficit for a 3-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on
Monday night.
	   The Sharks thought they'd gotten the tying goal on Ron Stern's
rebound with 22.5 seconds left, but the goal was disallowed because
teammate Stephane Matteau was in the crease.
	   Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk added second-period goals for
the Stars, 8-1-1 at home this season and 4-0-1 in their last five
games overall.
	   Bill Houlder and Stern scored in the game's opening 5:29 to give
the Sharks a quick 2-0 lead.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Flames 2
	   In Toronto, Defenseman Sylvain Cote scored at 7:15 of the third
period to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs over the Calgary Flames.
	   Cote drifted in from the point to take a centering pass from
behind the net from Fredrik Modin and beat rookie goaltender
Jean-Sebastien Giguere for his third goal of the season.
	   Steve Thomas and Derek King also scored for Toronto, which won
its fourth straight home game. Valeri Bure and Cory Stillman scored
for Calgary, which lost its third straight game _ all on the road.
 &UR; Senators 4, Canucks 3
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Andreas Johansson scored two goals,
including the winner midway through the third period, to lead the
Ottawa Senators over the Vancouver Canucks.
	   Johansson, who has nine goals, blasted a slap shot past
Vancouver goaltender Garth Snow at 11:18 of the third, giving coach
Jacques Martin his 150th NHL victory.
	   Shawn McEachern and Magnus Arvedson also scored for Ottawa just
31 seconds apart early in the first period. Bill Muckalt, Dave
Scatchard and Markus Naslund scored for the Canucks, who were
without injured star Alexander Mogilny.

Court orders 10-year jail term for farmer who killed disabled

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court ordered a Saskatchewan farmer to
serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his severely disabled
daughter, overturning a lenient sentence issued by a judge who said
the father had acted out of love.
	   The ruling Monday against Robert Latimer was the latest twist in
a five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate over the
ethics of mercy killing.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory life sentence with no chance of
parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used exemption, he
sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial jail and a
second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution
appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose
the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer said he was disappointed by the ruling but preferred a
long jail term to the alternative of watching Tracy suffer
indefinitely.
	   Latimer, who had been free on bail, turned himself in to police,
but he was released a few hours later and will be allowed to remain
free pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada on whether
it will consider an appeal of Monday's ruling.
	   Latimer took the ruling calmly, saying simply that the court
made the ``wrong decision.''
	   He vowed to fight on.
	   ``There's still quite a way to go I guess in terms of years and
dollars and things like that,'' he said from the family farm near
Wilkie, Saskatchewan.
	   Latimer, who has three other children, admitted to killing Tracy
by placing her in his pickup truck at the family farm and pumping
carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy had suffered from a severe form
of cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk, talk or feed
herself.
	   The girl had endured operations on her back, hips and legs, and
her parents believed she faced the prospect of a lifetime of
painful surgery.
	   After convicting Latimer last year, jurors told the trial judge,
Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence was too harsh and
recommended Latimer be paroled after one year.
	   Noble agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence
would in this case be cruel and unusual punishment.
	   ``The evidence establishes Mr. Latimer was motivated solely by
his love and compassion for Tracy and the need _ at least in his
mind _ that she should not suffer any more pain,'' Noble ruled.
	   Activists for the disabled were infuriated by Noble's ruling,
saying it sent a signal that the disabled have less of a right to
life than other people. But they hailed Monday's ruling.
	   ``To give him a lesser sentence would send a message to society
that it's OK to murder someone with a disability,'' said Bev
Prescott of Saskatchewan Voice of People with Disabilities.
	   Latimer was first convicted in the case in 1994, but the Supreme
Court threw out that conviction because some jurors had been
improperly questioned by police.
	   Latimer received thousands of letters of support from people
across the country who saw him as a loving father who relieved his
daughter from a life of misery.
	   He had been free on his own recognizance pending the outcome of
the appeals of last year's trial.

Taylor and Stewart want floodlights in test cricket
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-Australia-England
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Mark Taylor pressed for the use of
floodlights in test cricket after bad light and thunderstorms
combined to rob Australia of a win in the first Ashes test against
England at the Gabba on Tuesday.
	   With England on 179 for six, bad light robbed play for 20
minutes before a downpour abandoned the game as a draw.
	   ``We were always in trouble,'' Taylor said of the imminent
threat of rain on the last day of the test after he had declared
the second innings and set England 348 runs to win.
	   ``It is something that is beyond your control,'' Taylor said.
``If we had lights, probably, it would have given us time until
tea, but we might have struggled to get a result anyway.''
	   England had controversially refused to play under lights where
available in the event of bad light or making up for the time lost.
	   An experimental International Cricket Council (ICC) rule makes
provision for use of light in test matches only if both teams agree
at the start of a series.
	   The rule has been in use for about a year, but has hit a snag in
recent series with conditions proving to be difficult when the
lights are turned on.
	   It was the case in South Africa when the hosts played Pakistan
in a three-test series early this year.
	   Only once before have lights been used in a test in Australia _
the second test against South Africa in the 1997/98 series.
	   ``It can be difficult for the fielding side,'' Taylor said.
``But it is one of those things we have to go with the trend.
	   ``Test-match crowds in certain parts of the world are going
down. One reason is there are too many draws. We must take it to
the masses. We must make the game interesting.
	   ``It is an innovation of the game that allows for more hours.
People like to see runs, wickets and results. Not draws.''
	   England captain Alec Stewart agreed with Taylor and said cricket
was an ``entertainment business'' and everything possible should be
done to attract people to it.
	   He said the only way the novelty of it could be taken away is by
playing more often in county, state and provincial matches at
domestic level.
	   Stewart said if some of the early tour matches were arranged to
play under lights he wouldn't have refused at the start of the
series.
	   ``We were not given the options, so don't blame us. We have
never played under light with a red ball. It is all new to us.''

Jordan signs with Braves, Alomar with Tribe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP)_ Brian Jordan went home to Atlanta for a dlrs 40
million, five-year contract, Robert Alomar joined his brother in
Cleveland and Kenny Rogers decided he will stay with Oakland, after
all.
	   Meanwhile, Bernie Williams met with the Boston Red Sox, Randy
Johnson visited the Texas Rangers, B.J. Surhoff visited the
Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Mets made an offer to third
baseman Robin Ventura.
	   And the Detroit Tigers went to Japan to get a pitcher, agreeing
to a dlrs 3 million, two-year contract with 30-year-old
right-hander Masao Kida.
	   Jordan, courted by the New York Yankees, Mets and the Baltimore
Orioles last week, fills a hole in the Atlanta outfield that opened
earlier this month when the Braves sent pitcher Denny Neagle, right
fielder Michael Tucker and a minor leaguer to Cincinnati for
All-Star second baseman Bret Boone and pitcher Mike Remlinger.
	   When the Braves met his asking price, Jordan couldn't resist the
urge to play in his adopted home. Jordan was with the NFL's Atlanta
Falcons from 1989-91 and still lives in suburban Stone Mountain.
	   ``That was the deciding factor,'' he said at Turner Field, where
he was flanked by wife, Pam, and their children, daughter Brianna,
7, and son, Bryson, 4. ``I wanted to be here with my kids. They're
at an age where daddy needs to be home with them.''
	   In the final season of a dlrs 6.5 million, two-year contract, he
hit .316 with 25 homers for the St. Louis Cardinals, both career
highs. He also had 91 RBIs and 17 stolen bases.
	   The deal calls for him to get a dlrs 3 million signing bonus,
dlrs 4 million next season, dlrs 7 million in 2000, dlrs 8.5
million in 2001, dlrs 6 million in 2002 and dlrs 9 million in 2003.
	   Atlanta has a dlrs 10.5 million option for 2004 with a dlrs 2.5
million buyout. If the option is exercised, Jordan would get dlrs
48 million over six seasons.
	   ``We have a team that, in many ways, is in its prime,'' Braves
president Stan Kasten said. ``As long as we're in our prime, we're
going to keep pushing away at this rate. When this runs out, we may
retool and do something different. But I think we can keep this
philosophy for the next 3-to-5 years.''
	   Alomar, a nine-time All-Star, agreed to a four-year contract
worth dlrs 30 million to dlrs 32 million, a deal that will be
announced today at Jacobs Field.
	   Alomar's addition finally gives the Indians stability at second
base, where they have used 15 players since trading Carlos Baerga
in 1996. Roberto was the Most Valuable Player of this year's
All-Star game while his brother Sandy, the Indians catcher and a
six-time All-Star, was the MVP of the '97 game at Jacobs Field.
	   Roberto's addition gives the Indians the strongest and flashiest
middle infield in baseball. A six-time Gold Glove winner, Alomar
will be paired up the middle with shortstop Omar Vizquel, who won
his sixth straight Gold Glove this season and has the highest
fielding percentage of any shortstop ever.
	   ``It would be worth the price of a ticket just to watch Omar and
Robbie turn a double play,'' Indians general manager John Hart said
last week.
	   In Arlington, former Rangers star Nolan Ryan gave Johnson a tour
of The Ballpark.
	   ``We made a very strong offer to Randy, but he's going to get a
strong offer from several teams,'' Rangers owner Tom Hicks said.
	   Johnson already has visited Arizona, Anaheim and the Los Angeles
Dodgers, and the Houston Astros want to re-sign him, too.
	   In Atlanta, Bernie Williams and his agent met with Boston Red
Sox general manager Dan Duquette and manager Jimy Williams.
	   ``It went well and we'll go on from there,'' said agent Scott
Boras, who also has been negotiating with Arizona and the Yankees.
	   Yankees officials huddled in Tampa, Fla., to discuss their
negotiations with Williams and with Albert Belle, another free
agent outfielder. New York also is considering whether to attempt
to trade for Anaheim's Jim Edmonds, Montreal's Rondell White or St.
Louis' Ray Lankford.
	   Rogers rescinded his trade demand when the A's agreed to remove
an option for the 2000 season from the pitcher's contract, making
him eligible for free agency after next season. Rogers wants to
pitch closer to his home in Tampa, Fla.
	   ``I don't want to be on the West Coast for another couple of
years,'' he said. ``I can make it another year easily, but that's
too far to be away from my kids (for more than one year).''
	   Kida, who played last season for the Orix Blue Wave of Japan's
Pacific League, went 54-64 with a 3.81 ERA in 10 seasons in the
Japanese leagues _ all but one with the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants of the
Central League.
	   ``He's very poised, very level-headed,'' Tigers GM Randy Smith
said. ``Even with the language barrier, we think he's going to be a
good fit with our ballclub.''

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new 2nd graf with Kremlin saying no new information,
TRIMS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris
Yeltsin is resting in a hospital where he is likely to stay for at
least a week while he recovers from pneumonia.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said Tuesday he had no new information on
Yeltsin's condition. Officials said Monday night that the president
had a slight temperature and was resting.
	   Yeltsin played host to Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a
hospital reception room Monday. Aides said the president would
likely cancel other meetings with foreign visitors this month but
will meet Russian officials at the hospital.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin
called pneumonia and a high temperature Sunday, his third ailment
in recent weeks, reviving worries about his ability to run a vast
country deep in economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday
night.
	   In television footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was
chuckling and wearing a sweater and did not look very ill.
	   The Russian president has rarely been seen in public recently,
and the Kremlin has only allowed limited television coverage of
him, fueling speculation that he is seriously sick.
	   He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as a
respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and
exhaustion. Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking
little chance with the president's health, ensuring that he has
frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He
said treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, in an interview on NTV, added:
``Knowing the president's character, he will have his own point of
view on how long he has to stay in the hospital.''
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
speculation has grown about early elections.

Slain Russian lawmaker being honored with burial in cemetery of
</HEADLINE>
heroes &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG (AP) _ A prominent Russian lawmaker who was
gunned down last week was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic
ideals before being buried in the final resting place of some of
Russia's greatest heroes.
	   ``To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral
for Galina Starovoitova. ``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed
her life for.''
	   The stirring tribute to Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose
slaying remains a mystery, was indicative of the depth of national
feeling over her death.
	   One national television channel turned over its daylong
programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers
carried page after page of coverage of her death. Her political
party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn
out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
	   ``The killing of Galina Starovoitova has come as a tragic
illustration of the government's powerlessness. That is the price
we have paid for a myth about national accord,'' the business daily
Kommersant said.
	   Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in a simple
cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives.
	   But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government
announced that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky
Monastery in the city's center following a funeral in the grand
Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography Museum.
	   Among those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the
composers Peter Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author
Fyodor Dostoevsky.
	   Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide
scaled the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide,
27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able
to provide some description of the shooting to police.
	   Acting on his information, investigators rounded up several
suspects, officials said Monday. But a detective later said that
investigators had learned nothing ``serious'' from Linkov,
according to the Interfax news agency, and there were no further
details about whether the suspects were still in custody.
	   Authorities are acting on the assumption that Starovoitova's
death was a contract hit, a common event in post-Soviet Russia.
Russian politicians and newspapers have speculated wildly about
political motives for the killing, but police have said they have
no idea why someone would have wanted her dead.
	   Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member of
the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No one
was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to
Starovoitova's death.

Congolese rebels urge pope, European leaders to pressure Kabila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Tuesday urged Pope
John Paul II and European leaders to pressure Congolese President
Laurent Kabila to negotiate a cease-fire directly with them.
	   Kabila, on his first European tour since the Aug. 2 rebellion,
was due to meet with the pope and Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro. He also planned to visit Brussels and Paris, where he
will take part in the African Francophone summit Thursday.
	   ``Pressuring Kabila to negotiate directly with us is the only
way of ending the conflict,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba
said from Kisangani, Congo's third largest city. ``His refusal to
negotiate is prolonging the war.''
	   Kabila has refused to talk to the rebels, demanding instead that
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for the
insurgents and leave Congo. Both countries, which accuse Kabila of
failing to rid the common border of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels, say
they will stay as long as Congo remains unstable.
	   Last week, the rebels who attended peace talks in Botswana
refused to accept a cease-fire proposed by African negotiators as a
precondition for talks. Wamba said he wanted Kabila to first agree
to talks through a declaration of intent, then negotiate a
cease-fire and a cessation of hostilities, followed by the
simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign forces.
	   Wamba said the rebels would probably attend the next round of
talks, scheduled for Dec. 6 or Dec. 8 in South Africa.
	   On Monday, Congolese state radio reported that Zimbabwean
warplanes had sunk six barges with 600 rebel troops on the eastern
Lake Tanganyika. Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent
troops and arms to prop up Kabila.
	   Wamba denied the report, saying the rebels armed with
surface-to-air missiles controlled most of the skies over eastern
Congo, which they control.

Tokyo stocks surge; dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS UP with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index surged above
a key barrier for the first time in three months Tuesday following
a record high on Wall Street overnight. The U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 384.70 points,
or 2.60 percent, closing at 15,164.64. It was the index's first
close above the psychologically-important 15,000-point level since
Aug. 25.
	   Markets were closed for a national holiday Monday. On Friday,
the Nikkei had gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 121.62 yen, up 1.46 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of
120.99 yen late Monday.
	   In New York Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
214.72, closing at a record high of 9,374.27 points, boosted by
news of possible takeovers of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank and of
Netscape Communications by America Online. The Dow's previous
record was 9,337.97, set in July.
	   The rally kept going in Tokyo.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, to 1,155.61. It had
climbed 26.74 points, or 2.42 percent, Friday.
	   ``The Nikkei continued to advance, reflecting the record high in
New York,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, manager at Chuo Securities.
	   Shares of international blue-chip companies such as Sony Corp.
and Honda Motors Co. soared as investors interpreted Wall Street's
ability to post a new high as a sign of continued strength in the
U.S. economy.
	   Investors shrugged off signs that a coalition agreement between
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Liberal Party was in
trouble. The coalition plan had boosted share prices last week as
it raised hopes for more aggressive measures to lift Japan out of
recession.
	   On Monday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka admitted that
some politicians in the LDP were unhappy with the deal. And Liberal
Party head Ichiro Ozawa has threatened to bolt the coalition if the
LDP doesn't agree to his policy demands.
	   An estimated 580 million shares changed hands on the stock
exchange's First Section, up from 506.52 million Friday. Advances
outnumbered retreats 968 to 214, while 125 issues were unchanged.
	   Trading in futures and options on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
suspended Tuesday morning after a computer malfunction. Trading
resumed in the afternoon at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT).
	   On the foreign exchange market, increased confidence in the U.S.
economy after the Dow's dramatic surge lifted the dollar against
the yen.
	   But traders said the dollar's advance was curbed by the Tokyo
stock market's gains in response to the rise on Wall Street.
	   Japanese institutional investors and U.S. investors snapped up
dollars in early Asian trading, traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 120.95 yen and 121.79 yen in Tuesday's
trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.920 percent from Friday's finish of 0.900
percent, driving its price down to 107.73 yen from 107.92.

Anti-smoking experts suggest adopting tobacco industry tactics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Anti-smoking experts said Tuesday that
Asian women represent a vast pool of potential smokers, and
suggested one way to prevent them from lighting up would be to use
the psychological tools the tobacco industry employs to tempt them.
	   Compared to American and European women _ about a quarter of
whom smoke, but in stable or declining numbers _ only 4 to 8
percent of women in Asia and other developing regions smoke,
according to data presented at the Global Congress on Lung Health.
	   The four-day congress, bringing together 1,500 lung disease
experts from 90 countries, is the largest such gathering held in
Asia in a decade.
	   With tobacco companies already targeting Asia, where smoking
rates among men in countries like China, Japan and South Korea are
between 60 and 70 percent, the largely untapped female market will
be next in line, experts said.
	   Karen Slama, a researcher with the International Union Against
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, compared smoking in every country to
an epidemic that starts off slowly, builds up and peaks with
tobacco companies acting as an agent, then declines as anti-smoking
campaigns set it.
	   Women and men start smoking for different reasons, the experts
said. Women tend to start to express maturity, independence and
sociability and to relax and ease stress.
	   And even in their teens, women often keep smoking _ and have a
harder time permanently quitting _ because they believe it will
help keep them thin.
	   ``This is just the sort of connection that the tobacco industry
is trying to make to every girl in the world,'' said Patricia White
of Britain's National Health Service.
	   Cigarette advertisements play up the psychological perception of
smoking, beauty, assuredness and seductiveness, White said.
	   Anti-smoking campaigns should take that into account, White
said. She displayed one anti-smoking poster depicting the
halter-topped torso of a young woman smoker contrasted with a
diseased lung.
	   ``Part of gender sensitivity is that we have to adapt ourselves
to women's needs,'' White said. ``In terms of policy, we need to
apply gender sensitivity as well.''
	   Slama said that in every society where the smoking epidemic
among women takes off, it's usually the educated, more independent
women who are the first to light up. They also tend, decades later,
to be the first to quit.
	   Participants from India and Turkey said the educated elites led
the way in their countries. But the expectation that traditional
beliefs would form a barrier to poor women smoking proved wrong _
they were no match for modern advertising.
	   Neither are limited anti-smoking campaigns, which face an
additional problem in the poor education given to women in many
developing nations.
	   Women also have a more difficult time quitting smoking
permanently than men, the experts said. Two factors were fear of
weight gain and the harder time women's bodies have in shedding
nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco.

Train service returning to normal after European strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train service was returning to normal in France
Tuesday morning after a massive one-day European rail strike
seriously disrupted traffic for over 24 hours.
	   For French travelers, however, the relief will be temporary.
	   French train workers have called a nation-wide strike for
Friday, saying they lack sufficient staff.
	   The national train company, the SNCF, said traffic across the
country was mostly running smoothly Monday. Local routes in central
and eastern France were still reporting some delays, however, as
was one suburban line in the Paris area.
	   European rail unions, fearing job losses, called the one-day
strike in six countries to protest European Union plans to
deregulate the sector to boost competition and efficiency.

China's central bank makes Guangdong chief vice governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a leadership shuffle aimed at tightening
financial oversight, the People's Bank of China has named a new
chief for its expanded Guangdong branch operations and added
another vice governor position at headquarters, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The central bank appointed Xiao Gang, currently head of the
Guangdong central bank, as its fifth vice governor. Xiao will be
succeeded in Guangdong by Jiang Chaoliang, who now heads the bank's
office in Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong that
borders Hong Kong, an official in the central bank's information
office said.
	   In his new position, Jiang will supervise banking regulation for
the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan. A central
bank official declined to discuss the new duties for Xiao, the vice
governor.
	   The bank is in the midst of a reorganization. It is setting up
nine regional offices to replace provincial branches closely linked
to local governments in a bid to end interference by local
officials in lending decisions and financial market supervision.
	   Last week, the central bank appointed a new chief for its
powerful Shanghai office.
	   The reforms were hastened by the collapse of Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., which the central bank
closed in October because of more than dlrs 2 billion in domestic
and foreign debts it couldn't pay.
	   The central bank's Guangdong branch is now overseeing GITIC's
liquidation.
	   A Beijing-based central bank official said Xiao's transfer
wasn't linked to GITIC's failure and that he would not have been
promoted if his performance was poor.
	   Xiao, a career bank official, previously served as chief of the
bank's monetary and capital department.

	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Ijaz Ahmed hit an explosive century
as Pakistan posted a big 302 for six off their 50 overs in the
third and decisive one-day International against Zimbabwe Tuesday.
	   Zimbabwe and Pakistan are tied at one apiece in the three-game
series.
	   Ahmed, who has been suffering from influenza, played an
enterprising innings of 132 off 103 balls before he was out on the
last ball of the 50th over.
	   He hit nine fours and four big sixes.
	   After being put in to bat, Pakistani openers Saeed Anwar (73)
and Aamir Sohail made a quick 77 off 88 balls for the first wicket.
Anwar, who brought up his 27th half century in 161st one-dayer off
just 39 balls, was run out in the 21st over.
	   Anwar hit nine fours and a six off Eddo Brandes in his 63-ball
innings of 73.
	   The right-handed Ahmed also saw a productive 97-run third wicket
stand with Inzamamul Haq (34).
	   Ahmed spared none of the Zimbabwean bowlers with medium fast
Neil Johnson conceding 63 off his seven overs. Although Heath
Streak claimed two wickets, including Ahmed's, he gave away 62
runs.
	   With the series tied 1-1 Zimbabwe needs to score an average of
6.03 per over to clinch the series.

Chinese president off to Central Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin left for the city of
Novosibirsk in Central Siberia on Tuesday for a series of meetings
with the region's officials and scientists.
	   In Novosibirsk, a major scientific and military industrial
center about 2800 kilometers (1,750 miles) east of Moscow, Jiang
will visit research centers, including the renowned Nuclear Physics
Institute.
	   Jiang met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a hospital
reception room in Moscow on Monday. The two leaders approved a
statement on expanding relations between the former Cold War rivals
and defining the western part of their 4,300 kilometer (2,700-mile)
border. Yeltsin was hospitalized Sunday with a high temperature and
pneumonia.
	   The document noted that a ``strategic partnership'' declared
last year by the two countries _ the world's largest and the
world's most populous _ ``is not an alliance and is not aimed
against third countries.''
	   The statement also called for the creation of a multi-polar
world _ Russia's favorite euphemism for counterbalancing what it
perceives as U.S. dominance in global affairs. China has voiced
similar concerns.
	   Following decades of enmity between the Chinese and the former
Soviet Communist leaders that began in the 1950s, relations between
Russia and China began to improve shortly before the Soviet
collapse.
	   In recent years, China has evolved into a major export market
for Russia's cash-strapped defense industries, purchasing fighter
jets, missiles, submarines and other hardware.

Singapore curbing air pollution by cutting emissions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Cabinet minister's statement, ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As Singapore moved to cut unhealthy sulfur
emissions, the government defended the country Tuesday against
allegations of heavy carbon dioxide pollution.
	   Singapore has pointed out inaccuracies to international agencies
that publish its carbon dioxide emission figures, Sidek Saniff,
senior minister of state for the environment, said in Parliament.
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature, an influential private
environmental lobby group, has said Singapore emits 35 tons of the
greenhouse gas per capita, an amount much higher than most fully
industrialized countries.
	   Singapore has countered that it only discharges 8.2 tons of
carbon dioxide per capita, based on accepted international
standards.
	   Singapore's economy is driven primarily by manufacturing, mostly
electronic and petrochemical production. Both industries contribute
to the tropical island's air pollution, as do vehicle exhaust and
the generation of power to run these businesses.
	   Sidek said power plants account for half of Singapore's carbon
dioxide emissions, while industries and road transportation make up
the rest. He said that a ``wide range of measures taken over the
years has helped to keep down carbon dioxide emissions from these
sources.''
	   These government efforts include updated technology and greater
efficiency in power generation, improved energy conservation by the
public and industries, and tax incentive schemes.
	   He added that power plants plan to make greater use of cleaner
fuels like natural gas, which can reduce carbon dioxide emissions
by 25 percent.
	   But Singapore wasn't yet ready to set voluntary limits on
greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto protocol of the
Convention on Climate Change because it wasn't yet a fully
developed nation.
	   ``So Singapore, being a developing country, will see its
emissions grow as it develops and industrializes further,'' Sidek
conceded.
	   The country has decided to cut sulfur emissions from diesel,
however, because levels of these unhealthy air pollutants exceed
international standards.
	   Certain sulfur byproducts of diesel fuel have been linked to
respiratory and heart disease, and Singapore's level of these tiny
particles exceeds new health guidelines in the United States, The
Straits Times said Tuesday.
	   The government is also targeting sulfur dioxide emissions.
	   Singapore's environment ministry has been meeting with oil
companies over how to reduce the sulfur level in diesel from 0.3
percent to 0.05 percent, the report added.
	   The United States, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan and
Taiwan have all lowered their diesel sulfur level to 0.05 percent
in recent years, the newspaper said.

Palestinian airport opens; hailed as step toward statehood

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Taking a major step toward
statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza
International Airport, their first gateway to the world.
	   An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in
the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt), to cheers of
dozens of Palestinian dignitaries waiting on the ground.
	   As a police marching band played bagpipes, Palestinian airport
workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each other by their
hands and began dancing in a circle. Some kissed their neighbors,
others wiped away tears and several officers waved their rifles in
the air.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat slowly walked along a red
carpet to greet planes arriving at half-hour intervals, including
aircraft from Morocco, Jordan and Spain.
	   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.
	   However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the
authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor
arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out
if it considers them a danger to Israeli security.
	   Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over
security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
	   In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security
agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collected
the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet
ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags.
	   Later in the day, thousands of Palestinians from nearby refugee
camps and towns pushed onto the grounds to join the festivities. In
one corner, about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding
mules that moved to the beat of drums.
	   The celebrations were marred by a protest of about 150 relatives
of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The demonstrators were
angry at Arafat for having failed to win the release of more
security prisoners in last month's negotiations with Israel. ``No
airport, no sea port unless you return the prisoners,'' the crowd
chanted.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled
Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers
and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often
with difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to be
able to afford an air ticket.
	   Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission
to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport
near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to Jordan and
catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to
cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to
become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza
opens next month.
	   For the time being, Israel's government does not permit Israelis
to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
	   The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the
accord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last
week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open
next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian
seaport in Gaza are continuing.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   On Tuesday, seven flights were scheduled to land, including an
Israeli plane chartered by the European Union envoy to the Middle
East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls
for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of
Ashdod. Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a
portable control panel installed in a van.
	   Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians consider
the airport a big step toward independence. For those living in the
small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean
on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease
the feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to
Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.

MacGill dropped for second test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from captains and Lloyd
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Skipper Mark Taylor will insist on
playing utility bowler Colin Miller in the second cricket test
after the Australian selectors dropped leg spinner Stuart MacGill
for the next Ashes match starting Saturday in Perth.
	   MacGill, a member of the Australian side that drew the first
test against England at the Gabba on Tuesday, was replaced by
Miller, who bowls medium pace and off spin.
	   ``What we have done in the last 12 months in the Australia
cricket teams is picked horses for courses,'' Taylor said.
	   ``It has worked for us. The feeling is that Perth suit fast men,
so let's go with fast bowlers.''
	   Both teams leave for Perth on Wednesday. Taylor said the rest of
the attack _ three bowlers _ will be picked from Glenn McGrath,
Michael Kasprowicz, Damien Fleming and Jason Gillespie, who was the
12th man in Brisbane.
	   MacGill took 3-51 to leave England struggling on 179 for six
before rain saved them.
	   Taylor felt the current England team had shown ``good
resiliance'' by ``not throwing the game away'' compared to its
predecessors.
	   ``They played the first half particularly well until we put our
foot down and moved an extra gear on the fourth morning,'' Taylor
added.
	   Taylor, one of the most successful modern captains, praised his
top-gun fast bowler Glenn McGrath for an outstanding bowling effort
that saw him bag seven wickets in the match.
	   ``Until he took five wickets in a session, we were heading to a
draw. Suddenly we were in with a chance of forcing win,'' Taylor
said.
	   McGrath was voted man-of-the-match for his 6-85 and 1-30 in the
match.
	   Alec Stewart singled out the performance of opener Mark Butcher
and left-arm fast bowler Alan Mullally as the ``positives'' of the
drawn test.
	   Butcher, who went into the test with nine runs in five
first-class innings scored 116 and 40 while Mullally claimed his
first five-wicket haul.
	   Stewart said the three missed chances in the first innings made
a big difference in the test.
	   Steve Waugh and Ian Healy were both dropped on their way to
centuries and in the process shared an innings-building 187 runs
for the sixth wicket after Australia was struggling on 178 for
five.
	   England coach David Lloyd said he felt England had competed well
for most of the test but a couple of bad sessions had undermined
their hopes of success.
	   ``If you have bad sessions against Australia you pay for it,''
admitted Lloyd. ``We created the opportunities and we will have to
talk about the negatives and build on that.
	   ``Our fielding and catching was below standard, you cannot give
people like Steve Waugh and Ian Healy even half a chance.''
	   Australian squad for the second test in Perth: Mark Taylor
(captain), Michael Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh,
Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Michael Kasprowicz, Damien Fleming, Jason
Gillespie, Glenn McGrath and Colin Miller.

Far right leader sees good score in European elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Tuesday he
expects his National Front party to win over 20 percent of the vote
in European parliamentary elections next year.
	   The National Front ``has as a goal of surpassing 20 percent'' of
the vote in the elections, Le Pen said on Europe 1 radio.
	   Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration National Front, announced
last week he plans to appeal an assault conviction, a maneuver that
should allow him to skirt a ban on public office and let him run in
European elections.
	   The National Front has won about 15 percent of the vote in
recent national elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from
North Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence and has been
accused of anti-Semitism. It also opposes the new European single
currency.
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.

Hong Kong share prices surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Monday, with
the key index rising 3.2 percent on the back of sharp gains
overnight on Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 337.18 points to 10,851.71, its highest close since April 28.
On Monday, the index had gained 281.17 points.
	   Turnover rose to 11.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.4
billion) from Monday's 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.09 billion).
	   ``An improvement in overseas markets, including a gain in the
U.S. overnight,'' spurred strong buying in the Hong Kong markets,
said Francis Lun, research manager at Pacific Challenge Securities
Ltd.
	   Sentiment in Hong Kong was particularly boosted by a record
rally overnight on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 214.72 points _ or 2.3 percent _ to 9,374.27, vaulting
past the record close of 9,337.97 set July 17.
	   Brokers said investors also expect further cuts in local
interest rates following a quarter percentage point cut Friday.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.50 Hong Kong
dollars to 58.75, and Cheung Kong rose 1.25 dollars to 59.25.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC holdings rose 3.50 dollars to
201.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 2.50 dollars to 71.25.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.00 dollars to 60.00, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 2.70 dollars to 38.10.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A noisy, colorful election campaign for
crucial state elections is over in India, and authorities are
girding for their next challenge: preventing violence at 100,000
balloting stations.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party because of widespread
discontent with the soaring prices of vegetables. The BJP, which
also heads the federal government, governs two of the four states,
and Congress rules one.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said at a rally Monday the
election will not affect his 19-party coalition, although most
analysts see the vote as the first test of popularity for the
BJP-led government since it came to office in April.

in an article written by a leading adviser to President Saddam
Hussein, who warned that British and U.S. attempt to topple the
Iraq leader could destabilize the Middle East.
	   The newspapers also published the government's views on a failed
assassination attempt Sunday of a top deputy to Saddam _ hinting
Iran was responsible, as it usually does when violence acts are
aimed at Saddam's regime.
	   On Monday, Iraqi officials made clear their strategy for dealing
with the new crisis caused by U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler's demand for more documents on Iraqi arms programs.
	   In Baghdad and at the United Nations, Iraqi officials said their
resistance to handing over more documents did not mean they were
not cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon and Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh
al-Qaisi both argued that Iraq had turned over all relevant
documents to the U.N. Special Commission investigating Iraq's
lethal weapons and simply has no more to give.
	   ``Why is it that now Mr. Butler is requesting all over again the
same requests that were made in the past?'' al-Qaisi asked at a
Baghdad news conference. ``All we have, we gave. All we don't have,
we stated we don't have.''
	   In New York, Hamdoon said: ``Iraq wants to cooperate because it
wants to finish this whole job of the work of UNSCOM and to move on
forward to the comprehensive review.''
	   Failing to cooperate could hold up a U.N. Security Council
review of progress toward destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction _ which Iraq hopes will lead to easing of U.N.
sanctions _ and bring a threatened U.S.-British military strike.
	   In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that
the United States could still attack Iraq if it did not fully
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds of Iraqis arrived by bus outside the U.N.
headquarters to protest their plight under the sanctions.
	   ``You are here to kill our children,'' read a sign written in
red and blue and hung on a fence behind the crowd. ``You are here
to stop our progress,'' another read.
	   Editorials in state-run newspapers unleashed their invective
both at Butler and at Britain and the United States for supporting
the Iraqi opposition.
	   ``This cursed devil and mad bull (Butler) is playing a vicious
role to stir up craziest prolong the sanctions,'' al-Iraq said in a
front-page editorial.
	   It was rare for the carefully censored papers to discuss such
events as Monday's British-sponsored meeting of Iraqi opposition
groups dedicated to removing Saddam from power.
	   ``Yesterday, a British minister openly met with traitors of whom
the Iraqi people know nothing ... to discuss with them in front of
reporters' cameras how to conspire against Iraq and its historic
leadership,'' declared an editorial in Al-Qadissiya.
	   The paper added that ``Arab regimes and nations are shouldered
with a historic responsibility to effectively confront U.S. and
British threats.''
	   Hamed Youssef Hummadi, an adviser to Saddam and former
information minister, criticized Arab politicians in an article in
the same paper, saying they do not understand that Saddam's removal
will boomerang on their regimes.
	   He urged Arab governments to work for the lifting of sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot
be lifted until U.N. inspectors declare Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspapers printed the official report on the attempt on the
life of Izzat Ibrahim, No. 2 to Saddam on the Revolutionary Command
Council. The accounts said he escaped injury when two grenades were
thrown at him during a visit Sunday to the southern city of
Karbala.
	   ``Dirty hands committed the dreadful crime,'' wrote the daily
al-Iraq _ referring to Iran, which was also blamed by Iraq for an
attack that seriously wounded Saddam's eldest son, Odai, in
December 1996.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In an orderly democratic transfer of
power rare in the Arab world, Emile Lahoud was sworn in as
Lebanon's president Tuesday and Elias Hrawi left office after a
nine-year term.
	   ``I swear to God Almighty that I will respect the constitution
of the Lebanese nation and its laws and uphold the independence of
Lebanon and the safety of its territory,'' Lahoud said in the oath
of office from Parliament's podium.
	   With a copy of the Constitution in his left hand, Lahoud lifted
his right arm and took the oath of office at 11:16 a.m. (0916GMT)
before a chamber packed with lawmakers, Cabinet ministers, foreign
diplomats and legislators from the United States, Canada, Brazil,
Chile and Cyprus.
	   U.S. congressmen of Lebanese descent, Republican Ray Lahoud of
Illinois and Democrat Nick Rahal of West Virginia, were among the
guests at the ceremony broadcast live on state-run television and
radio.
	   The inauguration of Lahoud, Lebanon's 11th president since
independence from France 55 years ago, and the departure of Hrawi
marked the first smooth transition in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly
three decades. The last two presidents took over after
assassinations.
	   After the Parliament ceremony, Lahoud moves to the presidential
palace, and Hrawi leaves the hilltop residence in suburban Baabda
for the last time.
	   Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet
automatically resigns at the end of the presidential term. The
architect of Lebanon's reconstruction program, Hariri was expected
to be named again as prime minister by Lahoud.
	   Lahoud, who was commander of the Lebanese army, was elected by
Parliament on Oct. 15 after winning popular support and the
all-important approval of President Hafez Assad of Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. He has pledged to work to clean up
government and make the rule of law supreme.
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old general trained in Britain and the United
States, has since he became commander in 1989 rebuilt the army
which was decimated by the 1975-90 civil war.

Defense accuses police of treating Anwar harshly

 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim accused authorities in court Tuesday of
handling him harshly but treating his accusers gently.
	   Police broke down the door of the former deputy prime minister's
home to arrest him on Sept. 20, and Anwar later appeared in court
with a black eye and bruises. He has accused guards of beating him.
	   That treatment contrasts sharply with what happened last year,
when agents negotiated for four hours before apprehending two of
Anwar's accusers, said defense lawyer Christopher Fernando.
	   Fernando, questioning police officer Mazlan Mansor, suggested in
court Tuesday that the two accusers _ Ummi Hafilda and Azizan Abu
Bakar _ were treated softly because they were backed by men in
power.
	   The two ``were given special treatment and the police dared not
move in because there were people behind these people who have
clout,'' Fernando said.
	   The defense has earlier insinuated that there may have been a
conspiracy involving senior government officials to frame Anwar.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and arrested
after launching a reform campaign, is on trial on charges of sexual
misconduct and corruption.
	   Ummi and Azizan were arrested last year and forced to retract
their statements _ allegedly by police acting on Anwar's orders.
Prosecutors accuse him of using his power to cover up his misdeeds.
	   The arrests were delayed because the police had to negotiate
with the landlady, Restina Majid, for four hours, Mazlan testified
Tuesday. He was among a team of agents sent to arrest the two on
Aug. 18, 1997.
	   Mazlan disagreed that police offered any special treatment in
the arrest. Restina is the sister-in-law of Aziz Shamshuddin, press
secretary of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Tuesday afternoon, a police intelligence officer testified that
he was present at a meeting where Anwar ordered police to seek out
Ummi and Azizan and find out why they had made the allegations.
	   Amin Yunus, a former deputy director of the Special Branch, said
Anwar wanted police to intimidate the two.
	   ``The accused ordered us to track down Ummi and Azizan and dig
up all the information from them as to why they came up with the
allegations,'' Amin said. He did not say whether Anwar had ordered
the arrest of the two.
	   Anwar's trial resumed Monday after a weeklong recess so it would
not interfere with last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Anwar was arrested two weeks after his firing by Mahathir
sparked massive anti-government protests. The current trial
involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on another
corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual misconduct, at a
later date.
	   The 51-year-old sacked deputy denies the charges, calling them
part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former boss.
	   So far, 10 police officers have testified in support of the
prosecution version that Anwar had forced the police to obtain
retractions from Ummi, the sister of his former secretary, and
Azizan, his former chauffeur.
	   Ummi had accused Anwar of having sex with her brother's wife;
Azizan claimed he was sodomized by Anwar.

Palestinian airport opens; hailed as step toward statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat quotes, color &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Taking a major step toward
statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza
International Airport, their first gateway to the world.
	   An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in
the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT), to the cheers of
dozens of Palestinian dignitaries waiting on the ground.
	   As a police marching band played bagpipes, Palestinian airport
workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each other by the
hand and danced in a circle. Some kissed their neighbors, others
wiped away tears and several officers waved their rifles in the
air.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat slowly walked along a red
carpet to greet planes arriving at half-hour intervals, including
aircraft from Morocco, Jordan and Spain.
	   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and holding up his fingers in
a victory sign.
	   However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the
authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor
arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out
if it considers them a danger to Israeli security.
	   Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over
security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security agents approached the Egypt Air
jet together Tuesday and collected the passports of the passengers,
including Egyptian Cabinet ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in
white bags.
	   Later thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps and towns
pushed onto the grounds to join the festivities. In one corner,
about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that
moved to the beat of drums.
	   The celebrations were marred by a protest of about 150 relatives
of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The demonstrators were
angry at Arafat for having failed to win the release of more
security prisoners in last month's negotiations with Israel. ``No
airport, no sea port unless you return the prisoners,'' the crowd
chanted.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will boost the troubled Palestinian
economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers and farm
produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with
difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad, although a majority of Gazans probably cannot afford an air
ticket.
	   Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission
to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport
near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to Jordan and
catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to
cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to
become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza
opens next month.
	   For the time being, Israel's government does not permit Israelis
to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
	   The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the
accord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last
week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open
next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian
seaport in Gaza are continuing.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   On Tuesday, seven flights were scheduled to land, including an
Israeli plane chartered by the European Union envoy to the Middle
East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls
for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of
Ashdod. Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a
portable control panel installed in a van.
	   Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians consider
the airport a big step toward independence. For those living in the
small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean
on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease
the feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to
Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.

Following Dow's lead, Asian stock markets run up big gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs grafs 12-14, ``In Hong...by midday.'' with 3 grafs to
UPDATE with Hang Seng closing up 3.8 percent and Straits Times
index closing up 2.6 percent &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply
Tuesday, hours after Wall Street completed its resurrection from
last summer's steep decline.
	   But that didn't leave everyone optimistic.
	   Some analysts said that even though stock markets in the United
States and Asia were enjoying rebounds, volatility and
profit-taking remain significant risks.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average surged to a new
high on Monday, capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from last
summer's plunge.
	   Extending a nearly non-stop rally that began less than two
months ago, the average rose 214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the
July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The return to record terrain followed four months of volatility
that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to 7,467 on Oct.
8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   The rally came as a series of billion-dollar takeovers and
negotiations for two blockbuster deals signaled a return to the
merger frenzy that energized the market last spring and early
summer.
	   Financial shares rose as Germany's Deutsche Bank AG said it was
discussing the final details of a dlrs 9 billion deal to take over
Bankers Trust Corp., and Internet shares led the technology group
higher as America Online Inc. said it might buy Netscape
Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4 billion deal.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil and its spread around the world would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared 384.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to
15,164.64 Tuesday. It was the first time the index had finished
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug.
25.
	   On Friday, the Nikkei had climbed 425.48 points, and on Monday
it was closed because of a national holiday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rallied to a nearly
seven-month high. It closed at 10,851.71, up 337.18 points, or 3.2
percent, following a 2.7 percent gain Monday.
	   ``The market is rising, following the better performance of
overseas markets,'' said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS
Securities Hong Kong Ltd.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index broke through
the important 1,400-point plateau, rising 35.96 points, or 2.6
percent, to 1,412.90. Earlier in the day, it had risen even higher
to 1,421.56.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the
region's financial crisis struck about 17 months ago.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei has increased nearly 12 percent since it fell to
13,406.39 on Sept. 30, its lowest point in 12 years.
	   Singapore's key index, which dropped to a low of 800.27 on Sept.
4, has since risen 72 percent.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng has gained 58 percent.
	   The indexes in Asia's three hardest-hit countries _ Thailand,
South Korea and Indonesia _ also have improved, some even more
dramatically than those of Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   But that also has left analysts warning that the region's
economic outlook just can't justify these gains.
	   In Singapore, one trader called Tuesday's gain a ``knee-jerk
reaction'' to the surge in New York, and warned that profit-taking
had already begun to set in. Like many market analysts in
Singapore, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   On Wall Street, the rebound has been so continuous and so rapid
_ the Dow hasn't fallen as much as 100 points since Oct. 1 _ that
many analysts also are growing fearful of another sharp selloff.
	   ``We've got a mania for stocks right now, and you can't really
make a rational explanation for what we have witnessed over the
last six weeks,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at
Scott and Stringfellow in Richmond, Virginia.
	   Dickson noted that economic and financial instability overseas
still posed a big risk.
	   ``What has improved fundamentally enough to justify what is
close to a 30 percent gain from the market's lows?'' Dickson asked.
``Manias never end well.''

South Africa delays registration for half country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Tuesday put
off election registration for half the country, an acknowledgement
of the difficulties in creating the nation's first true voter roll.
	   The announcement by President Nelson Mandela and elections
officials came just three days before registration was to begin.
	   Now, only the nation's five northern provinces, including
central Gauteng where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located, will
register voters Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The provinces account
for about half the number of eligible voters.
	   The other four will go forward Dec. 3-5.
	   Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission told reporters
that the southern provinces, including that containing Cape Town,
needed more time to train people to oversee the process.
	   Moreover, more than 5 million people are estimated to lack
updated identification documents needed to register.
	   The commission has had to turn to national, provincial and local
civil servants to staff the registration because of a money
shortage. Most of the 72,000 personnel needed will come from those
ranks, including 16,000 soldiers who are being made available.
	   Two more three-day periods will be added on in January and
February for any overflow, said the chief electoral officer, Mandla
Mchunu.
	   The commission had hoped to register the country's 25 million
eligible voters over the three days this week.
	   But red tape and confusion have hindered many from acquiring the
ID or temporary piece of paper needed to register, causing an
outcry from the mainly white-supported opposition parties. Most of
those without the proper documents are white.
	   The Democratic Party has threatened to challenge the
registration in court.
	   One of the lowest turnouts in civil servants volunteering for
registration duty came in the Western Cape, the only province run
by the National Party, the old apartheid power.
	   In a message prepared for national broadcast Tuesday, Mandela
said difficulties were to be expected given the scope of the
first-time exercise in the new South Africa.
	   ``But the work that has been done so far and the goodwill that
has been shown gives me the confidence that we will succeed,'' he
said.
	   The vast majority of people don't even know where to register.
Elections officials on Wednesday and Thursday plan a ``knock and
drop'' campaign of visiting every home in each election district
and dropping off pamphlets with the information.
	   No election date has been set, but Mchunu said the commission
was urging Mandela to settle on a day in May, before the weather
worsened and days shortened.
	   The first all-race elections, in 1994, were held without
registration. But the new constitution of post-apartheid South
Africa requires a complete, national voters roll.

Yeltsin tells China Russia says `no' to Taiwan independence

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Chinese Foreign Ministry
confirming Russian statement on Taiwan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Following the Russian and Chinese presidents'
``no-necktie'' summit in a Moscow hospital, Russia pledged not to
undermine China's claim to rival Taiwan, a Chinese official said
Tuesday.
	   After Monday's meeting, the sixth between Presidents Boris
Yeltsin of Russia and Jiang Zemin of China, Russia also promised
not to sell Taiwan weapons, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said.
	   Although the pledges were largely symbolic _ Russia's relations
with Taiwan are hardly robust _ they underscored Beijing's solid
ties with Moscow and the momentum of its campaign to isolate Taipei
diplomatically.
	   Russia specifically promised not to recognize Taiwan's
independence or support the island's entry into international
organizations comprised of sovereign states, Tang said at a twice
weekly media briefing.
	   ``President Jiang expressed his appreciation for the stand of
the Russian side,'' Tang said. ``During the informal summit, the
Russian side has clearly expressed its policy on the question of
Taiwan: that is, one China.''
	   China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949. While Taiwan has
dropped its claim over the mainland, Beijing still regards the
island as a rebel province to be retaken by force if necessary. To
deny Taiwan legitimacy, China has used its growing influence to
persuade countries not to open diplomatic relations with the
island.
	   Tang expressed China's displeasure with a decision by the
Marshall Islands last week to set up ties with Taiwan, only the
27th nation to do so.
	   ``We have already made solemn representations to the Marshall
Islands. We demand that they correct their erroneous practice,''
Tang said.
	   In a sign that Beijing was preparing to sever ties with the
South Pacific nation, Tang reiterated that Beijing forbids its
diplomatic partners from having formal ties with Taiwan.
	   Aside from the commitment on arms sales, Tang's account of
Russia's Taiwan pledge virtually duplicates a statement U.S.
President Bill Clinton made during his visit to China in the
summer.
	   Once Cold War rivals for the allegiances of the socialist world,
Russia and China have quickly repaired ties over the past decade,
partly to counteract U.S. influence.
	   Although Monday's summit was postponed once and then moved to a
hospital at the last minute because of Yeltsin's health, Tang said
the meeting will bring a ``new impetus'' to ties.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanwa Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest banks,
announced Tuesday it will sell its U.S. business credit unit to
Boston-based Fleet Financial Group Inc.
	   Sanwa said in a statement it will sell all of shares of Sanwa
Business Credit Corporation, which specializes in leases and
asset-based lending, as it trims less-profitable or money-losing
operations to prepare for Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial
deregulation measures.
	   The bank said the Big Bang is forcing it to focus on
``strategically selected'' business areas, such as the retail
business.
	   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
	   Many Japanese financial institutions have been retreating from
overseas business as Japan's recession and financial turbulence
abroad force them to downsize.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to extend special low-interest loans to
struggling Asian economies totaling about 5 trillion yen (dlrs 41
billion), a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The loans will be made on condition they directly benefit
Japanese companies operating in the region, the mass-circulation
Asahi Shimbun said. They aim to help promote growth in Asia as well
as provide economic relief to Japan, the paper said.
	   The newspaper quoted trade minister Kaoru Yosano, on a visit to
Thailand, as providing the figure for the loans, but the ministry
said officials were still working out details of the plan.
	   Japan will provide 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.2 billion) to Asian
countries a year over a five-year period, the Asahi said. The paper
did not say which Asian countries were likely to receive the loans.
	   The government announced the Asian loan plan earlier this month
as part of its record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) yen
economic stimulus package to lift Japan out of its recession, but
did not provide the amount of the loans.
	   Countries throughout Asia have been battling a severe economic
crisis triggered by the plunge of regional currencies last year.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a leadership shuffle aimed at tightening
financial oversight, the People's Bank of China has named a new
chief for its expanded Guangdong branch operations and added
another vice governor position at headquarters, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The central bank appointed Xiao Gang, currently head of the
Guangdong central bank, as its fifth vice governor. Xiao will be
succeeded in Guangdong by Jiang Chaoliang, who now heads the bank's
office in Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong that
borders Hong Kong, according to an official in the central bank's
information office.
	   The bank is in the midst of a reorganization. It is setting up
nine regional offices to replace provincial branches closely linked
to local governments in a bid to end interference by local
officials in lending decisions and financial market supervision.
	   The reforms were hastened by the collapse of Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., which the central bank
closed in October because of more than dlrs 2 billion in domestic
and foreign debts it couldn't pay.
	   The central bank's Guangdong branch is now overseeing Gitic's
liquidation.
	   Xiao, a career bank official, previously served as chief of the
bank's monetary and capital department.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is unable to create enough jobs to absorb
growing numbers of laid-off workers and new entrants to the work
force next year, according to a researcher at a government
think-tank quoted in a state-run newspaper Tuesday.
	   ``China's unemployment picture for 1999 will be even more grim
than this year's,'' the Economic Information Daily quoted Yang
Yiyong, director of the State Development Planning Commission's
Economic Research Institute, as saying.
	   The official urban unemployment rate is projected to reach 3.3
percent, up 0.2 percentage points from 1997, the report said.
	   According to official statistics, in 1998 the number of urban
registered unemployed is expected to total 6.2 million, 420,000
higher than in 1997.
	   Reforms of state-owned enterprises are expected to leave about 3
million workers jobless next year. Another 1.67 million
civil-service workers are likely to be laid off in local and
central government restructuring, and about 1.33 million workers
will be laid off from nonprofit institutions, Yang said.
	   China plans to lay off a total of 5 million local- and
central-government workers and 4 million workers from nonprofit
institutions by 2000, the report said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a controlling stake in the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company.
	   In taking the 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co., First Pacific will appoint one of its own, Managing
Director Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino, as chief executive officer
and president.
	   Panglinan will replace Antonio Cojuangco, who will take the post
of chairman, Panglinan said.
	   Under the agreement, which has kept the stock market on
tenterhooks for the past few months and triggered wild swings in
PLDT's share price, First Pacific paid dlrs 750 million for its
stake in PLDT, or 1,420 pesos (dlrs 35.85) per share.
	   PLDT closed Tuesday at 1,055 pesos, down 30 pesos or 2.8 percent
from the previous day.
	   In a complicated buy-in, First Pacific's stake in PLDT was
acquired by paying dlrs 552 million for a 52.7 percent share of the
Cojuangco family's holding company, Philippine Telecommunications
Investment Corp., which holds a 21.5 percent stake in PLDT, and by
buying around 5.9 percent of PLDT on the market for dlrs 197
million.
	   First Pacific also said it has reached a preliminary agreement
for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to raise its stake
in Smart Communications Inc., the Philippines' largest cellular
telephone service provider, to 40 percent from 15 percent. No
financial terms were released.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite the economic slowdown, top executives
in Singapore made more than their U.S. counterparts last year, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Chief executive officers working in the affluent Southeast Asian
city-state received an average of dlrs 178,451 in 1997, compared to
about dlrs 173,000 in the United States, The Business Times said.
	   Only top-level managers in Japan and Hong Kong earned more than
their Singapore-based equivalents, the report added. CEOs in Japan
took home an average dlrs 225,473 last year, while Hong Kong
executives enjoyed mean salaries of dlrs 200,582.
	   Singapore's more humble blue-collar workers currently receive
dlrs 6.70 an hour, compared to dlrs 18 an hour in the United States
and Japan, and dlrs 26 an hour in Germany, added the newspaper.
	   Singapore is expected to adopt painful wage cuts soon to combat
slowing growth and reclaim business competitiveness lost to its
regional neighbors.
	   Debate on the business cost-cutting package, under which average
Singaporean workers will bear the burden, has focused on deeper
government cutbacks and on more equitable wage reductions for
lower-income employees.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are expected
to probe the dlrs 10 billion alliance between British
Telecommunications PLC and AT and T, an EU official said Tuesday.
	   The European Commission's initial four-week inquiry into the
alliance is due to end next week, but a senior Commission official
said a more detailed, second-phase investigation was ``very
likely.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity and refused
to give details on which aspects of the deal needed further
scrutiny.
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company and AT and T, the
largest U.S. carrier, announced in July they will combine their
international telephone operations and create a new Internet
system.
	   The deal needs approval from regulators in the United States,
Britain and the EU.

Board member resigns following infighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout, adds quotes, new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's Olympic organizing committee
was rocked Tuesday by the resignation of Rod McGeoch _ the public
face of the city's Games bid _ who said he was a victim of personal
vilification.
	   McGeoch's resignation as director followed several days of
bitter infighting involving the Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) board, including claims of internal
destabilization and political and personal animosity.
	   McGeoch, who led Sydney's 2000 Olympics bid, said he was
quitting for the sake of the Games because the city's preparations
for 2000 were already being damaged.
	   ``I'm the subject of the rumor mongering that has been going on
so I'm taking myself off the playing field because the Games are
much more important than I am,'' he said.
	   ``I don't know if it's a political campaign or what it is, but
what I do know is that SOCOG is suffering.
	   ``Our international image in the Olympic community and elsewhere
must be suffering as a result of what's gone on in the last
fortnight and I'm doing my part to make it stop.''
	   McGeoch's decision came as a surprise to his board colleagues,
including International Olympic Committee board member and SOCOG
vice-president Kevan Gosper.
	   ``Sure he's had a tough week but don't we all _ I'm surprised
and disappointed and I would have thought his decision was
unnecessary,'' Gosper said.
	   ``It's a pity he hadn't chosen to talk to one or two close
colleagues.''
	   In his resignation letter to New South Wales state Premier Bob
Carr, McGeoch said he had been the subject of an ongoing campaign
of destabilization, despite calls for peace by Carr, Prime Minister
John Howard and Olympics Minister Michael Knight.
	   Carr will lead his Australian Labor Party into a state election
next March.
	   McGeoch's departure reveals deep personal divisions on the SOCOG
board, which its members concede includes a number of ``big egos.''
	   The current row erupted after a story was leaked to newspapers
last week that McGeoch had allegedly demanded a fee of 8,000
Australian dollars (5,210 US dlrs) to speak to an American
delegation on behalf of SOCOG.
	   McGeoch, a lawyer, released signed declarations Tuesday from he
and his personal assistant, stating that he had no knowledge of the
fee request and that it did not come from SOCOG.
	   ``I spent three years leaving my professional career, working at
something like half my income, not seeing my wife and family for
months on end to try and win this thing for Sydney and Australia,''
McGeoch said.
	   ``So to walk away from it without seeing it finished is a sad
day for me.''
	   McGeoch became the first high-profile managerial departure from
SOCOG since Mal Hemmerling quite as chief executive in March 1997.
	   Hemmerling had taken over from Gary Pemberton as chief executive
officer in September 1995 before quitting to pursue ``other career
opportunities'' when he was replaced by Sandy Hollway.
	   Pemberton was the first president of SOCOG, assuming a hybrid
position of executive president in July 1994 when the proposed
candidate for the chief executive's job withdrew at the last
minute.
	   Pemberton quit his second role as president in March 1996 and
was replaced by John Iliffe. But Iliffe only lasted six months
before standing down after the Atlanta Olympics in favor of Michael
Knight.
	   Iliffe died last year after a long illness. (djp)

Imelda Marcos not interested in compromise settlement: Philippine

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Marcos' daughter in grafs 4-5,
raises reference to preliminary talks with the Marcos children to
graf 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos says she is not interested in compromising now with the
government over her husband's alleged ill-gotten wealth but has
left open the possibility of future negotiations, a senior official
said Tuesday.
	   Ronaldo Zamora, President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary,
said Imelda Marcos told him in a meeting late Monday that she is
prepared to fight the numerous civil and criminal charges against
her in connection with her husband's 20-year administration.
	   ``She doesn't want to talk about compromises,'' Zamora said.
	   However, Mrs. Marcos' eldest daughter, Rep. Imee Marcos Manotoc,
said her mother was just ``disappointed, frustrated because nothing
is happening with the compromise talks'' held so far.
	   ``But we are open as long as we can put this behind us,'' she
said. ``Any kind of agreement, compromise settlement or whatever
you want to call it is something that we look forward to as the
best solution to the problem.''
	   Zamora said there have been ``preliminary discussions'' with the
Marcos children ``but basically, we have not talked about anything
serious.''
	   Last month, the Supreme Court acquitted Mrs. Marcos of
corruption charges linked to the lease of government property, for
which she could have been jailed for up to 12 years.
	   Mrs. Marcos' statement appears to dash hopes for an early
recovery of the Marcos wealth, particularly dlrs 540 million in
Swiss bank accounts.
	   The money has been transferred to an escrow account in a
Philippine bank.
	   The government, which says the money was amassed illegally by
Marcos during his 20-year rule, is claiming the deposits. They are
also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action suit
for human rights violations against the Marcos estate and were
awarded dlrs 2 billion by a Hawaii court.
	   Zamora said Mrs. Marcos ``at some point'' may want to negotiate
with the government. If there are negotiations, she wants them to
be conducted formally with government representatives who are
appointed and authorized to deal with her, he added.
	   Mrs. Marcos, however, did not give any indication when she may
be willing to begin negotiations, Zamora said.
	   Zamora has said that the 5-month-old Estrada government favors
an out-of-court settlement with Mrs. Marcos since 12 years of
litigation have produced little in recovering her husband's wealth.
	   Marcos was toppled in a popular revolt in 1986. He died in exile
in Hawaii three years later.

	   The bank is in the midst of a reorganization. It is setting up
nine regional offices to replace provincial branches closely linked
to local governments in a bid to end interference by local
officials in lending decisions and financial market supervision.
	   The reforms were hastened by the collapse of Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., which the central bank
closed in October because of more than dlrs 2 billion in domestic
and foreign debts it couldn't pay.
	   The central bank's Guangdong branch is now overseeing Gitic's
liquidation.
	   Xiao, a career bank official, previously served as chief of the
bank's monetary and capital department.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is unable to create enough jobs to absorb
growing numbers of laid-off workers and new entrants to the work
force next year, according to a researcher at a government
think-tank quoted in a state-run newspaper Tuesday.
	   ``China's unemployment picture for 1999 will be even more grim
than this year's,'' the Economic Information Daily quoted Yang
Yiyong, director of the State Development Planning Commission's
Economic Research Institute, as saying.
	   The official urban unemployment rate is projected to reach 3.3
percent, up 0.2 percentage points from 1997, the report said.
	   According to official statistics, in 1998 the number of urban
registered unemployed is expected to total 6.2 million, 420,000
higher than in 1997.
	   Reforms of state-owned enterprises are expected to leave about 3
million workers jobless next year. Another 1.67 million
civil-service workers are likely to be laid off in local and
central government restructuring, and about 1.33 million workers
will be laid off from nonprofit institutions, Yang said.
	   China plans to lay off a total of 5 million local- and
central-government workers and 4 million workers from nonprofit
institutions by 2000, the report said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a controlling stake in the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company.
	   In taking the 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co., First Pacific will appoint one of its own, Managing
Director Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino, as chief executive officer
and president.
	   Panglinan will replace Antonio Cojuangco, who will take the post
of chairman, Panglinan said.
	   Under the agreement, which has kept the stock market on
tenterhooks for the past few months and triggered wild swings in
PLDT's share price, First Pacific paid dlrs 750 million for its
stake in PLDT, or 1,420 pesos (dlrs 35.85) per share.
	   PLDT closed Tuesday at 1,055 pesos, down 30 pesos or 2.8 percent
from the previous day.
	   In a complicated buy-in, First Pacific's stake in PLDT was
acquired by paying dlrs 552 million for a 52.7 percent share of the
Cojuangco family's holding company, Philippine Telecommunications
Investment Corp., which holds a 21.5 percent stake in PLDT, and by
buying around 5.9 percent of PLDT on the market for dlrs 197
million.
	   First Pacific also said it has reached a preliminary agreement
for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to raise its stake
in Smart Communications Inc., the Philippines' largest cellular
telephone service provider, to 40 percent from 15 percent. No
financial terms were released.

Report: Three wounded in scuffle between soldiers, rebels in
</HEADLINE>
Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Soldiers clashed with
Indian villagers sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas, and three villagers suffered cuts in the
scuffle, according to rebel supporters.
	   The clash occured early Monday just over a mile from the hamlet
of Acteal, where 45 Indians who belonged to group that supports the
rebels were massacred by a pro-government paramilitary gang in
December 1997.
	   The scuffle started when about 20 men who fled Acteal after the
massacre returned to an area near the hamlet _ now also near an
army encampment _ to work their fields, said Juan Gomez, an
official of the pro-rebel village of Polho.
	   Soldiers from the camp surrounded the men, until women from a
neighboring village began shoving and hitting the troops, demanding
the release of their neighbors.
	   The soldiers then apparently fought back, apparently with either
knives or bayonets, Gomez said. State officials disputed that
version.
	   The Chiapas state government said that the incident began when
about 100 villagers went to a field near the encampment and began
shouting anti-government slogans.
	   ``Army officers asked them to withdraw. One woman was injured
when she hit herself against a fence post,'' the state government
said in a press bulletin.
	   The injured were treated at a local clinic in Polho.
	   The rebels, who staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994
demanding greater democracy and Indian rights, broke off peace
talks with the government in August, 1996.
	   In Mexico City, Emilio Rabasa, the government's chief negotiator
in the nearly five-year-old Chiapas conflict, said that Zapatista
representatives had refused Monday to accept two sealed envelopes
containing what he called ``a proposal for a new arrangement for
dialogue.''
	   He refused to reveal details of the secret offer, but claimed
the rebels want to ``impose, not negotiate'' a solution to the
conflict.

British minister warns Czech army not yet compatible with NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Britain's defense minister praised
the Czech Republic on Tuesday for progress toward NATO membership,
but said its army has a long way to go to match up to alliance
standards.
	   ``Full interoperability will take some time after accession,''
George Robertson told journalists after talks with his Czech
counterpart, Vladimir Vetchy.
	   Robertson said Britain, as one of the Czechs' closest allies,
has prepared an ambitious program designed to assist the Czech army
with such tasks as language courses and training exercises.
	   The Czech military has often been criticized for being
underequipped and having low prestige. Other shortcomings include
inadequate knowledge of foreign laguages and corruption.
	   The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary this year became the
first former Soviet Bloc nations to be offered membership in the
alliance. Expansion likely will take place in 1999, pending
expected ratification by the parliaments of all current NATO
members and the parliaments of the future members.

Chernobyl nuclear plant officials unwilling to shut down reactor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Authorities at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear
power plant want to operate its only working reactor this winter
despite orders to close it for repairs, a plant official was quoted
as saying Tuesday.
	   ``The reactor is in good condition, and it's quite possible to
postpone the repairs,'' Chernobyl spokesman Oleh Holoskokov told
the Ukrainian News agency.
	   Holoskokov's comment appeared to signal a new round of
disagreement between nuclear safety authorities and energy
officials over whether to close the reactor. Western nations have
demanded the closing of the reactor amid growing worries over its
safety.
	   Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration ordered Chernobyl
officials earlier this month to stop Chernobyl's reactor No. 3 as
of Dec. 1 after an inspection showed that some of its safety
equipment was close to the end of its operational life.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor recently
despite lengthy repairs between July, 1997 and May, 1998.
	   But the order was immediately protested by Energy Ministry
officials who said the reactor was needed until the spring to
ensure enough electricity during the fall and winter months.
	   In addition, the plant has yet to bring in much of the required
equipment to start the repairs, financed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Holoskokov said.
	   The EBRD agreed to grant dlrs 118 million for upgrading
Chernobyl after international calls for the reactor to be stopped.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, when its other unit was shut down. Ukraine has pledged to
fully close the plant by 2000.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident, while another was stopped
after a 1991 fire.

Iraq pleads for Arab help against U.N. sanctions, foreign plots

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With Iraq facing a new crisis with the
United Nations over arms inspections, the government pleaded
Tuesday for help from Arab nations to lift U.N. sanctions on Iraq
and thwart British-American plots.
	   The pleas came in front-page editorials in state-run dailies and
in an article written by a leading adviser to President Saddam
Hussein, who warned that British and U.S. attempt to topple the
Iraq leader could destabilize the Middle East.
	   The newspapers also published the government's views on a failed
assassination attempt Sunday of a top deputy to Saddam _ hinting
Iran was responsible, as it usually does when violence acts are
aimed at Saddam's regime.
	   On Monday, Iraqi officials made clear their strategy for dealing
with the new crisis caused by U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler's demand for more documents on Iraqi arms programs.
	   In Baghdad and at the United Nations, Iraqi officials said their
resistance to handing over more documents did not mean they were
not cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon and Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh
al-Qaisi both argued that Iraq had turned over all relevant
documents to the U.N. Special Commission investigating Iraq's
lethal weapons and simply has no more to give.
	   ``Why is it that now Mr. Butler is requesting all over again the
same requests that were made in the past?'' al-Qaisi asked at a
Baghdad news conference. ``All we have, we gave. All we don't have,
we stated we don't have.''
	   In New York, Hamdoon said: ``Iraq wants to cooperate because it
wants to finish this whole job of the work of UNSCOM and to move on
forward to the comprehensive review.''
	   Failing to cooperate could hold up a U.N. Security Council
review of progress toward destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction _ which Iraq hopes will lead to easing of U.N.
sanctions _ and bring a threatened U.S.-British military strike.
	   In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that
the United States could still attack Iraq if it did not fully
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds of Iraqis arrived by bus outside the U.N.
headquarters to protest their plight under the sanctions.
	   ``You are here to kill our children,'' read a sign written in
red and blue and hung on a fence behind the crowd. ``You are here
to stop our progress,'' another read.
	   Editorials in state-run newspapers unleashed their invective
both at Butler and at Britain and the United States for supporting
the Iraqi opposition.
	   ``This cursed devil and mad bull (Butler) is playing a vicious
role to ... prolong the sanctions,'' al-Iraq said in a front-page
editorial.

Indonesian students press their demands in the streets again

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief predicted
Tuesday that student protests against the government would persist
until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999. In the streets,
hundreds of students demanded his ouster.
	   President B.J. Habibie, meanwhile, said continuing turmoil has
slowed efforts to revive Indonesia's sick economy even though the
battered rupiah has climbed in value in recent weeks.
	   Many foreign investors are wary of investing in the politically
fragile nation, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   ``We have witnessed the strengthening of the rupiah, which gives
hope for our economic recovery,'' Habibie said at the opening of
the national Boy Scouts' convention. ``But unfortunately this
progress has been countered by social and political unrest.''
	   Habibie has pledged to revamp the rigid political system left
behind by his authoritarian predecessor and former mentor, Suharto.
	   Suharto was ousted by riots and protests in May after three
decades in power, but students suspect his replacement is not
serious about democratic change.
	   Armed forces commander Wiranto said student protesters would
continue to push their demands, which also include the ouster of
Habibie and an end to the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement. ... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   Facing a public outcry, the military said 163 soldiers involved
in deadly clashes Nov. 13 with student protesters had been confined
to barracks for three weeks and could face court-martial.
	   At least nine student protesters, who were pressing for swift
democratic reforms, died in the fighting.
	   Although Wiranto had ordered riot officers to carry only blanks
and plastic bullets, hospital doctors said they found metal bullet
fragments in some of the victims.
	   The clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta, and a
total of 16 people died.
	   Wearing yellow jackets, about 300 students from the prestigious
University of Indonesia marched Tuesday near the presidential
palace, urging that Wiranto take responsibility for the killings.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' they chanted.
	   In a separate protest, more than 1,000 students entered the
compound of the office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to
demand a trial of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights
abuses.
	   ``First Suharto has to be put on trial. Then it's the turn of
the other cronies. If not, we'll protest all the time,'' said
Samsuddin, an engineering student.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby.
	   The Nov. 13 clashes have further tarnished the image of the
military, which is facing criticism for human rights abuses
committed during the Suharto era.
	   Wiranto said the soldiers who were disciplined include 144 who
fired at protesters without permission, 12 who beat demonstrators
and news photographers, and seven officers who failed to control
their men.
	   Violence also erupted in the Indonesian capital Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.

Iraq pleads for Arab help against U.N. sanctions, foreign plots

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With Iraq facing a new crisis with the

and thwart British-American plots.
	   The pleas came in front-page editorials in state-run dailies and

and the United States for supporting the Iraqi opposition.
	   ``This cursed devil and mad bull (Butler) is playing a vicious
role to ... prolong the sanctions,'' al-Iraq said in a front-page
editorial.
	   It was rare for the carefully censored papers to discuss such
events as Monday's British-sponsored meeting of Iraqi opposition
groups dedicated to removing Saddam from power.
	   ``Yesterday, a British minister openly met with traitors of whom
the Iraqi people know nothing ... to discuss with them in front of
reporters' cameras how to conspire against Iraq and its historic
leadership,'' declared an editorial in Al-Qadissiya.
	   The paper added that ``Arab regimes and nations are shouldered
with a historic responsibility to effectively confront U.S. and
British threats.''
	   Hamed Youssef Hummadi, an adviser to Saddam and former
information minister, criticized Arab politicians in an article in
the same paper, saying they do not understand that Saddam's removal
will boomerang on their regimes.
	   He urged Arab governments to work for the lifting of sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot
be lifted until U.N. inspectors declare Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspapers printed the official report on the attempt on the
life of Izzat Ibrahim, No. 2 to Saddam on the Revolutionary Command
Council. The accounts said he escaped injury when two grenades were
thrown at him during a visit Sunday to the southern city of
Karbala.
	   ``Dirty hands committed the dreadful crime,'' wrote the daily
al-Iraq _ referring to Iran, which was also blamed by Iraq for an
attack that seriously wounded Saddam's eldest son, Odai, in
December 1996.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and U.S. ground controllers on Tuesday
completed a series of maneuvers to position the first module of the
international space station for a docking with the next segment
early next month.
	   The Zarya, or Sunrise, module which was built by a Russian
company for NASA has been smoothly orbiting Earth since its launch
on Friday.
	   ``Ground controllers have had no complaints about any of Zarya's
systems,'' said Vera Medvedkova, a spokeswoman for the Russian
Mission Control that guides the spacecraft along with the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.
	   The final correction of the orbit on Tuesday circularized it at
around 385 kilometers (240 statute miles) _ the right position for
a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to
be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The
shuttle crew is to capture Zarya using the Endeavour's robot arm
and then attach the two modules in three space walks.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya is intended to serve as a space
tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion,
power and communications.
	   The new station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and
is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United
States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion.
	   The new station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of the Russian-made crew module which is
set to blast off next July or August.

	   ST. PETERSBURG (AP) _ A prominent Russian lawmaker who was
gunned down last week was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic
ideals before being buried in the final resting place of some of
Russia's greatest heroes.
	   The stirring tribute to Galina Starovoitova, a feisty liberal
whose slaying remains a mystery, was indicative of the depth of
national feeling over her death.
	   ``To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral
for Starovoitova. ``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her
life for.''
	   Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most
prominent political figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St.
Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the funeral.
	   An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons and flanked by a
military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. At the end of
the service, mourners passed grimly past it as classical music
played.
	   Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the cold,
waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay their
respects.
	   ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this
never happens again,'' said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the manager
of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, ``There's little
hope of that in our country.''
	   Among speakers at the service were former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, who represented the president at the service.
Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was also present.
	   Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee the
investigation into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow
hospital, recovering from pneumonia.
	   ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole
of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives for that
murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and society
should know all the truth about it.''
	   One national television channel turned over its daylong
programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers
carried page after page of coverage of her death. Her political
party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn
out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 8 p.m. Tuesday.
	   Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in a simple
cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives.
	   But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government
announced that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky
Monastery in the city's center following the funeral at the
Ethnography Museum.
	   Among those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the
composers Peter Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author
Fyodor Dostoevsky.
	   Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide
scaled the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide,
27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able
to provide some description of the shooting to police.
	   Acting on his information, investigators rounded up several
suspects, officials said Monday. But a detective later said that
investigators had learned nothing ``serious'' from Linkov,
according to the Interfax news agency, and there were no further
details about whether the suspects were still in custody.
	   Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior
Ministry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he was confident the case
would be solved. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that
investigators ``have tips, they have something to work on.''
	   Authorities are acting on the assumption that Starovoitova's
death was a contract hit, a common event in post-Soviet Russia.
Russian politicians and newspapers have speculated wildly about
political motives for the killing, but police have said they have
no idea why someone would have wanted her dead.
	   Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member of
the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No one
was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to
Starovoitova's death.

Singapore government dismisses concerns, adopts deep wage cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economic planners on Tuesday
dismissed concerns over the burden of deep wage cuts, saying the
country will adopt a multibillion-dollar business cost-cutting
package that slashes workers' pay.
	   The government strongly endorsed wage-related cuts equaling
about 15 percent of a workers' total income, including salaries,
bonuses and pension payments.
	   The wage reductions will take effect Jan. 1, and are worth an
estimated 7 billion to 8 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.3
billion to dlrs 4.9 billion). They form the basis of an overall
cost-cutting package worth 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.4
billion) that also includes government cutbacks.
	   ``Singapore is facing its gravest challenge since
independence,'' Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said before
confirming the painful wage cuts. He said the country has been
drawn into the regional crisis, and must take decisive action to
reclaim its business competitiveness.
	   ``The proposal is to reduce wage costs significantly'' as part
of short-term measures to help companies survive the crisis and
preserve jobs, Lee said.
	   He argued that the cuts will not only help Singapore overcome
its economic downturn, but help lay the foundations for sustained
growth in the future.
	   Debate over the wage cuts has focused on the extent of the
burden placed on workers. Community and business leaders have
questioned why workers must shoulder so much of the cost-cutting,
and many members of Parliament have urged the government to share
the burden by offering deeper tax cuts and other lower charges.
	   But the 84-seat Parliament, dominated by the ruling People's
Action Party and with only three opposition members, is widely
expected to adopt the government recommendations as they currently
stand during Wednesday's session.
	   Lee said it was ``not possible'' to match the wage cuts
dollar-for-dollar with reduced government taxes, levies and other
charges.
	   But he did offer some concessions, including an increased tax
rebate and help for homeowners who have trouble meeting their
mortgage obligations because of the pay cuts.

Parreira turns South Africa down for soccer coaching job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Brazil's Carlos Alberto
Parreira has turned down an offer to coach the South African
National soccer team.
	   News reports Tuesday quoted the Brazilian as saying he did not
want to be away from home for so long. Parreira was the South
African Football Association's top choice to guide Bafana Bafana.
	   He has been in South Africa this week for talks with the
association.
	   ``The talks went on very well but it will be difficult for me to
work outside Brazil at the moment,'' the Sowetan newspaper quoted
him as saying.
	   ``I have two daughters (aged 25 and 21) and a 79-year-old mother
from whom I have been separated for a long time. I need to be
closer to them,'' he said.
	   SAFA officials had said they wanted a four-year-old commitment
from Parreira.
	   He has coached four teams in the World Cup finals including
Saudi Arabia most recently at France.

Laver back in the swing after stroke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four months after suffering a stroke
which affected movement on his right side, Australian tennis legend
Rod Laver has swung a racket again and he's playing golf.
	   Laver said from his Palm Springs, California, home Tuesday that
he knew if he could get back on a tennis court, he would make a
full recovery.
	   ``To be able to stand and see the ball coming and playing
against my son, it's the best medicine and best pills I could have
taken,'' he told Channel Nine's A Current Affair television
program.
	   ``I know that I've done well so far and I hope to keep improving
on it and I'd like to get on that court and know that I'm here to
stay.''
	   Laver, who won 11 grand slam singles titles including four
Wimbledon crowns, was filming a television interview in Los Angeles
in late July when he suffered a stroke.
	   He was admitted to nearby UCLA Medical Center where he spent the
next six days in the intensive care unit (ICU) _ with, at one
stage, Australian players Pat Rafter and Sandon Stolle singing to
him from the corridor.
	   ``They wanted to come up and say hello to me but they couldn't
get into the ICU, but they were outside the door singing Waltzing
Matilda,'' Laver said.
	   Within hours of being released from intensive care, the
60-year-old was rushed back in with brain seizures and spent a
further six weeks in hospital.
	   His wife Mary described the setback as being ``hit in the head
with a brick bat.''
	   ``We thought we'd won it and all of a sudden we hadn't and that
was frightening,'' she said.
	   Laver, who had to learn to walk and talk again, remains
optimistic.
	   ``I just knew I was going to get out of this,'' he said. ``I
feel like I'm in a fight, I feel like I'm going to recover and
whatever it takes, I'll do it.''

Would-be dissident candidate booted in Beijing vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A veteran democracy activist who tried to run in
a local election said authorities put an end to his campaign
Tuesday.
	   He Depu said leaders of the No. 503 military factory separately
questioned the 32 workers about their nominating a dissident to run
as a candidate for Beijing's Chaoyang district legislature.
	   Workers were told their voting area was being redrawn and that
the nomination was invalid, He said.
	   ``I feel this method is very, very despicable,'' he said. ``It
makes me very angry.''
	   Under China's constitution, citizens have the right to nominate
and vote for their representatives to their local people's
congress, although in practice authorities control the process.
	   He said six guards beat him when he tried to hand out campaign
flyers Friday at the Beijing Information Engineering Institute,
part of his would-be constituency.
	   By voiding his nomination, authorities were violating people's
rights and in effect barring a group of people, such as dissidents,
from taking part in politics, He said.
	   A local election official who gave her name as Miss Xu refused
to discuss the case by telephone.
	   He Depu _ who took part in the Democracy Wall movement of the
late 1970s _ said he went to the office of the city election bureau
to complain and was told to wait for a reply. He said he did not
think his candidacy had a chance.
	   Direct votes in China are allowed only at the lowest levels of
government, such as city districts. Members of these ``people's
congresses'' vote for representatives to higher levels, such as a
municipal congress, who in turn select members of the National
People's Congress, the national legislature.

Soldiers on exercise suffer suspected carbon monoxide poisoning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The army was investigating Tuesday after 42
soldiers on a routine exercise suffered suspected carbon monoxide
poisoning.
	   The men from 7th Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers were living in an aircraft hangar at Hullavington, near
Swindon, southwest England, when they became ill on Monday night.
	   An army spokesman said it was unclear what had caused the
poisoning but the soldiers had been using generators to power tools
while working on helicopters inside the enclosed building.
	   ``Last night, when they were waking a new shift to take over,
one man was a bit slow to wake up and had a thumping headache,''
said the spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. ''Other
soldiers also complained of headaches.''
	   ``At the moment we don't know what caused the poisoning but they
were working in confined conditions with small generators running
to power various tools.''
	   Most of the soldiers were still being treated at hospital in
Swindon Tuesday.

Jordan to offer first Christian classes in public schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will offer Christian education in
government schools for the first time starting December 1, a
Christian leader said Tuesday.
	   The Christian Bishops Council and the Education Ministry reached
agreement for compulsory classes on Christianity for the 3,000
Christian students in government schools, said Father Hanna
Jallouf, coordinator for the Bishops Council.
	   The classes will be taught three times a week in seven districts
with concentrations of Christians, said Jallouf. Christians form 8
percent of Jordan's 4.2 million population.
	   Government schools already offer religious education for
Muslims, who make up the majority of the country's people.
	   Jallouf said the Christian classes will be modeled on a program
in Syria, which also has a minority Christian population.
	   Books for the classes will be distributed free to students and
the religion teachers will be paid by the Ministry of Education,
Jallouf said.

Poor labor relations worsened economic crisis in Asia, ILO says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis has sharpened
the region's need for better representation of workers and
employers, the International Labor Organization said Tuesday.
	   The ILO, which handles labor issues for the United Nations,
claimed that the presence of better social and labor institutions
would have lessened the impact of crushing recession in many
countries.
	   ``Although some progress has been made, the region's economic
crisis has increased the awareness of the need for more of a safety
net,'' William Simpson, an ILO East Asia official, said at a news
conference.
	   The organization is urging governments in Asia to adopt more
comprehensive social protections and to ensure that economic growth
is accompanied by social progress.
	   During the early 1990s, when many Asian countries were posting
double-digit growth, social improvements were left behind, Simpson
said.
	   Many Asian governments have since come to the ILO for technical
assistance on how to deal with labor-employer disputes amid huge
layoffs, Simpson said.
	   Simpson noted that authoritarian regimes in Vietnam, Laos and
China are turning to the ILO to improve labor relations. After the
fall of longtime leader Suharto in May, Indonesia ratified an ILO
convention guaranteeing workers' rights to form associations.
	   The convention allows the ILO to monitor the labor situation in
a country and issue reports on it. But in most cases, Simpson said,
there is a wide gap between ratification and making the measures
work.
	   The ILO is ``disgusted with the violation of human and labor
rights'' in Myanmar, also known as Burma, a signatory of the
convention, Simpson said.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific, or ESCAP, said that the economic crisis risked erasing
the progress made by women toward equality.
	   Although women had contributed greatly to the economic boom,
many are now losing their jobs at a greater rate than men, ESCAP
said in a statement.
	   Many newly unemployed women may be lured, often unwittingly, by
sex traffickers to work as prostitutes locally and in other
countries, it said.

Car bomb kills two outside German embassy in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two people were killed and scores injured
Tuesday when a car bomb exploded in front of the German Embassy,
witnesses said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The two Yemenis who died were pedestrians passing by the
embassy. About six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, and
many others suffered minor wounds.
	   The Mazda carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy in
the residential Hadda area, where most embassies are located.
	   The site has been cordoned off by police, who are not allowing
anyone to enter or leave the area. No other details were available,
and police would not comment on the incident.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to UPDATE with report on Yeltsin's
condition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris
Yeltsin is resting in a hospital where he is likely to stay for at
least a week while he recovers from pneumonia.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Tuesday that the
president's condition was stable and his temperature was normal,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Yeltsin played host to Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a
hospital reception room Monday. Aides said the president would
likely cancel other meetings with foreign visitors this month but
will meet Russian officials at the hospital.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin
called pneumonia and a high temperature Sunday, his third ailment
in recent weeks, reviving worries about his ability to run a vast
country deep in economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday
night.
	   In television footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was
chuckling and wearing a sweater and did not look very ill.
	   The Russian president has rarely been seen in public recently,
and the Kremlin has only allowed limited television coverage of
him, fueling speculation that he is seriously sick.
	   He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as a
respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and
exhaustion. Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking
little chance with the president's health, ensuring that he has
frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He
said treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, in an interview on NTV, added:
``Knowing the president's character, he will have his own point of
view on how long he has to stay in the hospital.''
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
speculation has grown about early elections.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose for a third
straight session Tuesday, buoyed by Wall Street's overnight gains
and a cut in the central bank's key borrowing rate, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 38.99 points,
or 2 percent, to 1,961.25 after a 4.4 percent surge Monday.
	   Traders said Wall Street's overnight gains injected fresh funds
into Asian stock markets, including the Philippines.
	   Interest in select blue chips also boosted Philippine share
prices, they said.
	   Among the most actively traded stocks were Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. and holdings concern Metro Pacific Corp., a
unit of Hong Kong's First Pacific Corp.
	   First Pacific announced after the end of trading Tuesday that it
has acquired 27.4 percent of PLDT, the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company.
	   PLDT's share price fell 30 pesos, or 2.8 percent, to 1,055 pesos
on rumors of the buy-in.
	   Metro Pacific's shares, meanwhile, gained 0.2 centavos, or just
less than 1 percent, to 2.14 pesos.
	   Analysts said the 0.25 percentage point cut in the central
bank's overnight borrowing rate will release more domestic funds to
the stock market.
	   Russell Ong, senior analyst at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.,
said, however, that it is unlikely the additional funds will be
used for long-term stock market investments.
	   ``Despite the positive sentiment in the market, many still
remain cautious,'' he said.
	   The central bank cut its overnight borrowing rate, its main tool
in controlling domestic liquidity, to 13.500 percent from 13.750
percent. It also cut its overnight lending rate by 0.25 percentage
points to 15.500 percent.
	   The cut is in line with the 0.25 percentage point cut in U.S.
short-term interest rates last week and was largely expected by
market participants.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed slightly lower as the cut
in interest rates released more pesos into the financial system,
traders said.
	   Generally weaker regional currencies and the lack of positive
developments on the domestic front likewise weighed on the peso,
they said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.606 pesos for the day, up from Monday's
39.551 pesos. It traded in a thin range of 39.510 pesos to 39.760
pesos and was last traded at 39.600 pesos.
	   The peso's losses were tempered by expectations of dollar
inflows in coming weeks, mainly from direct foreign investments,
stock investments and remittances from Filipinos working overseas,
traders said.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home
around dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy and are
expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.

Australian woman hospitalized with drug overdose
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ An Australian woman was hospitalized
after collapsing at Bahrain's international airport when one of
some 20 packets of heroin she had swallowed burst in her stomach,
the Gulf Daily News reported Tuesday.
	   Najwa Mustafa, 42, who is of Lebanese origin, was traveling to
Australia from Beirut via Bahrain when she collapsed and was rushed
to a hospital with severe symptoms of narcotics overdose, the
English-language paper said.
	   Nurses alerted police after finding the woman had secreted 40
packets of heroin in her stomach and other body cavities, the paper
said. She also had 15 packets wrapped up in a bun of her hair.
	   Mustafa, who collapsed Saturday, was still in the hospital's
intensive care unit Monday night, the newspaper added.
	   Hospital authorities could not be reached for comment.

Most Asian markets surge on back of Wall Street's gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's overnight rally to record
heights.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 384.70
points, or 2.60 percent, closing at 15,164.64. It was the index's
first close above the psychologically-important 15,000-point level
since Aug. 25.
	   Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday Monday. On
Friday, the Nikkei had gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   The buying frenzy in Asia was particularly boosted by the
overnight gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 214.72 points _ or 2.3 percent _ to 9,374.27, vaulting
past the record close of 9,337.97 set July 17.
	   Investors shrugged off signs that a coalition agreement between
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Liberal Party was
in trouble. The coalition plan had boosted share prices last week
as it raised hopes for more aggressive measures to lift Japan out
of recession.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.62 yen, up 1.46 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of
120.99 yen late Monday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 337.18 points,
or 3.2 percent, to 10,851.71, its highest close since April 28. On
Monday, the index had gained 281.17 points.
	   ``An improvement in overseas markets, including a gain in the
U.S. overnight,'' spurred strong buying in the Hong Kong markets,
said Francis Lun, research manager at Pacific Challenge Securities
Ltd.
	   Singapore shares also closed sharply higher, extending an almost
two-week advance that has been fueled by lower interest rates and a
firming of other major stock markets.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index rose 2.6 percent, or 35.96
points, to 1,412.90. In the last two weeks, the index has climbed
about 18 percent.
	   Philippine shares closed higher for the third straight session,
buoyed by Wall Street's gains and a quarter percentage point cut in
the central bank's key overnight borrowing rate.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 38.99
points, or 2 percent, closing at 1,961.25.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The
benchmark Composite Index rose 12.49 points, or 2.6 percent, to
489.66.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, helped by overnight gains on
the U.S. stock market. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index
rose 123.58 points, or 1.69 percent, to 7,435.84.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 capital index gained 9.15 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 1,995.71.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed generally higher after
positive U.S. investor sentiment boosted confidence among local
market players. The All Ordinaries Index rose 12.6 points, or 0.4
percent, to 2,760.2.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, encouraged by the surge in
U.S. stocks overnight. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose
6.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to 460.78.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed generally higher, but profit-taking
in some blue-chip stocks dragged the key index lower. The Composite
Index fell 4.907 points, or 1.2 percent, to 420.080.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 6.77 points, or 1.7 percent,
to 383.66.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A slain Russian lawmaker was
honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic ideals in a stately
funeral service in which anger mingled freely with tears.
	   Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside some
of Russia's greatest national heroes.
	   The stirring tribute to Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose
killing remains a mystery, was indicative of the depth of national
feeling over her death.
	   ``To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral
for Starovoitova. ``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her
life for.''
	   Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most
prominent political figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St.
Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the funeral.
	   An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons and flanked by a
military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. At the end of
the service, mourners passed grimly past it as classical music
played.
	   Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the cold,
waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay their
respects.
	   ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this
never happens again,'' said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the manager
of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, ``There's little
hope of that in our country.''
	   Among speakers at the service were former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, who represented the president at the service.
Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was also present.
	   Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee the
investigation into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow
hospital, recovering from pneumonia.
	   ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole
of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives for that
murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and society
should know all the truth about it.''
	   One national television channel turned over its daylong
programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers
carried page after page of coverage of her death. Her political
party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn
out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 8 p.m. Tuesday.
	   Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in a simple
cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives.
	   But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government
announced that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky
Monastery in the city's center following the funeral at the
Ethnography Museum.
	   Among those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the
composers Peter Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author
Fyodor Dostoevsky.
	   Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide
scaled the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide,
27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able
to provide some description of the shooting to police.
	   Acting on his information, investigators rounded up several
suspects, officials said Monday. But a detective later said that
investigators had learned nothing ``serious'' from Linkov,
according to the Interfax news agency, and there were no further
details about whether the suspects were still in custody.
	   Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior
Ministry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he was confident the case
would be solved. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that
investigators ``have tips, they have something to work on.''
	   Authorities are acting on the assumption that Starovoitova's
death was a contract hit, a common event in post-Soviet Russia.
Russian politicians and newspapers have speculated wildly about
political motives for the killing, but police have said they have
no idea why someone would have wanted her dead.
	   Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member of
the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No one
was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to
Starovoitova's death.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has been
released from a hospital after recovering from an infection, a
government statement said Tuesday.
	   But Lee, 75, will complete a course of intravenous antibiotics
as an outpatient. He was hospitalized Saturday for treatment of the
infection following a minor surgical procedure.
	   Lee was discharged Monday from National University Hospital by
his doctor, Associate Professor John Wong.
	   No details on the nature of the infection or the surgical
procedure were disclosed.
	   The former prime minister and architect of modern Singapore, who
remains a powerful voice on domestic and international affairs, has
enjoyed good health since two angioplasty operations in 1996 to
clear a blocked heart artery.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Canadian, Austrian ambassadors, British Embassy
official meeting foreign secretary to express opposition to capital
punishment, graf 5; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has turned
down appeals from the Vatican and other countries for the
Philippines to cancel its first execution in 22 years and repeal
the death penalty, his spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The Vatican, the European Union and Canada recently sent appeals
to the Philippine government arguing that the death penalty would
not reduce widespread crime, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
	   A Philippine judge has ordered prison authorities to execute Leo
Echegaray, convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old
stepdaughter, but ordered the execution date kept secret. The
scheduled execution has triggered a debate over the death penalty
that has divided many Filipinos.
	   ``President Estrada has a constitutional duty to see to it that
laws are faithfully executed and the law requires the execution. He
has to obey the law,'' presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said.
	   The ambassadors of Canada and Austria and an official of the
British Embassy met Siazon Tuesday to express their opposition to
the death penalty. ``We are 100 percent against the death penalty
for humanitarian cause,'' said Wolfgang Jilly of Austria, who also
represented the European Union.
	   Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying the execution
would deter similar crimes.
	   ``I am very firm with my decision because I know there will
still be many who will try to commit rape. There are so many rape
cases in the country, so this is one way of teaching them a
lesson,'' Estrada said.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   Another defendant, Pablito Andan, who was convicted of rape and
murder, is also scheduled to be executed this year but is appealing
his sentence. At least five others whose sentences have been upheld
by the Supreme Court may be executed next year, officials said.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said he has learned that
Echegaray may be executed sometime in January. He said he plans to
ask the Supreme Court to compel Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the
Quezon City Regional Trial Court to publicly reveal the exact date
of execution.
	   Under current government rules, authorities are forbidden from
informing Echegaray of his impending execution until after sunrise
on execution day. Cuevas, however, said the rules don't prohibit
the date from being disclosed publicly.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter crime, and that
crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

U.S. aircraft carrier enters Gulf waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and
five escort ships have joined the American naval fleet operating in
Gulf waters, a U.S. Navy spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The Enterprise is scheduled to relieve the carrier USS
Eisenhower now in the region, said Cmdr. Gordon Hume, spokesman for
the Bahrain-based U.S. 5th Fleet. Ships accompanying the carrier
include a cruiser, two destroyers and a submarine.
	   The Eisenhower, which arrived in the Gulf on Oct. 22, is
scheduled to return to its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, by
mid-December, Hume said, without specifying when the carrier will
leave the Gulf.
	   Aircraft from the nuclear-powered carrier fly about 100 sorties
daily to the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
	   The Enterprise was ordered to move to the Gulf to join U.S.
naval forces preparing to launch military strikes on Iraq.
	   The strikes were averted Nov. 14 when Iraq agreed to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   With the arrival of the Enterprise and its five ship battle
group, there are some 19 warships in the region carrying 17,000
sailors and marines.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kremlin confirming Yeltsin's condition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris
Yeltsin is resting in a hospital where he is likely to stay for at
least a week while he recovers from pneumonia, aides said Tuesday.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president's
condition was stable and his temperature was normal.
	   Yeltsin played host to Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a
hospital reception room Monday. Aides said the president would
likely cancel other meetings with foreign visitors this month but
will meet Russian officials at the hospital.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin
called pneumonia and a high temperature Sunday, his third ailment
in recent weeks, reviving worries about his ability to run a vast
country deep in economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday
night.
	   In television footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was
chuckling and wearing a sweater and did not look very ill.
	   The Russian president has rarely been seen in public recently,
and the Kremlin has only allowed limited television coverage of
him, fueling speculation that he is seriously sick.
	   He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as a
respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and
exhaustion. Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking
little chance with the president's health, ensuring that he has
frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He
said treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, in an interview on NTV, added:
``Knowing the president's character, he will have his own point of
view on how long he has to stay in the hospital.''
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
speculation has grown about early elections.

	   The strikes were averted Nov. 14 when Iraq agreed to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   With the arrival of the Enterprise and its five ship battle
group, there are some 19 warships in the region carrying 17,000
sailors and marines.

Hunger situation in Cambodia comparable to North Korea, WFP says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia
are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in
North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday.
	   Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a
faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and
education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children,
said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director.
	   ``There is enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor
to access it. The problem is poverty,'' Davies said.
	   The WFP is currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians _
about 15 percent of the population _ with food-for-work and direct
assistance programs, but Davies said he fears there are still
plenty more that are not getting enough to eat every day.
	   ``The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North
Korea,'' Davies said. ``The situation is much worse than most
people recognize.''
	   According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent of Cambodian
children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 20 percent
suffer from acute malnutrition.
	   By comparison, a similar survey of North Korean children under 7
found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute
malnutrition.
	   Cambodia has produced a rice surplus for export in the last two
years and expects another this year, but WFP statistics show that
25 percent of rice-growing areas account for 75 percent of the
surplus.
	   The majority of Cambodian farmers are not producing enough to
keep their families fed and are being increasingly saddled with
debts incurred when they run out of reserves before harvest, Davies
said.
	   Money-lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent
interest, which must be paid in rice at harvest time, giving many
farmers a handicapped start on the next crop season.
	   Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern
child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded
health and education sectors in Cambodia _ have exacerbated the
food security problem, Davies said.
	   Davies urged the new government to substantially increase annual
expenditures on health, education and rural development as a first
step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's food crisis.
	   ``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with
the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said.
	   Cambodia typically earmarks about half of its annual budget to
defense and security. In the 1998 budget, education was allocated
6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent.
	   Actual disbursements to the three ministries are often only 60
to 70 percent of the budgeted amount as annual revenues fall short
of expectations, according to aid workers.
	   A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health
ministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from
health officials and the U.N. World Health Program. The draft was
later readjusted to provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in
health spending.

Britain's Branson explores airline venture with Ghana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana, (AP) _ Hot air-ballooning British entrepreneur
Richard Branson is exploring the skies over West Africa and a
possible cooperative venture between his Virgin Atlantic Airways
and Ghana's national air carrier.
	   Branson met with representatives from Ghana Airways and the
Civil Aviation Authority to discuss possible investment
opportunities, a spokesman for Branson said Tuesday.
	   Ghana Airways, primarily a regional airline with a few long-haul
routes to Europe, has the potential to emerge as a competitive air
carrier with the help of some capital investment, Branson said.
	   ``Virgin group of companies has the confidence to invest in
Ghana,'' Branson said. ``I have come to begin a process that will
lead to the establishment of a framework for business
collaboration.''
	   Branson's interest in Ghana Airways may have been triggered by
the possibility of a void in regional airline services. West and
central Africa's primary carrier, Air Afrique, is facing dramatic
debt problems and is running out of time to find a solution.
	   The troubled Air Afrique has until the end of the month to come
up with money to pay off its creditors.
	   In addition to the airline industry, Branson is looking at
possible investment deals in Ghana's railway services and the music
and hotel industries.
	   ``Ghana is a viable place to do business,'' Branson said. ``The
success of Ghana's economic and political development would send
the right signals to other African countries.''
	   In addition to his airline, Branson's diversified business
empire includes music publishing and other entertainment ventures,
including a soft drink line.

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Taking a major step toward
statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza
International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with
cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
	   An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in
the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt).
	   But the emotional highlight was the touchdown of the first
Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. After landing, the pilot
and co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads as
they descended the stairway. A chant of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is
Great, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians who had
pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations.
	   ``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
later told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly
decorated with deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics.
	   Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the
tarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan,
Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights.
	   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.
	   However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the
authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor
arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out
if it considers them a danger to Israeli security.
	   Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over
security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
	   In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security
agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collected
the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet
ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags.
	   Throughout the morning, there were spontaneous celebrations. As
a police marching band played bagpipes, airport workers, policemen
and Cabinet ministers held each other by their hands and danced in
a circle. Some kissed and embraced their neighbors, others wiped
away tears and several officers waved their rifles in the air.
	   In one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered around
a man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled
Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers
and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often
with difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to be
able to afford an air ticket.
	   Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission
to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport
near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to Jordan and
catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to
cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to
become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza
opens next month.
	   Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the
Palestinian airport, citing security reasons. However, Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change
in the future.
	   The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the
accord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last
week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open
next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian
seaport in Gaza are continuing.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
next week.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls
for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of
Ashdod. Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a
portable control panel installed in a van.
	   Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians consider
the airport a big step toward independence. For those living in the
small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean
on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease
the feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to
Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.

European association presidents meet on club competitions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Top officials of Europe's soccer associations were
meeting Tuesday to discuss a revamped structure for UEFA's club
competitions.
	   Last month, representatives of major teams agreed not to join a
breakaway Super League after the European governing body proposed
changing its Champions League, offering teams more money.
	   UEFA promised to expand next season's Champions' League from 24
teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners
Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   Last week in Madrid, 14 clubs endorsed the plan and urged UEFA
to implement the new format starting next season.
	   Final details of the new structure have yet to be resolved.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the new-look competition in an
already tight season schedule are proving problematic.
	   ``Some leagues have 20 teams so it will be difficult for them,''
UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said earlier this month.
``We'll have to study the individual situation in each country.''
	   UEFA is also trying to come up with a ranking system which will
satisfy everyone.
	   Aigner said UEFA is looking to figure in group match results,
results in the knockout matches, the nation's coefficient and
individual club coefficients.
	   Europe's top clubs have demanded 50 percent of any revenue
generated by the revamped Champions League.
	   Tuesday's special conference in Geneva, to which the presidents
of UEFA's 51 member associations have been invited, will touch on
other areas ``including European Union matters,'' UEFA says.
	   The body last week expressed concern that soccer ``be treated in
accordance with its specific character by EU institutions.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines and
prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways have clashed over the
laying off of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks with
another foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the Philippine flag
carrier.
	   President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora,
said the two airlines have disagreed on how many of PAL's more than
8,000 workers should be laid off to make the airline viable.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that Hong Kong-based
Cathay Pacific wants to trim PAL's work force to about 5,000, but
PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan did not want to cut
the number of workers below 8,000 to avoid antagonizing the
company's unions.
	   Cathay Pacific also wants to lay off about 200 PAL pilots, a
proposal also opposed by Tan, Zamora said. Tan wants to retain the
200 pilots because they stood by him when the majority of PAL's
pilots staged a devastating strike in June.
	   Tan has gone to the United States to try to revive talks with
Northwest Airlines, which earlier expressed interest in investing
in PAL, Zamora said.
	   Zamora said Northwest was larger than Cathay Pacific ``and maybe
its first action would not be to fire employees.''
	   PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo did not comment on the reported
disagreement but said negotiations between the two companies were
continuing. He said Cathay Pacific was still studying PAL's
financial records.
	   Katherine Wang, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong,
said it has not asked PAL to lay off workers. She said the
companies must first reach agreement on Cathay Pacific's entry into
PAL before such operational details can be discussed.
	   ``Our view is that the manpower requirements of PAL are to be
discussed over the long term. Cathay Pacific has no definite plan
as far as staffing is concerned,'' Wang said.
	   She declined to comment on Zamora's and Espiritu's statements
and said Cathay Pacific's negotiations with PAL ``will still carry
on.''
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.

Mandela lawyers appeal rugby decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for President Nelson
Mandela on Tuesday appealed a court ruling that quashed a
government investigation of racism and mismanagement in rugby.
	   The ongoing battle about the sport, once heralded as a way of
uniting South Africa's races, has caused divisions in the country.
	   The South African Rugby Union had gone to court to block the
government's investigation, dragging the president to the witness
stand.
	   Many blacks felt that was a deliberate attempt by the
white-dominated sport to humiliate South Africa's first black
president. That impression deepened after Judge William de Villiers
ruled in favor of the rugby league and rebuked Mandela for
insolence during his testimony.
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the apartheid regime
that ended with 1994's first all-race election of Mandela as
president.
	   Lawyer Wim Trengove told a panel of Constitutional Court judges
that de Villier's judgment was invalid, and asked them to set it
aside. The Constitutional Court is South Africa's highest legal
body.
	   Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers who dominated apartheid governments and still maintain a
stranglehold on most professional teams.
	   Blacks grew to hate the sport during the apartheid era,
associating it with the white minority. But Mandela tried to use
rugby to promote racial reconciliation after he took power and
urged blacks to support the victorious national team in the 1995
World Cup.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two people were killed and scores injured
Tuesday when a car bomb exploded in front of the German Embassy,
witnesses said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat also
insisting on anonymity.
	   The two Yemenis who died were pedestrians passing by the
embassy. About six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, and
many others suffered minor wounds.
	   The bomb explosion set the car next to it on fire but
firefighters have managed to put out the blaze, the witnesses said.
	   The Mazda carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy in
the residential Hadda area, where most embassies are located.
	   The German embassy is right next to the house of prominent
political figure Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, who security officials
suspect may have been the target of the attack.
	   The site has been cordoned off by police, who are not allowing
anyone to enter or leave the area. No other details were available.
	   Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, is largely inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to
use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent
with the government.

Cambodian king praises coalition deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday
praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties _
previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition government led by
strongman Hun Sen.
	   In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had
received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will
place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of
fiscal and administrative functions in the government.
	   ``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will
certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people,''
Sihanouk wrote.
	   Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and
FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form
a government at a summit convened by Sihanouk.
	   The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh
president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of
political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by
Hun Sen.
	   Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper
house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the
outgoing head of the National Assembly.
	   Sihanouk, recalling procedures used in a past government,
suggested Tuesday that he should appoint the first two members of
the upper house. The remaining senators, he said, should be
selected by a method agreed upon by the new government and the
National Assembly.
	   Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC had agreed that
the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat National
Assembly.
	   Other details of the Senate, including how much power it will be
given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet to be ironed out
by the two parties.

Three North Koreans defect to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three North Koreans arrived in Seoul
Tuesday and sought asylum to join family members who had defected
earlier to South Korea, government officials said.
	   Park Sang Woon, 60, accompanied by his 58-year-old wife and
21-year-old son, flew in from a ``third country'' where they had
been living in hiding since escaping their communist homeland early
this year, the intelligence officials said.
	   The Seoul government generally uses the term ``third country''
to avoid naming China, which is required by a treaty with North
Korea to return defectors to their homeland.
	   South Korean officials said Park worked as a coal miner before
fleeing North Korea.
	   Two of his sons, aged 34 and 32, defected to South Korea
separately in 1993 and in September this year, they said.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years, including 61 so far this year. All complained about
severe food and fuel shortages in their country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 and
have never signed a formal peace treaty.

Investigators draw some conclusions into plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ All 10 passengers survived a plane's
crash landing but five people, including a senior military
official, later died of hypothermia and injuries, a government
investigation concluded.
	   Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze and three other passengers died days after
the crash Sept. 25 in the Rwenzori Mountains, in western Uganda,
where they were exposed to extreme cold, the government-owned New
Vision newspaper said, citing a report that has not yet been
officially released.
	   Only the pilot, Enos Luwuzu, who had two deep cuts on his face,
may have died directly as a result of injuries sustained in the
accident, the report said. Another five passengers survived.
	   No reference was made to claims by Luwuzu's family that two
bullets had entered his body at the base of the neck and exited
through his mouth.
	   The report carried by the New Vision also failed to address
several conflicting reports about the crash, including that there
were heated arguments before the crash as well as following it.
	   The twin-engine Islander plane, which had taken off from Entebbe
airport, was headed toward the northeastern Congolese town of Bunia
when it crashed.
	   The newspaper said investigators found the aircraft's flight
plan had been altered, although it did not specify what was changed
or when.
	   Following the crash, the New Vision reported that the plan had
been changed to show a destination of Kasese, western Uganda, thus
concealing its real destination across the Congolese border.
	   Some reports said the passengers were on a gold-buying mission.
Others said they were en route to help the Uganda-backed rebellion
in eastern Congo.
	   One newspaper report said the pilot wanted to land in Kasese,
but was threatened by a passengers at gunpoint to continue to
Bunia.
	   New Vision said the inquiry found the crash was caused by human
error, after ``a series of abrupt and last-minute changes in
destination of the intended flight, emanating from the
passengers.''
	   This may have caused the pilot to choose an inappropriate flight
path, the report said.
	   It also said the plane started gaining altitude too late to
clear the high mountain peaks on its path. The pilot may have
miscalculated because of low clouds, the report said.

Philippines' PLDT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., giving it management control of the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company.
	   First Pacific hailed the acquisition as a milestone in its
efforts to shape itself into an owner of a ``select number of
high-quality, larger businesses'' in Asia, and stressed the
investment was a long-term one.
	   ``Our strategy is to acquire businesses in the region that are
leaders in their home markets and have strong brand names,'' it
said.
	   But market watchers were surprised at the steep price First
Pacific paid for the stake in PLDT.
	   Under the agreement, which has kept the stock market on
tenterhooks for the past few months and triggered wild swings in
PLDT's share price, First Pacific paid about dlrs 750 million for a
27.4 percent stake in PLDT, or 1,420 pesos (dlrs 35.85) per share.
	   PLDT closed Tuesday at 1,055 pesos, down 30 pesos, or 2.8
percent, from the previous day. It fell to a year low of 695 pesos
on Sept. 14 and struck a high of 1,095 pesos on Nov. 17.
	   While most analysts praised PLDT as a valuable long-term asset,
the company is unlikely to bolster earnings at First Pacific in the
near-term.
	   Despite strong nine-month revenues, analysts are concerned that
the growth in PLDT's earnings has slowed dramatically. Net income
growth from year-earlier levels fell to 1.6 percent in the third
quarter, compared to 35 percent in the first quarter.
	   Despite concerns over the heavy price paid, analysts believe the
acquisition will be a good fit in terms of First Pacific's
long-term strategy.
	   First Pacific Managing Director Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino,
said he has been appointed chief executive officer and president of
PLDT, replacing Antonio Cojuangco in both posts.
	   Cojuangco was appointed PLDT chairman, replacing Roberto Romulo.
	   Pangilinan said the PLDT stake will be held by First Pacific's
non-listed Philippine unit, Metro Pacific Asset Holdings Inc.
	   In a complicated buy-in, First Pacific acquired its stake by
paying dlrs 552 million for a 52.7 percent share of the Cojuangco
family's holding company, Philippine Telecommunications Investment
Corp., which holds a 21.5 percent stake in PLDT, and by buying
around 5.9 percent of PLDT stock on the market for dlrs 197
million.
	   The transactions give First Pacific 27.4 percent of PLDT's
voting rights and make it the single largest shareholder.
	   The Philippine government, which holds 12 percent via state
pension funds, is the next biggest stake holder.
	   First Pacific also said it has reached a preliminary agreement
for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to raise its stake
in Smart Communications Inc., the Philippines' largest cellular
telephone service provider, to 40 percent from 15 percent. No
financial terms were released.
	   First Pacific, which now holds 65 percent of Smart, will
transfer its diluted holdings in the company to PLDT in exchange
for new PLDT shares. This would further raise the stake of First
Pacific in PLDT. The company plans to fold Smart into PLDT, it
said.
	   Pangilinan said PLDT's new management intends to focus initially
on domestic operations.
	   ``Then probably we will invest in the region,'' he said.
	   First Pacific is also open to the prospect of bringing new
partners into PLDT, especially if they can infuse new technology,
he said.

European association presidents meet on club competitions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Top officials of Europe's soccer associations were
meeting Tuesday to discuss a revamped structure for UEFA's club
competitions.
	   Last month, representatives of major teams agreed not to join a
breakaway Super League after the European governing body proposed
changing its Champions League, offering teams more money.
	   UEFA promised to expand next season's Champions' League from 24
teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners
Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   Last week in Madrid, 14 clubs endorsed the plan and urged UEFA
to implement the new format starting next season.
	   Final details of the new structure have yet to be resolved.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the new-look competition in an
already tight season schedule are proving problematic.
	   ``Some leagues have 20 teams so it will be difficult for them,''
UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said earlier this month.
``We'll have to study the individual situation in each country.''
	   UEFA is also trying to come up with a ranking system which will
satisfy everyone.
	   Aigner said UEFA is looking to figure in group match results,
results in the knockout matches, the nation's coefficient and
individual club coefficients.
	   Europe's top clubs have demanded 50 percent of any revenue
generated by the revamped Champions League.
	   Tuesday's special conference in Geneva, to which the presidents
of UEFA's 51 member associations have been invited, will touch on
other areas ``including European Union matters,'' UEFA says.
	   The body last week expressed concern that soccer ``be treated in
accordance with its specific character by EU institutions.''

Officials say Communist rebels strengthening presence in western
</HEADLINE>
Philippine island &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels are attempting to
strengthen their presence in a remote western island province that
they want to use as a rest and recreation area, officials said
Tuesday.
	   A military official said documents taken from three New People's
Army rebels killed in a clash with Marine soldiers in a town in
Palawan province last week contained plans by the rebels to step up
recruitment of new members.
	   The brief encounter in the town of Quezon, south of Palawan, was
the second in recent weeks. Last month, government troops clashed
with a small group of NPA guerrillas in a village near Quezon,
killing one rebel and arresting another.
	   Marine Lt. Ivan Papera of the military's Western Command in
Palawan said the guerrillas apparently want to turn Palawan, known
for its scenic beach resorts and mountain trails, into an area
where rebel troops can rest after staging operations in other parts
of the country.
	   The rebels began recruiting new members in Palawan last year and
are estimated to have about 90 members there now, 60 of them armed,
Papera said. There has been no significant presence of Communist
rebels in Palawan before.
	   Military and police authorities are taking steps to stop the
rebels' expansion plans, he said.
	   Palawan lies 580 kilometers (360 miles) southwest of Manila. It
is near the South China Sea's Spratlys Islands, which are claimed
by the Philippines, China and four other countries.
	   The Communists have been fighting the government since the late
1960s. They have been holding on-and-off peace negotiations with
the Philippine government in the Netherlands, where rebel leaders
live.
	   In March, the two sides signed an accord aimed at promoting
human rights, but it has not been implemented.

Kosovo rebels free Serb policeman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels on Tuesday
freed a kidnapped Serb policeman after U.S. diplomatic observers
intervened to persuade them to let him go.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was still believed to be holding two
ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along with the policeman
last Wednesday and are considered sympathetic to Serb authorities.
	   The KLA is accused of attacking or kidnapping numerous Serb
policemen since last month's agreement aimed at ending hostilities
in the restive province of southern Serbia.
	   The pre-arranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran Zvilic
took place Tuesday morning near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial
capital Pristina.
	   It was negotiated by American members of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission _ the main foreign monitoring force in Kosovo
until a recently approved international verification mission is
launched.
	   While the diplomats looked on and armed guerrillas stood watch
nearby, a KLA vehicle drove up and Zbiljic got out. Police
colleagues shook his hand and embraced the policeman, who had been
accused by the KLA of looting empty ethnic Albanian houses.
	   ``They did not harass me. Probably they had mixed me up with
someone else,'' he said.
	   ``I want to go home as soon as possible,'' the policeman added.
``The war is no good for anyone and it has to stop.''
	   On hand to make sure the release took place were Shaun Byrnes,
head of the U.S. diplomatic contingent, and KLA representative Adem
Demaci.
	   The foreign diplomats have been talking with both sides in
recent weeks, concerned by an increase of shooting incidents blamed
on both the Serbs and the rebels.
	   The Podujevo area had been very tense since Zbiljic's abduction,
with local Serbs threatening a mass exodus if Serb authorities did
not react to the KLA ``harassment.''
	   After talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill late
Monday, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic condemned continuing
``terrorist acts'' by the KLA and declared that its attacks on
``innocent citizens, police and soldiers'' must be be stopped.
	   Milutinovic demanded that Hill personally condemn the KLA's
actions.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in Kosovo. Most advocate independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were killed and
hundreds of thousands displaced during a crackdown by Serb and
Yugoslav authorities from February to October.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement led to a withdrawal of many Yugoslav forces
and a fragile cease-fire. But violence continues as international
officials try to produce a political settlement on Kosovo's future
status.
	   Ethnic Albanians have rejected the latest offer by the Serbs to
negotiate over Kosovo without the foreign mediation they demand.
	   Independent Belgrade media quoted Nekibe Kelmendi, general
secretary of Rugova's ethnic Albanian party, as saying they won't
take part in proposed talks Wednesday because ``the Serb side wants
to present the Kosovo issue as an internal matter.''
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic was quoted by state-run
media as saying that by rejecting the talks, the ethnic Albanian
leaders are buying time for their ``terrorists'' to reorganize.
	   ``But we won't allow it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A push for OPEC members to stick to
production cuts, designed to lift sagging prices, was expected to
intensify Tuesday as oil ministers arrived from three countries
said to be not fully complying.
	   OPEC's 11 member states will hold a formal year-end meeting
Wednesday facing the lowest prices in nearly 11 years.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
to dlrs 12.33, compared to dlrs 18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   The slump could damage OPEC's economies, often highly dependent
on oil revenues for government financing.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
raising levels of compliance with production cuts introduced in
June; extending the cuts; cutting further; and calling an
exceptional heads of state meeting ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said in
Dubai on Monday.
	   Algeria says OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands. The
United Arab Emirates has supported Algeria's idea of a special
top-level meeting.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6-million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in its latest report in October.
	   However compliance by Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia is lower,
analysts believe. Ministers from all three countries were expected
mid-Tuesday.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million, was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

Indonesia criticizes Portugal over suspension of East Timor talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims
that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and
criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the
future of the troubled territory.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly
wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last
week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese
rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.
	   East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Belo, has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed
near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor's capital.
	   The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said that so far, only 11
bodies had been identified.
	   Alatas said the claims of a massacre were not true.
	   ``The Portuguese delegation, without checking the truth of the
information, decided to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue,''
Antara quoted Alatas as saying.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said some deaths had
occurred in fights between rebels and Indonesian forces. However,
it could not confirm claims that dozens of people had been killed.
	   Alatas said it was the third time that Portugal had unilaterally
suspended talks over East Timor since 1986.
	   Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about
Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported.
	   Meanwhile, about 500 students staged a noisy but peaceful rally
outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili.
	   The group earlier had spent the night occupying the provincial
Parliament.
	   The students demanded a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers
from East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations, however, does not recognize Indonesia's
claim.
	   Before being suspended, the talks centered on an Indonesian
offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.

Duncan Ferguson joins Newcastle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Ruud Gullit moved to bolster his
struggling Newcastle side Tuesday by landing Everton striker Duncan
Ferguson in a 7-million-pound (dlrs 11.2 million) deal.
	   The transfer was announced the morning after Everton beat
Newcastle 1-0 at Goodison Park.
	   Gullit hopes the 26-year-old Scottish striker can team up front
with England captain Alan Shearer to provide the firepower that
Newcastle has been lacking all season.
	   Ferguson, a folk hero at Everton, is Gullit's first major
signing since he took over at Newcastle following the firing of
Kenny Dalglish.
	   Everton manager Walter Smith sold his club's most talented and
popular player in order to raise money to bring in fresh talent.
	   Ironically, it was Smith who sold Ferguson to Everton while he
was manager of Glasgow Rangers.
	   Ferguson's arrival will fuel speculation about Shearer's future
at Newcastle.
	   Gullit insisted after Monday night's defeat that he didn't want
the England captain to leave the club. But he said he wouldn't
stand in Shearer's way if he wanted to leave.
	   ``It depends on him, not on me,'' Gullit said. ``Every player
needs to be happy where he is. If he is unhappy, then what's the
point? I would like to hear from him if he is not happy. If he is
happy, then he will stay.''
	   Both Shearer and Ferguson missed Monday night's game with
injuries.
	   Newcastle lies 14th in the Premier League table, with Everton
16th.
	   Ferguson, who started his career at Dundee United in 1990,
joined Rangers in 1993 in a then British record 4 million pound
(dlrs 6.4 million) deal.
	   Ferguson received a three-month jail sentence after being
convicted of assault for head-butting John McStay in a 1995 game
against Raith. He eventually served six weeks in prison.
	   Ferguson, who played five times for Scotland, quit the national
side over what he considered unfair treatment in the McStay
incident.

South Korea turns over five jets to the Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ South Korea turned over five aging
jet fighters to the Philippines on Tuesday in ceremonies at a
former U.S. Air Force base north of Manila, an official said.
	   Philippine air force spokesman Col. Jose Mendoza said the F-5A
Freedom Fighters were given by South Korea to the Philippines for
an unspecified token amount. News reports said the amount was dlrs
500.
	   ``The planes were given to the Philippines in appreciation for
Philippine help to South Korea during the Korean War,'' Mendoza
said.
	   With the addition of the South Korean planes, presented at the
former Clark U.S. Air Force base, the Philippine air force now has
15 F-5s, a squadron of Italian-made S-211s and several dozen
helicopter gunships, he said.
	   Three years ago, South Korea provided 12 navy gunboats to the
Philippines.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest armed forces in Asia.
	   It previously depended on the U.S. defense umbrella in the
region but in 1992, a nationalist Philippine Senate ordered the
last U.S. base in the country to close, ending nearly a century of
American military presence in its former colony.
	   In 1996, the United States halted all major exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships after the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The Philippine Senate is currently considering a new pact that
would allow American soldiers to train in the country again.
	   The Philippines has approved a 15-year military modernization
program but the Asian financial crisis has delayed its
implementation.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The prime minister of Laos toured the
gilded Shwedagon pagoda, the holiest Buddhist shrine in Myanmar, on
the second day of a goodwill visit Tuesday.
	   Sisavath Keobounphan and his delegation also were to inspect an
industrial park on the capital's outskirts and the country's famed
gems museum.
	   Agreements were signed Monday exempting officials and diplomats
from visa requirements and for the official news agencies to

	   The Laotian delegation is to leave Yangon on Wednesday to visit
Pagan, a dusty plain filled with the ruins of hundreds of temples,
and the northern city of Mandalay.

would be allowed to use airport in the future &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ With cheers, tears and a surge of
patriotism, Palestinians inaugurated Gaza International Airport on
Tuesday, their first gateway to the world and for many a giant step
toward statehood.
	   An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in
the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT).
	   But the emotional highlight was the arrival of the first
Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. After landing, the pilot
and co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads as
they descended the stairway.
	   A chant of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great, rose from
thousands of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the
airfield to join the celebrations.
	   ``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
later told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly
decorated with deep-red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics.
	   Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the
tarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan,
Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights.
	   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.
	   However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the
authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor
arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out
if it considers them a danger to Israeli security.
	   Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over
security had delayed the opening for more than two years.
	   In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security
agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collected
the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet
ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags.
	   Throughout the morning, there were spontaneous celebrations. As
a police marching band played bagpipes, airport workers, policemen
and Cabinet ministers held hands and danced in a circle. Some
kissed and embraced their neighbors, others wiped away tears and
several officers waved their rifles in the air.
	   In one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered around
a man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums.
	   The dlrs 75 million airport will boost the troubled Palestinian
economy, permitting the quick export of Palestinian flowers and
farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with
difficulties and delays.
	   The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel
abroad, although a majority of Gazans probably cannot afford an air
ticket.
	   Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission
to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport
near Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to Jordan and
catch flights there.
	   Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to
cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel should be
smoother once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens
next month.
	   Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the
Palestinian airport, citing security reasons. However, Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change
in the future.
	   The opening was negotiated during last month's U.S.-sponsored
Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel also
withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released
250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open
next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian
seaport in Gaza continue.
	   Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in
an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported
from Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge
and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter
(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
next week.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will improvise. Major
pieces of equipment, including the controls for the control tower,
are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Tuesday's planes
were guided to a safe landing by a portable control panel installed
in a van.
	   Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians consider
the airport a big step toward independence. For those living in the
small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean
on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease
the feeling of being trapped.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studies
economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to
Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief predicted
Tuesday that student protests against the government would persist
until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999. In the streets,
hundreds of students demanded his ouster.
	   President B.J. Habibie, meanwhile, said continuing turmoil has
slowed efforts to revive Indonesia's sick economy even though the
battered rupiah has climbed in value in recent weeks.
	   Many foreign investors are wary of investing in the politically
fragile nation, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   ``We have witnessed the strengthening of the rupiah, which gives
hope for our economic recovery,'' Habibie said at the opening of
the national Boy Scouts' convention. ``But unfortunately this
progress has been countered by social and political unrest.''
	   Habibie has pledged to revamp the rigid political system left
behind by his authoritarian predecessor and former mentor, Suharto.
	   Suharto was ousted by riots and protests in May after three
decades in power, but students suspect his replacement is not
serious about democratic change.
	   Armed forces commander Wiranto said student protesters would
continue to push their demands, which also include the ouster of
Habibie and an end to the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement. ... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   Facing a public outcry, the military said 163 soldiers involved
in deadly clashes Nov. 13 with student protesters had been confined
to barracks for three weeks and could face court-martial.
	   At least nine student protesters, who were pressing for swift
democratic reforms, died in the fighting.
	   Although Wiranto had ordered riot officers to carry only blanks
and plastic bullets, hospital doctors said they found metal bullet
fragments in some of the victims.
	   The clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta, and a
total of 16 people died.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds of security personnel blocked about 1,000
students from several colleges from marching along a toll road and
on to the Parliament.
	   Wearing yellow jackets, about 300 students from the prestigious
University of Indonesia earlier marched near the presidential
palace, urging that Wiranto take responsibility for the killings.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' they chanted.
	   In a separate protest, more than 1,000 students entered the
compound of the office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to
demand a trial of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights
abuses.
	   ``First Suharto has to be put on trial. Then it's the turn of
the other cronies. If not, we'll protest all the time,'' said
Samsuddin, an engineering student.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby as student representatives held talks with Ghalib.
	   He refused to accept their demands that Suharto be put on trial
within one month.
	   The Nov. 13 clashes have further tarnished the image of the
military, which is facing criticism for human rights abuses
committed during the Suharto era.
	   Wiranto said the soldiers who were disciplined include 144 who
fired at protesters without permission, 12 who beat demonstrators
and news photographers, and seven officers who failed to control
their men.
	   Violence also erupted in the Indonesian capital Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.

Customs officers to go on indefinite strike starting Nov. 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officers are to begin an
indefinite strike starting at the end of the month, an action which
could lead to fuel shortages here and seriously disrupt Balkan
trade.
	   Customs union officials said Tuesday that officers around the
country will begin rolling five-day strikes starting on Nov. 30 to
protest government plans to unify pension funds. Customs workers
want to maintain their existing independent pension fund.
	   Coming at the beginning of the Christmas holiday period, it was
not yet known if the strike would disrupt sea-borne commerce with
the European Union.
	   But it was sure to affect trade through Greece's land borders
with its non-EU Balkan neighbors. A three-day warning strike held
last week caused serious fuel shortages around the country and
disrupted marine bunker fuel operations.
	   Although emergency staffs were working, hundreds of trucks were
bottle necked along Greece borders with Albania, Bulgaria,
Macedonia and Turkey. A large number of trucks also transit through
Greece bound for the Middle East and the central Asian republics.

Clinton trying to restart Israel-Syria peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton told Israeli and
Syrian leaders he is willing to make an immediate, personal effort
to help restart peace talks between the two countries, an Israeli
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   In a recent conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Clinton said he had sent a message on the subject to
Syrian President Hafez Assad, the daily said.
	   ``I am willing to get personally involved to achieve a peace
agreement if the two sides are willing,'' Clinton wrote to Assad,
according to the newspaper.
	   ``I am willing to participate in such efforts as soon as
possible, on condition that the sides are serious and prepared for
concessions that will lead to a peace agreement,'' the Clinton
message continued.
	   Top U.S. officials have met separately in Washington with Syrian
and Israeli representatives recently to discuss renewing the talks,
Maariv wrote.
	   Israel and Syria broke off peace talks in March 1996, three
months before Netanyahu came to power. At issue is the return of
the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Syria has conditioned a restart of the talks on an Israeli
promise to withdraw from all of the Golan. However, Netanyahu has
refused to commit to any surrender of territory to Syria.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A push for OPEC members to stick to
production cuts, designed to lift sagging prices, was expected to
intensify Tuesday as oil ministers arrived from three countries
said to be not fully complying.
	   OPEC's 11 member states will hold a formal year-end meeting
Wednesday facing the lowest prices in nearly 11 years.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
to dlrs 12.33, compared to dlrs 18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   The slump could damage OPEC's economies, often highly dependent
on oil revenues for government financing.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
raising levels of compliance with production cuts introduced in
June; extending the cuts; cutting further; and calling an
exceptional heads of state meeting ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said in
Dubai on Monday.
	   Algeria says OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands. The
United Arab Emirates has supported Algeria's idea of a special
top-level meeting.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6-million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in its latest report in October.
	   However compliance by Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia is lower,
analysts believe. Ministers from all three countries were expected
mid-Tuesday.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million, was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

New Lebanese president takes over in rare peaceful transition

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Emile Lahoud was sworn in Tuesday as
Lebanon's president, pledging to hold politicians accountable and
severely punish thieves in a public service plagued by corruption
and cronyism.
	   ``I do not claim to have a magic wand that fulfills the
(public's) hopes overnight, but I have the intention and the
will,'' he said in a 25-minute speech in Parliament after taking
the oath of office.
	   Lahoud was elected after winning popular backing from Lebanese
hoping that the former army commander would copy his success in
rebuilding the country's military, which was fractured by the
1975-90 civil war.
	   Lahoud's ascension marked an orderly democratic transfer of
power that is unusual in the Arab world, where military leaders and
dictators have ruled many countries for decades.
	   The inauguration of Lebanon's 11th president since independence
from France 55 years ago and the departure of President Elias Hrawi
marked the first smooth transition in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly
three decades. Two Lebanese president have taken over after
assassinations.
	   Repeatedly saying the people have a right to know, the new
president promised a nation demanding the rule of law that there
will be no exceptions.
	   ``I will be under the law,'' Lahoud stressed, adding that people
``want from us, rulers and officials, that we represent them with
respect.''
	   In a sideswipe at the outgoing administration, the 62-year-old
general said people want honest courts and an administration free
of the political and sectarian meddling typical of past
governments.
	   ``It is the people's right, before anything else, that they see
how the decent are rewarded and how a thief's hand is chopped off,
whoever that may be,'' he said in the speech repeatedly interrupted
by applause.
	   Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet
automatically resigns at the end of the presidential term. The
architect of Lebanon's reconstruction program, Hariri was expected
to be named again as prime minister by Lahoud.
	   Lahoud, who won the all-important approval of Lebanon's dominant
neighbor Syria for the nation's highest office, pledged continued
close relations with Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops in
Lebanon.
	   ``The relationship with Syria is that of history, land and
people ... it is a matter of destiny and choice,'' he said.
	   Lahoud, who was elected by Parliament on Oct. 15, said that
Lebanon under his six-year presidency will continue to stick with
Syria in any future negotiations with Israel.
	   Lebanon has rejected Israel's attempts to strike a separate deal
for withdrawal from an occupied zone in the south and insisted on a
withdrawal as well from Syria's Golan Heights.
	   Israel has controlled a border zone in the south since 1985,
saying it was necessary to protect its northern communities from
cross-border guerrilla raids. It captured the Golan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, respects the
power-sharing arrangement based on religion set at independence:
the president is Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and
the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The 128-member Parliament
is divided equally between Muslims and Christians.
	   Lahoud took the oath of office in a Parliament chamber packed
with lawmakers, Cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats and
legislators from the United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile and
Cyprus.
	   Two U.S. congressmen of Lebanese descent, Republican Ray Lahoud
of Illinois and Democrat Nick Rahal of West Virginia, were among
the guests at the ceremony broadcast live on state-run television
and radio.
	   ``This is a new day for Lebanon ... a new era of optimism and
enthusiasm,'' said Rep Lahoud, who is not directly related to the
new president.
	   Despite the criticism from opponents of Syria's dominance of
Lebanon over Lahoud's election with Assad's approval, Tuesday
marked a transformation for Lebanon as it recovers from civil war.
	   When Hrawi became president in 1989 the state was fractured and
battles raged between Christians and Muslims. Today, the country is
rebuilding itself, order has been restored and the armed forces
have re-established state authority.

	   APIA, Samoa (AP) _ Tuilaepa Sailele Maleiolegaoi, who helped
guide Samoa through a series of economic reforms as deputy prime
minister, was sworn in as the country's new leader Tuesday after
Prime Minister Tofilau Eti resigned due to illness.
	   Tuilaepa, a 52-year-old father of six, was deputy leader of the
governing Human Rights Protection Party. His economic reforms and a
restructuring of government gave the long depressed country one of
the region's best growth rates in recent years.
	   Tofilau, who held power for 16 years, said he will remain a
member of Parliament representing his home district.
	   Tofilau appeared in public for the first time in three weeks
Monday after returning from cancer treatment in New Zealand. He
resigned while addressing a session of Parliament broadcast live by
government-owned Radio 2AP.
	   He spoke for about five minutes but was too weak to continue.
	   Tofilau has also had major heart surgery and been hospitalized
in New Zealand several times in recent years. He is the uncle of
American Samoa Gov. Tauese Sunia.
	   Tuilaepa is a former domestic bureaucrat and trade official in
Brussels. He holds a masters of commerce degree from New Zealand's
Auckland University.
	   Tuilaepa entered the Western Samoan Parliament in a by-election
in 1978 and became finance minister in December 1982, a job he held
until 1985.
	   In 1985, the Tofilau government fell after its budget and
several other bills were defeated in Parliament by the coalition
opposition. Tofilau was returned to power in 1988.
	   In Wellington, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
was saddened by Tofilau's resignation.
	   ``Prime Minister Tofilau is one of the most respected and
admired statesmen of the Pacific, and has made a major contribution
to the social and economic advancement of his country,'' she said.
	   ``Over many years, Prime Minister Tofilau exercised inspired
leadership in the interests of the Samoan people.''
	   Samoa, which gained independence from New Zealand in 1962, is
east of the international dateline and 3,700 kilometers (2,300
miles) southwest of Hawaii. The United Nations regards it as one of
the world's least developed countries.

James Joyce fans lamenting demolition of significant house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Fans of James Joyce are fuming about the
razing of a house once home to the Irish writer's family that
figured prominently in his novel ``A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man.''
	   A passage in the book vividly describes the hero Stephen Dedalus
returning to 2 Millbourne Ave. _ one of 17 Dublin houses Joyce
lived in _ to find his family finishing a meager meal that included
``the last of the second watered tea.''
	   The company developing the site, MX Systems, said the house was
demolished because it posed a danger to children playing in the
area. But Dublin city officials maintained that planning permission
for the site did not permit the destruction of houses.
	   Patrick O'Rourke, the head of MX Systems, said he had not been
aware Joyce had lived in the house.
	   ``The roof had collapsed in 1996, and the walls were cracked,''
O'Rourke said. ``It was very dangerous.''
	   Ken Monaghan, one of Joyce's nephews, said he was ``very, very
sad'' to see the house go.
	   ``It would not be possible to keep every home the Joyces lived
in, because they led a very nomadic existence,'' Monaghan said.
``But this house has very strong resonances. The whole scene in
`Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' is very poignant.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With Iraq facing a new crisis with the
United Nations over arms inspections, the government pleaded
Tuesday for help from Arab nations to lift U.N. sanctions on Iraq
and thwart British-American plots.
	   The pleas came in front-page editorials in state-run dailies and
in an article written by a leading adviser to President Saddam
Hussein, who warned that British and U.S. attempt to topple the
Iraq leader could destabilize the Middle East.
	   The newspapers also published the government's views on a failed
assassination attempt Sunday of a top deputy to Saddam _ hinting
Iran was responsible, as it usually does when violence acts are
aimed at Saddam's regime.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, opening a poetry festival
Tuesday in Baghdad, said the United States wanted Iraq to surrender
to its demands but pledged Iraqis would resist.
	   ``America, Zionism (Israel) and other enemies supporting them
would like ... to humiliate Iraq,'' Aziz said.
	   ``Surrendering to their will ... is death itself,'' he added.

Galatasaray furious over UEFA's postponement of Juventus match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ UEFA's postponement of a Champions League
match between Istanbul's Galatasaray and Italy's Juventus outraged
the Turkish underdogs but made them even more determined to win.
	   The European governing body, postponed the game from Wednesday
to Dec. 2 because of anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over Italy's
refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``I strongly condemn the UEFA,'' Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim
said Tuesday. ``This decision has made Galatasaray more
ambitious.''
	   UEFA ordered the postponement despite assurances by the Turkish
government that it would guarantee the safety of Juventus players.
	   ``If Juventus is afraid of Turkey, let's play the game in
Turin,'' Terim said.
	   In its ruling, which came late Monday, UEFA said the match will
be played in same venue, Istanbul.
	   A sports commentator for the daily Hurriyet, Turgay Seren,
accused UEFA of conspiring to help the Italian team, which has
several injured players who might now have time to recover for the
match.
	   ``UEFA: the Italians' lackey,'' headlined the daily Milliyet.
``Dishonest,'' was the daily Foto Mac's verdict on the ruling.
	   The Turkish underdog tops group B with seven points, while
Juventus needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its
chances of qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Italian champions
have reached the cup final three straight years.
	   ``They ruined our concentration but they can't escape from our
hands,'' said Galatasaray star striker Hakan Sukur.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment has been running high in Turkey since
Ocalan was arrested earlier this month at the Rome airport. The
Italian Foreign Ministry has warned Italians to postpone travel to
Turkey as a precaution.
	   Thousands of Turks have taken to the streets over the past week
in anti-Italian demonstrations. A number of businesses are
boycotting Italian products and Italian stations were pulled from
the Turkish cable TV system.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia for capital crimes in Turkey as a
terrorist. He leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
been waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast for
14 years.

U.N. to resume Myanmar refugee returns this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations refugee agency said Tuesday it
will resume repatriations of Myanmar refugees from camps in
Bangladesh this week.
	   Fifty refugees will leave Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh Wednesday to
travel by boat and road to Maungdaw in Myanmar, also Burma, said
Judith Kumin, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   A quarter of a million Myanmar Muslims fled their homeland to go
to Bangladesh in 1991 accusing Myanmar's military of murder, rape
and forced unpaid labor.
	   Most have since then been sent back home under UNHCR
supervision. But many others, living in two camps in Bangladesh,
have refused to return home for fear of persecution.
	   Some 7,000 of the remaining 21,800 refugees are expected to
return in the latest operation, Kumin said. It could take some time
as Myanmar authorities are allowing movements only once a week, she
added.
	   Kumin stressed that only those who want to go will be leaving
and families will not be separated.
	   They will be met by UNHCR staff and will be given household
goods, a cash grant and food.
	   ``The government of Bangladesh has not been ready to accept the
local integration of those who do not want to return home,'' Kumin
added.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. human rights expert on Myanmar has had his
latest request to visit Myanmar refused, according to Jose Diaz,
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   Rajsoomer Lallah ``has been told there is no need for him to
investigate the situation in Myanmar,'' Diaz said.
	   Lallah will instead travel to Thailand to visit sites along the
border. In April, the U.N. human rights commission condemned
Myanmar for widespread rights abuses.

Report: Mossad operations chief resigns over Cyprus affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior official in Israel's famed Mossad
intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of
two agents in Cyprus - the third botched spy mission in a year.
	   The Mossad operations chief, known publicly only as ``Y,''
offered to step down after Cypriot police arrested the two Israelis
and seized electronic monitoring equipment, the daily Haaretz
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the
report.
	   The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is
responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment.
	   The suspects were caught with tapes of Cyprus police
conversations and surveillance devices near an army base on the
Mediterranean island earlier this month.
	   Cyprus has accused the two Israelis of operating with ``a
specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel
Aviv.'' Police on the island said the two were spying on behalf of
Turkey, which has a defense pact with Israel.
	   The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the
two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf
of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
	   ``Y'' had offered his resignation already earlier this year,
after Swiss police arrested five Mossad agents for allegedly spying
in a residential area of Bern, Israel radio said.
	   Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned in February in the
aftermath of a failed attempt to assassinate a leader of the Hamas
Islamic radical group in Jordan, Khalid Mashaal.
	   In a deal with Jordan to get back the two agents caught in the
Mashaal operation, Israel released the Hamas founder and several
other Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners.
	   Haaretz said ``Y'' was not involved in the Mashaal bungle.
	   Top Mossad officials told the daily that the resignation by
``Y'' was wrong since blame should have been put on lower levels.

Habibie approves Japanese plan for subway and major railroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday
approved a Japanese proposal to build a subway in Jakarta and an
electric railroad connecting the Indonesian capital to the eastern
Java city of Surabaya, the head of Indonesia's chamber of commerce
said.
	   The announcement followed a meeting with Habibie along with a
delegation from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, an
influential business lobby known as Keidanren.
	   The chamber's chief, Aburizal Bakrie, said the subway would cost
an estimated dlrs 1.2 billion and the Surabaya railroad would cost
dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Jakarta Gov. Sutiyoso was quoted earlier this year as saying
Japan's Itochu Corp. would build the 14.5-kilometer (9-mile),
17-station subway, which would be completed in 2003.
	   Itochu, together with the Japanese government, promised to fund
the project with a loan at annual interest of 0.75 percent, with an
option to repay over 40 years, Bakrie said.
	   He added that other details of the financing still have to be
hammered out.
	   The proposal for the project, to link the Blok M area in south
Jakarta to downtown Kota in north Jakarta, was submitted by a
consortium of Indonesian, Japanese and German companies called the
Indonesian-Japan-European Group in early 1995.
	   A cooperation agreement on the project between the Jakarta
administration and group was signed in August 1995.
	   The project, expected to help ease traffic congestion in the
capital, originally was to start in April last year but was delayed
until the following June. It was then delayed again after Indonesia
spiraled into its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   When fully operational, the subway is expected to carry at least
290,000 passengers a day.

 &UR; Following Dow's lead, Asian stocks soar, but Europe is less
impressed &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European figures, changes overline, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's resurrection galvanized Asian
markets Tuesday, but Europe reacted coolly and stock gains were
modest as dealers waited for the Dow Jones industrial average to
consolidate recent gains.
	   In London, shares fell in thin trading. At mid-morning, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index of blue-chip stocks was
trading at 5,797.9 points, down 50.5 points, or 0.9 percent.
	   ``The market's had such a strong run, we may be in for a more
reflective period,'' said Bob Semple, an equity strategist at BT
Alex Brown.
	   The London market ``isn't going to collapse unless we get
something very grim, but at the same time, it's not looking at
all-time highs as the Dow is,'' Semple said.
	   German financial shares rose as the Deutsche Bank AG said it was
discussing the final details of a dlrs 9 billion deal to take over
Bankers Trust Corp., and Internet shares led the technology group
higher as America Online Inc. said it might buy Netscape
Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4 billion deal.
	   That deal also helped boost French shares and, at midday, the
CAC Index of 40 leading stocks was up 18 points, at 3,863.81.
	   Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply Tuesday after the
Dow Jones industrial average surged to a new high in New York a day
earlier, capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from last summer's
plunge.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared 384.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to
15,164.64 Tuesday. It was the first time the index had finished
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug.
25.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rallied to a nearly
seven-month high. It closed at 10,851.71, up 337.18 points, or 3.2
percent, following a 2.7 percent gain Monday.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index broke through
the important 1,400-point plateau, rising 35.96 points, or 2.6
percent, to 1,412.90. Earlier in the day, it had risen even higher
to 1,421.56.
	   Extending a nearly non-stop rally that began less than two
months ago, the Dow average rose 214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping
the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The return to record terrain followed four months of volatility
that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to 7,467 on Oct.
8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil and its spread around the world would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the
region's financial crisis struck about 17 months ago.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng alone has gained 58 percent.
	   But some analysts warned that volatility and profit-taking
remain significant risks.
	   That was illustrated in Madrid, where Spanish shares fell back
after sharp rises as dealers took profits.
	   At 1100 GMT, the IBEX-35 index of Spain's most liquid shares was
up 12.30 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9, 454.20. Earlier in the
session it had risen past 9,600 points.

Jordan to offer first Christian classes in public schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will offer Christian education in
government schools for the first time from December 1, a Christian
leader said Tuesday.
	   The Christian Bishops Council and the Education Ministry reached
agreement for compulsory classes on Christianity for the 3,000
Christian students in government schools, said Father Hanna
Jallouf, coordinator for the Bishops Council.
	   The classes will be taught three times a week in seven districts
with concentrations of Christians, said Jallouf. Christians form 8
percent of Jordan's 4.2 million population.
	   Government schools already offer religious education for
Muslims, who make up the majority of the country's people.
	   Jallouf said the Christian classes will be modeled on a program
in Syria, which also has a minority Christian population.
	   Books for the classes will be distributed free to students and
the religion teachers will be paid by the Ministry of Education,
Jallouf said.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With Iraq facing a new crisis over U.N.
arms inspections, the government pleaded Tuesday with Arab nations
to help lift U.N. sanctions and thwart British-American attempts to
topple President Saddam Hussein. The pleas came in front-page
editorials in state-run dailies and in an article written by one of
Saddam's leading advisers, who warned that British and U.S.
attempts to dislodge the Iraqi leader could destabilize the Middle
East. The newspapers also hinted that Iran was responsible for a
failed assassination attempt Sunday of a top deputy to Saddam. Iraq
usually blames Iran for violent acts aimed at Saddam's regime. The
latest crisis was prompted by U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler's demand for more documents on Iraqi arms programs. (IRAQ)
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A slain Russian lawmaker was
honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic ideals in a stately
funeral service in which anger mingled freely with tears.
Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside some of
Russia's greatest national heroes. The stirring tribute to
Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, was
indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death.
Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most prominent
political figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's
Ethnography Museum for the funeral. Outside, several thousand more
mourners stood in the cold, waiting for the service to end so they
could file in and pay their respects. Starovoitova was shot to
death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled the stairs to her
apartment in St. Petersburg. (RUSSIA-SLAIN LAWMAKER)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ One Lebanese president left office and
another was sworn in Tuesday, marking the first smooth transition
in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly three decades. Emile Lahoud,
Lebanon's 11th president since independence from France 55 years
ago, was inaugurated after Elias Hrawi's nine-year extended term
expired at midnight Monday. The last two presidents took over after
assassinations. With a copy of Lebanon's Constitution in his left
hand, Lahoud took the oath of office before a chamber packed with
lawmakers, Cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats and foreign
legislators. Lahoud was elected by Parliament on Oct. 15 after
winning popular support and the approval of President Hafez Assad
of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. (LEBANON-PRESIDENT)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student demonstrators
demanded the ouster of Indonesia's military chief Tuesday, and the
military said 163 soldiers involved in deadly clashes had been
confined to barracks for three weeks. At least nine student
protesters were killed during clashes with soldiers on Nov. 13.
Although military chief Gen. Wiranto had ordered riot officers to
carry only blanks and plastic bullets, hospital doctors said they
found metal bullet fragments in some victims. Facing a public
outcry, the military said 163 soldiers involved in the clashes with
student protesters had been confined to barracks and could face
court-martial. Riots and protests forced Suharto to resign in May
after 32 years of authoritarian rule. His successor and former
protege, President B.J. Habibie, has promised democratic reforms,
but student activists say he is not serious about political change.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A noisy, colorful election campaign for
crucial state elections is over in India, and authorities are
girding for their next challenge: Preventing violence at 100,000
balloting stations. Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the
Congress Party over the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
because of widespread discontent with the soaring prices of
vegetables. The BJP, which also heads the federal government,
governs two of the four states, and Congress rules two. Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said at a rally Monday the election
will not affect his 19-party coalition, although most analysts see
the vote as the first test of popularity for the BJP-led government
since it came to office in April. More than 80 million voters are
eligible to choose 626 state legislators from among 5,000
candidates Wednesday in four of India's 26 states. Elections
frequently turn violent in India. (INDIA-POLITICS)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply
Tuesday, hours after Wall Street completed its resurrection from
last summer's steep decline. But that didn't leave everyone
optimistic. Some analysts said that even though stock markets in
the United States and Asia were enjoying rebounds, volatility and
profit-taking remain significant risks. In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared
384.70 points to 15,164.64, the first time the index had finished
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug.
25. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at
10,851.71, up 337.18 points. And in Singapore, the benchmark
Straits Times Index broke through the important 1,400-point
plateau, rising 35.96 points to 1,412.90. Elsewhere, shares also
rose in Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, New Zealand,
Australia and South Korea. Share prices closed generally higher in
Indonesia, but profit-taking in some blue-chip stocks dragged the
key index lower. Thai share prices closed lower on profit-taking.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. steel industry won another battle
against cheap foreign imports as the Commerce Department ruled that
Japan and Russia might face additional duties. The Commerce
Department on Monday found that imports doubled over five months as
domestic producers were preparing their case to fight the
shipments, making importers potentially liable for an additional 90
days of retroactive payments for any future finding of dumping.
Although the United States has yet to impose any duties in the
pending case, a lawyer for domestic steel producers said the latest
preliminary ruling would help deter imports immediately. (US-STEEL

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A push for OPEC members to stick to
production cuts, designed to lift sagging prices, was expected to
intensify Tuesday as oil ministers arrived from three countries
said to be not fully complying. OPEC's 11 member states will hold a
formal year-end meeting Wednesday facing the lowest prices in
nearly 11 years. OPEC's average price per barrel in the third
quarter has slumped to dlrs 12.33, compared to dlrs 18.03 in the
third quarter of 1997. The slump could damage OPEC's economies,
often highly dependent on oil revenues for government financing.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is unable to create enough jobs to absorb
growing numbers of laid-off workers and new entrants to the work
force next year, according to a researcher at a government
think-tank quoted in a state-run newspaper Tuesday. ``China's
unemployment picture for 1999 will be even more grim than this
year's,'' the Economic Information Daily quoted Yang Yiyong,
director of the State Development Planning Commission's Economic
Research Institute, as saying. Reforms of state-owned enterprises
are expected to leave about 3 million workers jobless next year.
Another 1.67 million civil-service workers are likely to be laid
off in local and central government restructuring, and about 1.33
million workers will be laid off from non-profit institutions, Yang
said. (CHINA-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economic planners on Tuesday
dismissed concerns over the burden of deep wage cuts, saying the
country will adopt a multibillion-dollar business cost-cutting
package that slashes workers' pay. The government strongly endorsed
wage-related cuts equaling about 15 percent of a workers' total
income, including salaries, bonuses and pension payments. The wage
reductions will take effect Jan. 1, and are worth an estimated 7
billion to 8 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.3 billion to dlrs
4.9 billion). They form the basis of an overall cost-cutting
package worth 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.4 billion)
that also includes government cutbacks. (SINGAPORE-WAGE CUTS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ending months of speculation, Hong
Kong-based holding company First Pacific Co. said Tuesday it has
acquired a 27.4 percent stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., giving it management control of the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company. First Pacific hailed the acquisition as
a milestone in its efforts to shape itself into an owner of a
``select number of high-quality, larger businesses'' in Asia, and
stressed the investment was a long-term one. (PHILIPPINES-PLDT)

	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels on Tuesday
freed a kidnapped Serb policeman after U.S. diplomatic observers
intervened to persuade them to let him go.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was still believed to be holding two
ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along with the policeman
last Wednesday and are considered sympathetic to Serb authorities.
	   The KLA is accused of attacking or kidnapping numerous Serb
policemen, civilians and ethnic Albanians believed loyal to the
Serbian regime since last month's agreement aimed at ending
hostilities in the restive province of southern Serbia.
	   The pre-arranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran Zvilic
took place Tuesday morning near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial
capital Pristina.

Iranian official condemns attack on bus carrying American tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official condemned the attack on
a bus carrying American tourists, saying visitors to Iran were
entitled to protection.
	   ``This kind of behavior is unacceptable to the government,''
Tuesday's Iran News quoted Iranian Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa
Tajzadeh as saying.
	   Radicals chanting ``Death to America'' used stones and metal
bars on Saturday to smash the windows of a bus carrying a group of
13 foreigners, predominantly Americans, after hardline newspapers
accused them of being spies. The group left the country early
Sunday.
	   ``Any person who has entered the country legally is entitled to
protection,'' Tajzadeh was quoted as saying.
	   On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington denied any of the
visiting Americans were government officials or had links to the
CIA.
	   Tajzadeh also condemned the murder earlier this week of an
Iranian opposition figure and his wife.
	   ``The government is obliged to provide security for all the
country's citizens. The lives of the people must be protected, even
if they are our opponents,'' the paper quoted Tajzadeh as saying.
	   Dariush Foruhar and his wife were found stabbed to death at
their Tehran home Sunday. Foruhar was the leader of the People's
Party of Iran, a small opposition group that is tolerated by the
government.
	   President Mohammad Khatami on Tuesday asked the Interior
Ministry to form a committee to look into Foruhar's death and bring
his killers to justice, Iranian radio reported.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group largely dormant since
Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, claimed responsibility for the bus
attack in a statement Monday.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' its statement said, apparently
referring to Khatami's call for cultural exchanges between
Americans and Iranians.

U.N. rights envoy urges labor reform in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A United Nations human rights envoy on
Tuesday lauded reform efforts in Nigeria, but urged the military
government to do more to protect labor unions and workers.
	   ``We are so far happy with the steps taken regarding human
rights,'' said United Nations Rapporteur Solil Sorabjee. ``But
since the government is moving towards full democracy, it is very
necessary that all laws impeding the quick dispensation of justice
and the rights of labor be removed with immediate effect.''
	   Sorabjee said Nigeria should repeal several decrees that in
effect strip labor unions of any real power. He made the comments
after meeting on Monday with Labor Minister Emmanuel Udogu.
	   Sorabjee was referring specifically to three decrees introduced
in 1988 by then military ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. All three
restrict the activities of trade unions and extend authority to the
government to dissolve unions.
	   Sorabjee said he will raise the issue when he meets with the
country's new military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Earlier, Sorabjee met with the Minister of the Federal Capital
Authority, Maj. Gen. Mamman Kontagora to express his satisfaction
with steps taken to improve the human rights situation in Nigeria.
	   ``There have been several changes in your country which portray
a good signal for the future of the country,'' he told Kontagora.
	   During his trip to Nigeria, Sorabjee was scheduled to visit the
commercial capital of Lagos, the Niger River delta hub city of Port
Harcourt and the northern city of Kano.
	   Abubakar has assured Sorabjee free access to meet with
individuals throughout Nigeria.
	   Former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, ruled Nigeria with an iron
fist for five years until his death in June. Abubakar has been
trying to introduce reform and has vowed to hand power over to a
civilian government next year.
	   Last week, Abubakar said he would repeal another military decree
that allows the police to detain people for up to six months
without being charged or appearing in a court.

Brazilian world record-holder enters London Marathon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa, who ran the fastest
marathon in history this year, has entered next year's London
Marathon.
	   Da Costa clocked a world best of 2 hours, 6 minutes, five
seconds, at the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 20. That surpassed the
previous record of 2:06:50, set by Ethiopia's Belayneh Densimo at
Rotterdam in 1988.
	   ``After his run in Berlin, Ronaldo has to be the most sought
after and exciting runner in the world of distance running,''
London Marthon director David Bedford said Tuesday.
	   The field for the April 18 race will also include 1996 Olympic
champion Josia Thugwane of South Africa and 1996 Olympic silver
mealist Lee Bong-Ju of South Korea.
	   ``With the world's fastest man, the Olympic champion and Olympic
silver medalist, we're confident we will have the strongest London
Marathon ever,'' Bedford said.
	   Also entered is two-time London champion Antonio Pinto of Spain,
winner in 1992 and 1997.

Singapore government dismisses concerns, adopts deep wage cuts

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economic planners on Tuesday
dismissed concerns over the burden of deep wage cuts, saying the
country will adopt a multibillion-dollar business cost-cutting
package that slashes workers' pay.
	   The government strongly endorsed wage-related cuts equaling at
least 15 percent of a worker's total income, including salaries,
bonuses and pension payments.
	   The wage reductions will take effect Jan. 1, and are worth an
estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.6 billion) per
year.
	   They form the basis of an overall revitalization package worth
10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.4 billion) _ or 7 percent of
the entire gross domestic product _ that also includes government
cutbacks.
	   ``Singapore is facing its gravest challenge since
independence,'' Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said before
confirming the painful wage cuts. He said the country has been
drawn into the regional crisis, and must take decisive action to
reclaim its business competitiveness.
	   ``The proposal is to reduce wage costs significantly'' as part
of short-term measures to help companies survive the crisis and
preserve jobs, Lee said.
	   In addition to a cut in company contributions to the mandatory,
state-run pension fund from 20 percent to 10 percent of a worker's
salary, Singaporeans also will face a 5 to 8 percent reduction in
their take-home pay.
	   The reductions ``will cause a drop in the standard of living
that Singaporeans have become used to'' but they ``cannot be
avoided, because it is through this sacrifice that we will reduce
our costs and strengthen our competitiveness,'' Lee said.
	   He argued that the cuts will not only help Singapore regain lost
competitiveness and steer the country through its economic
downturn, but lay the foundations for sustained growth in the
future.
	   Debate over the revitalization package has focused on the extent
of the burden placed on workers.
	   Community and business leaders have questioned why average
Singaporeans must shoulder so much of the cost-cutting, and many
members of Parliament have urged the government to share the burden
by offering deeper tax cuts and other lower charges.
	   But the 84-seat Parliament, dominated by the ruling People's
Action Party and with only three opposition members, is widely
expected to adopt the government recommendations as they currently
stand during Wednesday's session.
	   Lee said it was ``not possible'' to match the wage cuts
dollar-for-dollar with reduced government taxes, levies and other
charges.
	   However, civil servants and government ministers will be the
first to feel the bite of lower pay, he said.
	   He urged employers to ``moderate the wage cut for lower income
employees by implementing a proportionately deeper cut for the
higher income executives.''
	   Although that may be little comfort for many Singaporans, Lee
did offer some other concessions, including an increased tax
rebate, help for homeowners who have trouble meeting their mortgage
obligations, cheaper public transport and lower hospital fees.
	   Corporations will also enjoy a 10 percent tax rebate on 1998
income, while a current commercial and industrial property tax
rebate will be extended for another year.
	   Lee ruled out a reduced goods and services tax, adding that the
government would stem lost retail business from Singaporeans'
shopping day-trips to neighboring countries by lowering their
tax-free allowance immediately.
	   The foreign worker levy will be lowered for both skilled and
unskilled laborers, and government land rentals will drop
significantly.
	   Customs duties on cars and excise duties on fuel will be eased
immediately, while port dues will be slashed 20 percent in addition
to other lower handling charges in 1999.
	   Telecommunications and utilities charges will also fall in the
new year.

Philippines bans conversion of mangroves into fish and prawn farms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine environment secretary
said Tuesday he has banned the conversion of mangrove swamps into
fish farms and prawn farms to halt environmental damage.
	   Secretary Antonio Cerilles said the continued granting of
permits to convert mangrove forests into commercial fish and prawn
farms has resulted in the depletion of the country's mangroves.
	   Mangrove swamps are ecologically important because they are home
for young fish and shrimp. The roots of mangrove trees also are
effective in slowing the erosion of coast lands and act as a water
purifier.
	   Philippine environment officials estimate that about 3,000
hectares (7,410 acres) of Philippine mangroves are destroyed
annually.
	   In 1918, the Philippines had an estimated 500,000 hectares (1.2
million acres) of mangrove forests. In 1994, mangroves had declined
to 74,268 hectares (183,441 acres).
	   Cerilles said he has issued directives to all environment
offices to report to him the condition of the country's remaining
mangrove forests. He said damaged mangroves will be rehabilitated.

Russia's talks with IMF for more loans bring no progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is still critical
of the Russian government's plans to tackle the country's economic
crisis and is reluctant to release more loans, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has been pushing the
IMF to release the next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion
aid package, saying it is crucial to pay off huge domestic and
foreign debts.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse following government default on loans in August and
devaluation of the currency.
	   The IMF team wrapped up a week of talks Tuesday after meeting
with senior Cabinet officials and studying the government's 1999
budget estimates.
	   ``The talks aren't over yet and no agreements have been
reached,'' said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who met
with the IMF mission on Wednesday. ``They are studying us and we,
them.''
	   The IMF is expected to come back to Moscow for more talks later
this year.
	   Maslyukov voiced hope that the talks will be successful, but
said that the Fund remained dissatisfied with the budget plan and
specifically urged the government to boost tax collection. ``We
agree with that, but we can't go beyond the limits of what is
possible,'' he told reporters.
	   The IMF disapproved of the government's plan to support ailing
industries and insisted that state regulation of the economy should
be minimal.
	   The IMF believes that the ``the state intervention only brings
harm, while the Russian Cabinet thinks that it should control the
process,'' Maslyukov said, according to the Russian news reports.
	   To the IMF, the government's plan contains elements that are
``at odds with the free market,'' said Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin, who took part in the talks.
	   He said IMF experts also criticized the government's 1999 budget
as not austere enough and its revenue forecast as overly
optimistic.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
strict economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for next
year as the main condition for more loans.
	   Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the population
were living below the official poverty line of 644 rubles (just
under dlrs 40), compared to 31 million (21 percent) a year ago.
	   Maslyukov said that Russia was also urging the IMF and other
creditors to reschedule its foreign debt, which will require dlrs
17.5 billion to service next year. ``We view the outcome of such
talks with optimism,'' Maslyukov said.
	   Last week, Russia officially asked its creditors to reschedule
its debt, Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said in a interview
published in the liberal daily Vremya on Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the government has already included prospective IMF
credits in next year's budget and deducted from it debt payments it
hopes to reschedule _ an approach that drew the IMF's complaints,
Vyugin said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Signaling an end to six centuries of tradition,
Queen Elizabeth II opened Parliament on Tuesday by announcing a
Labor Party government bill to strip hereditary peers of their
right to vote.
	   Elected lawmakers crowded at the back of the chamber while the
queen, wearing the Imperial State Crown and long white dress, read
out to the ranks of peers dressed in scarlet robes with ermine
collars a 22-bill legislative program that included the political
demise of the bluebloods.
	   ``A bill will be introduced to remove the right of hereditary
peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords,'' the queen said,
reading in even tones the 20-minute speech written by Prime
Minister Tony Blair's government.
	   ``It will be the first stage of a process of reform to make the
House of Lords more democratic and representative.'' she added.
	   The legislative program _ the second since Labor swept the
long-ruling Conservative Party from office 19 months ago _ also
included a shakeup of welfare benefits designed to make things
tougher for the work-shy, a reform of legal funding and greater
protection for rape victims.
	   The 72-year-old queen arrived at Parliament amid almost all the
traditional glittering pageantry, including gliding in with her
husband, Prince Philip, in a horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham
Palace.
	   The carriage was escorted by mounted members of the Household
Cavalry, a regiment of helmeted riders with magnificent horses that
has long ceremonially guarded the monarch.
	   This time, because of Labor unease, however, a bit of the pomp
and ceremony was missing.
	   The Lord Chancellor, the chief judicial officer, turned and
walked away from the queen after handing her the speech instead of
shuffling backwards.
	   And a few of the officials with quaint titles were missing _
Silver-Stick-in-Waiting, the commander of the Household Cavalry;
Portcullis Pursuivant and nine other genealogists from the College
of Arms; and one of the queen's two ladies-in-waiting.
	   Stripping the hereditary peers, some with centuries-old titles
granted to descendants of monarchs' mistresses, was the measure set
to attract most public comment.
	   Blair's aides, however, tried to focus attention on welfare
shakeup, and changes in the state health and education system.
	   Confrontations between the government and the Lords _ where the
Conservatives have a built-in majority _ have increased since Labor
came to power. The Lords, who can delay legislation for up to a
year, have defeated 38 government bills, most recently five times
refusing to endorse changes in the voting system for the European
Parliament.
	   Critics charge that by removing the 759 hereditary peers, Blair
is simply leaving the chamber reduced to some 500 lifetime peers,
many elderly retired politicians given titles by their parties,
without announcing an alternative arrangement.
	   The government says it will appoint a commission to come up with
ideas.
	   Conservative Party spokesman Michael Ancram on Tuesday accused
Labor of ``constitutional vandalism.''
	   ``There is a certain nostalgia,'' Lord Walpole, holder of a
title created in 1723, said before the opening. ``I have enjoyed
every moment and I hope I have contributed.''

Commonwealth to monitor Nigerian elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commonwealth officials will monitor Nigeria's
local government elections on Dec. 5, the first phase of the West
African nation's return to democratic rule.
	   K. Srinivasan, deputy secretary-general of the club of Britain
and its former colonies will lead a team of 17 Commonwealth
monitors, most of whom will arrived in Nigeria on Nov. 30, the
Commonwealth Secretariat said in a statement Tuesday.
	   An advance party of three Secretariat officials was expected in
the capital, Lagos, on Tuesday. They will meet officials from the
Independent National Electoral Commission and complete arrangements
for the rest of the team.
	   Commission chairman, judge Ephraim Akpata, invited the
Commonwealth to observe all stages of the electoral process.
	   State gubernatorial elections will be held in January.
Parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for
February, creating Nigeria's first civilian government in 18 years.

Duncan Ferguson joins Newcastle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ferguson signing 5 1/2-year contract; quote from
chief executive

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Ruud Gullit moved to bolster his
struggling Newcastle side Tuesday by landing Everton striker Duncan
Ferguson in a 7-million-pound (dlrs 11.2 million) deal.
	   The transfer was announced the morning after Everton beat
Newcastle 1-0 at Goodison Park.
	   The 26-year-old former Scottish international, who signed a 5
1/2-year contract, is set to team up front with England captain
Alan Shearer in a 22-million-pound (dlrs 35.2 million) strike
force.
	   Ferguson, a folk hero at Everton, is Gullit's first major
signing since he took over at Newcastle following the firing of
Kenny Dalglish.
	   Gullit hopes the Ferguson-Shearer tandem will provide the
firepower the Magpies have been lacking all season.
	   Everton manager Walter Smith sold his club's most talented and
popular player in order to raise money to bring in fresh talent.
	   Ironically, it was Smith who sold Ferguson to Everton while he
was manager of Glasgow Rangers.
	   Ferguson's arrival fueled speculation about Shearer's future at
Newcastle. But chief executive Freddie Fletcher dismissed reports
that Shearer was unhappy and poised to leave.
	   ``The board have signed Duncan Ferguson to partner him with Alan
Shearer up front,'' he said. ``The object of the exercize is to
have two really class strikers playing up front for Newcastle
United.''
	   Gullit insisted after Monday night's defeat that he didn't want
Shearer to leave. But he said he wouldn't stand in Shearer's way if
he wanted to go.
	   ``It depends on him, not on me,'' Gullit said. ``Every player
needs to be happy where he is. If he is unhappy, then what's the
point? I would like to hear from him if he is not happy. If he is
happy, then he will stay.''
	   Both Shearer and Ferguson missed Monday night's game with
injuries.
	   Newcastle lies 14th in the Premier League table, with Everton
16th.
	   Ferguson, who started his career at Dundee United in 1990,
joined Rangers in 1993 in a then British record 4 million pound
(dlrs 6.4 million) deal.
	   Ferguson received a three-month jail sentence after being
convicted of assault for head-butting John McStay in a 1995 game
against Raith. He eventually served six weeks in prison.
	   Ferguson, who played five times for Scotland, quit the national
side over what he considered unfair treatment in the McStay
incident.

Indonesian students press their demands in the streets again

Suharto's home, graf 23 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief predicted
Tuesday that student protests against the government would persist
until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999.
	   In the streets, thousands of students demanded his ouster and a
corruption trial for former President Suharto.
	   Current President B.J. Habibie, meanwhile, said continuing
turmoil has slowed efforts to revive Indonesia's sick economy even
though the battered rupiah has climbed in value in recent weeks.
	   Many foreign investors are wary of investing in the politically
fragile nation, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   ``We have witnessed the strengthening of the rupiah, which gives
hope for our economic recovery,'' Habibie said at the opening of
the national Boy Scouts' convention. ``But unfortunately this
progress has been countered by social and political unrest.''
	   Habibie has pledged to revamp the rigid political system left
behind by his authoritarian predecessor and former mentor, Suharto.
	   Suharto was ousted by riots and protests in May after three
decades in power, but students suspect his replacement is not
serious about democratic change.
	   Armed forces commander Wiranto said student protesters would
continue to push their demands, which also include the ouster of
Habibie and an end to the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement. ... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   Facing a public outcry, the military said 163 soldiers involved
in deadly clashes Nov. 13 with student protesters had been confined
to barracks for three weeks and could face court-martial.
	   At least nine student protesters, who were pressing for swift
democratic reforms, died in the fighting.
	   Although Wiranto had ordered riot officers to carry only blanks
and plastic bullets, hospital doctors said they found metal bullet
fragments in some of the victims.
	   The clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta, and a
total of 16 people died.
	   On Tuesday, students staged at least four major protests in the
capital. There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Hundreds of security personnel blocked about 1,000 students from
several colleges from marching along a toll road and on to the
Parliament.
	   Wearing yellow jackets, about 300 students from the prestigious
University of Indonesia earlier marched near the presidential
palace, urging that Wiranto take responsibility for the killings.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' they chanted.
	   Separately, more than 1,000 students entered the compound of the
office of Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to demand a trial
of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   ``First Suharto has to be put on trial. Then it's the turn of
the other cronies. If not, we'll protest all the time,'' said
Samsuddin, an engineering student.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby as student representatives held talks with Ghalib.
	   He refused to accept their demands that Suharto be put on trial
within one month.
	   Later, about 250 students were stopped from marching on
Suharto's heavily guarded home in an exclusive suburb.
	   The Nov. 13 clashes have further tarnished the image of the
military, which is facing criticism for human rights abuses
committed during the Suharto era.
	   Wiranto said the soldiers who were disciplined include 144 who
fired at protesters without permission, 12 who beat demonstrators
and news photographers, and seven officers who failed to control
their men.
	   Violence also erupted in the Indonesian capital Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.

Train service returning to normal after European strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES France-Train Strikes, ADDS reports from other
European countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train service was returning to normal across Europe
Tuesday after a massive one-day strike by rail workers in six
countries brought traffic to a standstill in parts of Europe for
over 24 hours.
	   The French national train company, the SNCF, said traffic was
running smoothly Tuesday throughout most of the country. Some local
routes in central and eastern France, however, were still reporting
delays. Belgian train service was also back to normal.
	   In Greece, Hellenic Railways said trains were running normally,
but that some delays were reported because bad weather has damaged
some stretches of track.
	   In Spain and Portugal, where the strike had little impact,
national rail companies also said traffic was running without
delays.
	   European rail unions, fearing job losses, called the one-day
strike Monday in France, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Portugal and
Luxembourg to protest EU plans to open state-owned railways to
private operators.
	   The EU said the proposed changes, which are not set to go into
effect immediately, would be limited to the freight sector.
	   Meanwhile, the end to the European strike brought only temporary
relief for French travelers.
	   French train workers have called a nationwide strike for Friday,
saying they lack sufficient staff. Disruptions in train service are
expected to begin Thursday evening.

France issues second arrest warrant for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Tuesday issued a second
international arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, judicial sources said.
	   Like the first French warrant issued Nov. 2, the new arrest
order accuses Pinochet of sequestration followed by torture in the
disappearance of French citizens who vanished after the coup d'etat
that ousted Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 while in a London hospital
recuperating from back surgery on a Spanish arrest warrant.
	   Britain's highest court is to announce Nov. 25 whether Pinochet
has immunity from arrest and can leave Britain. Spanish authorities
want to extradite Pinochet to face charges of genocide during his
1973-90 rule.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of security forces after Pinochet
overthrew Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   France on Nov. 12 also asked for Pinochet's extradition.
	   The new French warrant concerns two French citizens, including
Georges Klein, Allende's personal doctor. The order brings the
number of French people covered by arrest orders to five.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The U.S. consulate in the Far East city of
Vladivostok denied Tuesday press reports that the U.S. consul
general was charged with injuring a pedestrian in a car accident.
	   Russian media had reported that Consul General Douglas Kent was
in a car accident Oct. 27 and that traffic police charged him with
violating traffic safety and causing injury to a pedestrian.
	   Consulate spokeswoman Susan Krause said no pedestrians were
involved in the incident and that the man who was injured was a
passenger in another car. She said traffic police were
investigating the incident.

	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Ijaz Ahmed's explosive century and a
three-wicket burst by off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq helped Pakistan
trounce Zimbabwe by 111 runs Tuesday to clinch the three-match
series 2-1.
	   Mushtaq ran through Zimbabwe's middle-order to dismiss the
tourists for 191 in 37.2 overs.
	   ``We didn't apply ourselves and kept losing wickets. Pakistan
deserved to win especially after Ijaz Ahmed's brilliant century
which gave them a very big total,'' said Zimbabwe captain Alistair
Campbell.
	   Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail praised his team for a splendid
performance.
	   ``It was a brilliant team effort. Saqlain got us the key wickets
and earlier Ijaz played superbly,'' he said.
	   Andy Flower, playing in his 100th International, made a fighting
61 off 94 balls but the visitors lost wickets at regular intervals.
	   Murray Goodwin (29) and Flower were involved in a 55-run
partnership for the third wicket off 64 balls before Mushtaq
chipped in with three wickets in 21 deliveries and put the game
beyond Zimbabweans reach. Mushtaq finished with three wickets in
just 27 runs.
	   Captain Alistair Campbell (3) dragged Mushtaq's delivery back
onto his stumps, while Craig Wishart's (6) leg stumps was uprooted
by the off-spinner.
	   Gavin Rennie scored only five runs before he was out.
	   Waqar Younis, back on the team after an extensive leave due to
an elbow injury, removed Grant Flower (11) in the fourth over. Neil
Johnson survived only 17 balls.
	   Veteran of 215 Internationals Ahmed, who was sidelined briefly
with influenza, played an enterprising innings of 132 off 103 balls
before he was out on the last ball of the 50th over.
	   ``I was only 70 percent fit before the match. But the team
needed me as the series was leveled,'' said Ahmed after being named
Man of the Match.
	   He hit nine fours and four big sixes.
	   After being put in to bat, Pakistani openers Saeed Anwar (73)
and Aamir Sohail made quick 77 off 88 balls for the first wicket.
Anwar brought up his 27th half century in 161st one-dayer off just
39 balls but was run out in the 21st over when Ahmed refused to
take a quick single off an accurate Gavin Rennie's throw from
point.
	   Anwar hit nine fours and a six off Eddo Brandes in his 63-ball
innings of 73.
	   The right-handed 30-year-old Ahmed was then involved in a
productive 97-run third wicket stand with Inzamamul Haq off 117
deliveries. He cut lose in the last ten overs and Pakistan made 82
runs, with a quick 20 from Wasim Akram.
	   Both teams will now travel to Peshawar where the three-Test
series begins on Friday.

Premier vows public relations offensive to win backing for IMF
</HEADLINE>
laws &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai vowed a
public relations offensive Tuesday to win backing for laws required
by the IMF bailout of Thailand but likely to run into opposition in
Parliament.
	   Chuan told a news conference after the weekly Cabinet meeting
that he will press ahead with the legislative commitments of the
dlrs 17.2 billion program, which his government hopes will lead to
an economic turnaround next year.
	   Chuan said that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaekminda is
working on the final draft of a letter of intent to govern the
sixth quarter of the program. The Cabinet will consider it next
week. Chuan refused to disclose details.
	   Chuan said he has asked Cabinet members to explain to the public
the need for key economic legislation, which the government must
pass under the IMF program.
	   Among legislation to be thrashed out between the elected House
of Representatives and the appointed Senate are amendments to the
bankruptcy and foreclosure acts, and the establishment of a
bankruptcy court.
	   Nationalist and vested interests are contesting amendments of
various acts to allow ownership of small plots of residential land
by foreign direct investors, 100 percent foreign ownership of units
in condominium projects, and 50-year renewable leases of commercial
land by foreigners, up from 30 years.
	   Financial analysts see the reforms as necessary to return to
growth for next year.
	   Analysts expect the central bank to act, possibly under
provisions to be included in the new IMF agreement, to force or
entice banks into a recapitalization assistance program announced
Aug. 14.
	   To restore credit and growth, major research houses have singled
out bank recapitalization as essential _ along with the bankruptcy
and foreclosure amendments, and talks between creditors and Thai
companies under a government-sponsored debt restructuring process.
	   Key lending, deposit and money market interest rates have
plummeted since monetary policy was eased in June, but banks have
not expanded lending for fear of increasing loan-loss reserve
requirements.
	   Non-performing loans account for more than 40 percent of total
bank loans and more than 60 percent of total finance company loans.

Sainz on course for third world title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; WILL UPDATE and the end of final stage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Sainz looked set to
capture his third world rally title Tuesday, moving into third
place on the final day of Britain's Network Q Rally after Alister
McRae crashed in the day's first stage.
	   Sainz, who won the world championship in 1990 and again in '92,
needs to finish in fourth place or better to claim the title.
	   The Madrid native entered the season's final rally trailing
Tommi Makinen by two points in the season standings. But the Finn _
bidding for a record third consecutive world title _ slid out of
the race on Sunday when he skidded on a patch of oil and hit a
concrete pillar.
	   After four stages Tuesday, with three remaining to complete the
final rally of the season, Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi held a 3
minute, 13.8 second advantage on Juha Kankkunen's Ford.
	   Sainz in a Toyota was 4:37.7 behind Burns with Bruno Thiry's
Ford in fourth, 4:43.9 behind the leader.
	   Gregoire De Mevius held fifth in a Subaru, trailing by 7:02.4.
	   McRae, in second place behind Burns at the time of the crash,
joined his brother Colin McRae on the sidelines. Colin McRae went
out with mechanical problems Monday while leading the race.
	   Barring a major accident or mistake, Sainz was expected to
navigate the final three stages without problems, although heavy
rain and frigid temperatures in southern Wales were making the
gravel roads difficult to negotiate.
	   Alister McRae lost his chance when he went off the road 1.5
miles (2.5 kilometers) from the end of the first stage Tuesday _
the 22nd of the three-day rally.
	   Neither McRae nor his co-driver David Senior were injured in the
accident and gave a thumbs-up to Sainz and co-pilot Carlos Moya as
they drove past.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand pole vaulter Denis
Petouchinski returned a positive test to the banned anabolic
steroid Stanozolol at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, the
New Zealand Olympic Committee said Tuesday.
	   The committee said that Petouchinski's case was to have been
heard on Wednesday in London but at Petouchinski's request the
hearing would now take place on Dec. 10.
	   Petouchinski, who won silver in the pole vault in the September
Games, could be stripped of his medal and face a two-year ban.
Stanozolol is the same substance that resulted in Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson being thrown out of the Seoul Olympics after a positive
test. (djp)

	   KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park
will limit the number of day-trippers during the holiday season to
prevent crowding, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Luther Masukusaid the southern and far northern
sections of the park were particularly vulnerable to crowding over
busy periods.
	   Each of the eight entrances will have a maximum quota of day
visitors. At the Paul Kruger gate, 750 people will be allowed in,
500 each at Numbi, Malelane, Orpen and Phalaborwa, and 300 each at
Punda Maria, Crocodile Bridge and Pafuri.
	   Day visits can be booked, he said.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army ordered 1.2 million
condoms in an effort to curb the spread of the AIDS virus among its
troops, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said the condoms will
be purchased from Commercial Marketing Strategies, a program funded
by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   David Kanyoro, CMS sales manager, said the military placed the
order as part of an urgent campaign to promote safe sex and stop
the spread of the immune-stripping disease among soldiers and their
families.
	   CMS last week donated 100,000 condoms to the army in recognition
of the large order and to serve the army while its order is filled,
Kanyoro said.
	   Uganda, which had the highest AIDS rate in the world in 1982, is
the only African country south of the Sahara to achieve a decline
in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A bus and heavy goods truck collided
Tuesday, killing 26 people and injuring 15, most of them seriously,
state radio reported.
	   The bus was headed south when it crashed into a truck carrying
fertilizer 180 kilometers (110 miles) from Harare near the town of
Mvuma.
	   Of the dead, 22 were women on shopping trips to neighboring
South Africa, to buy cheaper consumer goods to sell at home, the
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Police appealed for relatives of passengers known to be
traveling to South Africa by bus to come forward to identify the
victims.
	   Long distance bus crashes are common in Zimbabwe and are mostly
blamed on speeding and poor maintenance of vehicles.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni is undecided on
attending the Francophone summit Thursday at the invitation of the
French President Jacques Chirac, an aide said.
	   ``The president was invited but I cannot confirm his
attendance,'' Hope Kivengere, Museveni's press secretary, said
Tuesday.
	   The meeting is a gathering of former colonies of France, the
majority of them African.
	   A privately owned newspaper, The Crusader, said Tuesday that
non-French speaking countries which are involved in the Congolese
war like Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have been invited.
	   It was immediately impossible to verify The Crusaders report.
	   English-speaking Namibia and Zimbabwe and Portuguese-speaking
Angola have sent troops to help Congolese President Laurent Kabila
fight a rebellion in the country's east.
	   The rebellion is mostly by ethnic Tutsi, disaffected troops and
Kabila's opponents. The are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A regional workshop focusing on the
rights of refugee children and teen-agers in West Africa opened
Tuesday in the Ivory Coast's commercial capital of Abidjan.
	   Among those attending the four-day meeting organized by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are health ministers
and social workers from six West African countries as well as
representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund.
	   The major goal of the workshop is to strengthen efforts of
individuals involved in refugee work with children, UNHCR regional
operations head Abou Moussa said.
	   Other topics on the agenda include the demobilization of child
soldiers, displaced children, and the setting up of an action plan
to help protect child refugees.
	   The workshop sessions end Friday.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Food prices in Burundi have increased by
more than 110 percent since the imposition of economic sanctions by
the tiny Central African nation's neighbors, the Rome-based U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization said Tuesday.
	   The FAO Agricultural Emergency Coordination Unit said in a
report average food costs increased from Burundi francs 5,200 (dlrs
7.40) per week to 11,000 francs (dlrs 15.70). The agency has been
collecting data on 35 food products, fuel and exchange rates on a
weekly basis since 1996.
	   Rural production has been stymied because of reduced transport
to markets due to fuel shortages and insecurity, the report said.
	   Less than a week after President Pierre Buyoya overthrew a weak
coalition government on July 25, 1996, Burundi's neighbors imposed
the sanctions.
	   The seven countries want to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army
major, to restore democratic instutitions, which he has partially
done.
	   --
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Britain's outgoing ambassador to Angola
Roger Hart on Thursday expressed disappointment over the country's
ailing peace process, and announced the prospect of two British
companies operating in the southwest African country.
	   Hart said oil company British Petroleum was interested in
exploring Angola's prolific offshore waters, but gave no further
details.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-biggest oil exporter after
Nigeria. Oil production, which is mostly offshore, largely escaped
the effects of the two-decade civil war that ended in 1994. It is
the government's single largest source of revenue.
	   Hart _ to be replaced by Caroline Helms Dec. 3 _ also announced
the possibility of British Airways starting regular flights to the
Angolan capital Luanda in March.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slugline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A push for OPEC members to stick to
production cuts, designed to lift sagging prices, was expected to
intensify Tuesday as oil ministers arrived from three countries
said to be not fully complying.
	   OPEC's 11 member states will hold a formal year-end meeting
Wednesday facing the lowest prices in nearly 11 years.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
to dlrs 12.33, compared to dlrs 18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   The slump could damage OPEC's economies, often highly dependent
on oil revenues for government financing.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
raising levels of compliance with production cuts introduced in
June; extending the cuts; cutting further; and calling an
exceptional heads of state meeting ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said in
Dubai on Monday.
	   Algeria says OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands. The
United Arab Emirates has supported Algeria's idea of a special
top-level meeting.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6-million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in its latest report in October.
	   However compliance by Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia is lower,
analysts believe. Ministers from all three countries were expected
mid-Tuesday.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million, was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

Refugee chief urges release of kidnapped French worker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Marking his 300th day in captivity, the United
Nations' top refugee official Tuesday urged kidnappers to release
an aid worker kidnapped in southern Russia ``in the name of common
human decency.''
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the U.N. refugee agency's
office in North Ossetia, near breakaway Chechnya, was seized by
three masked gunmen in his apartment in the region's capital of
Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   ``Our intense efforts to obtain Vincent's release have yielded
no results so far,'' said Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   ``We have left no stone unturned and we will continue our
efforts for as long as it takes to get him free.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   ``I urge Vincent's captors, whoever they are, to release him in
the name of common human decency,'' Ogata said.
	   UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin said there had been a number of
indications that he is still alive.

Director Peter Sellars, composer Mauricio Kagel get Dutch award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ American theater director Peter
Sellars and German-Argentine composer Mauricio Kagel were awarded
the prestigious Erasmus Prize on Tuesday for their contemporary
approach to the performing arts.
	   They accepted the prize and its 300,000 guilder (dlrs 159,574)
cash award at a ceremony in Amsterdam attended by members of the
Dutch royal family, including Queen Beatrix.
	   ``They are both rebels,'' said Prince Bernhard, Beatrix's
father, who presented the awards.
	   ``They achieve an interaction between various art forms with
their works and they both give shape to a contemporary
interpretation of the cultural legacy,'' the Erasmus Foundation
said in a statement.
	   The prize is handed out annually to a person or group making an
important contribution to European culture, social or scientific
development.
	   Celebrating its 40th anniversary, the foundation has chosen two
winners this year.
	   Stage productions by Sellars including ``Ajax,'' ``Nixon in
China'' and ``Don Giovanni'' have won critical acclaim in the
Netherlands. The oeuvre of the versatile Kagel includes radio plays
and compositions for stage performances, films and orchestras.
	   Previous winners of the prize, named for the 16th century Dutch
humanist Desiderius Erasmus, include silent movie star Charlie
Chaplin, sculptor Henry Moore and Jacques Delors, the former
European Commission chief.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Some 700 villages were without
electricity Tuesday and 400 were without water after heavy snows
knocked down power lines and caused outages at water pumping
stations, officials said.
	   The Civil Defense agency said most of the affected villages were
in northern Bulgaria. Rescue teams were dispatched.
	   Five passes in the Balkan mountains were closed because of deep
drifts.
	   Airports in Sofia and the Black Sea port of Burgas were reopened
Tuesday after being closed temporarily Monday because of blizzards.

Charles visits Crete on last day of Greece tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles on Tuesday traveled to the
island of Crete to visit a Minoan palace complex first unearthed by
British archeologists earlier this century.
	   Charles, on a three-day cultural visit to Greece, earlier laid a
wreath under sunny skies at the tomb of the unknown soldier in
central Athens. Bad weather had postponed the ceremony Monday.
	   During his visit to Crete, Charles will tour the British School
of Archaeology facilities at Knossos, where the ruins were
partially rebuilt in the early 1900's by British archaeologist Sir
Arthur Evans.
	   He will also attend a reception at an archeological museum in
the port city of Iraklion, near the ruins.
	   A hand grenade exploded near the museum early Tuesday, but
police said the apparent target was the car of a lawyer who had
been a candidate for mayor in local elections. No one was injured.
	   Prince Philip, Charles' father, distinguished himself as a naval
officer during the Battle of Crete in World War II.
	   In Athens Monday, Charles lent his support for the British
Archeological School's appeal to raise 10.5 million pounds (dlrs
17.3 million).
	   Charles is patron of the school, the fifth Royal since it was
founded in 1886. His great-great-grandfather King Edward VII was
the last to visit in 1906, but according to local media reports
Charles expressed an interest in having his son Prince William
spend some time studying at the school.
	   During his Athens visit, Charles was the recipient of various
appeals made by its mayor and Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos
for the return of the 2,500-year-old Parthenon marbles housed in
the British Museum.
	   Unlike the work of Evans on Crete, Lord Elgin _ then Britain's
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire _ stripped the marbles adorning
the Parthenon in the early 19th century.
	   Successive Greek government have for years unsuccessfully
lobbied for their return. Charles did not comment on the dispute
between the two governments.
	   In Athens, Charles also inaugurated a British Council education
center, met with President Costis Stephanopoulos and attended
events at an annual Britain and Greece festival.
	   He also visited the home of reclusive multi-billionaire John
Latsis, who this year and in past summers hosted Charles and his
family on his yacht. The late Princess Diana was also a Latsis
guest before her death.

 &UR; ATP Tour and big tournaments create joint venture &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ The ATP Tour and the biggest tennis
tournaments outside the Grand Slams have formed a joint venture
that they hope would be worth dlrs one billion in a 10-year
partnership, the tour's chief executive officer Mark Miles said
Tuesday.
	   By pooling their commercial rights over a projected period of 10
years, the so-called Super 9 tournaments and the tour expect the
deal to substantially increase their revenue.
	   ``We believe there is a lot of untapped potential in the
sport,'' Miles said. ``We believe we can bring in a lot more
sponsors, especially global sponsors.''
	   In a related development, the tour and the nine tournaments
signed a new agreement with ISL/Octagon, a marketing company that
will work with the joint venture on assembling the commercial
rights.
	   The new agreement represents a substantial increase in the
rights that will be pooled, compared to the original partnership
deal with the Swiss-based ISL/Octagon announced in July, Miles
said.
	   The directors of the Super 9 tournaments wanted a better deal
after Boris Becker, the semi-retired German star, and Prisma, a
London-based subsidiary of the German media mogul Leo Kirch, made a
rival, more lucrative bid.
	   The original, smaller deal involving only television rights was
reportedly worth dlrs 75 million over three years, while Becker and
Prisma reportedly were offering dlrs 300 million.
	   The new joint venture leaves Becker and Prisma out of the
picture.
	   ``We are convinced that ISL/Octagon bring the ideal combination
of financial strength and marketing expertise to make this project
a success,'' Miles said.
	   No final terms of the deal have been fixed, but Miles said the
venture would be for a long period, probably 10 years, and expected
to be worth dlrs 100 million annually.
	   It will start in 2000, coinciding with other changes in the
game, including a simpler ranking system and a streamlined
calendar.
	   The Super 9 tournaments are the most lucrative in the game after
the four Grand Slams.
	   They are Indian Wells, Key Biscayne, Monte Carlo, Hamburg, Rome,
the Canadian Open, Cincinnati, Stuttgart and the Paris Indoor.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ With Iraq facing a new crisis with the
United Nations over arms inspections, the government pleaded
Tuesday for help from Arab nations to lift U.N. sanctions on Iraq
and thwart British-American plots.
	   The pleas came in front-page editorials in state-run dailies and
in an article written by a leading adviser to President Saddam
Hussein, who warned that British and U.S. attempt to topple the
Iraq leader could destabilize the Middle East.
	   The newspapers also published the government's views on the
assassination attempt Sunday of a top deputy to Saddam _ hinting
Iran was responsible, as it usually does when violence acts are
aimed at Saddam's regime.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, opening a poetry festival
Tuesday in Baghdad, said the United States wanted Iraq to surrender
to its demands but pledged Iraqis would resist.
	   ``America, Zionism and other enemies supporting them would like
... to humiliate Iraq,'' Aziz said.
	   ``Surrendering to their will ... is death itself,'' he added.

Parliament approves bill on formation of political groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese parliament approved a bill
that allows the formation of ``political associations'' that can
compete in elections, state-owned television said.
	   The television reported the bill was adopted Monday night. It
quoted Parliament speaker Hassan Turabi as saying it was adopted
with one dissenting vote in the 400-seat Parliament.
	   Sudan's constitution, which was approved in June, does not
clearly mention the right to form political parties, which were
banned after a 1989 coup, but does speak about the right to
organize political associations.
	   Some parliament members have pressed hard to replace such vague
phrases with a clear-cut reference to ``political parties.'' But
Turabi, the Islamic leader thought to be the real power behind the
government, has opposed such a change.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders in exile, in their last meeting in
Egypt in August, rejected the new constitution which is based on
Islamic law. They vowed to keep up their struggle for democracy.
	   President Omar el-Bashir last week said the door was open for
the opposition figures to come back and form their political
parties.
	   But the presence of Turabi at the head of parliament cast doubts
on the seriousness of the government's openness to the opposition.
	   The government has taken a series of steps to encourage the
opposition, even as it has sought to make piece with southern
rebels fighting for more autonomy.
	   Turabi earlier this year expressed readiness to leave the
parliament, and the daily Al-Anbaa said Tuesday it had confirmed he
will leave his post to give more time to the National Congress,
essentially a political party through which the country is run.
	   His resignation is expected to be announced before the new bill
on political openness takes effect January 1.
	   On that date, Sudan's national day, el-Bashir is expected to
announce serious measures that include general amnesty and freeing
all political prisoners or detainees.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and related famines.

New book puts tabloid spin on Bible stories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It's got illicit sex, violence, scandals, miracles
and martyrs _ all the ingredients that make for memorable Page 1
headlines in the irreverent British tabloids.
	   It's the Holy Bible, coming to a newsstand near you.
	   Actually, it's ``The Scroll,'' a new book that shows how today's
tabloid press might have covered the events of the Good Book _
minus, of course, the topless model on page 3.
	   ``Thank God for Sunday, God invents the weekend,'' blares a
headline in Genesis. ``Pharaoh issues tough new population policy''
is the take on the Egyptian edict that all baby boys be killed.
	   And this, when Moses came down from the mountain: ``Is that my
donkey you're coveting?: Adultery out as Moses gets Commandments.''
	   The resurrection of Christ is reported thusly: ``You can't keep
a good man down _ More appearances of Jesus reported.''
	   Perhaps surprisingly, the Church of England said it doesn't have
a problem with author Nick Page's tampering with the sacred text.
	   ``It's always good to have different approaches to propagating
the Bible because it gives people new opportunities to study the
message,'' church spokesman Steve Jenkins said.
	   Page described himself as a Christian looking for a way to
retell Bible stories ``so people might actually read them.''
	   His inspiration for the 155-page book, published only in Britain
by HarperCollins, was The Sun, a sensational and fearless tabloid
and the top-selling national newspaper.
	   Page, former communications director of the Christian charity
Oasis, said he knew some people would be offended by the flippant
accounts of sacred events, such as the crucifixion and
resurrection.
	   Fortunately, he said, those people are in the minority.
	   ``Most people can see what I'm doing and are pleased with any
attempt to make the Bible more accessible,'' he said.

Communist group honors memory of Stalin henchman Beria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A radical communist organization in St. Petersburg
has created a committee to honor the memory of Lavrenty Beria, the
notorious henchman of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, a news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The Working People's Front announced that it would organize a
conference next year to celebrate the life ``of the loyal security
warden, gifted organizer and father of Soviet nuclear weapons,''
Interfax said.
	   Beria headed the dreaded NKVD secret police under Stalin, and
oversaw the purges in which millions of Russians were executed,
imprisoned or sent to the Gulag network of labor camps. He was
convicted of treason and executed shortly after Stalin's death in
1953.
	   The Working People's Front said it had intentionally announced
its plans on the day of the funeral of slain Russian lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova, an outspoken liberal foe of Russian
communists.
	   Beria, the organization noted, ``was especially industrious when
purging the USSR of persons such as Starovoitova.''

Refugee chief urges release of kidnapped French worker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to clarify. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top refugee official Tuesday
urged kidnappers to release an aid worker, held for 300 days in
southern Russia, ``in the name of common human decency.''
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the U.N. refugee agency's
office in North Ossetia, near breakaway Chechnya, was seized by
three masked gunmen in his apartment in the region's capital of
Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   ``Our intense efforts to obtain Vincent's release have yielded
no results so far,'' said Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   ``We have left no stone unturned and we will continue our
efforts for as long as it takes to get him free.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   ``I urge Vincent's captors, whoever they are, to release him in
the name of common human decency,'' Ogata said.
	   UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin said there had been a number of
indications that he is still alive.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union steel makers filed a
complaint with the European Commission Tuesday alleging unfair
competition from cheap imports from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, South
Africa, Iran, India and Taiwan.
	   If the complaint is successful, the European Union may impose
anti-dumping duties on steel makers from the six countries.
	   The European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries, known
as Eurofer, said imports of unalloyed, hot-rolled coils _ which are
used mainly in the car and building industries _ from these
countries have caused them ``serious injury''
	   Eurofer complained the imports in the first eight months of this
year were 320 percent more thasn in the same 1997 period due to
unreasonably low prices that let outside producers dump steel on
the EU market.
	   The Commission has 45 days to decide if a full anti-dumping
inquiry is warranted.
	   Eurofer Director Christian Mari predicted the European
Commission will launch such an investigation, saying ``We think our
case is strong.''

Report: Singapore executives make more than U.S. counterparts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that not clear whether all forms of compensation
included, American unions contend U.S. chief executives vastly
overpaid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite the economic slowdown, top executives
in Singapore made more than their U.S. counterparts last year, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Chief executive officers working in the affluent Southeast Asian
city-state received an average of dlrs 178,451 in 1997, compared to
about dlrs 173,000 in the United States, The Business Times said.
	   The paper said its report was based on the 1998 World
Competitiveness Yearbook. It was not clear whether the figures
included all forms of compensation, including bonuses and stock
options.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. labor organization AFL-CIO said
chief executive officers ``get multimillion-dollar sweetheart
deals. Meanwhile, working families worry about downsizings and
layoffs.''
	   It cited a Sunday New York Times analysis of more than half the
nation's top 500 publicly held companies showing that at those
major corporations, executive pay climbed 37.8 percent in 1997, to
an average of dlrs 8.7 million per corporate chief.
	   The Business Times report said only top-level managers in Japan
and Hong Kong earned more than their Singapore-based equivalents.
It said CEOs in Japan took home an average dlrs 225,473 last year,
while Hong Kong executives enjoyed mean salaries of dlrs 200,582.
	   Singapore's more humble blue-collar workers currently receive
dlrs 6.70 an hour, compared to dlrs 18 an hour in the United States
and Japan, and dlrs 26 an hour in Germany, the newspaper added.
	   Singapore is expected to adopt painful wage cuts soon to combat
a developing recession and reclaim business competitiveness lost to
its regional neighbors.
	   Debate on the business cost-cutting package, under which average
Singaporean workers will bear the burden, has focused on deeper
government cutbacks and on more equitable wage reductions for
lower-income employees.

Kosovo rebels free Serb policeman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date of kidnapping to Nov. 17 in 2nd graf; fixes
spelling of Serb policeman in all references to conform to previous
editor's note &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels on Tuesday
freed a kidnapped Serb policeman after U.S. diplomatic observers
intervened to persuade them to let him go.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army was still believed to be holding two
ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along with the policeman
Nov. 17 and are considered sympathetic to Serb authorities.
	   The KLA is accused of attacking or kidnapping numerous Serb
policemen, civilians and ethnic Albanians believed loyal to the
Serbian regime since last month's agreement aimed at ending
hostilities in the restive province of southern Serbia.
	   The pre-arranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran Zbiljic
took place Tuesday morning near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial
capital Pristina.
	   It was negotiated by American members of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission _ the main foreign monitoring force in Kosovo
until a recently approved international verification mission is
launched.
	   While the diplomats looked on and armed guerrillas stood watch
nearby, a KLA vehicle drove up and Zbiljic got out. Police
colleagues shook his hand and embraced the policeman, who had been
accused by the KLA of looting empty ethnic Albanian houses.
	   ``They did not harass me. Probably they had mixed me up with
someone else,'' he said.
	   ``I want to go home as soon as possible,'' the policeman added.
``The war is no good for anyone and it has to stop.''
	   On hand to make sure the release took place were Shaun Byrnes,
head of the U.S. diplomatic contingent, and KLA representative Adem
Demaci.
	   The foreign diplomats have been talking with both sides in
recent weeks, concerned by an increase of shooting incidents blamed
on both the Serbs and the rebels.
	   The Podujevo area had been very tense since Zbiljic's abduction,
with local Serbs threatening a mass exodus if Serb authorities did
not react to the KLA ``harassment.''
	   After talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill late
Monday, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic condemned continuing
``terrorist acts'' by the KLA and declared that its attacks on
``innocent citizens, police and soldiers'' must be be stopped.
	   Milutinovic demanded that Hill personally condemn the KLA's
actions.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in Kosovo. Most advocate independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were killed and
hundreds of thousands displaced during a crackdown by Serb and
Yugoslav authorities from February to October.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement led to a withdrawal of many Yugoslav forces
and a fragile cease-fire. But violence continues as international
officials try to produce a political settlement on Kosovo's future
status.
	   Ethnic Albanians have rejected the latest offer by the Serbs to
negotiate over Kosovo without the foreign mediation they demand.
	   Independent Belgrade media quoted Nekibe Kelmendi, general
secretary of Rugova's ethnic Albanian party, as saying they won't
take part in proposed talks Wednesday because ``the Serb side wants
to present the Kosovo issue as an internal matter.''
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic was quoted by state-run
media as saying that by rejecting the talks, the ethnic Albanian
leaders are buying time for their ``terrorists'' to reorganize.
	   ``But we won't allow it,'' he said.

Athens Bar Association considering change in billing practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece largest's lawyers union, the Athens
Bar Association, on Tuesday said it is considering changing billing
practices to charge clients by the hour rather than by the case.
	   According to association President Andonis Roupakiotis, the
change is needed to modernize the billing system used by lawyers,
numbering 16,000 in the capital.
	   It was not know when, or if, the change would go into effect as
it could require altering existing legislation on lawyers.
	   Most lawyers here charge on a case-by-case basis rather than
charging customers by the hour. Some larger law firms, especially
those dealing with shipping and corporate law, already charge by
the hour.

Romania supplies energy to Moldova
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania is supplying Moldova with
electricity to help tide its neighbor over a serious energy crisis,
a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Moldovan authorities declared an emergency last week after
Ukraine recently cut electricity exports to Moldova which hadn't
been paid for. Ukraine is suffering an economic crisis.
	   Romania is meeting 15 percent of Moldova's energy needs, said a
spokesman of the Romanian national electricity company Conel. That
could be increased to up to 60 percent of this former Soviet
republic's electricity needs, said Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile.
	   Vasile met late Monday with Moldovan Deputy Premier Valeriu
Dolganiuc to discuss how Moldova would pay for the Romanian energy.
	   Moldova either will take out a loan from Moldovan banks or will
offer Romania a stake in the national telecommunications company,
MoldTelecom. The Romanian government will decide how it wants to be
paid.
	   ``Romania is producing enough energy now and it can easily
afford to export to other countries,'' said Gabriel Piscociu, a
government spokesman.
	   Moldovan authorities said up to 40 percent of the country's
electricity is stolen. Industrial and domestic consumers owe some
1.8 billion lei (dlrs 300 million) to the state electricity
company.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The estimated number of people with the AIDS virus
will increase by nearly 6 million this year, with two-thirds of the
new cases developing in Africa, according to a U.N. report released
Tuesday that urged greater efforts to prevent the disease.
	   ``Every one of these new HIV infections represents a prevention
failure _ our collective failure,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, executive
director of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS.
	   Some 33 million people around the world are infected with HIV,
two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report
by the U.N. program and the World Health Organization.
	   Britain's International Development Secretary, Clare Short, said
greater efforts must be made to make condoms more widely available.
	   ``It needs to become as easy to get hold of a condom in a poor
country as Coca-Cola,'' Short said at a news conference where the
U.N. report was officially launched.
	   Bill Roedy, president of MTV Networks International, said the
music channel would promote condom use in an upcoming series of
programs. ``Quite simply, condoms are cool, and using them is
cooler. We want to make it trendy, hip and cool to use condoms.''
	   The U.N. report said that of the 5.8 million new infections, 70
percent were in sub-Saharan Africa. Ninety percent of the 590,000
new cases involving children under 15 were also found there.

Bertelsmann sees strong sales in European on-line venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Media giant Bertelsmann said Tuesday it
expects sales of 28.5 billion marks (dlrs 17.8 billion) for the
fiscal year ending June 30 and could reach its 30-billion-mark
(dlrs 18.75 billion) goal before the year 2000.
	   Company Chairman Thomas Middelhoff said Bertelsmann, which
posted sales of 25.7 billion marks (dlrs 16 billion) in the
previous fiscal year, was seeing particular success in its European
venture with America Online Inc.
	   ``AOL is a classic example. There's a return on sales that I can
hardly describe with usual numbers,'' Middelhoff was quoted as
telling Die Welt newspaper, pointing to profits on AOL shares of
dlrs 1.6 billion following an investment of dlrs 50 million.
	   By 2000, the company wants to make half its profits from its
print and electronic media ventures, Middelhoff said.
	   Bertelsmann is the world's third-largest media and entertainment
company after Time Warner Inc. and The Walt Disney Co. It entered
the AOL venture in 1995 and in July purchased Random House, the
biggest book publisher in the United States.

Indonesia criticizes Portugal over suspension of East Timor talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from Portugal, grafs 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims
that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and
criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the
future of the troubled territory.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly
wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last
week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese
rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.
	   East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Belo, has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed
near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor's capital.
	   The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said that so far, only 11
bodies had been identified.
	   Alatas said the claims of a massacre were not true.
	   ``The Portuguese delegation, without checking the truth of the
information, decided to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue,''
Antara quoted Alatas as saying.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said some deaths had
occurred in fights between rebels and Indonesian forces. However,
it could not confirm claims that dozens of people had been killed.
	   Alatas said it was the third time that Portugal had unilaterally
suspended talks over East Timor since 1986.
	   Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about
Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported.
	   In response, Portugal's Foreign Ministry accused Indonesia of
breaking promises to reduce its military presence in East Timor and
called for a permanent U.N. mission in the disputed territory.
	   ``Unfortunately, Indonesia has increased its deployment and the
brutality of its military actions in East Timor,'' said ministry
spokesman Horacio Cesar.
	   Meanwhile, about 500 students staged a noisy but peaceful rally
outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili.
	   The group earlier had spent the night occupying the provincial
Parliament.
	   The students demanded a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers
from East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations, however, does not recognize Indonesia's
claim.
	   Before being suspended, the talks centered on an Indonesian
offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.

Iraq asks OPEC for action to boost oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi oil official pleaded Tuesday for
oil exporters to take steps to boost prices, speaking a day before
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was to meet in
Vienna.
	   Faleh al-Khayat, director-general of studies and planning in
Iraq's Oil Ministry, complained the sharp drop in prices had hurt
Iraq's oil-for-food pact with the United Nations and said it was
time OPEC took action.
	   ``OPEC members meeting in Vienna should take positive measures
to rectify oil prices which have been falling for more than one
year,'' al-Khayat told The Associated Press.
	   ``Both OPEC and non-OPEC members are required to put forth added
efforts to mend the current situation,'' he said.
	   Iraq, though an OPEC member, is not bound under the
organization's program of production cuts although its current
output is comparable to its pre-Gulf War quota.
	   Al-Khayat said Iraq was hit hard by the falling prices during
the current six-month phase of its partial oil exports scheduled to
end Wednesday.
	   ``We have been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day
and exporting between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we
failed to meet our own financial ceiling,'' he said.
	   Under the current phase Iraq is allowed exports worth up to dlrs
5.2 billion, but al-Khayat said total revenue will not exceed 3.2
billion.
	   ``We could have easily done the dlrs 5.2 billion or even more
had it not been for the drastic decline in oil prices,'' he said.
	   The oil-for-food deal is an exception to U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990. It allows limited oil
exports to help Iraq buy food, medicine and other urgent needs for
its 22 million people.
	   The oil income also goes to pay Gulf War reparations and U.N.
costs involved in Iraq's disarmament. Al-Khayat said Iraq's net
share of the oil money during the current leg of the program would
be about dlrs 2 billion.

Report: Mossad operations chief resigns over Cyprus affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior official in Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of
two agents in Cyprus _ the third botched spy mission in a year.
	   The Mossad operations chief, known publicly only as ``Y,''
offered to step down after Cypriot police arrested the two Israelis
and seized electronic monitoring equipment, the daily Haaretz
newspaper reported Tuesday. Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy accepted
``Y's'' resignation, the paper said.
	   An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the
report.
	   The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is
responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment.
	   The suspects were caught with tapes of police conversations and
surveillance devices near an army base on the Mediterranean island
earlier this month.
	   Cyprus has accused them of operating with ``a specific
intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.'' Police
on the island said the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, which
has a defense pact with Israel.
	   The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the
two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf
of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
	   ``Y'' also had offered his resignation earlier this year after
Swiss police arrested five Mossad agents for allegedly spying in a
residential area of Bern, Israel radio said.
	   Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned in February following a
failed attempt to assassinate a leader of the radical Islamic group
Hamas in Jordan. Haaretz said ``Y'' was not involved in that
operation.

Russia criticizes Britain over Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia criticized Britain on Tuesday for
supporting efforts to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, but also
said Iraq needs to fully comply with U.N. weapons inspectors, a
news agency said.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said the Russian
government regretted that ``individual countries, including
Britain, are issuing calls to topple the Iraqi regime,'' Interfax
reported.
	   British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said Monday that
Britain supported calls to indict Saddam for crimes against
humanity, and was frank about British desires to be rid of the
Iraqi leader.
	   ``It is almost inconceivable to imagine that Iraq without Saddam
Hussein would not be a better country,'' Fatchett said.
	   Russia has tried to act as a mediator in Western disputes with
Iraq, adopting a far more conciliatory line toward its former ally.
However, there have been signs that Russia's patience with Saddam
is wearing thin.
	   Rakhmanin said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met Tuesday
with a high-ranking member of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, and
stressed the need for Iraq to comply fully with United Nations'
inspectors.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A push for OPEC members to stick to
production cuts, designed to lift sagging prices, was expected to
intensify Tuesday as oil ministers arrived from three countries
said to be not fully complying.
	   OPEC's 11 member states will hold a formal year-end meeting
Wednesday facing the lowest prices in nearly 11 years.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
to dlrs 12.33, compared to dlrs 18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   The slump could damage OPEC's economies, often highly dependent
on oil revenues for government financing.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
raising levels of compliance with production cuts introduced in
June; extending the cuts; cutting further; and calling an
exceptional heads of state meeting ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said in
Dubai on Monday.
	   Algeria says OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands. The
United Arab Emirates has supported Algeria's idea of a special
top-level meeting.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6-million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in its latest report in October.
	   However compliance by Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia is lower,
analysts believe. Ministers from all three countries were expected
mid-Tuesday.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million, was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

Director Peter Sellars, composer Mauricio Kagel get Dutch award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ American theater director Peter
Sellars and German-Argentine composer Mauricio Kagel were awarded
the prestigious Erasmus Prize on Tuesday for their contemporary
approach to the performing arts.
	   They accepted the prize and its 300,000 guilder (dlrs 159,574)
cash award at a ceremony in Amsterdam attended by members of the
Dutch royal family, including Queen Beatrix.
	   ``They are both rebels,'' said Prince Bernhard, Beatrix's
father, who presented the awards.
	   The prize is handed out annually to a person or group making an
important contribution to European culture, social or scientific
development.
	   ``They achieve an interaction between various art forms with
their works and they both give shape to a contemporary
interpretation of the cultural legacy,'' according to a statement
by the Erasmus Foundation.
	   Celebrating its 40th anniversary, the foundation has chosen two
winners this year.
	   Stage productions by Sellars including ``Ajax,'' ``Nixon in
China'' and ``Don Giovanni'' have won critical acclaim in the
Netherlands. The oeuvre of the versatile Kagel includes radio plays
and compositions for stage performances, films and orchestras.
	   Previous winners of the prize, named for the 16th century Dutch
humanist Desiderius Erasmus, include silent movie star Charlie
Chaplin, sculptor Henry Moore and Jacques Delors, the former
European Commission chief.

Parties test ground for new coalition with government near
</HEADLINE>
collapse &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ With the government collapsing under the
weight of corruption allegations, political leaders Tuesday
intensified deal making aimed at forging Turkey's fifth governing
coalition in three years.
	   The key test was whether secular-minded parties could overcome
their differences and keep pro-Islamic forces from climbing back
into power _ a scenario strongly opposed by Turkey's powerful and
pro-Western military.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' nearly 17-month-old government is
given almost no chance of surviving a confidence vote Wednesday.
Opponents charge Yilmaz had links to a mob boss and rigged the
privatization of a state-run bank.
	   Yilmaz, however, struggled to keep his Motherland Party in power
by sealing a stopgap pact with its main rival, the True Path Party
led by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
	   But it's unclear whether a volatile union between Yilmaz and
Mrs. Ciller could last even until general elections in April. An
extended political crisis could hurt Turkey's main goal of the
moment: winning the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan from Italy, where he is seeking political asylum.
	   Meanwhile, both Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller face personal battles.
They are central figures in a growing probe of political
corruption, including ties to organized crime.
	   The accusations have touched the established parties, but have
so far spared Virtue _ which was formed after its predecessor, the
Welfare Party, was outlawed on accusations of trying to undermine
Turkey's secular principles.
	   Even if a pact between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller block Virtue for
the moment, its distance from the corruption scandals could give it
an important boost in the coming elections.
	   Yilmaz' government would be the fourth government to fall since
1995. Opponents need 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament to dump
the government.
	   Parties would then have 45 days to set up another coalition. If
they fail, the president could appoint a caretaker government to
rule until elections.
	   ``From now on, I am not interested in new government formulas,''
Yilmaz told his group in parliament. ``The next government will not
be able to achieve anything.''
	   First signals of a possible alliance came Monday when Yilmaz and
Mrs. Ciller had their parties oppose moving ahead with dueling
corruption probes.
	   ``They have sentenced each other,'' mocked Deniz Baykal, whose
center-left Republican People's Party turned against Yilmaz after
extending crucial support to the coalition.
	   Analysts say the leadership of Bulent Ecevit, head of the
Democratic Left Party, could bring Mrs. Ciller and Yilmaz together
once again.
	   Three coalitions have collapsed in Turkey over the past three
years. Yilmaz came to power in July 1997 after the military forced
out an Islamic-led coalition for policies it said increased the
influence of Islam in everyday life.

Stuck in snow, traffickers abandon marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Police helping drivers stuck in the snow
on Tuesday wound up seizing 106 kilograms (233 pounds) of marijuana
from a car that didn't need any help trying to speed away.
	   Police trying to help cars driving on snow-covered roads near
the border with Albania signaled for one speeding car to slow down.
	   Instead of slowing, it speeded up and was found abandoned a
short distance away. It's passengers had fled into the snow, but
left the marijuana in the trunk.
	   Police regularly seize large quantities of marijuana coming
across the border from Albania, which has been in political turmoil
since an armed uprising in March 1997.

Russia signs agreement for completion of Iranian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday agreed to complete work on
an Iranian nuclear plant and study the possibility of building a
second one, Iranian radio reported.
	   Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov signed an
agreement with Mohammed Aghazadeh, head of the Iran's Atomic Energy
Organization, to complete the Bushehr power plant, the radio said.
	   The United States and Israel have objected to the 1,000-megawatt
Bushehr plant, saying it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
But Russia says the reactor can be used only for civilian purposes.
	   Under Tuesday's agreement, a Russian-Iranian committee will
study the feasibility of constructing another nuclear power plant
over the next three months, the radio said. It did not give other
details.
	   Yevgeny arrived in Iran Saturday to check on the building of the
nuclear plant in the southern port of Bushehr.
	   Yevgeny said that Russia was cooperating with Iran in the area
of safe disposal of nuclear waste, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Russia is to install a VOWER-1000 light water reactor in the
plant. The contract is worth dlrs 800,000 the Russian news agency
Interfax said.
	   Iran says the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate power.
It notes that its facilities have been approved by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

Nigeria begins prisoners exchange with Cameroon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria on Tuesday released 86 Cameroonian
soldiers and one civilian who had been held captive since 1996,
when they were caught during border clashes between the two
countries, the local Red Cross said.
	   The released prisoners were flown home on a special Cameroon
Airlines flight as part of a prisoner exchange program.
	   In return, Cameroon is to release 86 Nigerian prisoners and 36
civilians who were caught during the same skirmishes in the
contested Bakassi peninsula.
	   The Cameroonian prisoners were released by Nigerian Maj. Gen.
Oladayo Popoola and delivered into the custody of the Red Cross,
which oversaw their return to Cameroon, the relief organization
said in a statement.
	   Disputes over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula have nearly driven
the two West African neighbors to full-scale war and have set off a
string of armed clashes.
	   Earlier this year, the World Court at the Hague deemed it had
jurisdiction to rule over the dispute, although Nigeria has
repeatedly said it would not necessarily abide by the court's
ruling if it was not in its favor.
	   Nigeria has accused Cameroon of massing troops in the peninsula
as a prelude to war.
	   Several times in recent months Nigeria has claimed that Cameroon
has attacked unarmed villagers in the disputed section of the
peninsula. Cameroon has leveled similar charges against Nigeria.
	   Both sides claim sovereignty over the Bakassi peninsula in the
Gulf of Guinea. At least 87 people have been killed in sporadic
clashes since 1994.
	   Oil and petroleum are the biggest foreign-exchange earners for
both Cameroon and Nigeria.

Norway's minority government struggles to cling to power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's minority government made a bid to
cling to power Tuesday, offering concessions on next year's
national budget to the political right in exchange for support in
parliament.
	   The government is under intense pressure because it is heading
into a debate on the budget Wednesday and Thursday without a
majority in parliament for its proposals. However, none of the
other parties have a majority for their alternative budgets.
	   The three-party centrist government, led by Christian Democrat
Kjell Magne Bondevik, has just 42 seats in the 165-seat parliament
and must have support from both the Conservatives, with 23 seats,
and the Party of Progress, with 25 seats, to pass the budget.
	   The coalition government has tried negotiations with those
parties and with Labor _ with 65 seats the largest party in
parliament _ on the budget, but the talks have failed.
	   Traditionally, a Norwegian government would resign if the
parliament rejected its budget, but Bondevik has said his
government would not step down if the budget failed.
	   Although a failed budget would leave Norway seriously weakened,
the Conservatives and the Progressives would be hesitant to back a
vote of no-confidence because that would open the way for Labor to
return to power.
	   Labor Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland stepped down last year
after national elections in which his party notched a disappointing
performance even though it was the largest vote-getter.
	   Jagland said this weekend that he was ready to form a new
government, a prospect that apparently drove Bondevik's coalition
to try again on seeking compromise with the right.
	   On Tuesday, Bondevik approached the Conservatives and the Party
of Progress with an offer to meet their demand for no tax hikes in
1999.
	   ``There is movement. There are some problems remaining, and we
have to look closer at the numbers,'' said Jan Petersen, chairman
of the Conservatives, after meeting Bondevik. ``This is something
we can work with.'' His party promised to reply to the offer
sometime Tuesday.
	   Carl I. Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress, said the
proposal was a basis for reopening negotiations with the government
with a view to reaching a budget compromise.

Kosovo rebels free Serb policeman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from KDOM observer, Zbiljic, Demaci; Edits
and trims.
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels on Tuesday
freed a kidnapped Serb policeman after U.S. diplomatic observers
intervened to persuade them to let him go.
	   ``It was a gesture of good will by the Kosovo Liberation Army,''
said KLA representative Adem Demaci, adding that with the release,
``the regime was given a chance to start releasing detained
Albanians and turn over a new leaf in our relations.''
	   Yugoslav authorities have reportedly detained hundreds of ethnic
Albanians on suspicion of participating in the KLA, which they
consider a terrorist organization. Guerrilla hostages have been
Serbs or Albanians considered loyal to them.
	   The KLA, at the forefront of the armed struggle for
majority-Albanian Kosovo's independence from Serbia, was still
believed holding two ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along
with the policeman Nov. 17.
	   Although last month's agreement was aimed at ending hostilities
between the KLA and the joint Serb-Yugoslav forces opposing them,
isolated fighting continues. The Serbs accuse the guerrillas of
attacking them, while the KLA says it is only responding to attacks
from Serb police.
	   The prearranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran Zbiljic
took place Tuesday morning near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial
capital Pristina.
	   It was negotiated by American members of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission _ the main foreign monitoring force in Kosovo
until a recently approved international verification mission is
launched.
	   While the observers looked on and armed guerrillas stood watch
nearby, a KLA vehicle drove up and Zbiljic stepped out. He said he
had been kept alone in a room for the duration of his detention but
had not been mistreated or beaten.
	   ``War is not good. There has to be peace,'' he said as he
stepped out of the car. ``As soon as possible, the politicians have
to do something because people are dying, people are suffering.''
	   Colleagues shook his hand and embraced the policeman, accused by
the KLA of looting abandoned ethnic Albanian houses.
	   The foreign observers have been talking with both sides in
recent weeks, concerned by an increase of shooting incidents blamed
on both Serbs and rebels.
	   After talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill late
Monday, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic condemned ``terrorist
acts'' by the KLA .
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in Kosovo. Most advocate independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were killed and
hundreds of thousands displaced during a crackdown by Serb and
Yugoslav authorities from February to October.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement led to a withdrawal of many Yugoslav forces
and a fragile cease-fire. But violence continues as international
officials try to produce a political settlement on Kosovo's future
status.
	   Ethnic Albanians have rejected the latest offer by the Serbs to
negotiate over Kosovo without the foreign mediation they demand.

	   ORANGE, California (AP) _ Dennis Rodman is on the rebound after
slam dunking his marriage to Carmen Electra.
	   The multi-tattooed, cross-dressing basketball star known as the
Worm filed papers Monday seeking an annulment from his 26-year-old
bride, citing fraud and unsound mind.
	   His lawyer said the Chicago Bulls star was drunk when he married
the former ``Baywatch'' actress and MTV hostess in a quickie Las
Vegas ceremony Nov. 14. Rodman, like the rest of players in the
National Basketball Association, had plenty of time on his hands
because of the ongoing lockout by team owners.
	   ``Dennis alleges he was so inebriated at the nuptials that he
didn't know which end was up, what he was doing,'' his lawyer
Gerald Phillips was quoted as saying in today's New York Post.
	   Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, made the same charge two days
after the wedding.
	   ``Obviously, anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort,'' Manley said at the time.
	   A handwritten note purportedly written by Rodman was released
soon after, in which he professed his love for Electra and
apologized ``for any false statements given on my behalf regarding
my marriage.''
	   But Phillips told the Post that Rodman, 37, didn't even write
the note.
	   ``My understanding is, the handwriting is not his. And it's not
his language either. Dennis does not talk that way,'' he said.
	   Ms. Electra's publicist, Cindy Guagenti, denied the note was
forged and said it was signed in her presence.
	   But she said things soon went downhill.
	   ``Carmen and Dennis spoke several days ago and mutually agreed
(to end the marriage),'' Ms. Guagenti said.
	   The honeymoon was apparently short _ Rodman claims the two
separated the day of the wedding.
	   Rodman was married once before, and it could be said this wasn't
the first time since then that he had toyed with the idea of
marriage. He once dressed up in a white wedding gown and a platinum
wig to sign autographs for one of his books, ``Bad As I Wanna Be.''

Swiss ask EU to lift ban on beef exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Following the European Union vote to
lift a ban on British beef imposed because of fears of ``mad-cow''
disease, non-member Switzerland demanded Tuesday that it should get
similar treatment.
	   Some 35 countries worldwide _ including neighboring Germany,
France, Italy and Austria _ have barred exports of Swiss cattle and
beef because of health fears, although there is not a formal EU
ban.
	   Since November 1990, there have been about 280 cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, making Switzerland the
second-hardest hit nation after Britain. Otherwise known as
``mad-cow'' disease, BSE has been linked to a fatal brain ailment
in humans.
	   Although not a big beef exporter, Swiss farmers have suffered
from the restrictions on exports of live animals.
	   The Swiss Federal Veterinary Office said the same scientific and
health criteria considered in Monday's EU vote to lift the British
ban, should be applied to Switzerland.
	   But it added that Switzerland would maintain its own ban on
British exports.
	   The veterinary office said some 10,000 cows would be tested
using a pioneering technique that can detect a BSE infection six
months before symptoms of the illness break out. The European
Commission, Portugal and several German states have expressed
interest in the test.

Defending champion Italy remains undefeated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Italy beat Russia 15-3, 15-8,
11-15, 15-9 Tuesday and remained unbeaten at 5-0 with two matches
left in the round that decides the semifinalists of the Men's World
Volleyball Championships.
	   Italy, seeking to become the first men's team ever to win three
consecutive world titles, needed one hour, 47 minutes to defeat
Russia, fourth in the 1996 Olympics and seventh in the previous
championships in 1994.
	   Yugoslavia, the Olympic bronze medalist, also improved to 5-0 by
beating the Netherlands, the Olympic champion, 15-9, 15-4, 15-13 in
another Group H match.
	   The Netherlands and Russia both were 4-1, and the group's other
teams _ Greece, Ukraine, the United States and China were out of
semifinal contention.
	   On Tuesday, Ukraine scored a 15-12, 4-15, 15-12, 6-15, 15-8
victory over the United States, which won a bronze medal in the
previous tournament in 1994 but is winless in second-round play
this time.
	   ``I am really happy with this victory, but I know we could have
played better,'' said Leonid Likhno, the Ukraine team's head coach.
	   American head coach Doug Beal said, ``We had a really uneven
match. Sometimes we were playing really well but it didn't last.
Ukraine is a very good team. They had many close matches in this
tournament.''
	   Greece beat winless China 12-15, 15-11, 15-8, 15-12.
	   In Group G at Osaka, western Japan, only Brazil stayed
undefeated, handing Cuba its first loss, 15-11, 15-7, 15-2 in one
hour, 15 minutes. The Cuban women's team defended its world title
on Nov. 12.
	   Spain defeated Argentina 6-15, 15-6, 17-15, 15-5 and was with
Cuba at 4-1.
	   Bulgaria defeated Canada 15-6, 15-9, 15-12, and South Korea beat
winless Japan 15-13, 15-8, 8-15, 9-15, 15-12.
	   Argentina, Bulgaria and Canada were at 2-3.
	   The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
advanced to the current round, which lasts until Thursday. The
semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Saturday and Sunday.

Russia signs agreement for completion of Iranian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS second reference to Adamov in 5th-6th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday agreed to complete work on
an Iranian nuclear plant and study the possibility of building a
second one, Iranian radio reported.
	   Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov signed an
agreement with Mohammed Aghazadeh, head of the Iran's Atomic Energy
Organization, to complete the Bushehr power plant, the radio said.
	   The United States and Israel have objected to the 1,000-megawatt
Bushehr plant, saying it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
But Russia says the reactor can be used only for civilian purposes.
	   Under Tuesday's agreement, a Russian-Iranian committee will
study the feasibility of constructing another nuclear power plant
over the next three months, the radio said. It did not give other
details.
	   Adamov arrived in Iran Saturday to check on the building of the
nuclear plant in the southern port of Bushehr.
	   Adamov said that Russia was cooperating with Iran in the area of
safe disposal of nuclear waste, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Russia is to install a VOWER-1000 light water reactor in the
plant. The contract is worth dlrs 800,000 the Russian news agency
Interfax said.
	   Iran says the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate power.
It notes that its facilities have been approved by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese received
an honorary degree and unveiled a memorial to Irish famine victims
Tuesday at the start of a two-day official visit to Britain.
	   During a ceremony at Liverpool's Anglican cathedral, Mrs.
McAleese was given an honorary fellowship by the city's John Moores
University.
	   Dressed in a red suit and green coat, Mrs. McAleese was greeted
at the cathedral by the university's vice-chancellor, Prof. Peter
Toyne, Liverpool's Lord Mayor Bert Herrity and dean of the
cathedral, the Very Rev. Derrick Walters.
	   Past honorees have included Cherie Booth, wife of Prime Minister
Tony Blair, playwright Alan Bleasdale and actress and lawmaker
Glenda Jackson.
	   Later, Mrs. McAleese unveiled 4-meter (13-foot) high slab of
granite commemorating the victims of the 1840s potato famine in
Ireland, many of whom fled to England through this northwest
English port.
	   On Tuesday evening, she was due to give a lecture at John Moores
University and attend a reception by Irish expatriates.
	   On Wednesday, she is scheduled to meet students from the
University of Liverpool and visit an Irish housing charity.

Milan gets new police chief after former chief arrested in
</HEADLINE>
suspect's slaying &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A new police chief was sworn in Tuesday in Milan, a
day after the city's top cop was arrested on murder charges in the
1995 slaying of a smuggling suspect in southern Italy.
	   Moving quickly to restore confidence in the police after the
stunning arrest, the Interior Ministry named Giovanni Finazzo, 56,
to replace Francesco Forleo, who is now in a military prison on
murder charges.
	   Finazzo was the police of Catania in Sicily until his promotion
to the Milan post.
	   In documents published by newspapers Tuesday, prosecutors
describe Forleo as the ``nastiest of all gunmen.''
	   They accuse him of killing a smuggler with a rifle and hand
grenades during a high speed chase in 1995. Forleo was in a police
helicopter and the smuggler was in a boat.
	   Forleo was the police chief of Brindisi, a port city in southern
Italy at the time. He has said he fired in self-defense and was
cleared in an earlier inquiry.
	   But prosecutors now say Forleo wanted the suspect dead because
he feared the man would expose police complicity with smugglers.
News reports suggest the smugglers paid Forleo and his men for
their protection.
	   Forleo, who was once a top police union official and later
served two terms in parliament, was one of Italy's more prominent
law enforcement officers.
	   He was arrested in Rome Monday, just hours after being summoned
to the Interior Ministry and tendering his resignation.
	   Five police officers who served in Brindisi under Forleo were
arrested earlier in connection with the slaying.

Burundian rebels kill 24 in two attacks, state-run radio says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 24 people in two
attacks in northwestern Burundi, state-run radio said Tuesday.
	   Rebels killed 23 people and wounded 20, 13 of them seriously, in
an attack overnight Sunday on Gihungwe village, 20 kilometers
(nearly 15 miles) northwest of the capital, the report said.
	   They also burned down 114 homes.
	   A teacher was killed in another attack in nearby Buringa, the
report said.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed since 1993 when the
violence erupted after Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's
first democratically elected president, a Hutu, in a failed coup.
	   Negotiations under the auspices former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere have failed to end the violence.
	   Hutus comprise 85 percent of Burundi's population of 6.2
million, while Tutsis make up 14 percent.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)_ Jordan will soon draw up a national
industrial policy based on economic openness, privatization and its
aim of joining the World Trade Organization, an official said
Tuesday.
	   The policy is aimed at achieving high productivity and quality
and to optimize the use of natural resources, said Ahmad Hindawi,
director of industrial development at the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
	   He said lifting of protection for local industries should be
gradual and reducing customs duties on industrial inputs should
come before reducing customs on the final products.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A government committee has decided to allow
investment companies to finance stock exchange transactions, a step
expected to pump much-needed liquidity into the slumping market,
the Al-Qabas newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The ministerial committee, which was set up by the Cabinet on
Sunday, aims at revitalizing the Kuwait Stock Exchange whose index
has fallen to record two-year lows.
	   The index closed at 1,776.4 points on Monday, the day the
committee had its first meeting, losing 47.4 points from the day
before.
	   More measures were expected next week, the newspaper said,
adding that there was panic trading on Monday especially among
small investors.
	   The exchange lists 77 companies, but trading is restricted to
Kuwaitis and nationals of the other Arab states in the Gulf: Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.

	   TEHRAN, IRAN (AP) _ The National Iranian Drilling Company (NIDC)
has completed drilling of the first well in Turkmenistan's offshore
Caspian waters, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The well, 4,350 meters (14,355 feet) deep, is at the Limanov
field where earlier tests had indicated the presence of natural gas
and liquid gas, the agency said.
	   The NIDC is to drill three more wells for Turkmenistan.
	   The NIDC has been subcontracted to carry out the drilling work
by the Malaysian firm, Petronas, which has undertaken to carry out
prospecting operations for oil in the Caspian Sea for Turkmenistan,
the agency said.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's energy and mining minister was
quoted Tuesday as saying that the country will be self-sufficient
in oil next year, saving some dlrs 450 million a year in import
bills.
	   The minister, Awad Jazz, told the official daily al-Anbaa that
Sudan is investing dlrs 3.5 billion in the oil industry and 47
international oil companies are now engaged in oil and mining
projects inside the country.
	   Jazz said Sudan has already signed 12 agreements with
international companies for mineral and gold prospects.
	   He said Sudan currently exports five tons of gold in a
Sudanese-French venture.

Bishop resigns following fraud allegations

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A months-long upheaval in the Cyprus
Orthodox church over fraud allegations against a bishop was settled
quietly Tuesday with the cleric's resignation and temporary
suspension from ecclesiastical duties.
	   However, an independent inquiry by the Cypriot attorney-general
into fraud allegations involving Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol is
continuing.
	   An official announcement by the Holy Synod of the Cyprus
Orthodox Church said the synod accepted Chrysanthos' resignation
submitted the previous day and imposed a two-year suspension on him
from involvement ``in every holy duty.''
	   This means that the bishop retains his rank and will continue to
live in the official residence but will not conduct church
services, explained synod secretary Archimandrite Vassilios
Papafotis.
	   The synod reached its verdict after considering a report by a
special committee of bishops which found Chrysanthos was involved
in fraud and profiteering through currency speculation and had
taken advantage of his office for illicit profit.
	   Bishop Chrysanthos has rejected charges he made personal profits
from his actions. But he apologized to the synod for becoming
naively involved in alleged quick-profit schemes to raise funds for
charity.

Palestinians clash with Israeli troops after funeral of student
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians marched
Tuesday in the funeral procession of a 23-year-old university
student who was found beaten to death near a Jewish settlement.
	   Two dozen Palestinians broke away from the march and threw
stones and empty bottles at Israeli troops who responded with
rubber bullets, injuring one protester.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement blamed Jewish settlers for the death
of Sabah Abu Sneineh, whose body was found Saturday in an abandoned
building near the Neve Daniel settlement.
	   However, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said there was
no reason to believe settlers were involved in the killing. She
said Israeli police suspected Palestinian assailants were
responsible for the woman's death.
	   Menuhin did not offer a possible motive. However, each year
there are several incidents in which Palestinian women are slain by
male relatives over perceived violations of the family's honor.
	   In a leaflet circulated on Monday, Fatah said Abu Sneineh was a
``daughter of Fatah'' and claimed settlers killed her in hopes of
disrupting the implementation of the recent land-for-security
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   In Tuesday's funeral procession, Abu Sneineh's body was wrapped
in a Palestinian flag and carried through the streets of Hebron.
Some 400 Palestinians joined the march, many of them Fatah members.
``We do not want to see any settlers,'' the crowed chanted.
	   Some 20 Palestinians threw rocks and empty bottles at Israeli
troops standing at a checkpost near the cemetery.
	   Israeli troops are deployed in downtown Hebron to protect about
450 Jewish settlers living there. The Palestinian Authority
controls the remainder of the city of 130,000 Palestinians.

Iranian official condemns attack on bus carrying American tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian government official condemned the
attack on a bus carrying American tourists, saying visitors to Iran
were entitled to protection.
	   Assailants, chanting ``Death to America,'' used stones and metal
bars Saturday to smash the windows of a bus carrying a group of 13
foreigners, mostly Americans, after hard-line newspapers accused
them of being spies.
	   ``This kind of behavior is unacceptable to the government,''
Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh was quoted Tuesday as
saying in the Iran News.
	   ``Any person who has entered the country legally is entitled to
protection,'' he was quoted as telling the newspaper.
	   On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington denied any of the
visiting Americans were government officials or had links to the
CIA. The group left Iran on Sunday.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group largely dormant since
Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, claimed responsibility for the bus
attack in a statement Monday.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' said the statement, apparently
referring to President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between Americans and Iranians.
	   Tajzadeh also condemned the murder earlier this week of an
Iranian opposition figure and his wife.
	   ``The government is obliged to provide security for all the
country's citizens. The lives of the people must be protected, even
if they are our opponents,'' the paper quoted Tajzadeh as saying.
	   Dariush Foruhar and his wife were found stabbed to death at
their Tehran home Sunday. Foruhar was the leader of the People's
Party of Iran, a small opposition group that is tolerated by the
government.
	   Khatami today asked the Interior Ministry to form a committee to
investigate Foruhar's death and bring his killers to justice,
Iranian radio reported.

Preservation body completes purchase of Mount Snowdon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thanks to a million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) from
the Welsh actor Sir Anthony Hopkins and hundreds of other public
donations, the National Trust announced Tuesday that it has
completed the purchase of 4,000 acres (1,620 hectares) of Wales'
highest mountain.
	   The National Trust, a charity that protects much of Britain's
natural and historic heritage, raised the total 3.65 million pounds
(dlrs 5.8 million) price tag for Mount Snowdon 10 days ahead of a
deadline set for the property to go on the open market.
	   It will be a national park, open to the public.
	   ``We intend ... to sensitively manage the estates and ensure
access forever,'' said Peter Broomhead, the trust's director for
Wales, who shook hands on the deal with the seller, farmer Richard
Williams.
	   The trust said money is still pouring into the appeal fund. Any
cash left over will be used to maintain the land and its buildings.
The purchase price also includes sheep which graze the area.
	   Hopkins, who was born in Port Talbot, Wales, is chairman of the
trust's Snowdonia Appeal, which raises money for protection of the
land it already owns.
	   The case was due to continue Wednesday.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Foreigners account for one in five of
the Swiss population _ one of the top rates in Europe _ according
to a government study presented Tuesday.
	   The Federal Statistics Office said that of the 1.5 million
foreigners, only 82,000 were asylum seekers. Many of the others
have been in Switzerland for many years.
	   Geneva, which is home to U.N. and other international

EU warns Turkey against Italian trade boycott
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BRU101-104
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Tuesday warned
Turkey it could face retaliatory sanctions from the whole 15-nation
EU if it boycotts Italian imports over Rome's refusal to extradite
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``A boycott by Turkey or Turkish public companies would be a
clear violation of our accords,'' said European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
	   At a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema, Santer said the EU would seek urgent consultations with
Turkey, if it introduces sanctions on Italy. ``If those
consultations don't work, the Union could legitimately impose
retaliation,'' Santer said.
	   Turkish ministers have said the country will ban Italian firms
from seeking defense contracts and Italian television networks will
be excluded from Turkish cables. Hundreds of companies have also
announced boycotts of Italian goods amid widespread outrage in
Turkey over Italy's refusal to hand Ocalan over.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed some 37,000 people. Turkey says
Ocalan is a terrorist and should be brought to trial.
	   Italy's constitution forbids it from extraditing suspects to
countries where they may face the death penalty. The 15 EU nations
issued a statement over the weekend backing Italy's stance.
	   ``It is important we express our solidarity with Italy as it
applies rights enshrined in its constitution,'' Santer said.
	   The conflict seems certain to further harm Turkey's relations
with the EU which have been strained since last December when the
EU leaders pushed Turkey to the back of a line of 12 nations
seeking to join the Union.
	   Lousewies van der Laan, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the EU's
executive Commission, said good-neighborly relations with EU
nations were a prerequisite for membership.
	   ``If Turkey would violate the customs union we have with them,
that would not be a particularly good sign,'' she told reporters.
	   The customs union signed in 1995 and other agreements call for
free trade in most goods between Turkey and the EU. However,
neither television nor defense contracts are covered. The Turkish
government has distanced itself from other boycotts claiming they
are spontaneous protests by private companies.
	   ``The government has not said one word about a trade boycott to
Italy but ... anti-Italian feelings are so high now that people
don't feel like using Italian products,'' said Turkey's ambassador
in Rome Inal Batu.
	   However, D'Alema blamed the authorities in Ankara for inciting
anti-Italian fervor. ``Obviously, the Turkish government has
created a spirit of hostility, even violence, toward Italian
interests,'' he said. ``There have been public statements that
would suggest violation of existing accords.''
	   Both Santer and D'Alema said they hoped the dispute could be
resolved through negotiation without it coming to a trade war.
	   ``We don't want to damage the Turkish economy, quite the
reverse,'' the Italian leader said. ``On the other hand we don't
want our interests damaged.''

South Africa delays registration for half country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with number of soldiers taking part, opposition
criticism, denial of May 19 date; RECASTS; no pickup
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Tuesday hit
its first major snag on the road to next year's landmark elections
when officials postponed registration for half the country.
	   Just three days before registration was to start, the
Independent Electoral Commission said it wasn't ready to sign up
all 25 million eligible voters. Next year's election will be the
first since the African National Congress swept to power in the
balloting that ended apartheid. No date has been set.
	   People were supposed to register Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Now, registration will be held in only five northern provinces,
including Johannesburg's Gauteng Province, which account for about
half the eligible voter pool.
	   The other four provinces, including Cape Town's province, will
hold registration Dec. 3-5. Two more three-day periods will be
added on in January and February for any overflow, said the chief
electoral officer, Mandla Mchunu.
	   Commission officials told reporters that the southern provinces
needed more time to train the 72,000 civil servants nationwide
offered by the African National Congress government to staff the
registration.
	   The commission had to turn to the public employees because it
did not receive enough government funds to hire its own workers.
The military said 8,200 soldiers will take part.
	   Controversy over the registration has been brewing for weeks.
	   More than 5 million people are estimated to lack updated
identification documents, which contain a bar-code to ensure
accuracy, that are needed to register and vote.
	   Red tape and confusion have hindered many from acquiring the ID
or temporary piece of paper that also can be used to register. Most
of those lacking the new document are whites because blacks rushed
to replace their restrictive apartheid-era IDs after the fall of
white minority rule.
	   The ANC has insisted on the bar-coded IDS as the only entry into
the voting booth, causing an outcry from the mainly white-supported
opposition parties.
	   The opposition National Party, which denied the vote to blacks
for decades as rulers under apartheid, immediately denounced the
registration postponement. It ``has confirmed that our country is
at present being governed by a bunch of incompetent people,'' said
party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk.
	   News reports also cite a low rate in some provinces of civil
servant volunteers -- particularly the southern provinces.
	   In a nationally broadcast speech Tuesday, President Nelson
Mandela said difficulties were to be expected given the scope of
the first-time exercise.
	   ``But the work that has been done so far and the goodwill that
has been shown gives me the confidence that we will succeed,'' he
said.
	   The vast majority of people don't even know where to register.
Elections officials on Wednesday and Thursday plan a ``knock and
drop'' campaign of visiting every home in each election district
and dropping off pamphlets with the information.
	   Mchunu said the commission was urging Mandela to settle on May
election date, before the weather worsened and days shortened in
the southern hemisphere fall.
	   Mandela called a May 19 date mentioned in news reports Tuesday
``speculation by journalists.''
	   The first all-race elections, in 1994, were held without
registration. But the new constitution of post-apartheid South
Africa requires a complete, national voters roll.

Palestinians clash with Israeli troops after funeral of student
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians marched
Tuesday in the funeral procession of a 23-year-old university
student who was found beaten to death near a Jewish settlement.
	   Two dozen Palestinians broke away from the march and threw
stones and empty bottles at Israeli troops, who responded with
rubber bullets, injuring one protester.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement have blamed Jewish settlers for the
death of Sabah Abu Sneineh, whose body was found Saturday in an
abandoned building near the Neve Daniel settlement.
	   However, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said there was
no reason to believe settlers were involved in the killing. She
said Israeli police suspected Palestinian assailants were
responsible for the woman's death.
	   Menuhin did not offer a possible motive. However, each year
several Palestinian women are slain by male relatives over
perceived violations of the family's honor.
	   In a leaflet circulated on Monday, Fatah said Abu Sneineh was a
``daughter of Fatah'' and claimed settlers killed her to disrupt
the implementation of the recent land-for-security agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   In Tuesday's funeral procession, Abu Sneineh's body was wrapped
in a Palestinian flag and carried through the streets of Hebron.
Some 400 Palestinians joined the march, many of them Fatah members.
``We do not want to see any settlers,'' the crowed chanted.
	   Some 20 Palestinians threw rocks and empty bottles at Israeli
troops standing at a checkpost near the cemetery.
	   Israeli troops are deployed in downtown Hebron to protect about
450 Jewish settlers living there. The Palestinian Authority
controls the remainder of the city of 130,000 Palestinians.

Ocalan assails Russian government for refusal to provide asylum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan criticized
the Russian government for its refusal to grant him political
asylum in an interview published Tuesday.
	   His plea for asylum was backed by the Communist-led Russian
parliament, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov responded with ``a
firm no,'' Ocalan said in an interview with the Russian business
daily Kommersant. ``I believe that decision was a mistake.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   He is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death
penalty.
	   Ocalan was freed from a Rome hospital Saturday by a court
decision. He had been in custody since he arrived in Italy on a
false passport Nov. 12.
	   Ocalan said Moscow had refused to offer him asylum because of
pressure from United States and Turkey.
	   ``I don't bear any grudge against Russia,'' Ocalan said in the
interview. ``Your country is in a difficult position itself.''
	   Ocalan was speaking from Italy, where he said he was staying in
a ``reliable place'' under the protection of both his bodyguards
and the Italian police.
	   Ocalan said he had to fled his base in Syria in October after
Turkey threatened air strikes, and arrived in Russia on Oct. 9 on a
false passport because he had failed to receive Moscow's permission
to enter.
	   He said he was initially staying in Moscow suburbs, but gave
himself away by using his cellular phone to call his comrades
abroad, which allowed the Israeli intelligence service Mossad to
trace him and alert Turkey.
	   When Turkish officials began asking Moscow about his
whereabouts, Ocalan fled to other former Soviet republics and
finally landed in Rome.
	   An Italian court refused to consider a Turkish arrest warrant
because of Italy's policy against extradition of any person who
could face the death penalty. Ocalan said in the interview that he
hopes to get asylum in Italy as early as this month.
	   Turkish Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey would make
a formal request for extradition later this week.

Indonesia criticizes Portugal over suspension of East Timor talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with students end protest, report on shooting, grafs
13-18 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims
that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and
criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the
future of the troubled territory.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly
wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last
week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese
rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.
	   East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Belo, has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed
near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
	   The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said that so far, only 11
bodies had been identified.
	   Alatas said the claims of a massacre were not true.
	   ``The Portuguese delegation, without checking the truth of the
information, decided to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue,''
Antara quoted Alatas as saying.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said some deaths had
occurred in fights between rebels and Indonesian forces. However,
it could not confirm claims that dozens of people had been killed.
	   Alatas said it was the third time that Portugal had unilaterally
suspended talks over East Timor since 1986.
	   Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about
Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported.
	   In response, Portugal's Foreign Ministry accused Indonesia of
breaking promises to reduce its military presence in East Timor and
called for a permanent U.N. mission in the disputed territory.
	   ``Unfortunately, Indonesia has increased its deployment and the
brutality of its military actions in East Timor,'' said ministry
spokesman Horacio Cesar.
	   Meanwhile, about 500 students ended their noisy but peaceful
rally outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili Tuesday
after receiving promises that the reported killings would be
investigated.
	   In a dialogue with the students' representatives, Governor
Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman
agreed to set up a team to make a thorough investigation.
	   The group earlier had spent one night occupying the provincial
Parliament and vowed to stay at the governor's office.
	   The students also demanded a total withdrawal of Indonesian
soldiers from East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, an unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, was
reported to have shot and wounded Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in
Baucau, 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Dili.
	   Izildo, 30, who was shot Sunday, was being treated at a military
hospital in Dili.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations, however, does not recognize Indonesia's
claim.
	   Before being suspended, the talks centered on an Indonesian
offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.

Mineblast, gunbattle kill 10 people in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A land mine blew up two patrol jeeps of a
crack antiterrorist outfit Tuesday in Kashmir, where Muslim
insurgents are fighting a separatist war. Six policemen were killed
and four were seriously wounded, police said.
	   Elsewhere in India's state of Jammu-Kashmir, two military men
and two militants died in a fierce gunbattle, the state's
Inspector-General of Police P.K. Gill said.
	   The land mine explosion occurred on a mountainous road in the
Sriguhphara region 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Srinagar,
the state's summer capital, when members of the Special Task Force
was patrolling in the region.
	   The gunbattle was further south in Bagla village, 230 kilometers
(143 miles) from Srinagar, Gill said.
	   The Jammu-Kashmir government formed the task force in 1996 to
ease the pressure on the military, which is fighting a 9-year-old
rebellion by nearly a dozen militant groups demanding either
independence or a merger with neighboring Pakistan. India accuses
Pakistan of arming and funding the insurgency.
	   The state is divided between them with both claiming the whole
territory. The two nations have fought two of their three wars in
the last 50 years over their rival claims to the region.

Opposition parties boycott meeting with President Emil
</HEADLINE>
Constantinescu

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Opposition leaders said Tuesday they
would not attend a meeting called by President Emil Constantinescu
to discuss the country's strategy for NATO membership and dealing
with a political crisis that is paralyzing economic reform.
	   It was the latest standoff among Romania's politicians. The
four-party ruling coalition is fractured by rifts, and dialogue
between parties on different sides of the political divide is
almost nonexistent.
	   Last week, three opposition parties withdrew from parliament
after their attempts to stage a no-confidence vote in the
government were stymied by the government coalition parties.
	   Opposition politicians said there was no point attending the
meeting scheduled at the presidential palace later Tuesday.
	   ``We agree that Romania should join NATO,'' said Corina Cretu, a
spokeswoman from the main opposition Party of Social Democracy.
``The political crisis should be resolved in parliament, where it
started.''
	   The nationalist Party of National Unity said the discussion
about NATO was irrelevant because the governing coalition, which
came to power two years ago, had hurt Romania's chances of joining
the military alliance with its policies.
	   Romania badly wanted to join NATO, but was told in July 1997
that it was not ready economically, unlike Hungary and the Czech
Republic, its former Soviet block allies, which were invited to
join.
	   Romania still hopes for NATO membership, although its chances
have diminished, partly due to political feuding and a failure to
reform the economy.

	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Sainz broke down just
300 meters (yards) from the finish line of the final stage of
Britain's season-ending Network Q Rally Tuesday, handing Tommi
Makinen a record third straight world title.
	   Sainz, going for this third world title and his first since

	   Sainz was set to finish the race in the fourth place or better

bidding for a record third consecutive world title _ slid out of
the race on Sunday when he skidded on a patch of oil and hit a
concrete pillar.
	   By not finishing the race, Sainz remained two points behind
Makinen in the final season points standings.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras winning first match &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras began his bid to make
tennis history Tuesday by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 at
the start of the ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in row, crushed the same opponent he beat
in last year's final, when he won his fourth title in the elite
season-ending tournament.
	   He rolled through the first set with his powerful
serve-and-volley game, making few errors and keeping Kafelnikov on
the defensive.
	   Sampras also broke the Russian's serve in the opening game of
the second set. But Kafelnikov battled back when his passing shots
found their range and he pulled level at 3-3.
	   It proved to be a brief revival for Kafelnikov. Sampras won the
next two games and had a match point at 5-3, but Kafelnikov hit a
service winner to save himself.
	   Sampras had trouble closing the match. He wasted four more match
points, one on a double-fault and had to fight off a break point.
But two straight backhand errors by Kafelnikov finally gave Sampras
the victory after 66 minutes.
	   Karol Kucera played Carlos Moya in a later match.
	   Marcelo Rios, who trails Sampras by only 33 points in the
rankings and has a shot at taking over the No. 1 spot in final year
rankings, played the last match of the day, against Tim Henman.
	   Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5
million tournament that brings together the eight players with the
best results in the year. The round-robin portion consists of two
four-man groups, with two players from each advancing to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras now has a 10-2 career lead over Kafelnikov and has won
heir last six matches. He beat Kafelnikov in three quick sets in
last year's final.
	   To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically has to keep pace with
the Chilean. Rios needs to win at least two round-robin matches to
have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each group advance to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras has finished the last five years as No. 1 in the world,
a record he shares with Connors, the fellow American who did it
from 1974 to 1978.

EU warns Turkey against Italian trade boycott
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Tuesday warned
Turkey it could face retaliatory sanctions from the whole 15-nation
EU if it boycotts Italian imports over Rome's refusal to extradite
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``A boycott by Turkey or Turkish public companies would be a
clear violation of our accords,'' said European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
	   At a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema, Santer said the EU would seek urgent consultations with
Turkey, if it introduces sanctions on Italy. ``If those
consultations don't work, the Union could legitimately impose
retaliation,'' Santer said.
	   Turkish ministers have said the country will ban Italian firms
from seeking defense contracts and Italian television networks will
be excluded from Turkish cables. Hundreds of companies have also
announced boycotts of Italian goods amid widespread outrage in
Turkey over Italy's refusal to hand over Ocalan.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed some 37,000 people. Turkey says
Ocalan is a terrorist and should be brought to trial.
	   Italy's constitution forbids it from extraditing suspects to
countries where they may face the death penalty. The 15 EU nations
issued a statement over the weekend backing Italy's stance.
	   ``It is important we express our solidarity with Italy as it
applies rights enshrined in its constitution,'' Santer said.
	   The conflict seems certain to further harm Turkey's relations
with the EU, which have been strained since last December when the
EU leaders pushed Turkey to the back of a line of 12 nations
seeking to join the Union.
	   Both Santer and D'Alema said they hoped the dispute could be
resolved through negotiation without it coming to a trade war.
	   ``We don't want to damage the Turkish economy, quite the
reverse,'' the Italian leader said. ``On the other hand we don't
want our interests damaged.''

Indonesian students press their demands in the streets again

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,000 student protesters
occupied the attorney general's office Tuesday to press their
demand that former President Suharto be put on trial.
	   Another 2,000 campus activists staged separate anti-government
rallies as Indonesia's military chief warned that protests would
persist until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999.
	   The military said 163 soldiers involved in deadly clashes with
students had been confined to their barracks for three weeks. Most
of them allegedly fired at protesters without permission from their
superiors.
	   At least nine student protesters were killed in fighting with
soldiers Nov. 13 during a government assembly on reforms of
Indonesia's rigid political system.
	   Although armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto had ordered riot
officers to carry only blanks and plastic bullets, hospital doctors
said they found metal bullet fragments in some victims.
	   More than 1,000 students entered the compound of the office of
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to demand a trial of Suharto
on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   The 77-year-old former army general quit in May after riots and
protests against his three-decade authoritarian rule.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby as student representatives held talks with Ghalib.
	   He refused to accept their demands that Suharto be put on trial
within one month. About 200 students remained late Tuesday in the
building, pledging to stay until their proposals were met.
	   President B.J. Habibie has ordered a new corruption inquiry
aimed at Suharto after an earlier investigation by Ghalib turned up
no evidence of wrongdoing and was labeled a whitewash by critics.
	   Habibie has partly dismantled the tightly controlled system
crafted by his former mentor, Suharto, legalizing political parties
and freeing some political prisoners.
	   He has scheduled general elections in May or June 1999, but
students doubt he is sincere about democratic change and suspect he
wants to preserve the political privileges of his allies.
	   Wiranto said he expected student protesters to continue to push
their demands, which include the ouster of Habibie and an end to
the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement. ... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   Wiranto was the target of 300 student protesters who marched
near the presidential palace, urging that he take responsibility
for the Nov. 13 student killings.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' chanted the students from the
prestigious University of Indonesia.
	   Those clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta, and
a total of 16 people died.
	   Protesters rallied in several areas of Jakarta Tuesday. Security
forces blocked 1,000 students who tried to walk along a toll road
toward Parliament as well as 250 activists attempting to march on
Suharto's heavily guarded home in an exclusive suburb.
	   Habibie said continuing turmoil has slowed efforts to revive
Indonesia's sick economy even though the fragile rupiah has
recently climbed in value.
	   ``Unfortunately, this progress has been countered by social and
political unrest,'' Habibie said in a speech.
	   Violence also erupted in the Indonesian capital Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.

New Lebanese president taking over in rare peaceful transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Lahoud's pledge to punish thieves and
stick with Syria on negotiations with Israel; EDITS to conform and
tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Emile Lahoud was sworn in Tuesday as
Lebanon's president, marking the first peaceful transition of power
in the country in nearly three decades.
	   Lahoud, Lebanon's 11th president since independence from France
55 years ago, was inaugurated after Elias Hrawi's nine-year
extended term expired at midnight Monday. Two presidents have taken
over after assassinations.
	   With a copy of Lebanon's Constitution in his left hand, Lahoud,
62, took the oath of office before a chamber packed with lawmakers,
Cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats and foreign legislators.
	   He pledged to hold politicians accountable and severely punish
thieves in a public service plagued by corruption and cronyism. He
also said people want honest courts and an administration free of
the political and sectarian meddling typical of past governments.
	   ``It is the people's right, before anything else, that they see
how the decent are rewarded and how a thief's hand is chopped off,
whoever that may be,'' he said in a speech repeatedly interrupted
by applause.
	   The ceremony was broadcast live on state-run television and
radio.
	   Lahoud was elected by Parliament on Oct. 15 after winning
popular support and the approval of President Hafez Assad of Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   A general who had commanded the army since 1989, he rebuilt a
force decimated by the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet is
expected to resign this week. The architect of Lebanon's
reconstruction program, Hariri was expected to be named again as
prime minister by Lahoud.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, is part of the
power-sharing arrangement based on religion established with
Lebanon's 1943 independence from France: the president is Maronite,
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a
Shiite Muslim.
	   When Hrawi became president in 1989, the state was fractured and
battles raged between Christians and Muslims. Today, the country is
rebuilding itself, order has been restored and the armed forces
have re-established state authority.
	   ``It was my destiny to take over a state that was in collapse
and disarray, and I hand over a unified nation,'' Hrawi said in a
televised farewell speech Monday night.
	   Tuesday also was the first orderly, nonviolent transfer of power
in the downtown Parliament headquarters since 1970, when Suleiman
Franjieh was sworn in.
	   Lahoud said Lebanon will stick with Syria in any future
negotiations with Israel. Lebanon has rejected Israel's attempts to
strike a separate deal for withdrawal from an occupied zone in the
south and insisted on a withdrawal as well from Syria's Golan
Heights.
	   Israel has controlled a border zone in the south since 1985,
saying it was necessary to protect its northern communities from
cross-border guerrilla raids. It captured the Golan in the 1967
Mideast war.

	   KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park
will limit the number of day-trippers during the holiday season to
prevent crowding, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Luther Masukusaid the southern and far northern
sections of the park were particularly vulnerable to crowding over
busy periods.
	   Each of the eight entrances will have a maximum quota of day
visitors. At the Paul Kruger gate, 750 people will be allowed in,
500 each at Numbi, Malelane, Orpen and Phalaborwa, and 300 each at
Punda Maria, Crocodile Bridge and Pafuri.
	   Day visits can be booked, he said.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army ordered 1.2 million
condoms in an effort to curb the spread of the AIDS virus among its
troops, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said the condoms will
be purchased from Commercial Marketing Strategies, a program funded
by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   David Kanyoro, CMS sales manager, said the military placed the
order as part of an urgent campaign to promote safe sex and stop
the spread of the immune-stripping disease among soldiers and their
families.
	   CMS last week donated 100,000 condoms to the army in recognition
of the large order and to serve the army while its order is filled,
Kanyoro said.
	   Uganda, which had the highest AIDS rate in the world in 1982, is
the only African country south of the Sahara to achieve a decline
in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A bus and heavy goods truck collided
Tuesday, killing 26 people and injuring 15, most of them seriously,
state radio reported.
	   The bus was headed south when it crashed into a truck carrying
fertilizer 180 kilometers (110 miles) from Harare near the town of
Mvuma.
	   Of the dead, 22 were women on shopping trips to neighboring
South Africa, to buy cheaper consumer goods to sell at home, the
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Police appealed for relatives of passengers known to be
traveling to South Africa by bus to come forward to identify the
victims.
	   Long distance bus crashes are common in Zimbabwe and are mostly
blamed on speeding and poor maintenance of vehicles.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni is undecided on
attending the Francophone summit Thursday at the invitation of the
French President Jacques Chirac, an aide said.
	   ``The president was invited but I cannot confirm his
attendance,'' Hope Kivengere, Museveni's press secretary, said
Tuesday.
	   The meeting is a gathering of former colonies of France, the
majority of them African.
	   A privately owned newspaper, The Crusader, said Tuesday that
non-French speaking countries which are involved in the Congolese
war like Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have been invited.
	   It was immediately impossible to verify The Crusaders report.
	   English-speaking Namibia and Zimbabwe and Portuguese-speaking
Angola have sent troops to help Congolese President Laurent Kabila
fight a rebellion in the country's east.
	   The rebellion is mostly by ethnic Tutsi, disaffected troops and
Kabila's opponents. The are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A regional workshop focusing on the
rights of refugee children and teen-agers in West Africa opened
Tuesday in the Ivory Coast's commercial capital of Abidjan.
	   Among those attending the four-day meeting organized by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are health ministers
and social workers from six West African countries as well as
representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund.
	   The major goal of the workshop is to strengthen efforts of
individuals involved in refugee work with children, UNHCR regional
operations head Abou Moussa said.
	   Other topics on the agenda include the demobilization of child
soldiers, displaced children, and the setting up of an action plan
to help protect child refugees.
	   The workshop sessions end Friday.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Food prices in Burundi have increased by
more than 110 percent since the imposition of economic sanctions by
the tiny Central African nation's neighbors, the Rome-based U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization said Tuesday.
	   The FAO Agricultural Emergency Coordination Unit said in a
report average food costs increased from Burundi francs 5,200 (dlrs
7.40) per week to 11,000 francs (dlrs 15.70). The agency has been
collecting data on 35 food products, fuel and exchange rates on a
weekly basis since 1996.
	   Rural production has been stymied because of reduced transport
to markets due to fuel shortages and insecurity, the report said.
	   Less than a week after President Pierre Buyoya overthrew a weak
coalition government on July 25, 1996, Burundi's neighbors imposed
the sanctions.
	   The seven countries want to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army
major, to restore democratic instutitions, which he has partially
done.
	   --
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Britain's outgoing ambassador to Angola
Roger Hart on Tuesday expressed disappointment over the country's
ailing peace process, and announced the prospect of two British
companies operating in the southwest African country.
	   Hart said oil company British Petroleum was interested in
exploring Angola's prolific offshore waters, but gave no further
details.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-biggest oil exporter after
Nigeria. Oil production, which is mostly offshore, largely escaped
the effects of the two-decade civil war that ended in 1994. It is
the government's single largest source of revenue.
	   Hart _ to be replaced by Caroline Helms Dec. 3 _ also announced
the possibility of British Airways starting regular flights to the
Angolan capital Luanda in March.

Cyprus protests airspace violations by Turkish warplanes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus said Tuesday it has protested to
the United Nations and to international aviation authorities over
repeated violations of its airspace by Turkish warplanes recently.
	   One protest was over flights by Turkish warplanes bound for
Israel and another was over last week's landing of Turkish planes
in the Turkish-occupied north of the island during military
exercises, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kornelios Korneliou said.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou had complained on
Monday about these flights, saying a formal protest should be made
to Israel as well as to the U.N. and aviation authorities.
	   But Korneliou said Israel was left out of the protest because no
Israeli planes were involved in the violations.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north following the 1974 Turkish invasion and
occupation of the northern third of the island. A breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by Ankara which
maintains 35,000 troops there.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Governors in former communist eastern Germany want
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's support in bringing their
economically downtrodden states to an equal level with the more
prosperous west.
	   The five eastern state leaders, plus the mayor of the city-state
of Berlin, meet with the chancellor for the first time Tuesday
night. They want Schroeder to make development of the east a
``priority,'' Thuringia state leader Bernhard Vogel said.
	   Unemployment is almost twice as high in the east as in the west,
just one example of the east's ongoing struggle to adapt to a
market economy eight years after German reunification.
	   Vogel said one topic at the meeting will be low-wage jobs, which
the eastern economy especially needs.
	   Also up for discussion are plans for an additional energy tax to
go toward environmental protection, he said. The governors want the
tax waived for the east, where the overhaul of electrical
facilities after communism means energy already costs more than in
the west. Governors fear the increased energy costs will further
discourage investors.

Kosovo rebels free Serb policeman

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo Monitors &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels freed a
kidnapped Serb policeman Tuesday after U.S. diplomatic observers
intervened to persuade them to let him go.
	   The release ``was a gesture of good will by the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' KLA representative Adem Demaci said, adding that
Serb authorities should now ``start releasing detained Albanians
and turn over a new leaf in our relations.''
	   Yugoslav authorities have reportedly detained hundreds of ethnic
Albanians on suspicion of membership in the KLA, which they
consider a terrorist organization. Guerrilla hostages have been
Serbs or Albanians considered loyal to Serb authorities.
	   The KLA, at the forefront of the armed struggle for
majority-Albanian Kosovo's independence from Serbia, was still
believed holding two ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished last
Tuesday along with the policeman.
	   Despite last month's agreement aimed at ending hostilities
between the KLA and the joint Serb-Yugoslav forces opposing them,
isolated fighting continues. The Serbs accuse the guerrillas of
attacking them, while the KLA says it is only responding to attacks
from Serb police.
	   Foreign observers of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission have
been talking with both sides in recent weeks, concerned by an
increase of shooting incidents blamed on both Serbs and rebels.
	   Tuesday's prearranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran
Zbiljic took place near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial
capital, Pristina.
	   It was negotiated by American members of the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission _ the main foreign monitoring force in Kosovo
until a recently approved international verification mission is
launched.
	   While the observers looked on and armed guerrillas stood watch
nearby, a KLA vehicle drove up and Zbiljic stepped out. He said he
had been kept alone in a room throughout his detention but had not
been mistreated or beaten.
	   ``War is not good. There has to be peace,'' he said as he
stepped out of the car. ``As soon as possible, the politicians have
to do something because people are dying, people are suffering.''
	   Colleagues shook Zbiljic's hand and embraced him. He had been
accused by the KLA of looting abandoned ethnic Albanian houses.
	   After talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill late
Monday, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic condemned ``terrorist
acts'' by the KLA .
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in Kosovo. Most advocate independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were killed and
hundreds of thousands displaced during fighting after a crackdown
by Serb and Yugoslav authorities from February to October.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement led to a withdrawal of many Yugoslav forces
and a fragile cease-fire. But violence continues as international
officials try to produce a political settlement on Kosovo's future
status.
	   Ethnic Albanians have rejected the latest offer by the Serbs to
negotiate over Kosovo without the foreign mediation they demand.

Prince's charity pleads guilty over death of two volunteers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORTH RONALDSAY, Scotland (AP) _ A charity set up by Prince
Charles to help young people pleaded guilty Tuesday to breaching
safety rules by allowing two inexperienced volunteers to work
beneath a huge slab of concrete that later collapsed, killing them.
	   Rescuers worked for seven hours to save Gary Leaburn, 25, and
Derek Taylor, 19, who were crushed as they laid concrete under the
five-ton slab, part of a sea wall on the Scottish Orkney island of
North Ronaldsay on Aug. 6, 1997.
	   Prosecutor Graeme Napier told the Kirkwall Sheriff's Court in
Orkney that all sides agreed the pair were ``not competent'' to
carry out what was a major structural engineering job organized by
the Prince's Trust.
	   ``They should not have been involved,'' Napier said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Prince's Trust.
Spokeswoman Deborah Lincoln said they would wait until for the
sheriff's judgment, expected later Tuesday.
	   Leaburn and Taylor were among 13 volunteers from the Scottish
city of Dundee recruited to repair walls damaged in storms in 1993
at Garso Wick, on the northern shore of North Ronaldsay, the most
northerly of the Orkney islands.
	   Prince Charles, who knows the Orkneys well and went to inspect
repairs, found the islanders did not have the resources to fix the
wall, designed to keep local sheep, who live on seaweed, away from
the island's interior.
	   So teams recruited by the Prince's Trust traveled several times
to North Ronaldsay to make repairs.
	   ``It was well-known that the Prince of Wales had been
sympathetic to the problems of the islanders,'' Napier said.
	   Volunteers dug out foundations under a section of concrete sea
wall and, by the day of the accident, had excavated a large area,
he said.
	   ``The two volunteers who died were working in the hole, pouring
concrete into it at the time of the accident. There were no
supports or props holding the weight of the wall,'' Napier added.
	   He said the piece of concrete that killed the men measured 20
feet (6 meters) by 5 feet (1.5 meters) and was two feet (0.6
meters) thick in parts.
	   The Prince's Trust and the board of management of Angus College
in Arbroath are charged with contravening the Health and Safety at
Work Act. Similar charges against Colin Robertson, a former
employee of Angus College, were dropped before Tuesday's hearing.

Bosnia's top mediator denies financial irregularities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A spokesman for Bosnia's top
international mediator on Tuesday denied published allegations of
inappropriate and excessive expenditures.
	   Chris Riley, a spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, said the Monday
report in the German magazine Der Spiegel was based on innuendo.
	   The Hamburg-based magazine claimed that European Union
investigators have discovered irregularities in Westendorp's
expenditures.
	   The report came as Westendorp is preparing to ask the Western
powers to double the budget for his office in 1999 to 70 million
German marks (dlrs 41 million).
	   Officials from Westendorp's office said the accusations were
aimed at giving the new German government an excuse for reducing
participation in the peace mission in Bosnia.
	   According to Der Spiegel, investigators from the EU's auditing
office in Luxembourg questioned why Westendorp gets 6,000 marks
(dlrs 3,500) more than his predecessor, Carl Bildt, who was paid
40,000 marks (dlrs 23,500) per month.
	   Also, since taking over the job 17 months ago the Spaniard has
flown home in business class nearly every weekend to Madrid, the
report said.
	   Riley said a private consultant hired by Westendorp, Price
Waterhouse Coopers, has commended the office for its financial
management and singled out only a couple of smaller irregularities
which were immediately fixed.
	   He did not elaborate, but another official from Westendorp's
office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the irregularities
were simple accountant mistakes.
	   Riley said the article appeared to have been based on a
still-unfinished investigation of a second team the office
enlisted, from the European Court of Auditors, whose findings
remain unknown.
	   Victoria Garcia, Westendorp's personal spokeswoman, said his
salary is higher because he has three children and spends more time
in Bosnia than Bildt.
	   The salary and occasional weekend plane tickets home were agreed
upon as Westendorp's precondition before taking over the post, the
officials said.

Indonesian students press their demands in the streets again

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,000 student protesters
occupied the attorney general's office Tuesday to press their
demand that former President Suharto be put on trial.
	   Another 2,000 campus activists staged separate anti-government
rallies as Indonesia's military chief warned that protests would
persist until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999.
	   The military said 163 soldiers involved in deadly clashes with
students had been confined to their barracks for three weeks.
	   Most of them allegedly fired at protesters without permission
from their superiors and could face courts-martial pending the
results of an investigation.
	   At least nine student protesters were killed in fighting with
soldiers Nov. 13 during a government assembly on reforms of
Indonesia's rigid political system.
	   Although armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto had ordered riot
officers to carry only blanks and plastic bullets, hospital doctors
said they found metal bullet fragments in some victims.
	   More than 1,000 students entered the compound of the office of
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to demand a trial of Suharto
on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   The 77-year-old former army general quit in May after riots and
protests against his three-decade authoritarian rule.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby as student representatives held talks with Ghalib.
	   He refused to accept their demands that Suharto be put on trial
within one month. About 200 students remained late Tuesday in the
building, pledging to stay until their proposals were met.
	   President B.J. Habibie has ordered a new corruption inquiry
aimed at Suharto after an earlier investigation by Ghalib turned up
no evidence of wrongdoing and was labeled a whitewash by critics.
	   Habibie has partly dismantled the tightly controlled system
crafted by his former mentor, Suharto, legalizing political parties
and freeing some political prisoners.
	   He has scheduled general elections in May or June 1999, but
students doubt he is sincere about democratic change and suspect he
wants to preserve the political privileges of his allies.
	   Wiranto said he expected student protesters to continue to push
their demands, which include the ouster of Habibie and an end to
the military's dominant role in politics.
	   ``Some of the protesting students are now arranging a systematic
plan for their movement. ... These actions will continue until the
1999 election,'' Wiranto told a parliamentary hearing on security
and political affairs.
	   He said some students aimed ``to topple the constitutional
government.''
	   Wiranto was the target of 300 student protesters who marched
near the presidential palace, urging that he take responsibility
for the Nov. 13 student killings.
	   ``Wiranto must step down,'' chanted the students from the
prestigious University of Indonesia.
	   Those clashes triggered rioting in several areas of Jakarta, and
a total of 16 people died.
	   Protesters rallied in several areas of Jakarta Tuesday. Security
forces blocked 1,000 students who tried to walk along a toll road
toward Parliament as well as 250 activists attempting to march on
Suharto's heavily guarded home in an exclusive suburb.
	   Habibie said continuing turmoil has slowed efforts to revive
Indonesia's sick economy even though the fragile rupiah has
recently climbed in value.
	   ``Unfortunately, this progress has been countered by social and
political unrest,'' Habibie said in a speech.
	   Violence also erupted in the Indonesian capital Sunday, when
mobs of Muslim youths burned and ransacked Christian churches in
ethnic and religious rioting. Fourteen people were killed.

 &UR; South Africa's Vice President discusses cooperation with Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki said
Tuesday he focused on cooperation in investment, tourism and sports
during talks with officials in Russia, whose economic crisis is
affecting South Africa.
	   Mbeki has expressed concern about Russia's financial troubles,
which have sent stock markets plunging worldwide as panicked
investors pull out of emerging markets.
	   During his talks in Moscow, the two sides signed agreements
covering protection of capital investments and cooperation in
tourism and sports.
	   They also tried to ``identify possible areas of cooperation'' in
the weapons industry, Mbeki said.
	   ``We are ourselves very happy with the visit,'' Mbeki told a
news conference in Moscow on Tuesday. ``We were indeed very well
received by the government.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also said his talks with
Mbeki had gone well.
	   Primakov hailed the improvement in relations between Russia and
South Africa since the end of white-minority rule with South
Africa's first multi-race elections in 1994.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela will visit Russia in
April 1999 for meetings with Russian leaders, Mbeki announced
during the Moscow visit. Mandela canceled a visit to Russia last
winter amid concerns about his health.
	   Mbeki, who is expected to succeed Mandela when elections are
held next year, also met with other top Russian officials and
parliamentary leaders and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church,
Patriarch Alexy II.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with London January oil future heading to 15-year low

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure on OPEC to act to lift badly
sagging oil prices grew Tuesday as prices headed to lows not seen
in 15 years.
	   Ministers from OPEC's 11 member states hold a year-end meeting
Wednesday.
	   In London, Brent crude oil January futures trading on the
International Petroleum Exchange hit a low of dlrs 11.25 a barrel
Tuesday, down 5 cents. Prices were last this low in 1983.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
to dlrs 12.33, down six dollars from 1997's third-quarter dlrs
18.03 a barrel.
	   Publicly, OPEC members have been tightlipped on solutions to the
weak market, which promises to badly hurt economies back home.
	   Kuwait's official news agency said recently the country is
facing a 45-percent revenue drop in 1998.
	   Arriving Tuesday afternoon, Venezuelan oil minister Dr. Erwin
Jose Arrieta said only that both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers
needed to seek out new markets.
	   ``It's a ... challenge,'' said Arrieta, whose country is widely
believed to be a key offender in overproduction, an issue expected
to figure high on the talks' agenda.
	   OPEC's predicament is due an untimely decision to boost
production last winter, just as demand growth was dropping because
of Asia's financial crisis.
	   The resulting oil glut has hammered prices.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
trying to tighten compliance with production cuts introduced in
June; extending the cuts; cutting further, and calling an
exceptional heads of state meeting ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said earlier
in Dubai.
	   The United Arab Emirates has supported the idea.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6 million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC now produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in a report based on the latest October figures.
	   However, Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia are reluctant to comply,
analysts believe.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million but was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

Roche families worth an estimated dlrs 20 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The families who control
Switzerland's Roche pharmaceuticals giant are worth 25-30 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 18-21 billion), according to a list of
Switzerland's Richest published Tuesday.
	   The survey by Bilanz business magazine said the Hoffmann, Sacher
and Oeri families had managed to increase their wealth by 5 billion
francs (dlrs 3.6 billion) during the past year despite the turmoil
on international stock markets.
	   The three families _ offshoots of the Hoffmann-La-Roche company
founders _ have a majority stake in the pharmaceuticals firm. They
are traditionally at the top of the annual Swiss survey and high on
the Forbes list of billionaires worldwide.
	   The latest Forbes list, published at the end of September, said
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, was by far the world's wealthiest man
with dlrs 58.4 billion.
	   A car dealer and software entrepreneur, Walter Haefner, followed
in second place on the Swiss survey with an estimated value of 10
billion francs (dlrs 7 billion).
	   Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the Danish manufacturer of the lego
game, headed the list of newcomers. He settled in a village in the
low-tax canton (state) of Zug with a fortune estimated at 3-4
billion francs (dlrs 2.1-2.8 billion), according to Bilanz.

Makinen claims third straight world title as Sainz breaks down

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Tommi Makinen claimed a record third
straight world rally title when rival Carlos Sainz had his Toyota
engine catch fire just 300 meters (yards) from the finish Tuesday
of the Network Q Rally, depriving the Spaniard of the world title.
	   Sainz, in fourth place at the time, needed only to cross the
line at the end of the final stage to claim the overall season
title, which would have been his third.
	   Sainz's fourth place would have given him three points, one more
in the final season standings than Makinen.
	   Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi won the rally with a 3
minute 46 second advantage over second-place Juha Kankkunen's Ford
with Bruno Thiry's Ford in third.
	   Makinen, who entered the rally with a two-point lead on Sainz,
slid out of the race on Sunday's first day when he skidded on a
patch of oil and hit a concrete pillar.
	   Sainz, one of the most popular drivers on the circuit, was left
in tears on the roadside as co-driver Luis Moya smashed his crash
helmet to the ground in frustration.
	   It was a cruel finish.
	   ``Then engine blew, it couldn't have been worse,'' Sainz said.
	   ``I've been in rallying for 30 years but I've never known an
occasion like this,'' said Mitsubishi chief Andrew Cowan. ``I feel
very sorry for Carlos and the Toyota team _ they must be
devastated.''
	   Sainz was the third major star to crash out of the rally.
Makinen went out Sunday, and former world champion Colin McRae went
out with mechanical problems Monday while leading the race.

Roots of abuses burrow deep in `no rules' Turkey

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A car crash on a country road two years
ago confirmed what everyone long suspected: cozy and profitable
alliances between state officials and mobsters.
	   The Mercedes was filled with big game for corruption hunters.
The No. 2 police officer in Istanbul was at the wheel. The
passengers included a fugitive terrorist-hit man, a powerful
militia chieftain-turned-lawmaker and a former beauty queen.
	   The wreck set off a chain reaction of investigations and
allegations. On Wednesday, the scandals are expected to claim the
government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz. A confidence motion was
called following accusations that Yilmaz tried to rig the
privatization of a state-run bank in favor of a major Istanbul
contractor allegedly linked with an underworld boss.
	   A member of Yilmaz' cabinet resigned in September after the
release of taped telephone conversations with the mob boss. Yilmaz,
however, denies any ties with organized crime.
	   ``Turkey is a state with no rules,'' complained Coskun San, an
Ankara University sociologist. ``In this environment, corruption
flourishes.''
	   But to explain the malignant climate, experts look back much
further than the present crisis. Most sketch out an evolution
starting with the free-for-all modernization rush in the early
1980s. A few scholars go all the way back to the early years of the
modern Turkish state, founded 75 years ago.
	   At the time, a highly centralized military-political axis was
formed to rule over nearly every aspect of Turkish life. The state
was the sole protector and patron of the new nation.
	   ``And no leader since has been willing to let go,'' said Dogu
Ergil, president of the Foundation for the Research of Societal
Problems, an Ankara-based think tank.
	   ``Without the state, even the mafia cannot exist,'' he added.
``Everything _ every problem, every allegation of corruption _
leads back to the state. It's the hub of everything in Turkey.''
	   The present crop of corruption allegations sprouts from bad
seeds planted more than a decade ago, many experts say.
	   The period after the 1980-83 military government was marked by
intense jockeying for lucrative footholds in an economy struggling
to catch up with the West. Roads, offices and other large building
projects were launched. Analysts anticipated the advent of private
media and the telecommunications revolution. But anyone hoping to
cash in needed a state contact _ a ``good fairy,'' as some media
reports have dubbed them.
	   Meanwhile, officials were allegedly consolidating a crew of
ultra-nationalist thugs and criminals to intimidate perceived
enemies of the state. A 1997 government report accused political
and police officials of hiring hit men to target Kurdish rebels,
journalists and anti-Turkish Armenian activists since the 1980s.
	   Many ``dirty war'' members eventually linked up with mafia-style
groups to win state contracts and other concessions.
	   ``This is just another example of the misguided idea that
anything goes to protect the state,'' said Ergil.
	   One of the assassins reportedly on Turkey's payroll was Abdullah
Catli, one of the three people who died in the 1996 car accident.
	   The only survivor of the crash, parliament member Sedat Bucak,
is presently on trial on charges of forming criminal gangs. His
family runs a private army of 2,000 government-armed village guards
fighting Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey.
	   Earlier this month, demonstrators held marches around Turkey on
the second anniversary of the car accident. The main banner in the
Ankara rally read: ``We're united for a democracy against the
gangs.''
	   But some commentators believe the current order in Turkey _
entrenched politicians and a supremely powerful military _ is
incapable of significant reforms.
	   ``It's just the beginning,'' said Ismet Berkan, a political
columnist for the daily Radikal newspaper. ``It's a very, very long
process. It just got started two years ago.''

Clothes worn by DiCaprio, Madonna fetch low prices at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Clothes worn in movies by ''Titanic'' star
Leonardo DiCaprio and by the singer Madonna failed Tuesday to reach
their estimated prices at an auction of Hollywood memorabilia.
	   An outfit comprising shirt, tunic, breeches and coat worn by
DiCaprio in the masquerade sequence of the film ''The Man in the
Iron Mask'' was expected to sell for 3,000-4,000 pounds dlrs
4,800-6,400). But it went to an unidentified private American
collector for just 2,300 pounds (dlrs 3,600) at auctioneers
Bonhams.
	   A second costume worn by DiCaprio in the same film sold for
1,400 pounds (dlrs 2,200) _ 600 pounds (dlrs 960) less than the
lowest forecast.
	   A silk floral dress worn by Madonna in four sequences of the hit
film ''Evita'' went to an unidentified trade buyer for 1,400 pounds
(dlrs 2,200). It was expected to raise at least 3,000 pounds (dlrs
4,800).
	   A Bonhams spokeswoman said buyers had been cautious about
DiCaprio because he is a relatively new star.
	   ``We are really happy with the price,'' said the spokeswoman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''There's obviously a sort of
interest in his memorabilia. I am sure it will increase as he
becomes more popular.''

	   KURLINGTAR, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's first passenger cable car
Tuesday began ferrying pilgrims to one of the most popular temples
in this Hindu kingdom.
	   The 2.8 kilometer (1.5 miles) long cable line cost 430 million
rupees (dlrs six million). Nepal's crown prince Dipendra
inaugurated the ride by more than 2,000 devotees on the first day
to Manakamana Temple. Earlier, the trek to the temple took nearly
three hours.
	   Devotees believe that a pilgrimage to the Hindu goddess fulfills
their wish. The temple is 110 kilometers (miles) west of Katmandu,
the Nepalese capital.
	   More than two-thirds of Nepal is covered by hills and mountains
and many remote mountainous regions still are not accessible by
road.

Young daughter of drug addicts dies in Croatian fire

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Fire killed a 3-year-old girl and
seriously injured her three brothers after their drug-addict
parents left the pre-schoolers home alone, the state news agency
HINA said Tuesday.
	   The parents, who had previously been hospitalized for drug
addiction, were taken for psychiatric treatment after the fire
Monday night in their apartment in the southern city of Split, the
report said.
	   Drug use is rising in Croatia, particularly in southern port
towns on a traditional drug-smuggling route.

Interior Minister acknowledges reporters' phones might be tapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's interior minister said Tuesday
that journalists' phones ``are not systematically'' tapped but some
reporters were being electronically surveyed as potential threats
to state security.
	   Minister Ivan Penic reacted to a recent article in the weekly
Globus, in which Chief Editor Djurdjica Klancir said that a former
close aide to President Franjo Tudjman showed her files on Globus
staffers, including her own file _ a compilation of transcripts of
her phone conversations as well as a resume of her private life.
	   Klancir said she also saw files on other journalists.
	   ``There is no systematic tapping of journalists' phones or the
creation of their files,'' Penic said. ``But the intelligence
service has a data base of persons who in any way were a part of
the security problem.''
	   The Service for Protection of the Constitutional Order can be
authorized by Penic to watch someone when state security is
jeopardized.
	   ``No one has been tapped just because he's a journalist,
professor or an attorney, but the profession itself does not clear
someone,'' Penic said.
	   Penic's statement was likely to further sour relations between
the government and independent media, which claim they are
restricted in free and fair reporting by the authorities.
	   Many journalists believe that the service regularly monitors
those suspected of nothing more than being critical of Tudjman's
government.
	   Croatian authorities have been regularly accused by western
governments of trying to stifle media freedom.
	   The Paris-based World Association of Newspapers on Tuesday
condemned the ``judicial harassment of independent newspapers and
journalists in Croatia.''
	   The group, which says it represents 15,000 newspapers, expressed
its concern over the government monopoly on newsprint distribution
and the hundreds of lawsuits brought against independent papers by
the authorities.
	   ``Other oppressive measures, such as telephone tapping and
police harassment of journalists are becoming commonplace,'' the
media monitoring group said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wall Street's resurrection galvanized Asian
markets Tuesday, but Europe reacted coolly and stocks were mixed.
U.S. stocks took a break after Monday's big advance.
	   Shares fell in London. In late trading, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 53.6 points at
5,794.80
	   Wall Street itself had an uncertain opening. Twenty minutes into
the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 13.13 at
9,361.14 after having fluctuated between positive and negative
territory.
	   ``The market's had such a strong run, we may be in for a more
reflective period,'' said Bob Semple, an equity strategist at BT
Alex Brown.
	   The London market ``isn't going to collapse unless we get
something very grim, but at the same time, it's not looking at
all-time highs as the Dow is,'' Semple said.
	   The activity followed Monday's rise in the Dow, which climbed
214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the July 17 record of 9,337.97
and capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from last summer's lows.
	   Takeover news helped the gains as Deutsche Bank AG said it was
discussing the final details of a dlrs 9 billion deal for Bankers
Trust Corp. Internet shares led the technology group higher as
America Online Inc. said it might buy Netscape Communications Corp.
in a dlrs 4 billion deal.
	   Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply Tuesday.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared 384.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to
15,164.64. It was the first time the index had finished above the
psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug. 25.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rallied to a nearly
seven-month high. It closed at 10,851.71, up 337.18 points, or 3.2
percent, following a 2.7 percent gain Monday.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index broke through
the important 1,400-point plateau, rising 35.96 points, or 2.6
percent, to 1,412.90. Earlier in the day, it had risen even higher
to 1,421.56.
	   The return to record terrain in New York followed four months of
volatility that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to
7,467 on Oct. 8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil and its spread around the world would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the
region's financial crisis struck about 17 months ago.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng alone has gained 58 percent.
	   But some analysts warned that volatility and profit-taking
remain significant risks.
	   That was illustrated Tuesday in Madrid, where Spanish shares
fell after sharp rises as dealers took profits.

Italy's RAI Still Open To Pay-TV Deal With Telecom Italia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian state broadcaster RAI said Tuesday it
remains open to a pay-TV deal with Telecom Italia despite reports
that RAI reached a preliminary accord with France's Canal Plus to
explore a similar agreement.
	   RAI said it began talking to Canal Plus because Telecom Italia
has been slow in reaching a decision as a result of its recent
management shakeup. Telecom's new chairman Franco Bernabe was only
named Thursday.
	   The news of the RAI-Canal Plus accord came just a day after
media mogul Rupert Murdoch said his News Corp. was close to signing
a digital TV deal with Telecom Italia to run against Canal Plus'
Italian unit Telepiu.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II granted a brief audience
Tuesday to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, urging him to seek a
negotiated end to the civil war in his troubled African nation.
	   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Kabila also met with
the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, and with
Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the secretary for foreign relations.
	   Navarro-Valls said the nearly 4-month-old conflict in Congo
dominated the talks.
	   The Holy See, he said, urged a ``dialogue on either the
international or national level'' to achieve ``a peaceful solution
that safeguards the principles of territorial integrity and
national sovereignty with respect for the rights of each individual
and social group.''
	   Kabila said afterward that the pope said ``justice should be
brought back to the country to solve peace problems.''
	   He also rejected the idea of direct talks with the rebels.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''

	   ROME (AP) _ A new police chief was sworn in Tuesday in Milan, a
day after the city's top cop was arrested on murder charges in the
1995 slaying of a smuggling suspect in southern Italy.
	   Moving quickly to restore confidence in the police after the
stunning arrest, the Interior Ministry named Giovanni Finazzo, 56,
to replace Francesco Forleo, who is now in a military prison on
murder charges.
	   Finazzo was the police chief of Catania in Sicily until his
promotion to the Milan post.
	   In documents published by newspapers Tuesday, prosecutors
describe Forleo, 57, as the ``nastiest of all gunmen.''

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A gloomy, overflow crowd of
thousands gathered Tuesday in a moving tribute to a slain Russian
lawmaker, a popular and vivacious woman who was buried as a
national hero.
	   The burial of Galina Starovoitova was delayed several hours
because the crowd, estimated at up to 10,000 people, lined up
outside the hall where her open casket lay and demanded a chance to
pay their final respects.
	   Starovoitova, a feisty liberal leader and member of parliament
who planned to run for president in 2000, was shot to death last
Friday evening as she walked up the stairs to her apartment with an
aide, who was critically wounded.
	   Her death has galvanized Russia's liberal reformers, deepened
the fault lines between Russia's left and right and brought forth
anguished calls to end the violence and lawlessness that has
plagued post-Soviet Russian society.
	   ``To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at a memorial
service. ``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her life for.''
	   Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most
prominent political figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St.
Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the service.
	   An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons, red-and-white
wreaths and floral bouquets, stood at the head of the hall, flanked
by a military honor guard.
	   ``Forgive us, Galina Vasiliyevna, that we who have the power
entrusted to us, we who were your colleagues, could not protect and
defend you,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, the
only woman in a top government post, her voice quavering.
	   Other speakers included former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff. Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee
the investigation into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow
hospital recovering from pneumonia.
	   ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole
of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives for that
murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and society
should know all the truth about it.''
	   Yarov was among several speakers at the service to say that
Starovoitova's death should serve as a catalyst for uniting
democratic forces. Her political allies have blamed Communists for
her death, although police have said they have no idea who killed
her.
	   Political finger-pointing aside, her death has struck a deep
chord among Russians, as demonstrated by the throngs who gathered
outside the memorial service.
	   ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this
never happens again,'' said Vadim Olshevsky, manager of a
construction company.
	   But, he added bitterly, ``There's little hope of that in our
country.''
	   One national television channel turned over its daytime
programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers
carried page after page of coverage of her death. Her political
party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn
out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 8 p.m. (1700
GMT) Tuesday.
	   After the memorial service, a private funeral was held in a
church at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in central St. Petersburg.
Then, as the Russian national anthem was played, her coffin was
lowered into its grave in the monastery's cemetery, one of Russia's
most hallowed resting places.
	   Among others buried there are the composers Peter Tchaikovsky
and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky.
	   Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior
Ministry, insisted that the case would be solved. ``It will take
time,'' he said, according to Interfax, but added that
investigators ``have tips, they have something to work on.''
	   The aide who was wounded in the attack, 27-year-old Ruslan
Linkov, has spoken to investigators, although they have cautioned
that he was unable to provide very much information.
	   Linkov, who has been heavily guarded to protect him from a
further assassination attempt, was moved out of intensive care
Tuesday, Interfax reported.

Christians protest increasing attacks in northern India

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A coalition of Christian groups accused
police and politicians Tuesday of complicity in some of the rising
number of attacks on nuns, priests and Christian schools by Hindu
nationalists.
	   The Roman Catholic archbishop of New Delhi said Christian
education institutions across the country would shut down in
protest Dec. 4 and Christians would march on Parliament to
highlight what he called rising intolerance against minorities.
	   ``The severity of violence, the geographic spread and the
complicity of police in not recognizing the crimes ... all go
against our Indian spirit of tolerance for all religions,'' the
Most Rev. Alan de Lastic said at a news conference.
	   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights compiled a list of
80 assaults in the last two years against Christian missionaries or
institutions.
	   Among the recent incidents cited by the archbishop was the rape
of four nuns in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. In a village
in Haryana near New Delhi, thugs stormed a missionary school, beat
up children and threatened two nuns, demanding that they shut down
the institution.
	   Hindu nationalists accuse missionaries of converting poor and
often illiterate low-caste Hindus to Christianity, promising relief
from the discrimination of the caste system.
	   The government has not reacted to the charges.
	   Leaders of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party and affiliated
groups have in recent weeks demanded that Christian and Muslim
minorities adopt what they describe as Indian culture if they are
to be treated as Indians.
	   The party has not spelled out what constitutes Indian culture,
but it wants the singing in schools of a Sanskrit hymn extolling
Mother India.
	   Muslims groups have bristled at the demand to sing the song,
which was popular during India's independence movement but has now
become identified as a Hindu nationalist anthem.

British watchdog cautions Med TV over reporting of Kurds in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the second time this year, Britain's
television watchdog has formally cautioned the London-based Kurdish
television station Med TV for showing bias toward Turkey's rebel
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
	   The Independent Television Commission on Monday issued a notice
to the satellite channel Med TV that it will revoke the station's
license to broadcast if it fails to bring its programming into line
in the next six months.
	   The notice ''reflects a recurrent lack of balance in political
coverage'' of the PKK, which is fighting for autonomy in the
southeast of Turkey, the ITC said in a statement.
	   The ITC said Med TV had recently breached the rules of
impartiality in two programs, Gun Ortasi and Pazar Sohbeti. ''In
the first program, a politician, Mehmet Sah, had been used as a
news reporter and included his personal views in his report,'' the
ITC said.
	   ''In the second, material had been shown which appeared to
condone, and even glorify, self-immolation.''
	   Med TV received a caution from the ITC in March. Shortly before
that, the station was fined 90,000 pounds (dlrs 144,000) for
breaching the commission's impartiality requirements.
	   The latest caution requires Med TV to provide a monthly log of
all news and factual programs specified by the ITC, detailing the
participants, their political affiliation and the airtime permitted
to them.
	   ''Med TV must not give preference to the views of
representatives or supporters of any political party of parties,
including the PKK, and politicians must not be used as news
reporters,'' the ITC said in a statement.

EU steel makers seek anti-dumping duties to punish foreign
</HEADLINE>
competitors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union steel makers filed a
complaint with the European Commission Tuesday alleging unfair
competition from cheap imports from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, South
Africa, Iran, India and Taiwan.
	   If the complaint is successful, the European Union may impose
anti-dumping duties on steel makers from the six countries.
	   The European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries, known
as Eurofer, said imports of unalloyed, hot-rolled coils _ which are
used mainly in the car and building industries _ from these
countries have caused them ``serious injury.''
	   Eurofer complained the imports in the first eight months of this
year were 320 percent more than in the same 1997 period due to
unreasonably low prices that let outside producers dump steel on
the EU market.
	   The Commission has 45 days to decide if a full anti-dumping
inquiry is warranted.
	   Eurofer Director Christian Mari predicted the European
Commission will launch such an investigation, saying, ``We think
our case is strong.''

Turkish pop star faces showdown over military service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Tarkan as one name cq &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's chart-topping pop star has chosen
song over service.
	   Tarkan says he will not report to army barracks to begin his
compulsory military stint, arguing that government officials
promised him time to promote his skyrocketing career, reports said
Tuesday.
	   Tarkan's songs have sold millions of records in Turkey and his
catchy Arabic-influenced tune ``Simarik,'' or ``Spoiled,'' reached
the top of music charts in France, where he is on a promotional
tour.
	   But military brass say they want Tarkan in fatigues. He must
begin 18 months of obligatory service Nov. 27 or face the
consequences. The showdown could lead to his arrest when he
returned to Turkey.
	   If he stays abroad, he could be branded a traitor and stripped
of his citizenship.
	   The military has been tough on celebrities in recent years,
making sure they don't get special treatment and concessions.
Military service is obligatory for men in Turkey.
	   But Tarkan, a shorter George Michael lookalike, announced
through his agent, Mehmet Sogutoglu, that he would not return to
Turkey and continue his mission as a ``cultural ambassador for
Turkey,'' the daily Milliyet newspaper reported.
	   ``We have trusted our government elders' words and have signed
important deals. It is impossible for Tarkan to be in Turkey on
Nov. 27,'' Sogutoglu said.
	   Sogutoglu said both Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Culture
Minister Istemihan Talay promised to defer Tarkan's military
service to allow the singer to promote his career in Europe. But
they apparently failed to convince the military.
	   ``The minister promised to do everything he could because
deferment would have been to the benefit of the country, but the
final decision was with the chief of staff's office,'' said Nafi
Sahin, an aide for Talay.
	   ``We looked into ways defer it, but we couldn't find any,'' said
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin. ``To run away from such a sacred
duty does not suit a sensitive singer like Tarkan. He should be
more obedient of our laws and constitution.''
	   Political events could also complicate matters for the singer. A
confidence vote Wednesday is expected to topple Yilmaz' government
and bring in new cabinet members who have not lobbied on Tarkan's
behalf.

Press watchdog tell governments to release jailed journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Governments should free the more than 150
journalists in prison around the world, a newspaper watchdog said
Tuesday.
	   The Paris-based watchdog, the World Association of Newspapers,
also criticized the Lebanese government for its press
``censorship.''
	   At the end of its two-day meeting in Beirut, the board of
directors of the association said it was urging all governments to
release journalists who are in jail ``for exercising their right to
freedom of expression.''
	   At least 24 journalists, editors and publishers had been
murdered so far this year, the association said in a statement.
	   Hundreds of other reporters have been arrested or attacked for
doing their job, the statement said, adding that countless
newspapers have been censored or banned for criticizing the
authorities.
	   The association, which says it represents 15,000 newspapers and
17 news agencies, condemned what it described as the judicial
harassment of independent newspapers and journalists in Croatia.
	   A delegation of the association met with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri on Monday, and urged him to abolish Lebanon's press
law, particularly a clause that makes it illegal to criticize
foreign heads of state, the statement said.
	   It quoted the association president Bengt Braun as telling
Hariri: ``You do not have a fully free press here.''
	   It said Hariri told the delegation, comprising 12 editors and
publishers from Europe, South America and Asia, that it was not
possible to change the law until there was more democracy in the
Middle East.
	   But Hariri's office responded Tuesday with a statement saying
the prime minister defended the government's policy on press
freedom.
	   ``We have this jewel, democracy and free press, and we will
protect it because no country can grow without it,'' Hariri was
quoted as saying by the statement.

Bosnia's top mediator denies financial irregularities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European Court of Auditors refusing to comment &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A spokesman for Bosnia's top
international mediator on Tuesday denied published allegations of
inappropriate and excessive expenditures.
	   Chris Riley, a spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, said the Monday
report in the German magazine Der Spiegel was based on innuendo.
	   The Hamburg-based magazine claimed that European Union
investigators have discovered irregularities in Westendorp's
expenditures.
	   The report came as Westendorp is preparing to ask the Western
powers to double the budget for his office in 1999 to 70 million
German marks (dlrs 41 million).
	   Officials from Westendorp's office said the accusations were
aimed at giving the new German government an excuse for reducing
participation in the peace mission in Bosnia.
	   According to Der Spiegel, investigators from the EU's auditing
office in Luxembourg questioned why Westendorp gets 6,000 marks
(dlrs 3,500) more than his predecessor, Carl Bildt, who was paid
40,000 marks (dlrs 23,500) per month.
	   Also, since taking over the job 17 months ago the Spaniard has
flown home in business class nearly every weekend to Madrid, the
report said.
	   Riley said a private consultant hired by Westendorp, Price
Waterhouse Coopers, has commended the office for its financial
management and singled out only a couple of smaller irregularities
which were immediately fixed.
	   He did not elaborate, but another official from Westendorp's
office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the irregularities
were simple accountant mistakes.
	   Riley said the article appeared to have been based on a
still-unfinished investigation of a second team the office
enlisted, from the European Court of Auditors, whose findings
remain unknown.
	   The court's press spokesman in Luxembourg declined comment
Tuesday.

TV report: DiMaggio has lung cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Engelberg's denial, birthday plans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio, who has been hospitalized for more
than a month, has lung cancer and suffered a heart attack last
week, a TV station reported Monday night.
	   The station, which televised New York Yankees games for 48
years, cited three sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
WPIX news executives declined to elaborate on the sourcing.
	   DiMaggio's attorney Tuesday morning denied that the Hall of Fame
centerfielder had suffered a heart attack or was gravely ill, as
the TV station had reported.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said in a statement.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this information on the
television and were very upset.''
	   Engelberg did not address the subjects of whether DiMaggio had
cancer or surgery for removal of a lung tumor. The lawyer's office
said he was not available to elaborate.
	   DiMaggio has been hospitalized in Hollywood, Florida, since Oct.
12 for what Engelberg said was pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   However, WPIX said DiMaggio, who will be 84 on Wednesday, had a
tumor removed from his lung last month.
	   It said that when Yankees owner George Steinbrenner canceled a
planned visit last week, he was told DiMaggio ``probably wouldn't
have recognized him anyway.''
	   The report also said friends of DiMaggio were concerned about
who was in control of his estate, which WPIX said includes an
estimated dlrs 20 million collectible and memorabilia fortune.
	   Personnel at Memorial Regional Hospital have not provided
information on DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators have
even denied DiMaggio is a patient.
	   Engelberg said Tuesday that DiMaggio had told him not to discuss
his health with anyone other than his doctors or immediate family.
	   The attorney said DiMaggio would celebrate his birthday at the
hospital with his grandchildren and great grandchildren, some of
the hospital staff, and his brother Dom. Engelberg said he would be
there as well.

U.N. seeks to better sanitation, food under next oil deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will try to repair a
water system sometimes polluted by sewage and make more food
available to Iraqis under the renewal of a U.N. program that
permits Iraq to sell some oil, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   The current phase of the program expires Wednesday. Over the
last six months, it allowed Iraq to export up to dlrs 5.2 billion
in oil to buy food and medicine for Iraqis devastated by eight
years of U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The program, though, has run into problems since its inception
in 1996. Low oil prices and the dilapidated state of Iraq's oil
industry have prevented it from exporting the amount allowed under
the deal _ it earned just dlrs 3.2 billion the last six months.
	   The Iraqi government, meanwhile, is unhappy with the deal that
it believes merely serves to keep the crippling sanctions in place.
It has asked that the current period be extended by two months, not
another six as the Security Council is proposing.
	   Hans von Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq,
said U.N. aid workers hoped Iraq would agree to the deal. In either
case, he said, the United Nations planned to continue its relief
work.
	   ``Whether it's two months or six months, we want to make sure
the humanitarian supplies continue to come in unimpeded in the
amounts that are allowed,'' he said in an interview.
	   He said he doubted that a delay in Iraq's acceptance of the deal
would interfere with oil exports or food deliveries.
	   Von Sponeck, who took over earlier this month, said priorities
under the next phase would be to increase the amount of food
available to Iraqis _ to 2,300 calories a day from 2,030.
	   Another challenge will be to provide more water and sanitation
equipment and repair facilities in disrepair, he said.
	   Water-borne diseases like cholera have mounted, and safe
drinking water has become rarer in Iraq, once one of the Arab
world's most prosperous countries. As many as one out of three
Iraqi children suffer from malnutrition, U.N. figures show.
	   Von Sponeck complained that the lingering crisis over U.N.
inspections has made his task more difficult, mainly by sapping
morale and requiring more time for security issues. About 150 aid
workers were evacuated during the last crisis before Iraq relented
and allowed inspectors to resume their work on Nov. 14.
	   ``It still affects all of us,'' he said.
	   The Security Council will not lift sanctions until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq no longer has chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and the weapons to build them.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2-3 with Yeltsin not holding meetings
Tuesday, doctors urging him to reduce workload; Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris
Yeltsin is resting in a hospital where he is likely to stay for at
least a week while he recovers from pneumonia, aides said Tuesday.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president's
condition was stable and his temperature was normal. Yeltsin did
not hold any meetings Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin played host to Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a
hospital reception room Monday. Doctors have told Yeltsin to reduce
his workload, the Interfax news agency quoted Yakushkin as saying.
	   Aides have said Yeltsin would likely cancel other meetings with
foreign visitors this month, but he is still expected to meet
Russian officials at the hospital.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin
called pneumonia and a high temperature Sunday, his third ailment
in recent weeks, reviving worries about his ability to run a vast
country deep in economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   In television footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was
chuckling and wearing a sweater and did not look very ill.
	   The Russian president has rarely been seen in public recently,
and the Kremlin has only allowed limited television coverage of
him, fueling speculation that he is seriously sick.
	   He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as a
respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and
exhaustion. Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking
little chance with the president's health, ensuring that he has
frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He
said treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, in an interview on NTV, added:
``Knowing the president's character, he will have his own point of
view on how long he has to stay in the hospital.''
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
speculation has grown about early elections.

Anti-speculators painting wins ASEAN competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The dlrs 10,000 grand prize winner of the
ASEAN Art Awards was a painting criticizing the market speculators
that some blame for the Asian economic crisis.
	   Judges denied that the title of the oil by Malaysian artist Kow
Leong Kiang, ``Foreign Speculators, Stop Damaging Our Country!''
played any role in their decision.
	   ``The details about what it means and the title were not
important to the judges,'' Malaysian judge Niranjan Rajah said.
``It's a great painting.''
	   But it was obvious that the economic problems _ and politics _
were never far from anyone's mind. Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has insisted that speculators, particularly those
specializing in currency trading, created the regional crisis.
	   ``The sentiment has meaning,'' Rajah said. ``It's not just
propaganda. Everyone, not just our prime minister, but the IMF and
the other big guys accept that speculators are damaging.''
	   The painting depicts three girls. Kiang said in a statement that
they are staring angrily out at ``inhuman speculators which steal
away 20-30 years'' of national progress and ``only cared about
generating profit from the weak.''
	   ``Ferocious predator footprints in the foreground reflect the
evil foreign manipulators who came and reaped the nation's
wealth,'' he said.
	   Another painting generated controversy earlier when the
Indonesian Embassy asked Vietnam's Culture and Information Ministry
to block its entrance, saying it wasn't in the ``ASEAN spirit.'' It
finally was allowed in after artist Chiang Jing Ying agreed to
change its name.
	   Originally called ``Victim in May,'' it is a two-panel work
depicting a blood-splattered torso on one side and a blood splatter
on the other. It represents the riots in Indonesia that led to the
resignation of longtime leader Suharto.
	   Ying, a Malaysian whose work was submitted by Singapore, changed
the name to ``Victim.'' White stickers covered ``in May'' in the
official program.
	   The art competition, sponsored by the Philip Morris Group of
Companies, is part of a program of cultural activities leading up
to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit Dec.
15-16 in Hanoi.

New German foreign minister wants changes to NATO's nuclear
</HEADLINE>
strategy &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Joshka Fischer wants
NATO to consider dropping its doctrine allowing first-use of
nuclear weapons, a suggestion that could trigger the first
significant foreign policy difference between the United States and
Germany's new center-left government.
	   The opposition Christian Democratic Union, voted out of office
in September, attacked the idea as violating the government's
promise for continuity in foreign policy.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen responded by saying that
the doctrine remains sound, and he sees no reason to change it.
	   ``We think that the ambiguity involved in the issue of the use
of nuclear weapons contributes to our own security, keeping any
potential adversary who might use either chemical or biologicals
unsure of what our response would be,'' Cohen said Monday in
Washington.
	   Fischer, who has sought support for a change of doctrine with
his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine, is a Greens politician who
was one of the leading demonstrators during the 1980s when the
United States installed nuclear weapons in Germany in the height of
the Cold War. Since the Berlin Wall came down, the United States
has removed all of its nuclear warheads from the continent.
	   Fischer was quoted in the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel as
saying that the changing strategic circumstances require another
look at the military alliance's doctrine allowing it to launch
nuclear weapons without first being targeted.
	   The alliance is to adopt a new ``strategy concept'' at a summit
in April that will adapt military thinking to latest post-Cold War
developments by further switching the emphasis from NATO's original
role of preparing for large-scale attack on Europe, to providing a
flexible, mobile response to localized crises.
	   Fischer said he has already indicated to NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana that the alliance should rethink its nuclear arms
strategy, but emphasized that Germany would not break with its
partners over the issue.
	   ``I am a realist enough to know how power is apportioned in
NATO. But I'm also realist enough to see that our political
security situation has fundamentally changed,'' Fischer was quoted
as saying. ``Germany is surrounded by friends today.''
	   ``We must speak openly about this in the alliance without giving
the impression that Germany is going its own way.''
	   The general secretary of the Christian Democrats, Angela Merkel,
said good reasons remained to maintain the first-strike doctrine.
``We shouldn't rule out future or present dangers, evident in the
Iraq example, just because Germany has friends in neighboring
countries.''

Berlin mayor wants Spielberg interviews for Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Mayor Eberhard Diepgen wants director Steven
Spielberg's visual archive of Holocaust survivor interviews to
become part of a planned national Holocaust memorial in Berlin, a
weekly newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Diepgen was quoted by Die Woche as saying he had written to
Spielberg about housing the nearly 50,000 filmed interviews in a
small museum, which along with a monument would constitute the
controversial, long-postponed memorial.
	   The weekly magazine Stern reported last week that Spielberg said
he had offered to move his Shoah Visual History Foundation to
Berlin. Earlier published reports had attributed the suggestion to
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's new culture adviser, Michael
Naumann, but he has refused to comment.
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been in contention
for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing over
whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent an
atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Eleven million people were
killed in the Holocaust, 6 million of them Jews.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl had favored a cemetery-like
monument design of thousands of concrete pillars to be built in the
heart of Berlin, but the center-left government elected in
September looks likely to reject the plan.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's cultural advisor, Michael
Naumann, has said that Germany's former concentration camps are the
most appropriate memorial to the Holocaust.
	   Spielberg directed the Oscar-winning film ``Schindler's List,''
which tells the story of a non-Jewish industrialist who saved
thousands of Jews during World War II. He was awarded one of
Germany's highest state honors in September.

Bishop resigns following fraud allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name Chrysanthos is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A months-long upheaval in the Cyprus
Orthodox church over fraud allegations against a bishop was settled
quietly Tuesday with the cleric's resignation and temporary
suspension from ecclesiastical duties.
	   However, an independent inquiry by the Cypriot attorney-general
into fraud allegations involving Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol is
continuing.
	   An official announcement by the Holy Synod of the Cyprus
Orthodox Church said the synod accepted Chrysanthos' resignation
submitted the previous day and imposed a two-year suspension on him
from involvement ``in every holy duty.''
	   This means that the bishop retains his rank and will continue to
live in the official residence but will not conduct church
services, explained synod secretary Archimandrite Vassilios
Papafotis.
	   The synod reached its verdict after considering a report by a
special committee of bishops that found Chrysanthos was involved in
fraud and profiteering through currency speculation and had taken
advantage of his office for illicit profit.
	   Bishop Chrysanthos has rejected charges he made personal profits
from his actions. But he apologized to the synod for becoming
naively involved in alleged quick-profit schemes to raise funds for
charity.

Ahold's net profit helped by sales in America and Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold
said Tuesday its third-quarter net profit rose 22 percent, buoyed
by sale increases in North America and Europe.
	   Net profit was 256.5 million guilders (dlrs 136 million) for the
three months ended early October, up from 209.7 million guilders
(dlrs 111 million) in the same period a year ago.
	   For the full year, Ahold _ which owns U.S.-based Stop and Shop
and Giant Food Stores _ said its net profit and earnings per share
will grow by between 12 percent and 20 percent.
	   In the third quarter, total sales rose 2.4 percent to 12.6
billion guilders (dlrs 6.7 billion), up from 12.3 billion guilders
(dlrs 6.5 billion).
	   In the United States, sales increased by 4.6 percent to dlrs 3.5
billion from dlrs 3.3 billion a year ago. Ahold's supermarket
chains in the eastern United States account for about half its
global sales.
	   Ahold said Stop and Shop and Giant Food reported higher sales,
but that sales at the BI-LO and Tops chains were almost identical.
	   Combined sales in Portugal, the Czech Republic and Poland rose
15.1 percent to 957.4 million guilders (dlrs 509 million), up from
832.1 million guilders (dlrs 442.6 million) a year ago.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles on Tuesday traveled to the
island of Crete to visit a Minoan palace complex first unearthed by
British archeologists earlier this century.
	   Charles, on a three-day cultural visit to Greece, earlier laid a
wreath under sunny skies at the tomb of the unknown soldier in
central Athens. Bad weather had postponed the ceremony Monday.
	   His jet was escorted by Greek air force Mirage 2000 fighters
during its flight to the Mediterranean island.
	   During his visit to Crete, Charles toured the British School of
Archaeology facilities at Knossos, where the ruins were partially
rebuilt in the early 1900's by British archaeologist Sir Arthur
Evans.
	   He also attended a reception at an archeological museum in the
port city of Iraklion, near the ruins, before flying for London.

Roche families worth an estimated dlrs 20 billion

 &UR; Eds: FIXES graf 3 that not majority stake &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The families who control
Switzerland's Roche pharmaceuticals giant are worth 25-30 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 18-21 billion), according to a list of
Switzerland's Richest published Tuesday.
	   The survey by Bilanz business magazine said the Hoffmann, Sacher
and Oeri families had managed to increase their wealth by 5 billion
francs (dlrs 3.6 billion) during the past year despite the turmoil
on international stock markets.
	   The three families _ offshoots of the Hoffmann-La-Roche company
founders _ have a big stake in the pharmaceuticals firm. They are
traditionally at the top of the annual Swiss survey and high on the
Forbes list of billionaires worldwide.
	   The latest Forbes list, published at the end of September, said
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, was by far the world's wealthiest man
with dlrs 58.4 billion.
	   A car dealer and software entrepreneur, Walter Haefner, followed
in second place on the Swiss survey with an estimated value of 10
billion francs (dlrs 7 billion).
	   Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the Danish manufacturer of the lego
game, headed the list of newcomers. He settled in a village in the
low-tax canton (state) of Zug with a fortune estimated at 3-4
billion francs (dlrs 2.1-2.8 billion), according to Bilanz.

Poll: Europeans believe majority of athletes use drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ About half the respondents in a
European poll said they believe the majority of professional
athletes use banned drugs.
	   The poll found significant public mistrust following a series of
doping scandals which rocked the sports world this year, especially
at the Tour de France.
	   ``Sport seems to be heading for a crisis where confidence in
sport and its athletes disappears,'' Danish Culture Minister
Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen said, commenting on the poll.
	   The poll, commissioned by the Danish Olympic Committee and the
Danish daily newspaper Berlingske Tidende, was conducted among more
than 6,000 people in Denmark, England, Germany, France, Italy and
Spain.
	   Gallup conducted the poll in Denmark and coordinated the survey
in the other five countries. No margin of error was listed.
	   The survey found that 79 percent consider doping a ``serious
problem.''
	   The poll found that 49 percent believe a majority of pro
athletes use performance-enhancing doping substances. The distrust
was highest in France, where 69 percent think the majority use
drugs.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
said he did not share that opinion.
	   ``I agree that doping is a serious problem in the sport movement
but I do not believe that the majority are doped,'' he said.
	   The survey found mistrust highest in bodybuilding, cycling,
track and field, swimming and soccer.
	   Bodybuilding was cited by 76 percent of the repsondents as a
sport with substantial doping, followed by track and field (75
percent), cycling (74 percent), swimming (56 percent) and soccer
(48 percent).
	   The poll found interest in cycling had diminished since the Tour
de France, where coaches and riders were implicated in systematic
doping.
	   Fourteen percent of the respondents said their interest in
cycling had decreased, with the biggest drop among the French (26
percent).
	   In Italy, where investigations are continuing into alleged
widespread drug use in Serie A, 72 percent of the respondents said
they believe doping is a significant problem in soccer.
	   In France, home of the World Cup champions, the figure was 61
percent.
	   Lennart Johansson, president of the European soccer federation
(UEFA), acknowledged that doping posed a danger to soccer.
	   ``What has happened in Italy has shown us that the situation is
not as good as we thought,'' he said. ``New things are invented.
These things can also be used in football, which has become obvious
in Italy. It is important that we react to the early warning
signals. We cannot allow ourselvs to be lulled to sleep just
because we live in a safe haven so far.''

Press watchdog group tells governments to release jailed
</HEADLINE>
journalists &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Governments should free the more than 150
journalists in prison around the world, a newspaper watchdog group
said Tuesday.
	   The Paris-based World Association of Newspapers also criticized
the Lebanese government for its press ``censorship.''
	   At the end of its two-day meeting in Beirut, the association's
board of directors said it was urging all governments to release
journalists who are in jail ``for exercising their right to freedom
of expression.''
	   At least 24 journalists, editors and publishers have been
murdered so far this year, the association said in a statement.
	   Hundreds of other reporters have been arrested or attacked for
doing their job, the statement said, adding that countless
newspapers have been censored or banned for criticizing the
authorities.
	   The association, which represents 15,000 newspapers and 17 news
agencies, also condemned what it described as the judicial
harassment of independent newspapers and journalists in Croatia.
	   And a delegation from the association met with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri on Monday and urged him to abolish Lebanon's
press law, particularly a clause that makes it illegal to criticize
foreign heads of state, the statement said.
	   It quoted the association president Bengt Braun as telling
Hariri: ``You do not have a fully free press here.''
	   Hariri's office responded Tuesday with a statement saying the
prime minister defended the government's policy on press freedom.
	   ``We have this jewel, democracy and free press, and we will
protect it because no country can grow without it,'' Hariri was
quoted as saying in the statement.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with London January oil futures prices heading to
15-year low, Venezuelan oil minister comments. EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure grew on OPEC to act to lift
sagging oil prices as prices headed to lows not seen in 15 years.
	   Ministers from OPEC's 11 member states planned a year-end
meeting Wednesday.
	   In London, Brent crude oil January futures trading on the
International Petroleum Exchange hit a low of dlrs 11.25 a barrel
Tuesday, down 5 cents. Prices were last this low in 1983.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter slumped to
dlrs 12.33, down dlrs 6 from 1997's third-quarter average of dlrs
18.03 a barrel.
	   Publicly, OPEC members have been tightlipped on how to boost
prices which are hurting economies back home.
	   Kuwait's official news agency said recently the country is
facing a 45 percent revenue drop in 1998.
	   Venezuelan oil minister Erwin Jose Arrieta said as he arrived
that both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers needed to seek out new
markets.
	   ``It's a ... challenge,'' said Arrieta, whose country is widely
believed to be a key offender in overproduction, an issue expected
to figure high on the talks' agenda.
	   OPEC's predicament is due an untimely decision to boost
production last winter, just as demand growth was dropping because
of Asia's financial crisis.
	   The resulting oil glut has hammered prices.
	   The ministers are expected to discuss how to improve levels of
compliance with production cuts introduced in June along with the
possibility of extending the cuts or cutting further.
	   Calling a meeting of heads of state ``to tackle the crisis at a
political level'' is another possibility that may be discussed,
Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said in Dubai on Monday.
	   Algeria says OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands. The
United Arab Emirates has supported Algeria's idea of a special
top-level meeting.
	   Kuwait is pushing for further cuts to the 2.6-million barrels a
day reductions agreed on in June and is backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Compliance is about 93 percent excluding Iraq, which is subject
to United Nations sanctions, the International Energy Agency said
in its latest report in October.
	   However compliance by Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia is lower,
analysts say.
	   Venezuela, which agreed to cut 525,000 barrels a day from its
quota of 2.845 million, is complying to the tune of 84 percent,
said Leo Drollas of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Iran _ down 305,000 million barrels from 3.318 million _ was
complying at about 77 percent, Drollas said, though Iran disputes
suggestions it is not in full compliance.
	   Indonesia agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day from a quota of
1.28 million, was complying at just 50 percent, he estimated.
	   Analysts say OPEC will likely agree to extend existing cuts for
six months through to the end of 1999.
	   Non-OPEC oil producers Mexico, Russia and Oman also are expected
to attend.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The heads of Europe's national soccer federations
discussed the proposed new structure for UEFA's club competitions
Tuesday but failed to agree on the nitty-gritty of when and how to
proceed.
	   It will now be up to UEFA's Executive Committee to pronounce on
whether to start the planned new Champions League and merged UEFA
Cup next year or in the year 2000, said UEFA General Secretary
Gerhard Aigner.
	   If the executive committee decides in December on a 2000 start
rather than 1999, ``I think the clubs would have to live with it,''
Aigner told reporters at the end of a special UEFA meeting.
	   Last month, representatives of major clubs agreed not to join a
breakaway Super League after the European governing body proposed
changing its Champions League, offering teams more money.
	   UEFA promised to expand next season's Champions League from 24
teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners
Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   Top clubs want the new competitions to begin next season to
maximize their potential earnings.
	   ``There were some reservations about an early start,'' at
Tuesday's meeting, Aigner said. UEFA stressed that both revamped
competitions would have to start the same year.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the new-look Champions League in an
already tight season could prove a problem for some of Europe's
larger leagues.
	   UEFA presented to associations two alternatives for the new UEFA
Cup, one of which would see eight teams who didn't qualify from
their Champions League group joining the competition in its third
round.
	   ``The feedback that we get is overwhelmingly positive for that
move,'' Aigner said.
	   Richer associations favored a group stage in the UEFA Cup, but
smaller associations backed a straight knockout format, he added.
	   In other business, UEFA's member associations agreed a
memorandum backing UEFA regulations to prevent two or more clubs
owned by the same company taking part in the same European club
competition.
	   In July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport provisionally
suspended the regulation, ruling that UEFA hadn't given clubs
enough time to adjust when it was introduced in May.
	   The ruling came in response to an arbitration request from Greek
club AEK Athens and Czech club Slavia Prague, both controlled by
British company ENIC.
	   The associations ``reaffirm our unqualified support for the UEFA
rule, and the sporting principles which underlie it,'' the
statement said.
	   They also agreed to lobby the European Union for an antitrust
exemption to allow UEFA to centrally market television rights.
	   ``Unless a means to redistribute income is recognized, there is
a real danger that the existing disparities between the rich and
poor will become a yawning gulf,'' they said in a memorandum.
	   ``The marketing of competition matches by individual clubs will
inevitably disrupt the league structure, as investors would focus
only on the best teams,'' they added.
	   UEFA asked its member associations to call on their governments
for a change in EU rules, backing the request with the memorandum
and a letter for the UEFA and FIFA presidents.

Parliament votes for broadcasting its sessions, government
</HEADLINE>
disagrees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's parliament on Tuesday approved a proposal
to broadcast its sessions on state-run television, but a
disapproving government said it might take the matter to the
country's highest court.
	   The National Assembly passed the proposal 36-12 with all Cabinet
members voting against it.
	   The Cabinet had rejected a similar yes vote previously but
according to the constitution it cannot reject a Parliament vote
twice. The only course open to the government now is to appeal
against the vote in the Constitutional Court.
	   The proposal is ``tinged with constitutional doubts'' and the
government might decide to consult the Constitutional Court,
Mohammad Sharar, minister of state for National Assembly affairs,
said. He did not elaborate.
	   The government has not said why it opposes the move. However,
lawmakers have quoted government ministers as saying that they are
reluctant to bring TV cameras into the house for fear of turning
sessions into spectacles with deputies dramatizing their speeches.
	   Opposition lawmakers say their opinions are not heard widely
enough at present.
	   ``Our voice reaches the people only through the newspapers ...
the government has to approve'' the broadcast proposal, said Muslim
fundamentalist lawmaker Khaled al-Adwa.
	   The proposal calls for broadcasting the meetings the same day,
and giving the speaker of the 50-seat house the power to censor
what goes on the air. Kuwait does not have private television
stations.
	   Attendance in Parliament is usually scant unless the house is
grilling a government minister or deliberating controversial issues
such as theft of public money.

Russian court convicts skinheads of beating people from Caucasus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nine teenage skinheads have been convicted of
beating dark-skinned visitors from the Caucasus Mountains region in
a northern Russian city, officials said Tuesday.
	   Three were sentenced to prison terms from 4 1/2 to 7 1/2 years
and another six received suspended sentences, said Alexander
Kostyunin, chairman of a court in Arkhangelsk, an Arctic city on
the White Sea, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The skinheads wanted to ``squeeze out'' traders from the
Caucasus _ which run through Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and part
of southern Russia _ and beat and harassed them, the report said.
	   Two businessmen from Georgia suffered the most violent attack.
The skinheads kicked them and stabbed them with a knife and an awl.
One Georgian received 17 stab wounds.
	   Russia has seen an increasing number of racist attacks by
members of neo-Nazi groups. Most are young skinheads who are openly
racist and call for driving ethnic minorities out of Russia. Human
rights groups and neo-Nazi organizations estimate that there are
about 4,000 neo-fascists in the Russian capital alone.
	   Russian law calls for punishment for ``inciting ethnic strife,''
but the government has done little to rein in neo-Nazi groups.

Thumping win for center-left party in Sao Tome election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MANUEL DENDE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The center-left MLSTP/PSD
Party won 31 seats in the 55-seat parliament in the Nov. 8 general
election, according to final official results Tuesday, and is
expected to form a government within two weeks.
	   MLSTP/PSD leader Manuel Pinto da Costa, who ran the small West
African island nation under a single-party Marxist system for 16
years following its 1975 independence from Portugal, was widely
expected to be named Prime Minister by his party.
	   Pinto da Costa's appointment likely will open a period of uneasy
cohabitation with President Miguel Trovoada, his longtime political
rival, whose Independent Democratic Alliance won 16 seats.
	   The Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) snared eight seats. The
abstention rate was 35.3 percent.
	   Trovoada, who must formally invite the winning party to form a
government, is currently abroad on a series of state visits.
	   The MLSTP/PSD was defeated in the country's first democratic
ballot in 1991 but regained power in 1994 elections.
	   Since 1996, when the government was dissolved after an aborted
military coup, it has governed as the major partner in a coalition
with the PCD.
	   The MLSTP/PSD shook off criticism of its economic record to win
the election in this country of 120,000 people.
	   The unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent and the average
salary is about dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs
50.
	   However, earlier this year the government entered a joint
venture with U.S. company Environmental Remediation Holding Corp.
to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to the country's economy
and help pay off a foreign debt estimated at dlrs 300 million.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.
	   The next general election is scheduled for 2002.

Hungarian, Slovak foreign ministers sign protocol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Hungary's foreign minister signed a
protocol Tuesday with his Slovak counterpart aimed at improving
long-tense relations between the two neighboring countries.
	   The pact, signed by Janos Martonyi of Hungary and Eduard Kukan
of Slovakia, comes less than a month after the new Slovak
government took power. It sets up 11 commissions designed to deal
with different areas of bilateral relations, including minority
rights.
	   More than 10 percent of Slovakia's population of 5.5 million is
Hungarian, and Hungary accused the previous government of
discriminating against them.
	   ``We have closed the period of disputes and misunderstandings,''
Martonyi told reporters. ``We are opening a new era.''
	   He said Hungary will support Slovakia in its attempts for
joining the European Union and NATO.
	   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will come for an official
visit to Slovakia in January.
	   Another long-time sore spot between the two countries is
Slovakia's efforts toward building a huge dam on the Danube River,
the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam.
	   Nothing has been done to implement the agreement the two reached
last February, aimed at ending more than 15 years of bitter
controversy. That pact came after the World Court in The Hague,
Netherlands, found both nations at fault and ordered them to reach
agreement.
	   Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda told reporters the two will
discuss the dam issue again soon.
	   ``We see the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros problem as an international
legal problem. It is not a political problem anymore,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A months-long upheaval in the Cyprus
Orthodox church over fraud allegations against a bishop was settled
quietly Tuesday with the cleric's resignation and temporary
suspension from ecclesiastical duties.
	   However, an independent inquiry by the Cypriot attorney-general
into fraud allegations involving Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol is
continuing.
	   An official announcement by the Holy Synod of the Cyprus
Orthodox Church said the synod accepted Chrysanthos' resignation
submitted the previous day and imposed a two-year suspension on him
from involvement ``in every holy duty.''
	   This means that the bishop retains his rank and will continue to
live in the official residence but will not conduct church
services, explained synod secretary Archimandrite Vassilios
Papafotis.
	   The synod reached its verdict after considering a report by a
special committee of bishops which found Chrysanthos was involved
in fraud and profiteering through currency speculation and had
taken advantage of his office for illicit profit.
	   Bishop Chrysanthos has rejected charges he made personal profits
from his actions. But he apologized to the synod for becoming
naively involved in alleged quick-profit schemes to raise funds for
charity.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Greenland Premier Jonathan Motzfeldt
said Tuesday he wants a Dutch museum to return an embalmed body
said to be a native Inuit on exhibit with other human remains.
	   The mummy-like body is part of an exhibit called ``Bone by
Bone'' at the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam. The remains are on loan
from museums all over the Netherlands, and have rarely been put on
public display.
	   ``It could be the great-grandfather of someone up here,'' a
furious Motzfeldt said on Denmark's TV2. Greenland is a Danish

	   The Danish Foreign Ministry said it was willing to require a DNA
test of the body to establish whether it was an Inuit, the
indigenous people of Greenland.
	   The Kunsthal has refused to remove the body from the exhibit,
Denmark's ambassador to the Netherlands Jakob Rytter told TV2. No
one at the museum could be reached by The Associated Press for a
comment.
	   Beside the embalmed body dating from the last century, the
exhibits include a pair of stillborn Siamese twins in a jar of

EU court: Italy cannot limit German language rights to
</HEADLINE>
German-speakers only &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union high court said Tuesday
Italy cannot limit German language rights in the courts of its Alto
Adige region near Austria to the area's German-speaking majority
only.
	   The EU high court found for an Austrian trucker and a German
tourist _ charged respectively with drunk driving in 1994 and
carrying an illegal knife in 1995 _ who asked to be tried in German
since they spoke no Italian.
	   Under EU law, they argued, they should have the same rights as
local German-speakers in Bolzano province which together with
Trento province comprise bilingual Alto Adige.
	   The region, which borders Austria, has 280,000 German speakers,
almost 70 percent of the population.
	   An Italian court referred the cases of Horst Otto Bickel, the
Austrian trucker, and Ulrich Franz, the German tourist, to the EU
court.
	   It said since the law in Alto Adige provides for local German
speakers to be tried in their mother tongue, German speakers from
elsewhere in the EU must be granted the same right.
	   Under a 1969 law, Italian is the language of government in alto
Adige but German speakers can use their language in all dealings
with the police and other public services.
	   The EU court ruling is binding on Italy and the other 14 EU
nations since European law takes precedence over national law.

Russian prison guards strike over back wages

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fifteen prison guards in a southern Russian city
walked off the job Tuesday to demand unpaid wages from the
government, a news report said.
	   The prison guards in Rostov-on-Don said they have not been paid
since September, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The 2,000 inmates were still guarded by other troops, deputy
prison warder Ivan Vinnik said. The prison administration was
taking ``urgent measures'' to pay off strikers' wages, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Millions of workers in the government and private sector
throughout the country get their pay months late. Teachers, coal
miners and nuclear workers have staged many strikes and other
protests, but to little avail.

EU warns Turkey against Italian trade boycott
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Tuesday warned
Turkey it could face retaliatory sanctions from the whole 15-nation
EU if it boycotts Italian imports over Rome's refusal to extradite
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``A boycott by Turkey or Turkish public companies would be a
clear violation of our accords,'' said European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
	   At a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema, Santer said the EU would seek urgent consultations with
Turkey, if it introduces sanctions on Italy. ``If those
consultations don't work, the Union could legitimately impose
retaliation,'' Santer said.
	   Turkish ministers have said the country will ban Italian firms
from seeking defense contracts and Italian television networks will
be excluded from Turkish cables. Hundreds of companies have also
announced boycotts of Italian goods amid widespread outrage in
Turkey over Italy's refusal to hand over Ocalan.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed some 37,000 people. Turkey says
Ocalan is a terrorist and should be brought to trial.
	   Italy's constitution forbids it from extraditing suspects to
countries where they may face the death penalty. The 15 EU nations
issued a statement over the weekend backing Italy's stance.
	   ``It is important we express our solidarity with Italy as it
applies rights enshrined in its constitution,'' Santer said.
	   The conflict seems certain to further harm Turkey's relations
with the EU, which have been strained since last December when the
EU leaders pushed Turkey to the back of a line of 12 nations
seeking to join the Union.
	   Both Santer and D'Alema said they hoped the dispute could be
resolved through negotiation without it coming to a trade war.
	   ``We don't want to damage the Turkish economy, quite the
reverse,'' the Italian leader said. ``On the other hand we don't
want our interests damaged.''

Top minister defends setting up of township defence units
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A top government official and
former anti-apartheid guerilla leader on Tuesday defended a policy
of arming bands of township youths to fight white rule, despite
their involvement in turf wars that cost thousands of black lives.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils told an amnesty hearing
of a human rights panel that self-defense units (SDUs) were vital
in continuing the anti-apartheid struggle in the early 1990s.
	   ``I am proud that I had participated in the establishment of
such units because their role was to protect our communities from
brutal attacks by evil forces,'' he told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   Kasrils, a commander in the armed wing of the African National
Congress during apartheid, testified as a witness in the amnesty
hearings of more than 100 applicants who include community members
and SDU operatives from black townships around Johannesburg.
	   He is also expected to seek amnesty from the Truth Commission at
a separate and as yet unannounced hearing.
	   Last month, the commission released a five-volume report on
testimony from victims of apartheid-era political violence and
assigned major blame for human rights violations to the National
Party, apartheid's architect.
	   But it also cited black anti-apartheid struggle groups _ like
those seeking amnesty at the hearings _ for their excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess their crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _ a
process expected to last well into next year as decisions are made
on over 7,000 amnesty applications.
	   The ANC units fought bloody battles against the security forces
of the white run state, but also massacred supporters of rival
black political parties, such as the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party.
	   The Inkatha groups, called Self Protection Units (SPUs), were
backed by the apartheid government, the Truth Commission has
determined.
	   In the sprawling black townships around Johannesburg, the
country's biggest city, the brutal faction fighting cost 2,400
lives in the four years up to all race elections in 1994.
	   Kasrils, who supplied arms to the SDUs, blamed a shadowy ``Third
Force'' of apartheid agents for instigating the worst of the
violence, but conceded innocent people had lost their lives in
fighting between the ANC and Inkatha.
	   The violence affected the moral fibre of society and ``turned
neighbour against neighbour, brother against brother,'' he said.
	   At the same hearing a former commander of an SDU in the Thokoza
township near Johannesburg, Chechela Esau Machitze, told the
committee that he ordered a full-scale attack on Inkatha members
during a funeral procession in 1992.
	   Machitze is applying for amnesty.
	   Casting light on some of the most painful episodes in South
Africa's grim past, the investigation of the SDUs reaches to the
top echelons of the ANC leadership.
	   Next week sees the amnesty hearing of Public Works Minister Jeff
Radebe for his role in organizing and arming SDUs in KwaZulu-Natal
from 1990 to 1994.
	   The ANC won the country's first all-race elections in 1994 that
ended apartheid.

Pipeline construction to export Kazakstan's oil to begin in
</HEADLINE>
January &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The construction of a pipeline that will carry
Kazakstan's Caspian Sea oil to Russia's Black Sea coast will begin
Jan. 1, 1999, an official said Tuesday.
	   The 1,580-kilometer (980-mile) pipeline between Kazakstan's
Tengiz oil field and the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk
will be built around Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya. Its
capacity is expected to total 67 million metric tons (19.7 billion
gallons) of oil a year.
	   ``The first tanker loaded with Kazak crude will leave the
Novorossiisk terminal by 2001,'' Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei
Generalov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The international Caspian Pipeline Consortium expects to spend
dlrs 2.2 billion on the project, including dlrs 854 million next
year, Generalov said.
	   The governments of Russia, Kazakstan and Oman together own half
of the pipeline consortium, which is also working together to pump
oil from the rest of the Caspian.
	   The other half is owned by a group of international oil
companies, including Chevron Corp., LUKARCO _ a partnership of
Russia's Lukoil and Arco of the United States _ Rosneft-Shell,
Britain's BG, Mobil and others.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police sealed off part of Sofia airport
on Tuesday after an anonymous caller said a bomb was planted there.
	   Passengers arriving from Frankfurt, Germany, by Lufthansa and
from Milan, Italy, by Alitalia were held in buses on the runway and
people in airport premises were evacuated from.
	   No further information was immediately available.
	   The emergency was expected to delay international flights and
cause inconveniences because of the cold and snow. Temperatures in
Sofia were about 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at the
time of the evacuation late Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Sofia airport and central railway station have been shut
down repeatedly for brief periods in the past couple of years
because of false bomb threats.

Cold weather sweeping Europe claims 84 lives in past days

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Cold weather and blizzards sweeping
parts of Europe claimed new deaths Tuesday, bringing the known
death toll to 84 people across the continent in the past few days.
	   Worst hit were Poland, with 41 cold-related deaths and Romania,
with 30. France reported eight deaths due to cold weather by
Monday, and deaths in Bulgaria and Italy accounted for the rest.
	   Romania's arctic cold snap began Friday. The latest deaths
included three people who lost control of heir cars in icy
conditions on Tuesday, said Col. Ioan Palalau of the national
traffic police.
	   One homeless man in a village near Bucharest died after he
sought shelter in a garbage bin. Another man was found frozen to
death in a streetcar Monday by the driver who noticed he did not
get off at the last stop. A man sweeping snow in Bucharest passed
out and died, apparently because of the cold, and another man was
found frozen to death in a factory in Bucharest where he had
apparently sought overnight shelter.
	   In the county of Tulcea in southeast Romania, schools were
closed due to unheated classrooms and roads made impassable by
heavy snow. Blizzards swept across Romania's southeast Tuesday and
temperatures plunged to -10 C (14 F) in pre-dawn hours.
	   Dozens of villages had no electricity and 300 communities were
without telephone lines, the Mediafax news agency reported. Some
150 soldiers in bulldozers and other military vehicles were
dispatched to help people trapped by the snow.
	   Bucharest's emergency hospital reported treating more than 800
fractures caused by slippery terrain in the latest 24-hour period.
	   The weather played a role in 41 recent deaths in Poland, said
Pawel Biedziak, national police spokesman by telephone, with four
deaths reported Tuesday.
	   Many deaths were caused by people drinking alcohol who passed
out in the cold, he said. About 30 percent were homeless.
	   In Bulgaria, some 700 villages were without electricity Tuesday
and 400 were without water after heavy snows knocked down power
lines and caused outages at water pumping stations, officials said.
	   The Civil Defense agency said most of the affected villages were
in northern Bulgaria. Rescue teams were dispatched.
	   Five passes in the Balkan Mountains were closed because of deep
drifts. Bulgarian state radio reported dozens of schools in rural
northeastern Bulgaria suspended classes because of the snow.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Sports Minister Tuesday called
the postponement of Galatasaray's Champions League match with
Juventus a ``disgrace.''
	   Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner said the decision was purely
aimed at gaining time for Juventus, crippled with injuries, and at
distracting Galatasaray's concentration.
	   ``This is a disgrace,'' Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner told The

war or martial law, which is not the case.''
	   ``It is an unjustified decision,'' he added.
	   UEFA postponed the Champions League match on Monday _ it was to
have been played Wednesday _ and reset it for Dec. 2 in Istanbul
because of anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over Italy's refusal to
extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.

Facing Turkish boycotts, Italy tells Germany to take Turkish Kurd
</HEADLINE>
rebel off its hands &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy tried Tuesday to get a Turkish Kurd guerrilla
chief off its hands, saying Germany's arrest warrants for Abdullah
Ocalan obligated it to extradite him.
	   ``This is what we expect of Germany,'' Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said.
	   In Brussels, Premier Massimo D'Alema declared Ocalan wasn't just
Italy's problem but Europe's, and won his European Union partners'
support against Turkish boycotts of Italian goods.
	   Turks are burning or boycotting everything Italian, from Fiats
and fashion to weaponry, in anger over Italy's refusal to send
Ocalan to Turkey for trial as a terrorist. Ocalan leads the Kurdish
Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old war for
Kurdish autonomy in Turkey that has killed 37,000.
	   Ocalan came to Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum. A Rome court
rejected Turkey's arrest warrant on Friday, citing Italian law
forbidding extradition of suspects who face the death penalty, as
Ocalan would in Turkey.
	   Germany has two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one
dating back to 1990 and another issued over the weekend. But the
Justice Ministry says it has no plans to pursue extradition.
	   Dini said Germany was shirking.
	   ``We have clearly indicated that when a country sends an arrest
warrant, as a consequence, it then must proceed with extradition to
that country,'' the foreign minister said in Milan.
	   An editorial in Tuesday's Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung noted a
``politically motivated reserve'' had set in since Germany first
issued its arrest warrant for Ocalan. Germany is home to 2 million
Turks, as well as 400,000 Kurds.
	   ``Turkey, and also Italy, are sure to read a German nondecision
as a decision _ namely, that it is better to give in to terrorist
blackmail than to charge domestic politics with anger,'' it said.
	   The problem is expected to dominate a Friday meeting between
D'Alema and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Italian judges
have ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany
time to mull over extradition.
	   In Brussels, the EU warned Turkey it could face sanctions from
the 15-nation bloc over any boycott. ``This result clearly shows
that in Europe Italy isn't at all isolated,'' D'Alema said.
	   Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, insisted that all the
boycotts were spontaneous _ although the Turkish government itself
took Italian TV stations off the air in Turkey.
	   Batu also rejected D'Alema's recommendation Monday that Turks
and the PKK talk out their problems. Turkey has always rejected
negotiations with the rebels.
	   ``This is ridiculous. This is unjust. How can Turkey sit at the
negotiating table with a terrorist organization?'' the diplomat
asked. ``But if Mr. D'Alema means dialogue between Turkey and
Italy, we are prepared for this. The channels of communication are
open between Turkey and Italy _ I am here.''
	   In Turkey, 18 families whose sons were killed in fighting with
the PKK filed a lawsuit Tuesday against both D'Alema and Ocalan.
Seeking only a single Turkish lira as symbolic compensation, the
suit declared: ``The money would relieve the sufferings of the
Turkish nation until spiritual justice takes place.''
	   The pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party said Turkey had filed
charges of aiding the PKK against 130 of the party members. Police
detained 3,000 party members after Ocalan was arrested in Rome;
nearly 2,000 remain in custody.

New Berlin memorial will commemorate 1953 workers uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The city will commemorate the 1953 workers
uprising in the former East Germany with a monument featuring 467
spotlights flashing illuminated text and photos, officials
announced Tuesday.
	   Work is to begin immediately on the monument, designed by artist
Katharina Karrenberg. City lawmakers voted in 1994 to install on
Leipziger Platz in the heart of Berlin.
	   Half a million people rioted across East Germany on June 17,
1953 after the government imposed a 10 percent rise in production
quotas. Soviet troops were called out to put down the uprising,
killing dozens and arresting thousands of protesters.

Leftists stage demonstrations across Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Communists, socialists and other leftists
on Tuesday held small rallies across Ukraine to protest President
Leonid Kuchma's reform policies and demand his resignation.
	   Cold weather apparently limited attendance. The demonstration
near presidential headquarters in the capital, Kiev, drew only 700
people. About 2,700 rallied in the northeastern industrial Kharkiv
region, the Interfax and the UNIAN news agencies reported.
	   ``Ukraine is prepared for a peaceful revolution and is ready to
oust this anti-people president through elections,'' said Socialist
Party leader Vasyl Arestov. Ukraine's next presidential elections
are scheduled for October 1999.
	   The Federation of Trade Unions said it was negotiating with the
government over various workers' demands and refused to participate
in Tuesday's protest.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A dairy company said: dig in. But Kurds on
a hunger strike to support rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan answered:
no thanks.
	   More than one dozen supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party,
or PKK, watched Tuesday as a Greek dairy company and a cooking
school prepared what was billed as the world's largest profiterole,
a nearly five-ton chocolate and cream puff mousse covered with
half-a-ton of whipped cream.
	   Kurdish protesters have been sitting in a central Athens square
since Ocalan's Nov. 12 arrest in Rome. About a dozen say they are
on a hunger strike to demand that Italy not extradite him to
Turkey.
	   Although some people passing by the sweet complained it was in
bad taste, the sweet was completed and was given to people passing
through the busy square.
	   Organizers of the event declined comment, as did the hunger
strikers.

Vatican urges negotiations to end Congo war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new comment from Kabila; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II granted a brief audience
Tuesday to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, urging him to seek a
negotiated end to the civil war in his troubled African nation.
	   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Kabila also met with
the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, and with
Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the secretary for foreign relations.
	   Navarro-Valls said the nearly 4-month-old conflict in Congo
dominated the talks.
	   The Holy See, he said, urged a ``dialogue on either the
international or national level'' to achieve ``a peaceful solution
that safeguards the principles of territorial integrity and
national sovereignty with respect for the rights of each individual
and social group.''
	   Kabila's papal audience lasted only about 20 minutes. It came
just a day after Amnesty International issued a report on
atrocities by both Kabila's forces and the rebels. The
international human rights group said both were waging war against
civilians.
	   ``He understands the problem, he knows the problem,'' Kabila
said afterward of the pontiff. ``The pope said `We want everybody
to respect other countries.' This is the good message he has given
us and to the whole community of the West.''
	   Congolese rebels have urged the pontiff and European leaders to
pressure Kabila to negotiate a cease-fire directly with them.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks, demanding instead that
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for the
insurgents and leave Congo. He rejected the idea once again on
Tuesday.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels and say they'll stay as long as Congo
remains unstable.
	   Kabila, who took power after toppling the late President Mobutu
Sese Seko in 1997, is on his first European tour since the Aug. 2
rebellion against him began. After Rome, he goes to Brussels and
Paris for a summit for French-speaking African nations on Thursday.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras began his bid to make
tennis history Tuesday by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 at
the start of the ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in row, crushed the same opponent he beat
in last year's final, when he won his fourth title in the elite
season-ending tournament.
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.
	   He rolled through the first set with his powerful
serve-and-volley game, making few errors and keeping Kafelnikov on
the defensive.
	   Sampras also broke the Russian's serve in the opening game of
the second set. But Kafelnikov battled back when his passing shots
found their range and he pulled level at 3-3.
	   It proved to be a brief revival for Kafelnikov. Sampras won the
next two games and had a match point at 5-3, but Kafelnikov hit a
service winner to save himself.
	   Sampras had trouble closing the match. He wasted four more match
points, one on a double-fault and had to fight off a break point.
But two straight backhand errors by Kafelnikov finally gave Sampras
the victory after 66 minutes.
	   ``I definitely had a lot of work to do in the second set,''
Sampras said. ``I didn't want to do what I did last year when I
lost my first match and played a little bit flat. I didn't want to
dig myself into a hole, having to win my next two matches.''
	   Karol Kucera played Carlos Moya in a later match.
	   Marcelo Rios, who trails Sampras by only 33 points in the
rankings and has a shot at taking over the No. 1 spot in final year
rankings, played the last match of the day, against Tim Henman.
	   Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5
million tournament that brings together the eight players with the
best results in the year. The round-robin portion consists of two
four-man groups, with two players from each advancing to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras now has a 10-2 career lead over Kafelnikov and has won
heir last six matches. He beat Kafelnikov in three quick sets in
last year's final.
	   To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically has to keep pace with
the Chilean. Rios needs to win at least two round-robin matches to
have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each group advance to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras has finished the last five years as No. 1 in the world,
a record he shares with Connors, the fellow American who did it
from 1974 to 1978.

Woman poised to become Slovenian defense minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia was poised to get its first
female Cabinet member after a key coalition party nominated
40-year-old Marija Ribic as defense minister Tuesday.
	   If Premier Janez Drnovsek accepts the recommendation of the
Slovene People's Party, the No. 2 force in the country's coalition
government, it could end a month-long standoff in the defense
department. Parliament must also approve the choice.
	   Former Defense Minister Alojz Krapez was forced to quit Oct. 20
after opposition leaders revealed he accepted an apartment reserved
for members of the uniformed armed services, which government
officials are not allowed to use.
	   Parliament accepted his resignation only on Tuesday, a day after
Krapez protested the government's long delay in naming a successor.
	   Drnovsek is expected to give Ribic's candidacy especially close
scrutiny. She was the subject of a criminal investigation last year
for alleged financial swindles in an accountant company, and now
works in the ministry's financial department.
	   Slovenia is in NATO's Partnership for Peace program and was
considered a potential candidate for NATO membership. But its
defense ministry has seen repeated troubles.
	   Krapez's predecessor, Tit Turnsek, had to resign in March after
a van equipped to do electronic surveillance for the intelligence
services was caught in neighboring Croatia.

Cyprus protests airspace violations by Turkish warplanes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to restore cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus said Tuesday it has protested to
the United Nations and to international aviation authorities over
repeated violations of its airspace by Turkish warplanes recently.
	   One protest was over flights by Turkish warplanes bound for
Israel and another was over last week's landing of Turkish planes
in the Turkish-occupied north of the island during military
exercises, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kornelios Korneliou said.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou had complained on
Monday about these flights, saying a formal protest should be made
to Israel as well as to the U.N. and aviation authorities.
	   But Korneliou said Israel was left out of the protest because no
Israeli planes were involved in the violations.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north following the 1974 Turkish invasion and
occupation of the northern third of the island. A breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by Ankara which
maintains 35,000 troops there.

Roche families worth an estimated dlrs 20 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The families who control
Switzerland's Roche pharmaceuticals giant are worth 25-30 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 18-21 billion), according to a list of
Switzerland's Richest published Tuesday.
	   The survey by Bilanz business magazine said the Hoffmann, Sacher
and Oeri families had managed to increase their wealth by 5 billion
francs (dlrs 3.6 billion) during the past year despite the turmoil
on international stock markets.
	   The three families _ offshoots of the Hoffmann-La-Roche company
founders _ have a big stake in the pharmaceuticals firm. They are
traditionally at the top of the annual Swiss survey and high on the
Forbes list of billionaires worldwide.
	   The latest Forbes list, published at the end of September, said
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, was by far the world's wealthiest man
with dlrs 58.4 billion.
	   A car dealer and software entrepreneur, Walter Haefner, followed
in second place on the Swiss survey with an estimated value of 10
billion francs (dlrs 7 billion).
	   Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the Danish manufacturer of the lego
game, headed the list of newcomers. He settled in a village in the
low-tax canton (state) of Zug with a fortune estimated at 3-4
billion francs (dlrs 2.1-2.8 billion), according to Bilanz.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Masked robbers burst into a posh Paris department
store Tuesday and shot a guard in the head when he tried to stop
them, leaving him in critical condition, police said. Eight others
were injured, four seriously.
	   The thieves were chased by a crowd of angry shoppers, but
nevertheless escaped with 240,000 francs (dlrs 42,100) from the
money-changing office at the Printemps store on Paris' Right Bank.
	   The guard was hospitalized and in critical condition at the
Pitie Salpetriere hospital, emergency workers said.
	   The thieves escaped through the back entrance of the shop, and a
bullet shell could be seen lying on the curb, circled by a white
line of chalk. Nearby, there was a pool of blood on the pavement.
	   Store officials refused to give immediate comment, and a
saleswoman at the Lancome cosmetics counter said only, ``We've been
ordered not to talk.''
	   Two men and two women were also seriously injured, police said.
Three other women and a man received light injuries. The injured
were both customers and employees.
	   Fifty firemen and 15 fire trucks rushed to the scene, as did
Paris police chief Philippe Massoni.

Ronaldo returns for Inter as pressure mounts on coach Simoni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Can Ronaldo save Gigi Simoni's job?
	   The Brazilian star returns to Inter Milan's lineup for
Wednesday's Champions League game against defending titlist Real
Madrid.
	   A defeat in the San Siro stadium almost certainly would mean
Inter's elimination from the competition.
	   And, according to Inter owner Massimo Moratti, that would cost
coach Simoni his job.
	   Ronaldo has been dogged by injuries since the World Cup final
and comes off a knee problem which apparently has now healed.
	   Inter needs him desperately.
	   Simoni's team is mired in sixth place in Serie A, having lost to
leader Fiorentina on Sunday, and has two points to make up on Group
C leader Real Madrid.
	   A sellout crowd of 80,000 is expected at San Marino, where Real
has never never won against either of the Milan clubs in 10
European games.
	   Fortunately for Inter, Real's domestic form is patchy too. A 3-1
loss to Valencia on Sunday left the club in fourth place and off
the pace in the Spanish league, with 18 goals conceded in 11 games.
	   ``Our rival is not Inter,'' said coach Guus Hiddink. ``It is
ourselves.''
	   But Simoni doesn't want his team to rely on Real's problems.
	   ``They are not doing too well in the Spanish league. But we must
not think of our opponents' misfortunes,'' Simoni said. ``We must
think of winning the match.''
	   Spartak Moscow has the same number of points as Inter and should
gain three more from a home game against Sturm Graz, which has so
far lost all four games.
	   Although Spartak has a better goal difference, a victory for
Inter over Real would Simoni's team top because it has a better
head-to-head record _ a win and a tie against the Russians.
	   Another big confrontation Wednesday is Barcelona against
Manchester United in Group D. The Spanish giants are out if they
lose.
	   Louis van Gaal's team lost twice to Bayern Munich in its last
two Champions League games. United is unbeaten with eight points,
having scored 11 goals in its last two outings against Danish club
Brondby.
	   Manager Alex Ferguson believes a victory in Camp Nou would
guarantee his team a place in the quarterfinal with a game to
spare.
	   ``We could qualify as (at least) the highest second-placed side,
and that is a surprise when you consider the group we are in,'' he
said.
	   If Ferguson's team slips up, Bayern Munich can go top by beating
Brondby at home.
	   With the Galatasaray-Juventus game postponed a week because of
political conflict between Turkey and Italy, Norway's Rosenborg has
the chance to go top of Group B by beating last place Athletic
Bilbao. Bilbao has yet to win a game in the group but has tied
three times, including 1-1 with the Norwegians.
	   Ajax Amsterdam and Olympiakos can eliminate Croatia Zagreb and
FC Porto by winning their home games Wednesday. Each has seven
points against their opponents' four and, while Ajax hosts Croatia,
the Greek champion welcomes the Portuguese titlist.
	   The closest finish appears to be in Group E where leader
Panathinaikos has six points and Dynamo Kiev, Lens and Arsenal each
have five.
	   Kiev receives Panathinaikos with temperatures likely to drop to
minus 15 Celsius (plus 5 Fahrenheit). Arsenal, which slipped to
last after losing in Ukraine, hosts French champion Lens without
injured French star Patrick Vieira. Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp,
who is receiving intensive treatment on a calf muscle injury, is
also questionable.
	   With a five-point lead, German champion Kaiserslautern will
clinch a place with a victory at Benfica. The Germans have 10
points from four games and have the best record of the 24 teams.
	   HJK Helsinki, second with five points, welcomes midfielder Aarno
Turpeinen back after a four-game suspension as it hosts PSV
Eindhoven, which is last with three.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Calling it an act of good will,
ethnic Albanian rebels freed a kidnapped Serb policeman Tuesday,
and their political representative signaled possible acceptance of
a U.S. peace plan.
	   But Kosovo Liberation Army spokesman Adem Demaci also said KLA
guerrillas are preparing for more fighting with the Serb-led
government if a negotiated settlement is not reached by spring.
	   ``The KLA has no illusions ... and it is preparing, if need be,
to rise again in defense of the Albanian people,'' said Demaci. ``I
am not an optimist. I'm afraid the Serb regime will once more force
us into spilling blood.''
	   Despite U.S. efforts to find a peace formula that would win
support of all Kosovo factions, the positions of the two sides on
the future of the province are still far apart.
	   Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians, including Demaci, reject any
possibility of the province remaining part of Serbia, the largest
of Yugoslavia's two republics. Serbia has rejected a U.S.-drafted
plan which would in effect separate Kosovo from Serbia Kosovo but
keep the province within the Yugoslav federation, which also
includes Montenegro.
	   Serbia came up with a counterproposal last week and President
Milan Milutinovic called for talks on Wednesday to discuss it. Such
Serb-organized talks have failed in the past and the latest
invitation has been rejected by ethnic Albanian negotiators led by
Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Demaci said that for the first time he too had been invited to
attend the meeting and hailed the move.
	   So far the government has refused to negotiate with the
``terrorists.'' Demaci said the invitation for talks was de facto
recognition of the rebels' importance in achieving peace in Kosovo.
	   American envoy Christopher Hill met twice with the KLA
representatives earlier this month to discuss his peace plan, which
falls short of the rebels' demand for full independence.
	   But Demaci signaled the rebels might support it.
	   ``Hill's plan is far from what we really want, but we are not
rejecting it,'' he said.
	   The rebel spokesman seemed to back down from earlier KLA demands
for a complete withdrawal of army and police from Kosovo before
talks could start. He demanded release of political and other
ethnic Albanian prisoners and an end ``to Serb provocations,''
instead. He also said talks should be held on the Yugoslav level
``because the Albanians do not see the solution of their problems
within Serbia.''
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoys led to an end of
hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of much of the Serb-led
forces. But sporadic violence continues. Each side accuses the
other of starting it.
	   After talks in Belgrade with Hill late Monday, Milutinovic
condemned continuing ``terrorist acts'' by the KLA and declared
that its attacks on ``innocent citizens, police and soldiers'' must
be stopped.
	   Milutinovic demanded that Hill personally condemn the KLA's
actions.
	   The release of policeman Goran Zbiljic, kidnapped in Podujevo,
northeast of the capital Pristina, followed intervention by U.S.
diplomatic observers in Kosovo who persuaded the rebels to let him
go.
	   The KLA was still believed to be holding two ethnic Albanian
civilians who vanished along with the policeman Nov. 17. The two
are considered sympathetic to the Serb cause.
	   ``We're not sure what the disposition for the other two will be,
but we're hopeful that everybody can come home,'' said William
Slavik, the observer who led the negotiations.
	   Zbiljic said he had been kept alone in a room during his
detention but had not been mistreated.
	   ``War is not good. There has to be peace,'' he said as he
stepped out of the car on a hill overlooking Podujevo. ``As soon as
possible, the politicians have to do something because people are
dying, people are suffering.''
	   Both the government forces and the KLA are believed to have
captured hundreds of people during the seven months of fighting.
The Serb crackdown against the KLA claimed hundreds of lives _ most
of them ethnic Albanian _ and made hundreds of thousands more
homeless.

Saddam replaces 18 ambassadors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered the
replacement of 18 Iraqi ambassadors, including the country's envoy
to the United Nations, government officials said Tuesday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, the ambassador to the U.N., will be replaced by
his deputy, Saeed al-Mausawi, the officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   It is not known what post Hamdoon will get.
	   Saddam's half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who was Iraq's U.N.
representative in Geneva, has already been replaced by Mohammed
al-Douri, a legal adviser in the foreign ministry, the officials
said.
	   Iraq signaled it was going to replace its ambassadors earlier
this year and the new envoys will take office by the end of the
year, the officials said.
	   The government is said to hope that the new envoys will be able
to drum up more support for its campaign to lift the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the embargo, which allows
only limited sales of oil, will not be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In two other appointments, Sultan al-Shawi will become Iraq's
representative at the Arab League in Cairo and Naji al-Hadithi, who
has long dealt with foreign media in the Culture and Information
Ministry, will go to Vienna as ambassador to Austria and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA is charged with overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's
nuclear program.

Plymouth hosts first Thanksgiving festival for homesick Americans

<TEXT>
	   PLYMOUTH, England (AP) _ Turkey and cranberry sauce. A Raiders
game. The kickoff for Christmas shopping.
	   The city where the Pilgrims embarked for the New World in 1620
is going to celebrate Thanksgiving this year for the first time,
and it is trying to add the right touches.
	   So what if the Raiders play basketball, not football, and the
shopping isn't all that frenzied? It's the thought that counts.
	   Still, it's the thought that counts.
	   The Pilgrims founded Thanksgiving a year after they landed at
Massachusetts' Plymouth Rock, after setting sail from this
southwestern English city on the Mayflower.
	   Now, Plymouth's civic leaders plan to raise the American flag as
part of a three-day annual Thanksgiving event aimed at establishing
the city as the home away from home for expatriate Americans.
	   It's not quite like home _ there's a bit of the Fourth of July
thrown in, with a ``Star-Spangled'' fireworks display, and the
Royal Shakespeare Company will stage ``Twelfth Night'' _ but the
basics are there:
	   Lots of feasting, with turkey, sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie at
every turn, and U.S.-style late-night Christmas shopping on the day
after Thanksgiving.
	   ``I know it's not going to be like it is at home, but I'm pretty
excited about it,'' said Susan Schenk, a teacher from Philadelphia
who is spending this Thanksgiving with her family in Plymouth. ``It
has made me feel wanted and considered as an American.''
	   Plus, there's another bonus.
	   ``I haven't had to explain to anybody why I'm going there,
because everyone knows the pilgrims left from Plymouth,'' Mrs.
Schenk said.
	   Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the city also is launching its
Great American Heritage Trail, a three-mile (five-kilometer) path
retracing five centuries of trans-Atlantic exploration,
colonization, emigration and other links to the United States,
which contains towns called Plymouth in 24 states.
	   The trail starts at a place where some of 102 Puritans are
believed to have been sheltered and fed before their departure on
the Mayflower.
	   The building, dating from 1431, is now England's oldest gin
distillery and displays a plaque commemorating the names of all the
Pilgrim fathers who left in search of religious freedom.
	   The Pilgrim mothers and children were not commemorated until 10
years ago, when a plaque was placed outside another building where
the Pilgrims reportedly ate before the trip.
	   At the port lies the Mayflower memorial portal, a mini-replica
of the portal at the U.S. Plymouth Rock, and more plaques
commemorating various American connections. The portal leads to the
Mayflower Steps, winding down to the point where the ship set out
for the New World.
	   A true American, Mrs. Schenk has instructed her daughter, who is
studying in Plymouth, to find the family a good place to eat
Thanksgiving dinner.
	   ``That's the most important thing,'' she said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student protesters
occupied the attorney general's office for nearly 12 hours Tuesday
to press their demand that former President Suharto be put on
trial.
	   Another 2,000 campus activists staged separate anti-government
rallies, and Indonesia's military chief warned that protests would
persist until promised parliamentary elections in mid-1999.
	   The military said 163 soldiers involved in deadly clashes with
students had been confined to their barracks for three weeks.
	   Most of them allegedly fired at protesters without permission
from their superiors and could face courts-martial pending an
investigation.
	   At least nine student protesters were killed in fighting with
soldiers Nov. 13 during a government assembly on reforms of
Indonesia's rigid political system.
	   Although armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto had ordered riot
officers to carry only blanks and plastic bullets, hospital doctors
said they found metal bullet fragments in some victims.
	   More than 1,000 students entered the compound of the office of
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib to demand that Suharto be
tried charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   The 77-year-old former army general quit in May after riots and
protests against his three-decade authoritarian rule.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the students, who occupied the office
lobby as student representatives held talks with Ghalib.
	   He refused to accept their demands that Suharto be put on trial
within one month. Many students later left voluntarily, and a last
group of 200 agreed to board military trucks that ferried them to
their university campuses shortly before midnight.
	   Some students scuffled with officers, but the evacuation was
largely peaceful.

Nazi-looted Rodin sculpture to be installed in Tuileries

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bronze cast of Auguste Rodin's monumental ``The
Kiss,'' looted by the Nazis during World War II, goes on permanent
display in the Tuileries Gardens Wednesday after decades out of the
public eye.
	   The installation is part of a plan by the Culture Ministry to
put 20 pieces of modern sculpture in the city's most popular royal
gardens by the end of next year.
	   In recent years, ``The Kiss,'' the world-famous portrayal of a
couple locked in an amorous embrace, has adorned the private
gardens behind Matignon, the French prime minister's official
residence. It hasn't been seen in public for decades.
	   But now, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ``believes that
displaying the sculpture in a prominent place increases its chances
of being claimed by its rightful owners or their heirs,'' says
Alain Kirili, the French sculptor who conceived the Tuileries
Sculpture Project.
	   The government has made a number of efforts recently to show it
is actively investigating wartime abuses by the collaborationist
Vichy regime. It recently published a catalog of missing Dutch and
Flemish paintings.
	   ``The Kiss'' is among thousands of art works looted by the Nazis
and recovered after the war. Most were returned soon after, but it
was revealed last year that some 2,000 still hang in French museums
or decorate official embassies and residences around the world,
their ownership yet untraced.
	   ``The Kiss,'' No. 24 on the government's list of recovered
works, became state property in 1951.
	   ``We found no trace of ownership,'' said Olivier Kaeppelin, a
Culture Ministry official. ``If someone comes forward, which we
hope will happen, there will be a thorough verification.''
	   The Rodin is among the first 12 pieces of modern sculpture being
installed this week in the Tuileries, to be inaugurated by Jospin
Dec. 9. The rest will be in place by the end of next year.
	   ``It's about time the 20th century got into the Tuileries,''
said Kirili, who in 1985 became the first living artist to have a
work in the gardens.
	   His ``Commandment'' _ composed of a dozen or so small figures in
white forged iron resembling letters _ was a site-specific
commission by then-Culture Minister Jack Lang.
	   Others pieces installed this week include Jean Dubuffet's
colorful ``Le Bel Costume;'' Rodin's ``Eve,'' ``L'Ombre'' (Shadow),
and ``Meditation;'' Alberto Giacometti's ``Grande Femme II;'' Henry
Moore's ``Figure Couchee;'' and ``Primo Piano II'' by American
sculptor David Smith.
	   The Tuileries, laid out by Le Notre in the 17th century as a
playground for royalty, are widely regarded as King Louis XIV's
greatest gift to Parisians.
	   But in a country where matters of art take on national
importance, there was opposition to making way for Rodin and his
contemporaries rather than for living artists, who need work.
	   ``The Tuileries, which have always been synonymous with state
power, should have been an opportunity to commission works from
contemporary artists,'' said Anne Pingeot, a sculpture curator at
the Orsay Museum _ better known as the mother of the late Francois
Mitterrand's illegitimate daughter, Mazarine.
	   Lamenting the garden's dust and mud, she called for putting the
project's six million-franc- (dls 1.1 million) cost towards
planting grass.
	   ``Ask any Parisian what he wants and he'll tell you: more grass,
not a sculpture garden,'' she said in telephone interview.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A gloomy, overflow crowd of
thousands gathered Tuesday in a moving tribute to a slain Russian
lawmaker, a popular and vivacious woman who was buried as a
national hero.
	   The burial of Galina Starovoitova was delayed several hours
because the crowd, estimated at up to 10,000 people, lined up
outside the hall where her open casket lay and demanded a chance to
pay their final respects.
	   Starovoitova, a feisty liberal leader and member of parliament
who planned to run for president in 2000, was shot to death last
Friday evening as she walked up the stairs to her apartment with an
aide, who was critically wounded.
	   Her death has galvanized Russia's liberal reformers, deepened
the fault lines between Russia's left and right and brought forth
anguished calls to end the violence and lawlessness that has
plagued post-Soviet Russian society.
	   ``To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at a memorial
service. ``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her life for.''
	   Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most
prominent political figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St.
Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the service.
	   An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons, red-and-white
wreaths and floral bouquets, stood at the head of the hall, flanked
by a military honor guard.
	   ``Forgive us, Galina Vasiliyevna, that we who have the power
entrusted to us, we who were your colleagues, could not protect and
defend you,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, the
only woman in a top government post, her voice quavering.
	   Other speakers included former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff. Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee
the investigation into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow
hospital recovering from pneumonia.
	   ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole
of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives for that
murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and society
should know all the truth about it.''
	   Yarov was among several speakers at the service to say that
Starovoitova's death should serve as a catalyst for uniting
democratic forces. Her political allies have blamed Communists for
her death, although police have said they have no idea who killed
her.
	   Political finger-pointing aside, her death has struck a deep
chord among Russians, as demonstrated by the throngs who gathered
outside the memorial service.
	   ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this
never happens again,'' said Vadim Olshevsky, manager of a
construction company.
	   But, he added bitterly, ``There's little hope of that in our
country.''
	   People across Russia dimmed the lights in her memory for a few
minutes at 8 p.m. Moscow time (1700 GMT), at the urging of her
political party, Russia's Democratic Choice.
	   One national television channel turned over its daytime
programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers
carried page after page of coverage of her death.
	   After the memorial service, a private funeral was held in a
church at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in central St. Petersburg.
Then, as the Russian national anthem was played, her coffin was
lowered into its grave in the monastery's cemetery, one of Russia's
most hallowed resting places.
	   Among others buried there are the composers Peter Tchaikovsky
and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky.
	   Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior
Ministry, insisted that the case would be solved. ``It will take
time,'' he said, according to Interfax, but added that
investigators ``have tips, they have something to work on.''
	   The aide who was wounded in the attack, 27-year-old Ruslan
Linkov, has spoken to investigators, although they have cautioned
that he was unable to provide very much information.
	   Linkov, who has been heavily guarded to protect him from a
further assassination attempt, was moved out of intensive care
Tuesday, Interfax reported.

Prince's charity pleads guilty over death of two volunteers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fine, reaction from trust, grafs 1-5. Minor
changes throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NORTH RONALDSAY, Scotland (AP) _ A charity set up by Prince
Charles to help young people was fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,500)
on Tuesday in connection with the death of two volunteers on a
remote Scottish island.
	   The Prince's Trust pleaded guilty to breaching safety rules by
allowing two inexperienced volunteers to work beneath a huge slab
of concrete that later collapsed, killing them.
	   ``Everyone at The Prince's Trust Volunteers is deeply upset at
this very tragic accident,'' said Elizabeth Crowther-Hunt, the
trust's executive director. ``Our thoughts and sympathies are with
the families of the two young men who lost their lives.''
	   ``It is clear,'' she said, that the safety procedures had not
been sufficient ``on this occasion,'' and they have been reviewed.
The trust had ``put in place new measures to do everything we
possibly can to prevent anything like this ever happening again.
	   ``It is of paramount importance that we learn every lesson from
this terrible tragedy,'' she said.
	   Rescuers worked for seven hours to save Gary Leaburn, 25, and
Derek Taylor, 19, who were crushed as they laid concrete under the
five-ton slab, part of a sea wall on the Scottish Orkney island of
North Ronaldsay on Aug. 6, 1997.
	   Prosecutor Graeme Napier told the Kirkwall Sheriff's Court in
Orkney that all sides agreed the pair were ``not competent'' to
carry out what was a major structural engineering job organized by
The Prince's Trust.
	   ``They should not have been involved,'' Napier said.
	   Leaburn and Taylor were among 13 volunteers from the Scottish
city of Dundee recruited to repair walls damaged in storms in 1993
at Garso Wick, on the northern shore of North Ronaldsay, the most
northerly of the Orkney islands.
	   Prince Charles, who knows the Orkneys well and went to inspect
repairs, found the islanders did not have the resources to fix the
wall, designed to keep local sheep, who live on seaweed, away from
the island's interior.
	   So teams recruited by The Prince's Trust traveled several times
to North Ronaldsay to make repairs.
	   ``It was well known that the Prince of Wales had been
sympathetic to the problems of the islanders,'' Napier said.
	   Volunteers dug out foundations under a section of concrete sea
wall and, by the day of the accident, had excavated a large area,
he said.
	   ``The two volunteers who died were working in the hole, pouring
concrete into it at the time of the accident. There were no
supports or props holding the weight of the wall,'' Napier added.
	   He said the piece of concrete that killed the men measured 20
feet (6 meters) by 5 feet (1.5 meters) and was two feet (0.6
meters) thick in parts.
	   The Prince's Trust and the board of management of Angus College
in Arbroath were charged with contravening the Health and Safety at
Work Act. Similar charges against Colin Robertson, a former
employee of Angus College, were dropped before Tuesday's hearing.

Saddam replaces 18 ambassadors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered the
replacement of 18 Iraqi ambassadors, including the country's envoy
to the United Nations, government officials said Tuesday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, the ambassador to the United Nations, will be
replaced by his deputy, Saeed al-Mausawi, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It is not known what post Hamdoon will get.
	   Saddam's half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who was Iraq's U.N.
representative in Geneva, has already been replaced by Mohammed
al-Douri, a legal adviser in the foreign ministry, the officials
said.
	   Iraq signaled it was going to replace its ambassadors earlier
this year and the new envoys will take office by the end of the
year, the officials said.
	   The government is said to hope that the new envoys will be able
to drum up more support for its campaign to lift the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Gulf
War.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the embargo, which allows
only limited sales of oil, will not be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In two other appointments, Sultan al-Shawi will become Iraq's
representative at the Arab League in Cairo and Naji al-Hadithi, who
has long dealt with foreign media in the Culture and Information
Ministry, will go to Vienna as ambassador to Austria and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA is charged with overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's
nuclear program.

Iraq pours hundreds into the streets, stands tough in crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq poured hundreds into the streets
Tuesday to protest eight years of U.N. sanctions, and its leaders
promised not to relent to pressure in its standoff with the United
Nations over documents on its weapons programs.
	   The tough words came a day after the government acknowledged an
assassination attempt on one of its most powerful officials.
	   Hundreds of Iraqis, many of them elderly women clad in black,
arrived by bus outside the U.N. headquarters to protest their
plight under sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Women cried, and others beat their chests in anguish.
	   ``There is no god but God, America is the enemy of God,'' the
crowd shouted. ``Down USA,'' others chanted in the
government-orchestrated demonstration.
	   A convoy of cars drove along the street carrying wood coffins
meant to symbolize children who died during the hardships.
	   At the heart of Iraq's dispute with the United Nations is the
sanctions, which have wrecked a country once one of the Arab
world's most prosperous. Iraq claims 5,000 children die every
month, and U.N. officials acknowledge one in three suffer from
malnutrition.
	   The U.N. Security Council cannot lift the sanctions until U.N.
inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to build
them.
	   Last week, the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, asked
for more documents _ from personal diaries to a log of weapons used
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ as part of that search. But Iraq has
repeatedly insisted that the documents had been destroyed, were
already turned over to inspectors or irrelevant to their searches.
	   Failing to cooperate could delay a U.N. review of progress on
dismantling the weapons that Iraq hopes will ease the sanctions,
and the United States has warned it is still willing to attack Iraq
if it does not do everything the U.N. inspectors ask.
	   The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and five escort ships joined
the American naval fleet in the Gulf, U.S. military officials said
Tuesday. Its arrival brought to 19 the number of warships in the
region, in all carrying 17,000 sailors and marines.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz declared Tuesday that Iraqis
would not submit to the demands, ``regardless of the dangers.''
	   ``Surrendering to their will ... is death itself,'' he told a
poetry festival in the capital Baghdad.
	   Iraq averted what appeared to be an imminent U.S. and British
attack by agreeing to resume the work of U.N. inspectors on Nov.
14. Since then, inspectors have made daily visits to suspected
weapons sites, and Iraqi officials have provided full cooperation.
	   Still, anger remains at Butler, whom the Iraqi government views
as instrumental in prolonging the sanctions. Al-Iraq, an official
newspaper, called Butler on Tuesday a ``cursed devil and mad
bull.''
	   The assassination attempt on Izzat Ibrahim, President Saddam
Hussein's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command Council,
startled Iraqis, accustomed to the iron-fist security that reigns
in the country.
	   Official media said an assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim
as he got out of his car in the Shiite Muslim holy city of Kerbala
in southern Iraq. He escaped but several bodyguards and bystanders
were wounded.
	   The assailant was reportedly shot in the neck and killed.
	   The assassination attempt was the first known attack on a senior
official since December 1996, when gunmen shot Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, about 10 times while he waited in his car in an upscale
Baghdad neighborhood. Odai survived with grievous injuries.
	   Southern Iraq was the site of fierce fighting in the aftermath
of the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi military crushed an uprising by
Shiite Muslim rebels. Iraqi opposition groups in London have said
fighting has flared again there in recent months, and that Ibrahim
even commanded some units sent to fight the rebels.

Report: Primakov heading to India on Nov. 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will
travel to India on Sunday for talks on relations and possibly
extending a pact on military cooperation, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Primakov will stay for three or four days, Interfax quoted
Indian diplomatic sources in Moscow as saying.
	   Boris Yeltsin had been scheduled to go to India for an official
visit next month, but he postponed the trip last week and asked
Primakov to go.
	   The Kremlin insisted that Primakov wasn't going in place of
Yeltsin and said the change had nothing to do with Yeltsin's
health. The president is in the hospital recovering from pneumonia.
	   Primakov and Indian officials may sign a new agreement on
military and technical cooperation through 2010, Interfax said. The
two countries have an agreement now that expires in 2000.

Reports: DiMaggio has lung cancer, had heart attack

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Miami TV station confirming illness. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio, who has been hospitalized for more
than a month, has lung cancer and had a heart attack last week, TV
station WPIX reported.
	   The station, which televised New York Yankees games for 48
years, on Monday night cited three sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity. WPIX news executives declined to elaborate on the
sourcing.
	   DiMaggio's lawyer denied that the Hall of Famer, who turns 84 on
Wednesday, had a heart attack or was gravely ill.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said Tuesday. ``Mr.
DiMaggio and his family heard this information on the television
and were very upset.''
	   WTVJ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Miami, cited unidentified sources
close to DiMaggio to say it confirmed he had a heart attack and has
lung cancer. The station also said he was on a ventilator.
	   Engelberg did not say whether DiMaggio had cancer or surgery to
remove a lung tumor. The lawyer's office said he was not available
to elaborate.
	   DiMaggio has been hospitalized in Hollywood, Florida, since Oct.
12 for what Engelberg said was pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   However, WPIX said DiMaggio had a tumor removed from his lung
last month.
	   The station added that when Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
canceled a visit last week, he was told DiMaggio ``probably
wouldn't have recognized him anyway.''
	   The report also said friends of DiMaggio were concerned about
who was in control of his estate, which WPIX said includes a
collectible and memorabilia fortune worth about dlrs 20 million.
	   Personnel at Memorial Regional Hospital have not provided
information on DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators have
even denied DiMaggio is a patient.
	   Engelberg said Tuesday that DiMaggio had told him not to discuss
his health with anyone other than his doctors or immediate family.
	   The lawyer, a longtime friend, said the baseball great would
celebrate his birthday at the hospital with his grandchildren,
great grandchildren, brother Dom and some of the hospital staff.
Engelberg said he would be there as well.

Brazilian world record-holder enters London Marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, ADDS quotes, byline
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa, who ran the fastest
marathon in history this year, believes he can go even faster in
next year's London Marathon.
	   Da Costa clocked a world best of 2 hours, 6 minutes, five
seconds, at the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 20. That surpassed the
previous record of 2:06:50, set by Ethiopia's Belayneh Densimo at
Rotterdam in 1988.
	   Announcing his entry for the April 18 London Marathon, Da Costa
said he was capable of lowering the mark again.
	   ``Firstly, I would like to win the race. If it goes well, I
would like to make a change here,'' the Brazilian said, pointing to
the 2:06.05 printed on his sweatshirt.
	   ``During the race I'll see how things are going and make the
decision then.''
	   That's just what Da Costa did when he broke Densimo's
10-year-old mark in Berlin. Attempting to run around 2:07, he was
told halfway through the race that he was well outside that
schedule.
	   He quickened and ran the second half of the Berlin race in an
amazing 61 seconds compared with 64 for the first half and
surprised the crowd by doing two victory cartwheels after crossing
the line.
	   ``In Berlin I did two cartwheels, in London I'll do three,'' Da
Costa said through an interpreter.
	   The field for the race will also include 1996 Olympic champion
Josia Thugwane of South Africa and 1996 Olympic silver medalist Lee
Bong-Ju of South Korea.
	   ``With the world's fastest man, the Olympic champion and Olympic
silver medalist, we're confident we will have the strongest London
Marathon ever,'' Bedford said.
	   Also entered is two-time London champion Antonio Pinto of Spain,
winner in 1992 and 1997, whose fastest time for the race, 2:07.55,
is in danger.
	   ``After his run in Berlin, Ronaldo has to be the most sought
after and exciting runner in the world of distance running,'' said
London Marathon director David Bedford, who estimated the Brazilian
would collect some dlrs 200,000 if he broke the world mark at the
race.
	   A former soccer player who played in goal for his home town
team, Descoberto, despite being only 5-foot-6 (1.67 meters) tall,
Da Costa and his twin brother, Romildo, entered a local road when
prize money was offered. They finished second and third.
	   One of 12 children, Ronaldo said he took up running seriously
when he was offered a job and the company sponsored him while his
brother gave up the sport because he didn't get the sponsorship.

Vatican urges negotiations to end Congo war

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II granted a brief audience
Tuesday to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, urging him to seek a
negotiated end to the civil war in his troubled African nation.
	   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Kabila also met with
the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, and with
Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the secretary for foreign relations.
	   Navarro-Valls said the nearly 4-month-old conflict in Congo
dominated the talks.
	   The Holy See, he said, urged a ``dialogue on either the
international or national level'' to achieve ``a peaceful solution
that safeguards the principles of territorial integrity and
national sovereignty with respect for the rights of each individual
and social group.''
	   Kabila's roughly 20-minute papal audience came a day after
Amnesty International issued a report on atrocities by both
Kabila's forces and the rebels. The international human rights
group said both were waging war against civilians.
	   Protesters jeered Kabila as he went into a later meeting with
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, calling him ``assassin.''
	   Navarro-Valls acknowledged some ``perplexity'' over the pope's
willingness to meet with Kabila.
	   ``To this, our response has always been that you have to keep in
mind that the pope listens to everybody, and that for obvious
reasons, he is probably the only person that in certain cases can
make profound ethical reflections with anyone, something that other
people can't do,'' the Vatican spokesman said.
	   ``So when there's an occasion for the pope to make his voice
heard, to express thoughts on ethics to certain people, I don't see
the reason for such perplexity,'' Navarro-Valls said.
	   ``He understands the problem, he knows the problem,'' Kabila
said afterward of the pontiff. ``The pope said `We want everybody
to respect other countries.' This is the good message he has given
us and to the whole community of the West.''
	   Kabila also met with members of Sant' Egidio, a Roman Catholic
group trying to arrange talks for the Congo, as it has in other
international conflicts. There was no immediate word on any
outcome.
	   Congolese rebels have urged the pontiff and European leaders to
pressure Kabila to negotiate a cease-fire directly with them.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks, demanding instead that
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for the
insurgents and leave Congo. He rejected the idea once again on
Tuesday.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels and say they'll stay as long as Congo
remains unstable.
	   Kabila, who took power after toppling the late President Mobutu
Sese Seko in 1997, is on his first European tour since the Aug. 2
rebellion against him began. After Rome, he goes to Brussels and
Paris for a summit for French-speaking African nations on Thursday.

AS Roma 1, FC Zurich 0 in third-round first-leg of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Francesco Totti converted a penalty kick in
second-half injury time to give Italian league great AS Roma an
undeserved 1-0 victory against FC Zurich in their third-round
first-leg game of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Zurich players bitterly protested the referee decision to grant
the home team a penalty when Totti himself was pushed by defender
Franco Di Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to reach a long
cross in the 91st minute.
	   Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 15 games at
Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite fans who occasionally
booed the unimpressive play of the home team before the late game
winner.
	   In fact it was underdog Zurich to produce the best scoring
chances at the Olympic stadium.
	   Quick forward Frederic Chassot kicked the ball past the bar,
from a few meters in the 33rd minute, after rushing alone into
Roma's penalty area.
	   Five minutes before Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti had made a
decisive save on a powerful drive by South African forward Thurston
Bartlett.
	   Chassot had another scoring chance in the 60th but his shot was
stopped by Chimenti, a substitute of Roma's No.1 Austrian goalie
Michael Konsel who's recovering from surgery.
	   Roma, often overwhelmed at midfield, wasted a scoring chance
with Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio in the 42nd while Totti hit the
post with a diagonal shot in the 15th.
	   Totti had earned and converted a controversial penalty kick also
in Sunday's league game against Bari, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   Swiss officials were furious with British referee Young who
ignored a dubious intervention by Damiano Tommasi on Brazilian
forward Lima inside Roma's penalty area in the 50th.
	   Roma, second to Fiorentina in the Italian league standings, will
travel to Zurich for the second leg on Dec. 8.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moya winning &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras began his bid to make
tennis history Tuesday by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 at
the start of the ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in
the world for six years in a row, crushed the same opponent he beat
in last year's final, when he won his fourth title in the elite
season-ending tournament.
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.
	   In a battle between the other two players in Sampras' Red Group,
Carlos Moya rallied to beat Karol Kucera 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, won his first indoor match of
the year, after going 0-5 until Hanover.
	   The Spaniard turned the match in the second set, when Kucera
first double-faulted to give Moya a set point and then hit a simple
forehand into the net.
	   Moya broke serve for a decisive break of serve in the third set
of the match that lasted 2 1/2 hours.
	   Sampras rolled through the first set with his powerful
serve-and-volley game, making few errors and keeping Kafelnikov on
the defensive.
	   Sampras also broke the Russian's serve in the opening game of
the second set. But Kafelnikov battled back when his passing shots
found their range and he pulled level at 3-3.
	   It proved to be a brief revival for Kafelnikov. Sampras won the
next two games and had a match point at 5-3, but Kafelnikov hit a
service winner to save himself.
	   Sampras had trouble closing the match. He wasted four more match
points, one on a double-fault and had to fight off a break point.
But two straight backhand errors by Kafelnikov finally gave Sampras
the victory after 66 minutes.
	   ``I definitely had a lot of work to do in the second set,''
Sampras said. ``I didn't want to do what I did last year when I
lost my first match and played a little bit flat. I didn't want to
dig myself into a hole, having to win my next two matches.''
	   Marcelo Rios, who trails Sampras by only 33 points in the
rankings and has a shot at taking over the No. 1 spot in final year
rankings, played the last match of the day, against Tim Henman.
	   Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5
million tournament that brings together the eight players with the
best results in the year. The round-robin portion consists of two
four-man groups, with two players from each advancing to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras now has a 10-2 career lead over Kafelnikov and has won
heir last six matches. He beat Kafelnikov in three quick sets in
last year's final.
	   To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically has to keep pace with
the Chilean. Rios needs to win at least two round-robin matches to
have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each group advance to the
semifinals.
	   Sampras has finished the last five years as No. 1 in the world,
a record he shares with Connors, the fellow American who did it
from 1974 to 1978.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Iraqi oil official asking OPEC for action,
EDITS throughout; CLARIFIES low is London oil price in lead &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure on OPEC to act to lift badly
sagging oil prices grew Tuesday as prices headed to record lows in
London.
	   OPEC ministers and representatives meet in Vienna Wednesday.
	   In Iraq, an oil official pleaded with OPEC to take action,
saying low prices had stripped about dlrs 2 billion from the
maximum dlrs 5.2 billion it is allowed to export in its current
food-for-oil deal with the United Nations.
	   ``We have been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day
and exporting between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we
failed to meet our own financial ceiling,'' Faleh al-Khayat,
director-general of studies and planning in Iraq's Oil Ministry,
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We could have easily done the dlrs 5.2 billion or even more
had it not been for the drastic decline in oil prices,'' al-Khayat
said.
	   Iraq is an OPEC member but has stayed away from past meetings
because of the U.N restrictions that keep it from selling its oil
freely. It also was not sending a minister to the Vienna meeting.
	   In London, Brent crude oil January futures slipped again on the
International Petroleum Exchange to a low of dlrs 11.19 a barrel
Tuesday afternoon, before creeping up slightly to dlrs 11.33.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
by about 30 percent.
	   OPEC's predicament is due an untimely decision to boost
production last winter, just as demand growth was dropping because
of Asia's financial crisis. The resulting oil glut hammered prices,
helping consumers but hurting oil-dependent economies back home.
	   Publicly, OPEC members have been tightlipped on solutions.
	   Arriving Tuesday afternoon, Venezuelan oil minister Dr. Erwin
Jose Arrieta said only that both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers
needed to seek out new markets.
	   ``It's a ... challenge,'' said Arrieta, whose country is widely
believed to be a key offender in overproduction, an issue expected
to figure high on the talks' agenda.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
trying to tighten compliance with production cuts, introduced in
June to soak up the glut; extending the cuts; cutting further, and
calling an exceptional heads of state meeting, an idea proposed by
Algeria and supported by the United Arab Emirates.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6 million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC now produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day,
including Iraq.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Excluding Iraq, where compliance is high, compliance overall is
about 93 percent, the International Energy Agency said, in a report
based on the latest October figures.
	   However, Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia vary from 50 to 84
percent compliance, analysts believe.
	   Iran questions the level the cuts should be judged from, while
Venezuela is worried at losing market share in the United States.
	   Indonesia is not a major exporter and is less closely
scrutinized.
	   Russia, which does not belong to OPEC, promised in the spring it
would cut exports. Instead local producers have pushed exports to
record volumes as oil becomes a precious source of cash amid
economic crisis, analysts say.

Nonagenarian Spaniard learns to read
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Adela Guerrero says she's having a blast
learning to read at age 65. And she owes it all to a fellow
student, her 91-year-old mother.
	   In a mountain hamlet of 250 people called Guajar el Alto in
southern Granada province, they religiously attend an adult
education class four days a week, two hours a day, right after
lunch.
	   ``It's a great two hours,'' said Guerrero by telephone Tuesday.
``The teacher is very nice.''
	   ``They show promise,'' said the teacher, Francisco Lopez.
``These women want to do things.''
	   Of nonagenarian Adelaida Vasco, who has four children, eight
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, Lopez says the rest of
the dozen or so students in the class are crazy about her.
	   ``They treat her with love, respect and affection. At first the
class was hard for her because she had never been to school,''
Lopez said. ``But little by little, she is catching on.''
	   Guerrero said she and her mother wanted to make up for
opportunities they have missed over the course of a rough life. Her
mother, for instance, lost her husband and a son in the Spanish
Civil War of 1936-39.
	   ``We didn't have a chance to go to school,'' Guerrero said.
``All we did was work.''
	   Guerrero explained that she got the education bug from her
mother after Lopez called Mrs. Vasco to suggest they go to school.
``It was all my mother's idea,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Vasco could not be interviewed at length because she has
trouble hearing over the telephone. Asked how she felt, she said
``clumsy'', then handed the phone to her daughter.

Russia's talks with IMF for more loans bring no progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs at end to UPDATE with government issuing new
treasury bills by Dec. 10.; Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is still critical
of the Russian government's plans to tackle the country's economic
crisis and is reluctant to release more loans, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has been pushing the
IMF to release the next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion
aid package, saying it is crucial to pay off huge domestic and
foreign debts.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse following government default on loans in August and
devaluation of the currency.
	   The IMF team wrapped up a week of talks Tuesday after meeting
with senior Cabinet officials and studying the government's 1999
budget estimates.
	   ``The talks aren't over yet and no agreements have been
reached,'' said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who met
with the IMF mission on Wednesday. ``They are studying us and we,
them.''
	   The IMF is expected to come back to Moscow for more talks later
this year.
	   Maslyukov voiced hope that those talks will be successful, but
said that the Fund remained dissatisfied with the budget plan and
specifically urged the government to boost tax collection. ``We
agree with that, but we can't go beyond the limits of what is
possible,'' Maslyukov told reporters.
	   The IMF disapproved of the government's plan to support ailing
industries and insisted that state regulation of the economy should
be minimal.
	   The IMF believes that the ``the state intervention only brings
harm, while the Russian Cabinet thinks that it should control the
process,'' Maslyukov said, according to Russian news reports.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin, who took part in the talks,
said IMF experts also criticized the government's 1999 budget as
not austere enough and its revenue forecast as overly optimistic.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
strict economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for next
year as the main condition for more loans.
	   Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the population
were living below the official poverty line of 644 rubles (just
under dlrs 40) a month, compared to 31 million (21 percent) a year
ago.
	   Russia is also urging the IMF and other creditors to reschedule
its foreign debt, which will require dlrs 17.5 billion to service
next year.
	   Meanwhile, the government has already included prospective IMF
credits in next year's budget and deducted from it debt payments it
hopes to reschedule _ an approach that drew the IMF's complaints,
Vyugin said.
	   Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the
government will issue new treasury bonds by Dec. 10 to replace
those it froze in August, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF and other foreign lenders have demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with holders of the dlrs 40 billion
worth of frozen treasury bills, or GKOs _ including several major
foreign banks.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Federica Faiella and Luciano Milo of
Italy were neck and neck in first place with Russians Natalia
Romaniuta and Danil Barantsev Tuesday, following the compulsory
dances at the world junior figure skating championships.
	   Faiella and Milo, who won the silver medal at the world's last
year, led the Russians after the Viennese waltz but dropped behind
the pair after the tango.
	   The result was encouraging for Romaniuta and Barantsev as they
finished a distant seventh a year ago at the championships in New
Brunswick, Canada.
	   Jamie Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, of the United
States, took third place at the early stages of this event, while
their compatriots, Melissa Gregory, 17, and James Shuford, 20,
placed eleventh.
	   Compulsory dances make up 20 percent of the overall score. The
original dances, counting for 30 percent of the total, will take
place on Thursday, to be followed by the free skate on Friday.
	   The men's short program, led by rising Russian star Ilia
Klimkin, is the other event scheduled later Tuesday.

UN report says prospects for restarting peace process bleak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With contacts severed between Angolan
forces and the head of the former rebel movement UNITA, prospects
for restarting Angola's peace process look bleak, the United
Nations said in a report Tuesday.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was extremely concerned
about the stalled process and deteriorating situation in the
southwestern African nation and warned again that the U.N. observer
mission may have to reduce its presence if security doesn't
improve.
	   While UNITA is primarily responsible for the stalled
implementation of the 1994 peace accord, the government's rejection
of all contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi ``is not likely to
advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation, at least in
the foreseeable future,'' Annan said.
	   And with preparations for a military showdown continuing, the
United Nations is ``unable to carry out most of its mandated tasks,
and the prospects for reactivating the peace process look bleak,''
Annan concluded.
	   The United Nations mediated the so-called Lusaka Protocol
between Angola and UNITA in 1994 to end nearly two decades of civil
war, which erupted after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal. About 500,000 people are thought to have died in the
fighting.
	   But the accord has been unraveling recently with reports of
skirmishes between the two sides and the government's refusal to
deal any longer with Savimbi.
	   Instead, the government has recognized a group of UNITA
dissidents as the legitimate representatives of the group. UNITA is
a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
	   The United Nations says Savimbi is still the legitimate partner
in the peace process and has refused to recognize the new group,
though the U.N. envoy has met with its members.
	   Annan reported that he hadn't received any clarification to a
reported statement by a government official Nov. 20 that said that
unless U.N. officials and the three countries overseeing the peace
process _ the United States, Russia and Portugal _ participate with
the dissidents in a meeting, the government would resolve the
remaining issues alone.
	   Annan also recommended that the mandate of the U.N. observer
mission be extended for up to three months.

Pinochet to learn fate of immunity on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet will
learn Wednesday whether he has diplomatic immunity that would block
his extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture.
	   A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, is considering Spanish and British authorities' appeal of a
High Court ruling holding that Pinochet is entitled to immunity for
any crimes committed while a head of state.
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 on Wednesday, was arrested on a Spanish
arrest warrant Oct. 16 while in a London hospital recuperating from
back surgery.
	   If the House of Lords rules that he cannot be held accountable
for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 tenure in office, Britain
will release him.
	   Meanwhile, he remains in a London hospital awaiting the Lords'
ruling _ although lawyers say he is well enough to be moved.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were killed or
disappeared at the hands of security forces after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Several other countries have filed complaints against Pinochet,
including France, which sources told The Associated Press issued a
second international arrest warrant Tuesday. But Britain would not
be able to act on any warrants if the Lords tribunal upholds
Pinochet's immunity.
	   A win for prosecutors would touch off a lengthy extradition
battle.
	   The spotlight would focus on British Home Secretary Jack Straw,
who has Spain's formal extradition request on his desk, along with
similar requests from France and Switzerland.
	   The Bow Street magistrates court has set a Dec. 2 deadline for
Straw to decide whether to allow the Spanish extradition request to
go before the courts.
	   On the same day, if his health permitted, Pinochet would make
his first public appearance since his arrest at a preliminary
hearing at Bow Street.
	   A medically equipped Chilean Air Force jet has been standing by
at an air base in Oxfordshire since Pinochet's arrest, awaiting his
release.

Makinen claims third straight world title as Sainz breaks down

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Sainz quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Tommi Makinen claimed a record third
straight world rally title when rival Carlos Sainz had his Toyota
engine catch fire just 300 meters (yards) from the finish Tuesday
of the Network Q Rally, depriving the Spaniard of the world title.
	   Sainz, in fourth place at the time, needed only to cross the
line at the end of the final stage to claim the overall season
title, which would have been his third.
	   Sainz's fourth place would have given him three points, one more
in the final season standings than Makinen.
	   Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi won the rally with a 3
minute 46 second advantage over second-place Juha Kankkunen's Ford
with Bruno Thiry's Ford in third.
	   Makinen, who entered the rally with a two-point lead on Sainz,
slid out of the race on Sunday's first day when he skidded on a
patch of oil and hit a concrete pillar.
	   Sainz, one of the most popular drivers on the circuit, was left
in tears on the roadside as co-driver Luis Moya smashed his crash
helmet to the ground in frustration.
	   It was a cruel finish.
	   ``Then engine blew, it couldn't have been worse,'' Sainz said.
	   ``It seems incredible that something like this happened,'' he
added. ``We only needed a few hundred meters. You can't have worse
luck than that.''
	   ``I've been in rallying for 30 years but I've never known an
occasion like this,'' said Mitsubishi chief Andrew Cowan. ``I feel
very sorry for Carlos and the Toyota team _ they must be
devastated.''
	   Sainz was the third major star to crash out of the rally.
Makinen went out Sunday, and former world champion Colin McRae went
out with mechanical problems Monday while leading the race.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in front of the German
Embassy Tuesday, killing three people including two policemen,
witnesses said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat also
insisting on anonymity.
	   Among those killed was a police major who was visiting the
policemen in charge of the embassy's security. A lieutenant posted
in the diplomatic neighborhood also was killed, security officials
said.
	   The third victim was a Yemeni boy who was in a car passing by,
said the officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, and many others
suffered minor wounds. Two of them were discharged from hospital
later in the day, the security officials said.
	   The explosion set a nearby car on fire but firefighters put out
the blaze, the witnesses said.
	   The Mazda car carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy
in the residential Hadda area, where most embassies are located.
	   The German embassy is next to the house of prominent political
figure, Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, who security officials suspect
may have been the target of the attack.
	   The site was cordoned off by police, who refused to allow anyone
to enter or leave the area. No other details were available.
	   Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, is largely inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to
use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent
with the government.

discussed the proposed new structure for UEFA's club competitions
Tuesday but failed to agree on the nitty-gritty of when and how to
proceed.
	   It will now be up to UEFA's Executive Committee to pronounce on
whether to start the planned new Champions League and merged UEFA
Cup next year or in the year 2000, said UEFA General Secretary
Gerhard Aigner.
	   If the executive committee decides in December on a 2000 start
rather than 1999, ``I think the clubs would have to live with it,''
Aigner told reporters at the end of a special UEFA meeting.
	   Last month, representatives of major clubs agreed not to join a
breakaway Super League after the European governing body proposed
changing its Champions League, offering teams more money.
	   UEFA promised to expand next season's Champions League from 24
teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four teams in the
first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners
Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   Top clubs want the new competitions to begin next season to
maximize their potential earnings.
	   ``There were some reservations about an early start,'' at
Tuesday's meeting, Aigner said. UEFA stressed that both revamped
competitions would have to start the same year.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the new-look Champions League in an
already tight season could prove a problem for some of Europe's
larger leagues.
	   UEFA presented to associations two alternatives for the new UEFA
Cup, one of which would see eight teams who didn't qualify from
their Champions League group joining the competition in its third
round.
	   ``The feedback that we get is overwhelmingly positive for that
move,'' Aigner said.
	   Richer associations favored a group stage in the UEFA Cup, but
smaller associations backed a straight knockout format, he added.
	   In other business, UEFA's member associations agreed on a
memorandum backing UEFA regulations to prevent two or more clubs
owned by the same company from taking part in the same European
club competition.
	   In July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport provisionally
suspended the regulation, ruling that UEFA hadn't given clubs
enough time to adjust when it was introduced in May.
	   The ruling came in response to an arbitration request from Greek
club AEK Athens and Czech club Slavia Prague, both controlled by
British company ENIC.
	   The associations ``reaffirm our unqualified support for the UEFA
rule, and the sporting principles which underlie it,'' the
statement said.
	   The federation heads also agreed to lobby the European Union for
an antitrust exemption to allow UEFA to centrally market television
rights.
	   ``Unless a means to redistribute income is recognized, there is
a real danger that the existing disparities between the rich and
poor will become a yawning gulf,'' they said in a memorandum.
	   ``The marketing of competition matches by individual clubs will
inevitably disrupt the league structure, as investors would focus
only on the best teams,'' they added.

Mandela lawyers appeal rugby decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS in 2nd graf judgement sought from Constitutional Court;
UPDATES in 7th to 10th grafs with choice of two courts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for President Nelson
Mandela on Tuesday appealed a court ruling that quashed a
government investigation of racism and mismanagement in rugby.
	   Mandela is seeking a judgement from the Constitutional Court,
South Africa's highest legal body.
	   The ongoing battle about the sport, once heralded as a way of
uniting South Africa's races, has caused divisions in the country.
	   The South African Rugby Union had gone to court to block the
government's investigation, dragging the president to the witness
stand.
	   Many blacks felt that was a deliberate attempt by the
white-dominated sport to humiliate South Africa's first black
president. That impression deepened after Judge William de Villiers
ruled in favor of the rugby league and rebuked Mandela for
insolence during his testimony.
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the apartheid regime
that ended with 1994's first all-race election of Mandela as
president.
	   Lawyer Wim Trengove told a panel of Constitutional Court judges
that de Villier's judgment was invalid, and asked them to consider
the case because it involved constitutional matters.
	   But lawyer Mike Maritz, who represented SARFU and its former
head, Louis Luyt, argued that the case should be heard by the
Appeal Court in Bloemfontein, the next highest court.
	   The Constitutional Court on Tuesday delayed judgement about
accepting the case until a later date.
	   Luyt resigned from SARFU under the pressure of outcry over his
decision to take Mandela to court.
	   Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers who dominated apartheid governments and still maintain a
stranglehold on most professional teams.
	   Blacks grew to hate the sport during the apartheid era,
associating it with the white minority. But Mandela tried to use
rugby to promote racial reconciliation after he took power and
urged blacks to support the victorious national team in the 1995
World Cup.

OPEC ministers confer on lifting low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi oil official asking OPEC for action,
CLARIFIES low is London oil price in lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure grew on OPEC to act to lift
sagging oil prices as prices headed to record lows in London.
	   Ministers from OPEC's 11 member states planned a year-end
meeting Wednesday.
	   In Iraq, an oil official pleaded with OPEC to take action,
saying low prices had stripped about dlrs 2 billion from the
maximum dlrs 5.2 billion it is allowed to export in its current
food-for-oil deal with the United Nations.
	   ``We have been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day
and exporting between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we
failed to meet our own financial ceiling,'' Faleh al-Khayat,
director-general of studies and planning in Iraq's Oil Ministry,
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We could have easily done the dlrs 5.2 billion or even more
had it not been for the drastic decline in oil prices,'' al-Khayat
said.
	   Iraq is an OPEC member but has stayed away from past meetings
because of the U.N restrictions that keep it from selling its oil
freely. It also was not sending a minister to the Vienna meeting.
	   In London, Brent crude oil January futures slipped again on the
International Petroleum Exchange to a low of dlrs 11.19 a barrel
Tuesday afternoon, before creeping up slightly to dlrs 11.33.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter has slumped
by about 30 percent.
	   OPEC's predicament is due an untimely decision to boost
production last winter, just as demand growth was dropping because
of Asia's financial crisis. The resulting oil glut hammered prices,
helping consumers but hurting oil-dependent economies back home.
	   Publicly, OPEC members have been tightlipped on solutions.
	   Arriving Tuesday afternoon, Venezuelan oil minister Dr. Erwin
Jose Arrieta said only that both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers
needed to seek out new markets.
	   ``It's a ... challenge,'' said Arrieta, whose country is widely
believed to be a key offender in overproduction, an issue expected
to figure high on the talks' agenda.
	   Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include
trying to tighten compliance with production cuts, introduced in
June to soak up the glut; extending the cuts; cutting further, and
calling an exceptional heads of state meeting, an idea proposed by
Algeria and supported by the United Arab Emirates.
	   Pushing hard for further cuts to the 2.6 million barrels a day
agreed in June is Kuwait, backed by Algeria.
	   OPEC now produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day,
including Iraq.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Excluding Iraq, where compliance is high, compliance overall is
about 93 percent, the International Energy Agency said, in a report
based on the latest October figures.
	   However, compliance, 12th graf

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Federica Faiella and Luciano Milo of
Italy were neck and neck in first place with Russians Natalia
Romaniuta and Danil Barantsev Tuesday, following the compulsory
dances at the world junior figure skating championships.
	   Faiella and Milo, who won the silver medal at the world's last
year, led the Russians after the Viennese waltz but dropped behind
the pair after the tango.
	   The result was encouraging for Romaniuta and Barantsev as they
finished a distant seventh a year ago at the championships in New
Brunswick, Canada.
	   Jamie Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, of the United
States, took third place at the early stages of this event, while
their compatriots, Melissa Gregory, 17, and James Shuford, 20,
placed eleventh.
	   Compulsory dances make up 20 percent of the overall score. The
original dances, counting for 30 percent of the total, will take
place on Thursday, to be followed by the free skate on Friday.
	   The men's short program, led by rising Russian star Ilia
Klimkin, is the other event scheduled later Tuesday.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Masked robbers burst into a posh Paris department
store Tuesday and shot a passerby in the head when he tried to stop
them, leaving the man in critical condition, police officials said.
	   Three others were seriously injured, and at least five others
were being treated for shock, the officials said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The thieves were chased by a crowd of angry shoppers, but
nevertheless escaped with 240,000 francs (dlrs 42,100) from the
money-changing office at the Printemps store on Paris' Right Bank.
	   They escaped through the back entrance of the elegant store, one
of the best known in Paris, which was packed with afternoon
Christmas shoppers.
	   The passerby, a man whose identity was not given, was
hospitalized and in critical condition at the Pitie Salpetriere
hospital, police and emergency workers said.
	   Police had originally said the man in critical condition was a
guard, but interviews with witnesses later showed it was a
passerby.
	   The injured included customers, employees and passers-by.
	   One of the victims was hurt in the leg by flying glass. The
robbers hit two others on the head with the butts of their guns.
Five or six others were being treated for shock.
	   A bullet shell could be seen lying on the curb, circled by a
white line of chalk. Nearby, there was a pool of blood on the
pavement.
	   Store officials refused to give immediate comment, and a
saleswoman at the Lancome cosmetics counter said only, ``We've been
ordered not to talk.''
	   Dale Graham, an American tourist from Bethesda, Maryland, was
shopping with her two children shortly after the attack.
	   When one of her sons took out a toy gun they had bought at
another store, security guards came running up and told the mother:
``Do you know there was a holdup here earlier? Do not take the gun
out of the bag,'' Mrs. Graham said.
	   Mary Ann Ignatius, a visitor from Washington, D.C., said her
hosts had called to say ``Don't go out, there's been a shootout.''
	   ``I went out anyway, but kept my eyes open,'' Mrs. Ignatius
said.
	   Fifty firemen and 15 fire trucks rushed to the scene, as did
Paris police chief Philippe Massoni.
	   Two security guards were standing at the money-changing office
after the attack.

McEnroe says he's better than doubles player; rips Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe claims he's better than any current
doubles player in the world _ could beat most in singles _ and says
he ``almost fell over laughing'' at the field in last week's World
Doubles Championship.
	   The outspoken McEnroe, in an interview Tuesday in London's Daily
Mail, also ripped American Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson and
world No. 1 Pete Sampras.
	   McEnroe, 39, also said he was fit enough to hold his own on the
ATP Tour.
	   ``I am still better than any of the doubles players who have
played for America in any of the matches since I retired,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``I have no doubt in my mind I am better than any
of the doubles players in the world.''
	   ``I watch these guy on the main professional tour and I'm not
too impressed,'' he added of the singles players. ``On a given day
I could lose to hundreds, but there's also a given day where I
could beat most of them. They'd be sorry guys.''
	   ``When I looked at the people in the World Doubles Championship
last week, I almost fell over laughing.''
	   McEnroe also said he deserved to be involved in the American
Davis Cup team. He said he'd still like to captain the team _ and
even play again _ and suggested Stan Smith as another choice for
captain.
	   He was also again critical of Davis Cup captain Gullikson and
the semifinal loss of the under-strength Americans to Italy earlier
this year.
	   ``After the debacle against Italy in the semifinals recently, I
am amazed that Tom Gullikson was named captain again for next
year,'' he said. ``I have no idea why.''
	   McEnroe said he had lost some interest in captaining the United
States but ``never say never,'' he added.
	   ``But if they didn't have the guts to pick me, why not go for
Stan Smith? He was a great Davis Cup player and he has wanted the
job for 15 years.''
	   McEnroe hit out again at Sampras, who has repeatedly said the
Davis Cup is not his priority.
	   ``Pete has always said the Grand Slams are all that matter to
him, but now he seems to have made an abrupt 360-degree turn and
realized what No. 1 is all about.
	   ``I don't what to sound cynical, but I hope he realizes now how
nice it would be to end up No. 1 again on the computer. It is a
great achievement and certainly he is undermining the whole tour by
claiming that all that matters to him are the majors. He has been
doing this for years.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A coalition of Christian groups accused
police and politicians Tuesday of complicity in some of the rising
number of attacks on nuns, priests and Christian schools by Hindu
nationalists.
	   The Roman Catholic archbishop of New Delhi said Christian
education institutions across the country would shut down in
protest Dec. 4 and Christians would march on Parliament to
highlight what he called rising intolerance against minorities.
	   ``The severity of violence, the geographic spread and the
complicity of police in not recognizing the crimes ... all go
against our Indian spirit of tolerance for all religions,'' the
Most Rev. Alan de Lastic said at a news conference.
	   Last week, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee asked the
Interior Ministry to investigate all such incidents.
	   ``Acts of violence against the minority community .... must be
dealt with sternly. There is no place for religious bigotry and
communal violence in a democracy like ours,'' he said in a note to
the ministry.
	   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights compiled a list of
80 assaults in the last two years against Christian missionaries or
institutions.
	   B.P.Singh, the top official of the Interior Ministry, said all
cases that could affect religious freedom are investigated. Many of
the incidents were purely criminal in nature and did not have
anything to do with religion, he said in a meeting with foreign
correspondents to dispel fears that Christians were in danger in
India.

AS Roma 1, FC Zurich 0 in third-round first-leg of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Francesco Totti converted a penalty kick in
second-half injury time to give Italian league great AS Roma an
undeserved 1-0 victory against FC Zurich in their third-round
first-leg game of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Zurich players bitterly protested the referee decision to grant
the home team a penalty when Totti himself was pushed by defender
Franco Di Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to reach a long
cross in the 91st minute.
	   Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 15 games at
Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite fans who occasionally
booed the unimpressive play of the home team before the late game
winner.
	   In fact it was underdog Zurich that produced the best scoring
chances at the Olympic stadium.
	   Quick forward Frederic Chassot kicked the ball past the bar,
from a few meters (yards) in the 33rd minute, after rushing alone
into Roma's penalty area.
	   Five minutes before Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti had made a
decisive save on a powerful drive by South African forward Thurston
Bartlett.
	   Chassot had another scoring chance in the 60th but his shot was
stopped by Chimenti, a substitute of Roma's No.1 Austrian goalie
Michael Konsel who's recovering from surgery.
	   Roma, often overwhelmed at midfield, wasted a scoring chance
with Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio in the 42nd while Totti hit the
post with a diagonal shot in the 15th.
	   Totti had earned and converted a controversial penalty kick also
in Sunday's league game against Bari, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   Swiss officials were furious with British referee Young who
ignored a dubious intervention by Damiano Tommasi on Brazilian
forward Lima inside Roma's penalty area in the 50th.
	   Roma, second to Fiorentina in the Italian league standings, will
travel to Zurich for the second leg on Dec. 8.

Memorial service held for novelist Catherine Cookson and husband
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Hundreds of people packed a memorial
service Tuesday to pay tribute to Dame Catherine Cookson, whose
novels about working-class hardships in 19th-century England made
her one of Britain's most popular writers.
	   Mrs. Cookson died in June at the age of 91, leaving behind more
than 100 books that combined sold more than 100 million copies in
18 languages.
	   The service also was to commemorate her husband, Tom, who died
three weeks later, after nursing her through many years of ill
health.
	   ``Dame Catherine's work has touched the lives of millions and
her unassuming generosity has brought help and healing to many,''
the Right Rev. Ambrose Griffiths said at the service at St. Mary's
Roman Catholic Cathedral.
	   Griffith called Tom Cookson a man of ``great gentleness and
selfless devotion.''
	   The couple's physician, Dr. David Harle, made a short but
emotional speech relating his 20-year friendship with the pair.
	   ``You are in death just as you were in life together, now and
forever,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airport reopening; Lufthansa officials seeing
Ocalan related provocation against Alitalia

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police briefly sealed off part of Sofia
airport on Tuesday after an anonymous person called in a hoax bomb
threat.
	   Normal operations were resumed about 90 minutes later after
police gave an all clear.
	   Lufthansa officials suggested that the threat might have been
directed at an Alitalia flight and could have been related to
Abdulah Ocalan, the outlawed leader of separatist Kurds in Turkey,
whom Ankara wants extradited from Italy.

 &UR; Chinese president visits researchers in central Siberia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of visit, comments by Jiang,
Russian scientist. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited
a major scientific and military industrial center in Siberia on
Tuesday and discussed possible cooperation with Russia's ailing
research sector.
	   In Novosibirsk, about 2800 kilometers (1,750 miles) east of
Moscow, Jiang visited research centers, including the renowned
Nuclear Physics Institute.
	   ``I have long heard that it is better to visit the great city of
Novosibirsk just one time than to hear about it 100 times,'' Jiang
said. ``You have a very powerful scientific capability and your
potential for scientific creation is great.''
	   But Russia's impoverished researchers are often unable to earn
money for the work they produce, institute director Gennady
Kulipanov said. The sides discussed the possibility of selling
Russia's ``know-how'' to China, Kulipanov said.
	   Jiang met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a hospital
reception room in Moscow on Monday. The two leaders approved a
statement on expanding relations between the former Cold War rivals
and defining the western part of their 4,300 kilometer (2,700-mile)
border. Yeltsin was hospitalized Sunday with a high temperature and
pneumonia.
	   The document noted that a ``strategic partnership'' declared
last year by the two countries _ the world's largest and the
world's most populous _ ``is not an alliance and is not aimed
against third countries.''
	   The statement also called for the creation of a multi-polar
world, Russia's favorite euphemism for counterbalancing what it
perceives as U.S. dominance in global affairs. China has voiced
similar concerns.
	   Starting in the 1950s, decades of enmity marred relations
between the Chinese and the former Soviet Communist leaders.
Relations between Russia and China began to improve shortly before
the Soviet collapse.
	   In recent years, China has evolved into a major export market
for Russia's cash-strapped defense industries, purchasing fighter
jets, missiles, submarines and other hardware.

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched
breathlessly as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched down at
Gaza International Airport Tuesday and crew members waved the
national green, red, black and white flag from the pilot's window.
	   And then, with many holding back tears of joy, the emotional
crowd began a spontaneous celebration of dance and song set to last
for days. The opening of their first airport was a concrete sign
for Palestinians that their lives were becoming freer and their
homeland was moving one step closer to statehood.
	   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you
are a citizen in a country,'' said Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man
from Gaza City.
	   Gaza International, built with dlrs 75 million in contributions
mainly from Japan, is petite for an international airport. Sprawled
over 1,125-acres, it has one runway long enough to accommodate all
but the biggest jumbo jets. The one passenger terminal for arrivals
and departures resembles an Arabian desert palace with arches and
multicolored Moroccan tiles and includes a VIP lounge.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls
for the control tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable
control panel installed in a van.
	   Israel, which feared a solely-Palestinian run airport would mean
enemies could land at its door-step or smuggle weapons to the
Palestinians, held up the opening for two years over security.
	   Under the airport agreement, Israel will continue to control the
airspace and could shut down the airport at any time. With a
full-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel will
pre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists. No Israeli
will sit in the control tower or operate any area of the airport.
	   Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an
Egypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,
including Egyptian Cabinet ministers in small white bags.
	   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence
will be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses
from the planes to a security check area in the airport where they
will go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-Ray
luggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security
checks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other
crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage
will be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an
additional check while Palestinian agents observe.
	   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to
Jordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza
International. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with
a fleet of three planes including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a
Saudi prince.
	   The airport will also be the permanent home of Yasser Arafat's
presidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung
from the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat
was on hand to personally greet seven plane-loads of dignitaries.
	   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.
	   Next month, U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to land
there too _ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least
in Palestinian eyes
	   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the
Palestinian people. Despite the monitoring role, the airport marks
a significant loosening of the Jewish state's security grip over
the Palestinians. Years of requests for Israeli permission, often
denied, to travel anywhere by land or air are slowly ending. For
people in the cramped Gaza Strip which is surrounded by barbed-wire
on three sides and the sea on a fourth, the airport will provide
the only unfettered way out.
	   Palestinians in the West Bank still need Israeli permission to
travel across its territory to Gaza but a safe passage route in the
works will make the land journey easier.
	   For Arafat, Tuesday was a chance to share the fruits of peace
with his people. As the first plane touched down and the pilot and
co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads, a chant
of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great, rose from the crowd of
thousands of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the
airfield to join the celebrations.
	   ``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
later told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly
decorated with deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics.

Refugee chief urges release of kidnapped French worker

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. secretary-general in 7th, 8th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top refugee official Tuesday
urged kidnappers to release an aid worker, held for 300 days in
southern Russia, ``in the name of common human decency.''
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the U.N. refugee agency's
office in North Ossetia, near breakaway Chechnya, was seized by
three masked gunmen in his apartment in the region's capital of
Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   ``Our intense efforts to obtain Vincent's release have yielded
no results so far,'' said Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   ``We have left no stone unturned and we will continue our
efforts for as long as it takes to get him free.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   ``I urge Vincent's captors, whoever they are, to release him in
the name of common human decency,'' Ogata said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent letters to Cochetel's
wife and parents to mark his 300 days in captivity, urging them to
have hope and courage.
	   Annan ``feels sorrow and a deep sense of frustration'' and
pledged his continued efforts and contacts with Russian officials
to try to bring Cochetel home, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in
New York.
	   UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin said there had been a number of
indications that he is still alive.

Norway's minority government struggles to cling to power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with Conservatives also agreeing to reopen budget
talks in new penultimate graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's minority government made a bid to
cling to power Tuesday, offering concessions on next year's
national budget to the political right in exchange for support in
parliament.
	   The government is under intense pressure because it is heading
into a debate on the budget Wednesday and Thursday without a
majority in parliament for its proposals. However, none of the
other parties have a majority for their alternative budgets.
	   The three-party centrist government, led by Christian Democrat
Kjell Magne Bondevik, has just 42 seats in the 165-seat parliament
and must have support from both the Conservatives, with 23 seats,
and the Party of Progress, with 25 seats, to pass the budget.
	   The coalition government has tried negotiations with those
parties and with Labor _ with 65 seats the largest party in
parliament _ on the budget, but the talks have failed.
	   Traditionally, a Norwegian government would resign if the
parliament rejected its budget, but Bondevik has said his
government would not step down if the budget failed.
	   Although a failed budget would leave Norway seriously weakened,
the Conservatives and the Progressives would be hesitant to back a
vote of no-confidence because that would open the way for Labor to
return to power.
	   Labor Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland stepped down last year
after national elections in which his party notched a disappointing
performance even though it was the largest vote-getter.
	   Jagland said this weekend that he was ready to form a new
government, a prospect that apparently drove Bondevik's coalition
to try again on seeking compromise with the right.
	   On Tuesday, Bondevik approached the Conservatives and the Party
of Progress with an offer to meet their demand for no tax hikes in
1999.
	   ``We have received an outline that absolutely forms the basis
for further negotiations,'' said Jan Petersen, chairman of the
Conservatives, after reviewing the new proposal with his party's
leadership. ``I hope and believe it will be possible to reach an
agreement.''
	   Carl I. Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress, also said the
proposal was a basis for reopening negotiations with the government
with a view to reaching a budget compromise.

U.N. seeks to better sanitation, food under next oil deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations will try to repair a
water system sometimes polluted by sewage and make more food
available to Iraqis under the renewal of a U.N. program that
permits Iraq to sell some oil, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   The current phase of the program expires Wednesday. Over the
last six months, it allowed Iraq to export up to dlrs 5.2 billion
in oil to buy food and medicine for Iraqis devastated by eight
years of U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The program, though, has run into problems since its inception
in 1996. Low oil prices and the dilapidated state of Iraq's oil
industry have prevented it from exporting the amount allowed under
the deal _ it earned just dlrs 3.2 billion the last six months.
	   The Iraqi government, meanwhile, is unhappy with the deal that
it believes merely serves to keep the crippling sanctions in place.
It has asked that the current period be extended by two months, not
another six as the Security Council is proposing.
	   Hans von Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq,
said U.N. aid workers hoped Iraq would agree to the deal. In either
case, he said, the United Nations planned to continue its relief
work.
	   ``Whether it's two months or six months, we want to make sure
the humanitarian supplies continue to come in unimpeded in the
amounts that are allowed,'' he said in an interview.
	   He said he doubted that a delay in Iraq's acceptance of the deal
would interfere with oil exports or food deliveries.
	   Von Sponeck, who took over earlier this month, said priorities
under the next phase would be to increase the amount of food
available to Iraqis _ to 2,300 calories a day from 2,030.
	   Another challenge will be to provide more water and sanitation
equipment and repair facilities in disrepair, he said.
	   Water-borne diseases like cholera have mounted, and safe
drinking water has become rarer in Iraq, once one of the Arab
world's most prosperous countries. As many as one out of three
Iraqi children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. figures.
	   Von Sponeck complained that the lingering crisis over U.N.
inspections has made his task more difficult, mainly by sapping
morale and requiring more time for security issues. About 150 aid
workers were evacuated during the last crisis before Iraq relented
and allowed inspectors to resume their work on Nov. 14.
	   The Security Council will not lift sanctions until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq no longer has chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and the weapons to build them.

Saddam replaces 18 ambassadors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 2nd graf Hamdoon's deputy prefers to use Hasan as
second name sted family name al-Mausawi; ADDS Hamdoon quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered the
replacement of 18 Iraqi ambassadors, including the country's envoy
to the United Nations, government officials said Tuesday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, the ambassador to the U.N., will be replaced by
his deputy, Saeed Hasan, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   At the United Nations, Hamdoon said he will return to Baghdad at
the end of the year to take an undetermined post at the foreign
ministry.
	   Hamdoon said Hasan has been in New York for four years, dealing
with all aspects of U.N. economic sanctions. ``I think he is
probably the best to replace me at this very crucial time,'' he
said.
	   Saddam's half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who was Iraq's U.N.
representative in Geneva, has already been replaced by Mohammed
al-Douri, a legal adviser in the foreign ministry, the officials
said.
	   Iraq signaled it was going to replace its ambassadors earlier
this year and the new envoys will take office by the end of the
year, the officials said.
	   The government is said to hope that the new envoys will be able
to drum up more support for its campaign to lift the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the embargo, which allows
only limited sales of oil, will not be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In two other appointments, Sultan al-Shawi will become Iraq's
representative at the Arab League in Cairo and Naji al-Hadithi, who
has long dealt with foreign media in the Culture and Information
Ministry, will go to Vienna as ambassador to Austria and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The IAEA is charged with overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's
nuclear program.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Calling a 400 million lire (dlrs 235,000)
prize ridiculous, Italian Davis Cup players on Tuesday rejected a
proposed money bonus for a victory in the Cup final against Sweden.
	   Andrea Gaudenzi, Diego Nargiso and Davide Sanguinetti, while
criticizing the Italian Federation offer, made public their
unchanged fidelity to Italian colors and their utmost engagement in
the Dec. 4-6 Davis Cup final at Assago Forum, at Milan's outskirts.
	   Italy's No.1 player Gaudenzi, acting as a spokesman for the
other team members, told the Italian news agency ANSA ``we have
been treated badly (by the Federation) ... it's a disappointing,
ridiculous offer.''
	   ``We are going to play Sweden anyway and engage hard,'' said
Gaudenzi, who has been nursing a sore shoulder.
	   Federation president Francesco Ricci Bitti said he did not want
to comment the players stand, to avoid fueling controversy prior to
the final.
	   ``We acknowledge that players are unhappy with the extent of the
money bonus,'' Ricci Bitti said.
	   Italian players, currently training in Milan for the match with
Sweden, upset the United States in the semifinals.
	   The final will be played on clay, indoor.

Council renews oil-for-food program for another 6 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Tuesday to
allow Iraq to sell another dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over six months
to buy badly needed humanitarian aid for Iraqis suffering under
U.N. sanctions.
	   In a 15-0 vote, the council renewed the U.N. ``oil-for-food''
program and also agreed to let Iraq to buy another dlrs 300 million
in spare parts to repair its dilapidated oil facilities.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War. The council will
only lift the sanctions after U.N. arms experts report that Baghdad
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council agreed to start the oil-for-food program in 1996 to
allow imports of basic necessities such as food and medicine for
Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Iraq had hoped that the current phase of the program would be
the last, and it had tried to persuade the council to merely extend
the current phase for two months rather than renew it for six.
	   Iraqi officials have long complained that the unique U.N.
program has merely served to keep sanctions in place.
	   Iraq hasn't signed any new contracts with foreign firms for
deliveries of crude beyond Wednesday, Oil Ministry officials said
in Baghdad on Monday. They said exports could be disrupted for a
few days.
	   Council members nearly doubled the amount Iraq could sell to
dlrs 5.2 billion in February, But Iraq has not been able to pump
enough crude to meet that target, due to low oil prices and the
weak condition of Iraq's industry. These factors have limited its
exports to about dlrs 3.2 billion worth of oil in the current
phase, which ends Wednesday.
	   To help Iraq pump more oil, the council agreed in June to let
Iraq buy dlrs 300 million in spare parts for its industry. The
first materials from those purchases _ dlrs 1.75 million worth of
material used to treat crude oil and remove impurities _ are
expected to arrive in Iraq this week, U.N. officials said Monday.

SAfrican animal welfare group files second elephant cruelty
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A national animal welfare
group has filed cruelty charges against an elephant handler who
stabbed a young animal with a pitch fork, the group said Tuesday.
	   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has asked police to investigate the incident that took place last
week and was observed by one of its investigators.
	   ``The elephant did not want to move and the (trainer) lost his
temper and stabbed him in the back of the leg,'' said Rick Allan,
the group's chief wildlife investigator, at a Johannesburg press
conference.
	   In a case that has roused emotions among international wildlife
organizations, the elephant is one of 30 young elephants taken from
Botswana in August and now held at an animal export farm near
Pretoria.
	   Last month the NSPCA filed cruelty charges against the owner of
African Game Services, Riccardo Ghiazza.
	   The cruelty cases, which are to be prosecuted as criminal
matters, run parallel to a protective custody case the NSPCA is
waging in a courtroom in the town of Brits, near Pretoria.
	   Final arguments in the custody case are to be held on Thursday,
with a decision expected on Friday or Monday, NSPCA officials said.
The group is asking the court to grant it temporary custody of the
elephants until the cruelty case is heard.
	   The charges on last week's stabbing were filed against a mahout
trainer, so called after an Indonesian training method that
involves hobbling the elephants with chains, beating them with
sharp poles and depriving them of food and water.
	   The trainer's name and nationality were not known, Allan said.
	   The method has gained guarded approval from the South African
government and some conservation groups that have helped set up a
special advisory board to monitor and improve on Ghiazza's training
methods.
	   Ghiazza planned to export the elephants to zoos in Basel,
Switzerland; to German zoos in Erfurt and Dresden; and to a safari
park in China.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has ordered the
replacement of 18 Iraqi ambassadors, including the country's envoy
to the United Nations, government officials said Tuesday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, the ambassador to the United Nations, will be
replaced by his deputy, Saeed Hasan, the officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   At the United Nations, Hamdoon said he will return to Baghdad at
the end of the year to take an undetermined post at the foreign
ministry.
	   Hamdoon said Hasan has been in New York for four years, dealing
with all aspects of U.N. economic sanctions. ``I think he is
probably the best to replace me at this very crucial time,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in front of the German
Embassy Tuesday, killing a Yemeni boy and two policemen, witnesses
and officials said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy, and damaged the embassy's wall, said the witnesses,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The explosion also set a
nearby car afire.
	   No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat who
also insisted on anonymity.
	   The dead included a police major and a police lieutenant,
security officials said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
The third victim was a Yemeni boy who had been in a passing car,
according to the officials.
	   Six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, and many others
suffered minor wounds.
	   The Mazda carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy in
the residential Hadda area, where most embassies are located.
	   The German Embassy is next to the house of a prominent political
figure, Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh. Security officials said they
suspected the sheik may have been the target of the attack.
	   Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, is largely inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to
use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent
with the government.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Masked robbers burst into a posh Paris department
store Tuesday and shot a passerby in the head when he tried to stop
them, gravely wounding him, police said.
	   A store statement said the man's life was not in danger. Three
others were injured, and at least five others were treated for
shock, the store and police said.
	   The thieves were chased by a crowd of angry shoppers, but
nevertheless escaped with 240,000 francs (dlrs 42,100) from the
money-changing office at the Printemps store, near the grand Opera
house on Paris' Right Bank.
	   They escaped through the back entrance of the elegant store, one
of the best known in Paris, which was packed with afternoon
shoppers and decorated with Christmas wreaths and garlands.
	   The passerby, whose identity was not given, was taken in
critical condition to the Pitie Salpetriere hospital, police and
emergency workers said. However, a statement by store president
Bertrand de Talhouet said the man's life ``happily is not in
danger.''
	   Police had originally said the man was a guard, but changed
their account after interviewing witnesses.
	   In his statement, the store president said one of the three
others injured was a security guard.
	   One of the victims was hurt in the leg by flying glass. The
robbers hit two others on the head with the butts of their guns.
Five or six others were treated for shock.
	   Just after the attack, a bullet shell could be seen lying on the
curb, circled by a white line of chalk. Nearby, there was a pool of
blood on the pavement, under trees that had been hung with orange
and gold stars for Christmas.
	   A saleswoman at the Lancome cosmetics counter would say only,
``We've been ordered not to talk.''
	   Dale Graham, an American tourist from Bethesda, Maryland, was
shopping with her two children shortly after the attack.
	   When one of her sons took out a toy gun they had bought at
another store, security guards came running up and told the mother:
``Do you know there was a holdup here earlier? Do not take the gun
out of the bag,'' Mrs. Graham said.
	   Mary Ann Ignatius, a visitor from Washington, D.C., said her
hosts had called to say ``Don't go out, there's been a shootout.''
	   ``I went out anyway, but kept my eyes open,'' Mrs. Ignatius
said.
	   Fifty firemen and 15 fire trucks rushed to the scene, as did
Paris police chief Philippe Massoni.
	   At the money-changing office, near the sunglasses and hosiery
departments, security officers were standing guard hours after the
attack.

Discarded heart-attack treatment saves lives, study finds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ A simple and inexpensive treatment for heart
attacks that had been abandoned because of doubts about its
effectiveness could actually save thousands of lives each year,
according to a study released Tuesday.
	   Patients treated with a mixture of sugar, insulin and potassium
within 24 hours of experiencing heart attack symptoms had an
overall death rate about half that of study participants who
weren't given that combination, according to researchers in six
Latin American countries.
	   ``The decrease in the death rate is dramatic _ the largest
reduction of just about any intervention that's been tried,'' said
Dr. Carl S. Apstein, professor of medicine at Boston University's
School of Medicine. His editorial commenting on the study appeared
alongside the findings in Tuesday's edition of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
	   He said the treatment has the potential to prevent about 75,000
heart attack deaths per year in the United States. An estimated 1.1
million Americans have heart attacks each year and about a third of
them die.
	   The study involved 407 heart attack patients, 268 of whom were
given GIK _ for glucose, insulin and potassium, whose chemical
symbol is K. Only 6.7 percent of those given GIK died, compared
with 11.5 percent of patients who did not.
	   Among patients who either received a clot-busting drug or
underwent angioplasty to open clogged arteries, GIK reduced the
death rate from 15.2 percent to 5.2 percent.
	   The treatment nourishes heart muscles deprived of oxygen by a
heart attack, said the study's lead author, Dr. Rafael Diaz,
co-director of the cardiovascular medicine division of the
Institutio Cardiovascular de Rosario in Argentina.
	   He acknowledged that the sample size was small but added that
``the direction of the benefit is consistently positive.''
	   The GIK treatment was first reported in 1962. Over the next
decade, however, clinical studies reached conflicting conclusions
about its effectiveness.
	   Last year, British researchers using only those earlier studies
that met the criteria of being well-designed concluded that giving
GIK could reduce the death rate in heart attack patients by up to
48 percent.

Chechen court revokes sentence against Raduyev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Chechen court has revoked a prison sentence
against a renegade commander, citing his poor health and injuries
received in Chechnya's independence war against Moscow, news
reports said Tuesday.
	   But Salman Raduyev, who had been tried in absentia and remains
at large, declared he has no health problems and regards the court
decision as an insult, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Raduyev suffered major injuries during the 1994-96 war, and
Russia even reported him dead of head wounds in March 1996. But he
resurfaced several months later, saying he lost an eye and had to
undergo plastic surgery.
	   Chechnya's Supreme Court sentenced Raduyev to four years in
prison earlier this month for attempting a coup against Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov.
	   The ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported Tuesday the
court had revoked the sentence. The reports did not say whether the
conviction still held.
	   Raduyev has recently been rallying the country's opposition
around a demand for Maskhadov's resignation.
	   Raduyev made yet another iconoclastic proposal on Tuesday,
suggesting that Chechnya's oil revenues be divided among the
republic's residents to resolve the region's economic problems.
	   ``Even if the majority of the population does not support our
ideas, we won't leave our share of oil to the government,'' Raduyev
was quoted as saying by Interfax.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's new President Emile Lahoud took
the oath of office Tuesday, promising to clean up a graft-riddled
administration.
	   The people ``want an administration in which they get service by
paying taxes and not by paying bribes and taxes,'' Lahoud said.
	   In an inauguration speech repeatedly interrupted by applause,
the former army commander told the National Assembly that taxpayers
want a transparent civil service where nobody is above the law.
	   ``It is the people's right, before anything else, that they see
how the decent are rewarded and how a thief's hand is chopped off,
whoever that may be,'' he said.
	   ``I will be under the law,'' he added.
	   Lahoud's election as the 11th president since independence from
France 55 years ago marks the first smooth transition of power in
Lebanon, which ended a 15-year-civil war in 1990. Two previous
presidents took over after assassinations.
	   Lahoud, the 62-year-old, British-trained general, was elected by
Parliament on Oct. 25 amid hopes that he would rebuild the
administration as he had done the army: taking an organization
fractured by the 1975-90 civil war and welding it into a coherent
body free of sectarian tension.
	   During the nine-year tenure of retiring President Elias Hrawi,
government officials routinely took bribes, powerful politicians
gave lucrative contracts to cronies and family members, while other
politicians demanded kickbacks.
	   Lahoud said the people have the right to ask the government how
contracts are being awarded and how public funds are being
disbursed.
	   But he acknowledged the difficulties that lie ahead.
	   ``I do not claim to have a magic wand that fulfills the
(people's) hopes overnight, but I have the intention and the
will,'' he said.
	   One of Lahoud's first tasks of his six-year term will be to name
a prime minister. He is expected to ask the outgoing Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, whose Cabinet became a caretaker body with the end of
Hrawi's term, to form a new government. Hariri is the architect of
multibillion dollar program to rebuild Lebanon from the destruction
of the war.
	   On foreign policy, Lahoud is expected to change little. In his
speech, he pledged to continue close relations with Syria, without
whose approval he would not have been elected. Syria stations
30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power broker.
	   Lahoud said Lebanon would continue to ally itself with Syria in
any peace negotiations with Israel. The Beirut government has long
rejected Israel's attempts to negotiate a separate peace that would
involve Israeli troops withdrawing from the buffer zone they occupy
in southern Lebanon.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, respects the
religiously-defined divisions that dominate the politics of this
nation of 3.2 million: the president is a Maronite Christian, the
prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary speaker is a
Shiite Muslim. The assembly is divided equally between Muslims and
Christians.

Premier accepts resignation of transport minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on Tuesday
accepted the resignation of the transport minister who argued that
trade unions had too much to say on urgently-needed restructuring
of the strapped state railways.
	   Minister Eugeniusz Morawski resigned Monday after the government
put off last week a discussion on the reform of the monopoly
Polskie Koleje Panstwowe, pending outcome of negotiations with
trade unions to last until Nov. 30.
	   Morawski said in a statement Monday he could not accept the
Cabinet's bowing to the unions' demands concerning the reform and a
further delay of the plan to save the heavily-indebted, inefficient
railways.
	   The Transport Ministry proposed a plan to split the state
railway into two separate companies, one managing the track network
and the other managing the rolling stock. The move could allow a
more fair competition between the state and private rail transport
companies.
	   Polskie Koleje Panstwowe, an inefficient structure inherited
from the communist era, has been cutting train connections and
increasing ticket prices to prevent further losses.
	   Unions of train engineers have been staging strikes since the
early 1990s to demand higher pay and better work conditions.
	   In June, a four-day strike which idled half of Poland's
passenger trains and about 90 percent of freight traffic, cost the
railroad an estimated 50 million zlotys (dlrs 15 million).
	   The Polish rail carries 1.1 million passengers and some 600,000
tons of goods daily.

AS Roma 1, FC Zurich 0 in third-round first-leg of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zeman, Ponte quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Francesco Totti converted a penalty kick in
second-half injury time to give Italian league great AS Roma an
undeserved 1-0 victory against FC Zurich in their third-round
first-leg game of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Zurich players bitterly protested the referee decision to grant
the home team a penalty when Totti was pushed by defender Franco Di
Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to reach a long cross in
the 91st minute.
	   Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 15 games at
Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite fans who occasionally
booed the unimpressive play of the home team before the late game
winner.
	   ``We suffered such more than expected and needed some luck to
win the game,'' said Roma's Czech coach Zdenek Zeman.
	   In fact it was underdog Zurich to produce the best scoring
chances at the Olympic stadium.
	   Quick forward Frederic Chassot kicked the ball past the bar,
from a few meters in the 33rd minute, after rushing alone into
Roma's penalty area.
	   Five minutes before Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti had made a
decisive save on a powerful drive by South African forward Thurston
Bartlett.
	   Chassot had another scoring chance in the 60th but his shot was
stopped by Chimenti, a substitute of Roma's No.1 Austrian goalie
Michael Konsel who's recovering from surgery.
	   Roma, often overwhelmed at midfield, wasted a scoring chance
with Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio in the 42nd while Totti hit the
post with a diagonal shot in the 15th.
	   Totti had earned and converted a controversial penalty kick also
in Sunday's league game against Bari, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   Swiss officials were furious with British referee Young who
ignored a dubious intervention by Damiano Tommasi on Brazilian
forward Lima inside Roma's penalty area in the 50th.
	   ``We caused a lot of problems to Roma, and did not deserve
defeat. We were badly hurt by the referee's decisions,'' said
Zurich's coach Raimondo Ponte.
	   Roma, second to Fiorentina in the Italian league standings, will
travel to Zurich for the second leg on Dec. 8.

Makinen claims third straight world title as Sainz breaks down

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Tommi Makinen claimed a record third
straight world rally title when rival Carlos Sainz's Toyota engine
catch fire just 300 meters (yards) from the finish Tuesday of the
Network Q Rally, depriving the Spaniard of the world title.
	   Sainz, in fourth place at the time, needed only to cross the
line at the end of the final stage to claim the overall season
title, which would have been his third.
	   Sainz's fourth place would have given him three points, one more
in the final season standings than Makinen.
	   Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi won the rally with a 3
minute 46 second advantage over second-place Juha Kankkunen's Ford
with Bruno Thiry's Ford in third.
	   Makinen, who entered the rally with a two-point lead on Sainz,
slid out of the race on Sunday's first day when he skidded on a
patch of oil and hit a concrete pillar.
	   Sainz, one of the most popular drivers on the circuit, was left
in tears on the cold, wet roadside in southern Wales as co-driver
Luis Moya smashed his crash helmet to the ground in frustration.
	   It was a cruel finish.
	   ``The engine blew, it couldn't have been worse,'' Sainz said.
	   ``It seems incredible that something like this happened,'' he
added. ``We only needed a few hundred meters. You can't have worse
luck than that.''
	   ``It's impossible to put into words how I feel,'' he went on.
``We had backed off earlier in the day because of the damp and
foggy conditions and were doing all we needed for the championship.
It's so difficult to comprehend what has happened, especially so
close to the end of the rally.''
	   Makinen, who was in his hotel and waiting for a car to go to the
airport, was also stunned by the finish and offered sympathy to
Sainz.
	   ``My brother Duomo rang from the last stage to tell me what had
happened to Carlos,'' Makinen explained. ``I couldn't believe it _
I told him to stop joking. I thought nothing would happen to
Carlos, and I feel very sorry for him. He was very unlucky.''
	   Sainz was the third major star to crash out of the rally.
Makinen went out Sunday, and former world champion Colin McRae went
out with mechanical problems Monday while leading the race.
	   ``I've been in rallying for 30 years but I've never known an
occasion like this,'' said Mitsubishi chief Andrew Cowan. ``I feel
very sorry for Carlos and the Toyota team _ they must be
devastated.''

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Prince Charles on Tuesday traveled to the
island of Crete to visit a Minoan palace complex first unearthed by
British archeologists earlier this century.
	   Charles, on a three-day cultural visit to Greece, earlier laid a
wreath under sunny skies at the tomb of the unknown soldier in
central Athens. Bad weather had postponed the ceremony Monday.
	   His jet was escorted by Greek air force Mirage 2000 fighters
during its flight to the Mediterranean island.
	   During his visit to Crete, Charles toured the British School of
Archaeology facilities at Knossos, where the ruins were partially
rebuilt in the early 1900's by British archaeologist Sir Arthur
Evans.
	   While touring the 5,000-year-old palace complex, Charles was
offered an opporunity to sit on the ancient kingdom's throne.
	   ``I said to him `you are the only man here who can sit in the
throne room,' but he said `no','' said Alexandra Karetsou, director
of the Central Crete Archaeological Service.

	   LONDON (AP) _ An official called Black Rod summons commoners to
cluster behind a sea of ermine-collared scarlet robes to watch
Queen Elizabeth II, solemn-faced under the glittering Imperial
State Crown and surrounded by buckle-shoed pages and bewigged
officials.
	   This is modernization?
	   Well, it is if you consider that Silver Stick in Waiting, the
Crown Equerry, Maltravers Herald Extraordinary and a handful of
other officials with quaint titles were absent from the scaled-down
royal procession Tuesday when the queen opened a new session of
Parliament.
	   The monarch also delivered a starkly untraditional message,
announcing the government's plan to strip aristocrats of their
600-year-old right to vote in the House of Lords, Parliament's
unelected upper chamber.
	   The move is part of a legislative program for the coming year
that Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government described
as focusing ``upon the modernization of the country.''
	   Looking around, there were other bows toward criticism by many
Laborites that the pomp, flummery and general dressing up in
strange clothes that weaves through British ceremonial tradition is
outdated.
	   With Her Majesty's assent, for example, the Lord Chancellor _ a
top lawyer who is the country's chief judicial officer _ turned his
back and walked away after handing the government's speech to the
queen, instead of shuffling backward.
	   But much of the rest of the elaborate show was right on track.
	   The queen rode from Buckingham Palace with her husband, Prince
Philip, in a horse-drawn carriage escorted by the Household
Cavalry, a regiment of riders in scarlet and gold tunics astride
magnificent horses.
	   And if the Lord Chancellor thought it all right to turn his
back, the Earl Marshal, who is the senior duke of England, and the
Lord Chamberlain did not. They kept on inching backward ahead of
the queen as she entered the chamber.
	   The legislative program the queen read out _ the second since
Labor swept the long-ruling Conservative Party from office 19
months ago _ included a shakeup of welfare benefits designed to
make things tougher for the work-shy, a reform of legal funding and
greater protection for rape victims.
	   But a single item promises to provoke the most debate.
	   ``A bill will be introduced to remove the right of hereditary
peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords,'' the queen intoned.
``It will be the first stage of a process of reform to make the
House of Lords more democratic and representative.''
	   The 759 dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons whose
inherited titles qualify them to sit in the Lords _ although many
never do _ give the Conservative Party a 3-1 majority there. They
sit alongside some 500 lifetime peers, mostly retired politicians.
	   Critics charge that Blair is wrong to remove the often
independent-minded blue-bloods before setting up a new arrangement.
A commission is due to report within two years on a new-look Lords.
	   ``He wants to create a House of Cronies, beholden to him
alone,'' Conservative Party leader William Hague jeered at Blair in
the Commons later Tuesday _ after the queen had gone home, leaving
the elected chamber to its rambunctious debate.
	   Some bluebloods prepared for a final filibuster in the chamber,
which can delay legislation for up to a year.
	   ``It is exceedingly easy to bung up the system,'' said the Earl
of Onslow, whose family motto is ``Quick without Impetuosity.''
	   ``I am happy to go to this sort of extent and length to make
sure that what comes after me is better and can act as a check,''
he said.

	   LONDON (AP) - Share prices fell Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed down 49.3 points, or 0.84 percent, at 5,799.1.
	   Volume was 971.7 million shares compared with 775.4 million on
Monday.
	   The retreat broke a run of three straight sessions of
triple-digit gains.
	   ``We've felt for a while that the market's recent performance
doesn't have an enormous amount of depth,'' said Jeremy Batstone,
head of research at Natwest Stockbrokers.
	   He said the recent rally has been driven by market makers and
fund managers short of stock, eager to get funds into the market.
That has pushed stocks higher against a small but steady flow of
negative corporate news.
	   Wall Street's decline underpinned the drop in U.K. shares, with
the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 64.36 points at 9,309.91 when
trading ceased in London.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Masked robbers burst into a department store packed
with tourists and Christmas shoppers Tuesday and shot a passerby in
the head when he tried to stop them, gravely wounding him, police
said.
	   A store statement said the man's life was not in danger. Three
others were injured, and at least five others were treated for
shock, the store and police said.
	   The thieves were chased by a crowd of angry shoppers, but
nevertheless escaped with 240,000 francs (dlrs 42,100) from the
money-changing office at the Printemps store, near the grand Opera
house on Paris' Right Bank.
	   They escaped through the back entrance of the elegant store, one
of the best known in Paris, which was packed with afternoon
shoppers and decorated with Christmas wreaths and garlands.
	   ``I was walking by and saw one of the robbers jump on top of the
glass cabin where the money is. Then he got inside,'' said Nabine
Chil, 26, who sells T-shirts outside the store.
	   ``I'm stunned. This type of thing never happens in a store like
this in Paris,'' he said.
	   The man who was shot, whose identity was not given, was taken in
critical condition to the Pitie Salpetriere hospital, police and
emergency workers said. However, a statement by store president
Bertrand de Talhouet said the man's life ``happily is not in
danger.''
	   Police had originally said the man was a guard, but changed
their account after interviewing witnesses.
	   In his statement, the store president said one of the three
others injured was a security guard.
	   One of the victims was hurt in the leg by flying glass. The
robbers hit two others on the head with the butts of their guns.
Five or six others were treated for shock.
	   Just after the attack, a bullet shell could be seen lying on the
curb, circled by a white line of chalk. Nearby, there was a pool of
blood on the pavement, under trees that had been hung with orange
and gold stars for Christmas.
	   A saleswoman at the Lancome cosmetics counter would say only,
``We've been ordered not to talk.''
	   Dale Graham, an American tourist from Bethesda, Maryland, was
shopping with her two children shortly after the attack.
	   When one of her sons took out a toy gun they had bought at
another store, security guards came running up and told the mother:
``Do you know there was a holdup here earlier? Do not take the gun
out of the bag,'' Mrs. Graham said.
	   Mary Ann Ignatius, a visitor from Washington, D.C., said her
hosts had called to say ``Don't go out, there's been a shootout.''
	   ``I went out anyway, but kept my eyes open,'' Mrs. Ignatius
said.
	   Fifty firemen and 15 fire trucks rushed to the scene, as did
Paris police chief Philippe Massoni.
	   At the money-changing office, near the sunglasses and hosiery
departments, security officers were standing guard hours after the
attack.

Congressmen tour new airport under U.S. embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Two visiting U.S. congressmen on Tuesday
toured the new terminal building of the Beirut International
airport and praised the improved security at the facility, which
has been under a U.S. embargo for 13 years for lack of safety.
	   Republican Ray Lahoud of Illinois and Democrat Nick Rahall of
West Virginia inspected the departure, arrival and transit lounges
at the new dlrs 475 million terminal. They were accompanied by U.S.
Ambassador David Satterfield and a bodyguard.
	   Rahall said the embargo on the airport should be lifted and said
he will appeal to the Transportation Department and the Federal
Aviation Administration when he returns to Washington.
	   ``There is a process that needs to be followed ... and that
involves time. We have to be patient,'' said Rahall.
	   ``We have seen tremendous improvement at Beirut airport with
definite progress in both the physical construction underway and
the security screening process,'' Rahall told The Associated Press.
	   He and Lahoud, members of the U.S. House of Representatives, are
of Lebanese descent. They were here to attend Tuesday's
inauguration of President Emile Lahoud who is not related to the
congressman.
	   The two lawmakers came to Lebanon by helicopter from neighboring
Cyprus, landing at the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy. The airport
remains off-limits to Americans on official government business.
	   U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley, who visited Lebanon
Nov. 13, also took the helicopter route.
	   Beirut International Airport, a major hub in the Middle East
before the 1975-90 civil war, became a haven for hijackers during
the conflict. Foreigners also were kidnapped on the highway linking
it in south Beirut with the city.
	   The U.S. embargo was slapped after the June 1985 hijacking of a
TWA jetliner to Beirut airport. One passenger, a U.S. Navy diver,
was killed and the remaining 37 Americans on board were held
hostage for 17 days as hijackers enjoyed free access in and out of
the aircraft and received support from comrades in surrounding
neighborhoods.
	   A subsequent ban on American passport holders from traveling to
Lebanon was lifted only in July 1997.
	   In 1983, a suicide bomber blew up a U.S. Marines base in the
airport premises, killing 241 servicemen. The next year, two
bombings of U.S. diplomatic compounds killed 29 more Americans.
Seventeen Americans were kidnapped and held hostage in Lebanon in
the 1980s.
	   ``The measures taken recently have tremendously impressed us.
The situation is much improved now over what it was six months ago
and it will improve, I'm sure, over the coming six months,'' Rahall
said.

AS Roma 1, FC Zurich 0 in third-round first-leg of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zeman, Ponte quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Francesco Totti converted a penalty kick in
second-half injury time to give Italian league great AS Roma an
undeserved 1-0 victory against FC Zurich in their third-round,
first-leg game of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Zurich players bitterly protested the referee decision to grant
the home team a penalty when Totti was pushed by defender Franco Di
Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to reach a long cross in
the 91st minute.
	   Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 15 games at
Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite fans who occasionally
booed the unimpressive play of the home team before the late game
winner.
	   ``We suffered such more than expected and needed some luck to
win the game,'' said Roma's Czech coach Zdenek Zeman.
	   In fact it was underdog Zurich to produce the best scoring
chances at the Olympic stadium.
	   Quick forward Frederic Chassot kicked the ball past the bar,
from a few meters (yards) in the 33rd minute, after rushing alone
into Roma's penalty area.
	   Five minutes before Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti had made a
decisive save on a powerful drive by South African forward Thurston
Bartlett.
	   Chassot had another scoring chance in the 60th but his shot was
stopped by Chimenti, a substitute of Roma's No.1 Austrian goalie
Michael Konsel who's recovering from surgery.
	   Roma, often overwhelmed at midfield, wasted a scoring chance
with Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio in the 42nd while Totti hit the
post with a diagonal shot in the 15th.
	   Totti had earned and converted a controversial penalty kick also
in Sunday's league game against Bari, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   Swiss officials were furious with British referee Young who
ignored a dubious intervention by Damiano Tommasi on Brazilian
forward Lima inside Roma's penalty area in the 50th.
	   ``We caused a lot of problems to Roma, and did not deserve
defeat. We were badly hurt by the referee's decisions,'' said
Zurich's coach Raimondo Ponte.
	   Roma, second to Fiorentina in the Italian league standings, will
travel to Zurich for the second leg on Dec. 8.

Tajik troops detain rebels, fighting continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan's government forces have detained
several rebel fighters suspected of taking part in fierce fighting
earlier this month in the Central Asian nation, a news report said
Tuesday, while another standoff continued nearby.
	   Government forces seized explosives and other weapons during the
arrest raid in Khudzhand in northern Tajikistan, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, near the northern town of Aini, government forces
surrounded about 50 rebels Tuesday.
	   However, the rebels' suspected leader, former army Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev, and more than 200 of his supporters remained at
large, and the government was worried about another attack,
Interfax reported.
	   More than 200 people were killed and hundreds wounded in several
days of fighting around Khudzhand and Aini earlier this month, the
government said.
	   Khudoberdyev, who broke with the government after it signed a
peace treaty with the opposition last year, had demanded that
President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring
his supporters into the government. The president refused to
negotiate.
	   The peace treaty ended five years of civil war between the
Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's hard-line government, and the
main opposition groups are now participating in the government.
	   But a number of warlords have refused to acknowledge the peace
accord and periodically launch attacks in the poor, mountainous
former Soviet republic.

Car bomb kills three outside German embassy in Yemen

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in front of the German
Embassy Tuesday, killing three people including two policemen,
witnesses and security officials said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat also
insisting on anonymity.
	   The official Yemeni news agency SABA quoted an interior ministry
source as saying that preliminary information indicates that the
target was not the German Embassy but a prominent political figure,
Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, whose house is next to the embassy.
	   SABA said three people were killed and four were injured but it
did not identify the victims. Security officials said two of the
injured were discharged from hospital later Tuesday.
	   They said one of those killed was a police major who was
visiting the policemen in charge of the embassy's security. A
lieutenant posted in the diplomatic neighborhood was the other
person killed, said the officials.
	   The third victim was a Yemeni boy who was in a car passing by,
said the officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The explosion set a nearby car on fire but firefighters put out
the blaze, the witnesses said.
	   The Mazda car carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy
in the residential Hadda area, where most embassies are located.
	   The site was cordoned off by police, who refused to allow anyone
to enter or leave the area. No other details were available.
	   Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, is largely inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to
use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent
with the government.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebel leaders
signaled Tuesday that they may accept a U.S. peace plan to end the
crisis in Kosovo, even though it falls short of their demands.
	   American envoy Christopher Hill met twice with representatives
of the Kosovo Liberation Army earlier this month to discuss his
peace plan, which fails to grant the rebels' demand for
independence.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci signaled the rebels might support it
nonetheless.
	   ``Hill's plan is far from what we really want, but we are not
rejecting it,'' he said.
	   The rebels also freed a kidnapped Serb policeman Tuesday,
calling it an act of good will. The KLA was still believed to be
holding two ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along with the
policeman Nov. 17. The two are considered sympathetic to the Serb
cause.
	   Despite U.S. efforts to find a peace formula that would win
support of all Kosovo factions, the positions of the two sides on
the future of the province are still far apart.
	   Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians have rejected any possibility
of the province remaining part of Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   The U.S.-drafted plan would sever the province from Serbia, but
keep Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation.
	   Serbia has rejected the U.S. plan and came up with a
counterproposal last week.
	   President Milan Milutinovic called for talks on Wednesday to
discuss it, but such Serb-organized talks have failed in the past.
The latest invitation has been rejected by ethnic Albanian
negotiators led by Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Demaci said that for the first time he, too, had been invited to
attend the meeting.
	   The rebel spokesman seemed to back down from earlier KLA demands
for a complete withdrawal of army and police from Kosovo before
talks could start. He demanded release of other ethnic Albanian
prisoners and an end ``to Serb provocations,'' instead.
	   An Oct. 12 agreement mediated by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
led to an end of hostilities in Kosovo and the withdrawal of many
Serb-led forces. But sporadic violence continues. Each side accuses
the other of starting it.
	   The release of policeman Goran Zbiljic, kidnapped in Podujevo,
northeast of the capital Pristina, followed intervention by U.S.
diplomatic observers in Kosovo who persuaded the rebels to let him
go.
	   Both the government forces and the KLA are believed to have
captured hundreds of people during the seven months of fighting.
The Serb crackdown against the KLA that began in February claimed
hundreds of lives and made hundreds of thousands more homeless.

Frigid weather sweeping Europe claims 85 lives

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Frigid weather and snow storms
sweeping through Europe claimed more lives Tuesday, bringing the
death toll to at least 85 people since last week.
	   Fourteen more deaths were reported Tuesday. Worst hit by the
cold snap has been Poland, with 41 weather-related deaths, and
Romania, with 30.
	   France, Bulgaria and Italy also reported storm-related deaths.
	   Romania's cold snap began Friday, and authorities reported nine
more deaths Tuesday. The latest deaths included three people who
lost control of their cars in icy conditions, said Col. Ioan
Palalau of the national traffic police.
	   One homeless man in a village near Romania's capital, Bucharest,
died after he sought shelter in a garbage bin, and another froze to
death in a streetcar. A man sweeping snow in the capital passed out
and died, apparently because of the cold, and another man was found
frozen to death in a Bucharest factory where he had apparently
sought shelter.
	   In the county of Tulcea in southeastern Romania, schools were
closed due to unheated classrooms and roads made impassable by
heavy snow. Blizzards swept across Romania's southeast Tuesday and
temperatures plunged to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees
Fahrenheit) before dawn.
	   Dozens of villages had no electricity and 300 communities were
without telephone lines, the Mediafax news agency reported. About
150 soldiers in bulldozers and other military vehicles were
dispatched to help people trapped by the snow.
	   Bucharest's emergency hospital reported treating more than 800
fractures caused by slippery terrain within the last 24 hours.
	   In Bulgaria, 700 villages were without electricity Tuesday and
400 were without water after heavy snow knocked down power lines
and caused outages at water pumping stations, officials said.
	   Five passes in the Balkan Mountains were closed because of deep
snow drifts. Bulgarian state radio reported dozens of schools in
rural northeastern Bulgaria had suspended classes because of the
snow.

Muslim leadership tells U.S. diplomat to ``get off their backs''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In an unusually harsh
letter, Bosnian Muslim leaders called a U.S. diplomat a liar on
Tuesday for an alleged claim that all Bosnian politicians are
corrupt, urging him to come up with names or ``get off our backs.''
	   The Muslim members of the presidency and government of Bosnia as
well as of the Muslim-Croat Federation half of Bosnia reacted
jointly to a statement U.S. mediator Richard Sklar made on
television on Monday.
	   The letter accused Sklar of saying: ``All politicians in
Bosnia-Herzegovina are corrupt.''
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of Bosnia's tripartite
presidency and premieres Haris Silajdzic and Edhem Bicakcic, said
Sklar's alleged statement was a ``lie.''
	   ``We are not thieves,'' the letter said.
	   Sklar has helped mediate on special ties between the
Muslim-Croat half of Bosnia and neighboring Croatia. The letter was
made public too late Tuesday to get any U.S. comment on its
contents.
	   The Muslims in Bosnia feared the agreement would bolster any
Croatian aspirations for a greater role in parts of Bosnia where
Croats are numerous and were reluctant to sign it.
	   Under international pressure, the Muslim leadership did sign
last weekend, after Sklar and other U.S. mediators repeatedly
expressed their frustration with the slowness of the process.
	   ``We have nothing to hide,'' the letter on Tuesday said adding
Sklar should finally publicly name those he accuses of corruption,
or get off our backs.''
	   The president of the Muslim-Croat Federation, Ejup Ganic, also
wrote a letter to Sklar with similar contents, Bosnian radio
reported.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Masked robbers burst into a department store packed
with tourists and Christmas shoppers Tuesday, stole cash from a
money-changing office and then shot a passerby in the head who
confronted them, gravely wounding him, police said.
	   A store statement said the man's life was not in danger. Three
others were injured, and at least five others were treated for
shock.
	   The thieves were chased by a crowd of angry shoppers, but
nevertheless escaped with 240,000 francs (dlrs 42,100) from the
ground-floor money-changing office at the Printemps store, near the
grand Opera house on Paris' Right Bank.
	   They escaped through the back entrance of the elegant store, one
of the best known in Paris, which was packed with afternoon
shoppers and decorated with Christmas wreaths and garlands.
	   ``I was walking by and saw one of the robbers jump on top of the
glass cabin where the money is. Then he got inside,'' said Nabine
Chil, 26, who sells T-shirts outside the store.
	   ``I'm stunned. This type of thing never happens in a store like
this in Paris,'' he said.
	   Police, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, would not
identify the man who was injured.
	   But they said he was shot when the robbers made their escape out
the back entrance, on the Rue de Provence. When they violently
shoved the man's wife, as the couple was entering the store, her
husband confronted them and was shot, they said.
	   He was taken in critical condition to the Pitie Salpetriere
hospital. However, a statement by store president Bertrand de
Talhouet said the man's life ``happily is not in danger.''
	   Police originally said the man was a guard, but changed their
account after interviewing witnesses.
	   Two others, including a security guard, were hit on the head by
the robbers with the butts of their guns, police said. Another was
injured in the leg by flying glass. Five or six others were treated
for shock.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II granted a brief audience
Tuesday to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, urging him to seek a
negotiated end to a rebellion that threatens to bring on a larger
African war.
	   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Kabila also talked
with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, and
with Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the secretary for foreign
relations.
	   Catholic mediators also tried their hand at Kabila, who so far
has refused their attempts to arrange talks with rebels in the
4-month-old conflict. Many of Congo's neighbors have joined the
fighting _ some for Kabila, some against _ raising fears of an
all-out regional war.
	   The Holy See, Navarro-Valls said, urged a ``dialogue on either
the international or national level'' toward ``a peaceful solution
that safeguards the principles of territorial integrity and
national sovereignty with respect for the rights of each individual
and social group.''
	   Kabila's roughly 20-minute papal audience came a day after
Amnesty International issued a report on atrocities by both
Kabila's forces and the rebels. The international human rights
group said both were waging war against civilians.
	   Protesters jeered Kabila as he went into a later meeting with
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, calling him ``assassin.''
	   Navarro-Valls acknowledged some ``perplexity'' over the pope's
willingness to meet with Kabila.
	   ``To this, our response has always been that you have to keep in
mind that the pope listens to everybody, the Vatican spokesman
said, adding, ``When there's an occasion for the pope to make his
voice heard, to express thoughts on ethics to certain people, I
don't see the reason for such perplexity.''
	   Kabila praised the pope but said nothing of any outcome to the
day of talks.
	   ``He understands the problem, he knows the problem,'' Kabila
said. ``The pope said `We want everybody to respect other
countries.' This is the good message he has given us and to the
whole community of the West.''
	   Kabila talked later in the day with members of the Rome-based
Sant' Egidio community, which has mediated conflicts worldwide.
Sant' Egidio mediators also were expected to meet some time this
week with the visiting president of Namibia, Samuel Nujoma,
increasing pressure for talks.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are supporting Kabila against the
rebels, who have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Kabila has refused direct talks, demanding instead that Rwanda
and Uganda end their support for the insurgents and leave Congo. He
rejected the idea once again on Tuesday.
	   ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated Press
Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of our
country.''
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels and say they'll stay as long as Congo
remains unstable.
	   Kabila, who took power after toppling the late President Mobutu
Sese Seko in 1997, is on his first European tour since the Aug. 2
rebellion against him began. After Rome, he goes to Brussels and
Paris for a summit for French-speaking African nations on Thursday.

Council renews oil-for-food program for another 6 months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from US ambassador; ADDS that Iraq has
complained about delays in aproval for spare parts contracts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Tuesday to
allow Iraq to sell another dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over six months
to buy badly needed humanitarian aid for Iraqis suffering under
U.N. sanctions.
	   In a 15-0 vote, the council renewed the U.N. ``oil-for-food''
program and also agreed to let Iraq to buy another dlrs 300 million
in spare parts to repair its dilapidated oil facilities.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War. The council will
only lift the sanctions after U.N. arms experts report that Baghdad
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council agreed to start the oil-for-food program in 1996 to
allow imports of basic necessities such as food and medicine for
Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Iraq had hoped that the current phase of the program would be
the last, and it had tried to persuade the council to merely extend
the current phase for two months rather than renew it for six.
	   Iraqi officials have long complained that the unique U.N.
program has merely served to keep sanctions in place.
	   After the vote, the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh,
acknowledged criticism that the program was sometimes inefficient
and hadn't met Iraqis' nutritional needs.
	   ``There has been a major improvement of the implementation of
the program over the past year,'' he said, adding that the basic
obstacle in getting goods to Iraqis was delivery delays on the
ground.
	   Iraq has routinely accused the United States and Britain of
delaying approval of contracts for spare parts to repair and
upgrade its oil facilities.
	   Council members nearly doubled the amount of oil Iraq could sell
to dlrs 5.2 billion in February, but Iraq has not been able to pump
enough crude to meet that target, due to low oil prices and the
weak condition of Iraq's industry. These factors have limited its
exports to about dlrs 3.2 billion worth of oil in the current
phase, which ends Wednesday.
	   To help Iraq pump more oil, the council agreed in June to let
Iraq buy dlrs 300 million in spare parts for its industry. The
first of those purchases _ dlrs 1.75 million worth of material used
to treat crude oil and remove impurities _ are expected to arrive
in Iraq this week, U.N. officials said Monday.

Thousands rally in Belarus to protest referendum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 2,000 opposition demonstrators
rallied in Belarus' capital Tuesday to mark the anniversary of a
referendum giving their autocratic president nearly unlimited
powers.
	   Opposition groups called the referendum a ``coup'' against human
rights and blamed it for the former Soviet republic's deep economic
troubles.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who openly pines for
the Soviet Union, staged and won a referendum Nov. 24, 1996, that
gave him extraordinary powers. It prompted him to dissolve
parliament and replace it with a loyal legislature and allowed him
to effectively rewrite the constitution adopted in March 1994.
	   The referendum passed by a landslide. Though Lukashenko is
widely admired in Belarus, the pro-reform opposition and
international human rights groups say the referendum was tainted by
fraud and was unconstitutional.
	   On Tuesday, 2,000 protesters marched through downtown Minsk
carrying red-and-white Belarusian national flags _ as opposed to
the red-and-green Soviet-era flag Lukashenko prefers. Riot police
escorted the march, though no violence was reported.
	   The demonstrators rallied near the National Opera House,
demanding a radical reduction in police forces and bureaucracy,
increased pensions, a return to the 1994 constitution and
improvement in relations with the West.
	   ``Two years ago the president ... used brutal force, arranged
the so-called referendum and got these powers,'' leader of the
opposition party Hromada, Nikolai Statkevich, told the crowd.
	   ``Today the results of his policy can be observed on the empty
store shelves. What is going on in the country proves that
Lukashenko can't rule the country. There is only one way out, not
to give in.''
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies of the former
Soviet Union, and has received a fraction of the foreign investment
and aid of its Eastern European neighbors.
	   An economic crisis rocked Belarus this spring, with a plunge in
its currency prompting the government to order strict price
controls. That led to a boom in exports and to dramatic shortages
of staple goods, including meat and dairy products, throughout
Belarus.
	   Lukashenko has been criticized by human rights groups for
cracking down on dissent and independent media.

Israelis, Palestinians, Americans to hear incitement complaints
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After decades of animosity, Israel and the
Palestinians sat down Tuesday to tackle the issue of incitement for
the first time and discuss the sensitivities of language.
	   Four Americans will monitor the talks: former California
congressman Mel Levine, former U.S. State Department spokesman
Bernard Kalb, former Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroker
and Notre Dame University President Emeritus Father Theodore
Hesburgh.
	   The committee was established at the request of Israel and
agreed upon during last month's Mideast summit in Maryland that
concluded with the Wye River land-for-security accord between
Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Israel has long complained that the Palestinian Authority
tolerates and even encourages incitement against the Jewish state
in Palestinian school books, newspapers, broadcasts and during
public rallies.
	   As part of the new peace agreement, Israel wants the
Palestinians to do more to stop inflammatory rhetoric often seen by
Israel as anti-Semitic in nature as well.
	   ``We're trying to reduce 50 years of anti-Israel incitement on
the Palestinian streets,'' said Yoash Sidon, the head of the
Israeli delegation and a former legislator for the right-wing
Tsomet Party.
	   Sidon said the committee would meet every two weeks once the
agenda was fixed.
	   Another committee member, Itamar Marcus, said the Israelis would
demand that the Palestinians rewrite school books that do not
recognize Israel or call for its destruction. Marcus said Israel
will ask the United States to cover the costs of rewriting the
books and printing new ones.
	   In a speech to Israel's parliament last week, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu cited what he said were several examples of
incitement, including a religious program on Palestine TV in which
Jews were called the work of Satan and public comments by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat threatening armed conflict as a
means of achieving statehood.
	   Palestinian legislator Marwan Kanafani, who heads the
Palestinian delegation, would not say what kinds of grievances he
would bring up, if any, concerning Israeli incitement against
Palestinians.
	   Arafat issued an anti-incitement decree last week. It was one of
the conditions he had to meet ahead of Israel's troop withdrawal in
the northern West Bank last Friday.
	   A first complaint to be raised by Israel on Tuesday is about a
rally at An Najah University in the West Bank town of Nablus on
Monday, Israel radio said. During the protest by opponents to the
peace agreements, pictures of Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill
Clinton were burned.

Iraqi opposition groups meet U.S. envoy

	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraqi opposition leaders, trying to consolidate
support for their campaign to oust Saddam Hussein, met with a U.S.
envoy on Tuesday following talks with British officials.
	   Sixteen representatives of leading opposition groups met with
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk at the American
Embassy in the early evening.
	   The Iraqis had talked with British Foreign Office Minister Derek
Fatchett on Monday and won support for their efforts to indict
Saddam for crimes against humanity.
	   Indyk had talks last week with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the
largest opposition umbrella group, the Iraqi National Congress.
Chalabi also was involved in Tuesday's talks.
	   U. S. support is crucial to support in the Middle East for the
Iraqi dissidents, said the INC's Za'ab Sethna. He also said the
group wanted the United States to encourage all dissident groups to
align behind the INC.
	   ``The reality of the situation in the Middle East is that the
U.S. is the preponderant power,'' said Sethna.
	   The U.S. Congress has approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to
support Iraqi dissidents.
	   Security analysts are skeptical about the ability of dissident
groups to overthrow Saddam, citing divisions between Iraqi
opposition groups.
	   ``For the last eight years they have not demonstrated themselves
to be a viable alternative,'' said George Joffe, deputy director of
the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
	   Joffe said only a plot by the armed forces or the ruling Ba'ath
party would be likely to succeed.
	   ``Saddam has very effective security arrangements,'' Joffe said.
	   The Iraqi National Congress said before the meeting that it
hoped Indyk would tell Iraqi opposition groups to unite behind the
Iraqi National Congress platform. The major Iraqi dissident groups
have held talks in the past few days, and relations between them
were good, Sethna said.
	   ``We have good relations with them. We are not rivals to the
Iraqi National accord,'' said Sethna. ``Iraqi groups in the Iraqi
National Congress have a common platform which calls for the
removal of dictatorship, renunciation of weapons of mass
destruction and federalism for Iraq.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street took an expected break Tuesday as
profit-takers moved into the stock market after its big run to new
highs on Monday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point was down
70.28, rebounded in the afternoon and was off 2.57 at 9,371.70 at 2
p.m. (1900 GMT).
	   In earlier overseas trading, Asian markets were galvanized by
Monday's big advance in New York, but European markets closed down.
Germany's DAX index fell 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.2 percent.
	   ``The market's had such a strong run, we may be in for a more
reflective period,'' said Bob Semple, an equity strategist at BT
Alex Brown.
	   The activity followed Monday's rise in the Dow, which climbed
214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the July 17 record of 9,337.97
and capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from last summer's lows.
	   Takeover news helped the gains as Deutsche Bank AG said it was
discussing the final details of a dlrs 9 billion deal for Bankers
Trust Corp. Internet shares led the technology group higher as
America Online Inc. said it would buy Netscape Communications Corp.
in a dlrs 4 billion deal. The AOL-Netscape deal was confirmed
Tuesday.
	   Asia's top three stock markets rose sharply.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared 384.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to
15,164.64. It was the first time the index had finished above the
psychologically significant 15,000-point level since Aug. 25.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rallied to a nearly
seven-month high. It closed at 10,851.71, up 337.18 points, or 3.2
percent, following a 2.7 percent gain Monday.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index broke through
the important 1,400-point plateau, rising 35.96 points, or 2.6
percent, to 1,412.90. Earlier in the day, it had risen even higher
to 1,421.56.
	   The return to record terrain in New York followed four months of
volatility that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to
7,467 on Oct. 8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil and its spread around the world would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the
region's financial crisis struck about 17 months ago.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng alone has gained 58 percent.
	   But some analysts warned that volatility and profit-taking
remain significant risks.

Bologna 4, Betis 1 in UEFA Cup third-round first-leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Russian forward Igor Kolyvanov scored one
goal and set up two others as Bologna trounced Real Betis 4-1
Tuesday in their third-round first-leg game of the UEFA Cup.
	   It was an unexpectedly wide home victory for the Italian team
against the Spanish club which started costly Brazilian superstar
Denilson.
	   Kolyvanov fed Italian veteran striker Daniele Fontolan for the
opening goal, in the 26th minute, which gave Bologna a 1-0 halftime
lead.
	   The Russian forward made it two in the 52nd, with a left-footed
drive from a few meters as he got the pass from Swedish teammate
Kennet Andersson.
	   Young Brazilian Eriberto scored Bologna's third goal in the
58th, kicking in a rebound _ a shot by Kolyvanov which hit the bar.
	   The 30-year-old Russian player completed his outstanding
performance offering Fontolan the chance for the home team's fourth
goal in the 74th.
	   Kolyvanov received a standing ovation from the crowd as he left
the field, replaced by Beppe Signori, with 14 minutes left.
	   Midfielder Benjamin Zarandona scored Betis' only goal in the
64th on a defensive mishap by Alessandro Rinaldi.
	   Denilson, cautioned in the first part of the game at Dall'Ara
stadium, was replaced by Alexis in the second half following a
lackluster performance.
	   ``We played a perfect game,'' said coach Carlo Mazzone as
Bologna extended its unbeaten home streak in the European
competition. ``It looks we are qualified for the quarterfinals. But
better wait for the outcome of the second leg. Everything can
happen in soccer.''
	   The second leg is scheduled in Seville on Dec. 8.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Completing the first smooth transition of
power in a peaceful Lebanon in nearly 30 years, the nation's new
leader took the oath of office Tuesday and promised to clean up a
graft-riddled government.
	   In a speech repeatedly interrupted by applause, President Emile
Lahoud told lawmakers that taxpayers want a transparent civil
service where nobody is above the law.
	   ``It is the people's right, before anything else, that they see
how the decent are rewarded and how a thief's hand is chopped off,
whoever that may be,'' he said.
	   On foreign policy, Lahoud is expected to change little. In his
speech, he pledged to continue close relations with Syria, without
whose approval he would not have been elected. Syria stations
30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power broker.
	   Lahoud said Lebanon would continue to ally itself with Syria in
any peace negotiations with Israel. Beirut has long rejected
Israel's attempts to negotiate a separate peace that would involve
Israeli troops withdrawing from the buffer zone they occupy in
southern Lebanon.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, respects the
religious divisions that dominate the politics of this nation of
3.2 million: The president is a Maronite Christian, the prime
minister is a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary speaker is a
Shiite Muslim. The assembly is divided equally between Muslims and
Christians.
	   Lahoud is the 11th president since independence from France 55
years ago. Two previous presidents took over after assassinations
in Lebanon, which ended a 15-year-civil war in 1990.
	   Lahoud, the 62-year-old, British-trained general, was elected by
Parliament on Oct. 25 amid hopes that he would rebuild the
administration as he had done the army: taking an organization
fractured by the 1975-90 civil war and welding it into a coherent
body free of sectarian tension.
	   During the nine-year tenure of retiring President Elias Hrawi,
government officials routinely took bribes, powerful politicians
gave lucrative contracts to cronies and family members, while other
politicians demanded kickbacks.
	   Lahoud said the people have the right to ask the government how
contracts are being awarded and how public funds are being
disbursed.
	   But he acknowledged the difficulties that lie ahead.
	   ``I do not claim to have a magic wand that fulfills the
(people's) hopes overnight, but I have the intention and the
will,'' he said.
	   One of Lahoud's first tasks of his six-year term will be to name
a prime minister. He is expected to ask the outgoing Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, whose Cabinet became a caretaker body with the end of
Hrawi's term, to form a new government. Hariri is the architect of
multibillion-dollar program to rebuild Lebanon from the destruction
of the war.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Russian forward Igor Kolyvanov scored one
goal and set up two others as Bologna trounced Real Betis 4-1
Tuesday in their third-round, first-leg game of the UEFA Cup.
	   It was an unexpectedly wide home victory for the Italian team
against the Spanish club, which started costly Brazilian superstar
Denilson.
	   Kolyvanov fed Italian veteran striker Daniele Fontolan for the
opening goal, in the 26th minute, which gave Bologna a 1-0 halftime
lead.
	   The Russian forward made it two in the 52nd, with a left-footed
drive from a few meters (yards) as he got the pass from Swedish
teammate Kennet Andersson.
	   Young Brazilian Eriberto scored Bologna's third goal in the
58th, kicking in a rebound _ a shot by Kolyvanov which hit the bar.
	   The 30-year-old Russian player completed his outstanding
performance offering Fontolan the chance for the home team's fourth
goal in the 74th.
	   Kolyvanov received a standing ovation from the crowd as he left
the field, replaced by Beppe Signori, with 14 minutes left.
	   Midfielder Benjamin Zarandona scored Betis' only goal in the
64th on a defensive mishap by Alessandro Rinaldi.
	   Denilson, cautioned in the first part of the game at Dall'Ara
stadium, was replaced by Alexis in the second half following a
lackluster performance.
	   ``We played a perfect game,'' said coach Carlo Mazzone as
Bologna extended its unbeaten home streak in the European
competition. ``It looks we are qualified for the quarterfinals. But
better wait for the outcome of the second leg. Everything can
happen in soccer.''
	   The second leg is scheduled in Seville on Dec. 8.

Parliament approves bill on formation of political groups

 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese parliament approved a bill
that allows the formation of ``political associations'' that can
compete in elections, state-owned television said.
	   The television reported the bill was adopted Monday night. It
quoted Parliament speaker Hassan Turabi as saying it was adopted
with one dissenting vote in the 400-seat Parliament.
	   The vote needs to be ratified by President Omar el-Bashir, but
that is considered a formality.
	   Sudan's constitution, which was approved in June, does not
clearly mention the right to form political parties, which were
banned after a 1989 coup, but does speak about the right to
organize political associations.
	   Some parliament members have pressed hard to replace such vague
phrases with a clear-cut reference to ``political parties.'' But
Turabi, the Islamic leader thought to be the real power behind the
government, has opposed such a change.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders in exile, in their last meeting in
Egypt in August, rejected the new constitution which is based on
Islamic law. They vowed to keep up their struggle for democracy.
	   President el-Bashir last week said the door was open for the
opposition figures to come back and form their political parties.
	   But the presence of Turabi at the head of parliament cast doubts
on the seriousness of the government's openness to the opposition.
	   The government has taken a series of steps to encourage the
opposition, even as it has sought to make peace with southern
rebels fighting for more autonomy.
	   Turabi earlier this year expressed readiness to leave the
parliament, and the daily Al-Anbaa said Tuesday it had confirmed he
will leave his post to give more time to the National Congress,
essentially a political party through which the country is run.
	   Turabi or government officials were not immediately available
for comment on the report.
	   Al-Anbaa said Turabi's resignation is expected to be announced
before the new bill on political openness takes effect January 1.
	   On that date, Sudan's national day, el-Bashir is expected to
announce serious measures that include general amnesty and freeing
all political prisoners or detainees.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and related famines.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki said
Tuesday he focused on cooperation in investment, tourism and sports
during talks with officials in Russia, whose economic crisis is
also affecting South Africa.
	   Mbeki has expressed concern about Russia's financial troubles,
which have sent stock markets plunging worldwide as panicked
investors pull out of emerging markets.
	   During his talks in Moscow, the two countries signed agreements
covering protection of capital investments and cooperation in
tourism and sports.
	   They also tried to ``identify possible areas of cooperation'' in
the weapons industry, Mbeki said.
	   ``We are ourselves very happy with the visit,'' Mbeki told a
news conference in Moscow on Tuesday. ``We were indeed very well
received by the government.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also said his talks with
Mbeki had gone well.
	   Primakov hailed the improvement in relations between Russia and
South Africa since the end of white-minority rule with South
Africa's first multi-race elections in 1994.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela will visit Russia in
April 1999 for meetings with Russian leaders, Mbeki announced
during the Moscow visit. Mandela canceled a visit to Russia last
winter amid concerns about his health.
	   Mbeki, who is expected to succeed Mandela when elections are
held next year, also met with other top Russian officials,
parliamentary leaders, businessmen and the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, before leaving Tuesday night.
	   Mbeki attended Moscow's Academy of Social Sciences, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Saudi Arabia, Yemen reach agreements on easing tensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Uneasy neighbors Saudi Arabia and Yemen have
agreed to prevent hostile political activities and media campaigns
against each other, officials said Tuesday.
	   The two countries also agreed on the need to implement a
tentative border agreement signed in 1995, said the Yemeni
officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   They gave no details of the agreements. Saudi officials also
were not immediately available for comment.
	   Officials said the agreements were reached during the visit of
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz. He ended his
two-day visit Tuesday after meeting with President Ali Abdullah
Saleh.
	   The agreements could help ease tensions between the two
countries whose troops have often engaged in skirmishes along the
2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with
potentially lucrative oil fields. The two nations have yet to
demarcate a mountainous border in the east.
	   Border talks have been stalled since four months and Yemen is
frustrated by the lack of progress and has said it will consider
seeking international arbitration.
	   Yemen accuses Saudi Arabia of helping finance its exiled
opposition and of being behind a series of explosions in the
southern port city of Aden last year. Yemen also claims that a
number of men implicated in an assassination attempt against Arab
last year are hiding out in Saudi Arabia.
	   For its part, Saudi Arabia accuses Yemen of allowing arms and
drugs to be smuggled through its borders to Saudi Arabia, the
official said.

Rwandan court sentences ex-officer to death for 1994 genocide

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A former army officer convicted of leading
Hutu soldiers into massacres and rape during a 1994 genocide was
sentenced to death on Tuesday, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
	   Warrant Officer Anaclet Rwahama was convicted of having led and
participated in attacks by his mostly Hutu soldiers and militiamen
at Kigali's Kicukiro sector targeting minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. He was also found guilty of rape.
	   More than 500,000 people were killed during Rwanda's 90-day Hutu
government-organized slaughter before Tutsi-led rebels won power
and stopped the genocide in July 1994.
	   Rwahama had pleaded guilty in hopes of avoiding the death
penalty. But the court tribunal rejected the plea because the case
had already reached the court.
	   Under Rwanda's genocide law, plea bargains are accepted only if
the defendant has confessed to crimes before the case is in court.
	   Rwahama, who has 15 days to appeal the sentence, is the third
former Rwandan army officer to face the death penalty for the
crimes of genocide. Dr. Martin Kaberuka and 2nd Lt. Pierre Bizimana
were sentenced to death July 28, but they have not yet been
executed.
	   So far, more than 350 people have been tried in connection with
the genocide, and more than 120 have been sentenced to death.
Firing squads executed the first 22 people in Rwanda on April 24.
Authorities have said more executions would follow, although it
wasn't clear when.
	   Six others were sentenced to death Friday at a court in
Gikongoro, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the Rwandan
capital. They included three former city administrators _ the
highest ranking officials to be tried in the country so far.
	   Joseph Ntegeyintwali, former deputy prefect of Karama; Didace
Hategekimana, former mayor of Karama and Martin Kagimbura, former
mayor of nearby Rukondo were convicted of failing to prevent and in
some cases helping organize the 1994 killings in their towns.
	   In addition, 11 others were sentenced to life in prison; five
people received up to 7 years in prison and three were acquitted.
	   In Arusha, Tanzania, the United Nations has been conducting
separate trials of Rwandan genocide suspects.
	   The tribunal has 32 suspects in custody and has convicted one
defendant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He is appealing.
	   Another defendant pleaded guilty and was also sentenced to life
in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Defending titlist Sweden will rely
mainly on veterans in the Davis Cup final against Italy on Dec.
4-6.
	   Team captain Carl-Axel Hageskog announced Tuesday a quartet of
old hands including Jonas Bjorkman, Magnus Gustafsson, Nicklas
Kulti and Magnus Norman.
	   Although Hageskog would not divulge his battle plan, it is very
likely he will use Bjorkman and Kulti in the doubles. In the
singles Hageskog has at least three players at his disposal.
	   Thomas Johansson, currently Sweden's highest-ranked player at
No. 17, is suffering a strained knee, but could be included on the
team if his condition improves. ``Thomas has to undergo one more
session for treatment. He'll join the others in Monte Carlo a day
later,'' Hageskog said.The other two candidates are Gustafsson and
Norman.
	   Bjorkman, currently ranked 24th, is the highest ranking player
on Sweden's team, followed by Gustafsson at 31, Norman at 52 and
Kulti at 293.
	   The Swedes will work out three or four days on clay in Monte
Carlo, outdoors weather permitting.
	   If the recent cold spell that has plagued many parts of Europe
continues, the team can also travel earlier to Italy for indoor
practice.
	   According to plan, the Swedes will travel to Milan on Sunday.
The final will be played on clay at the Assago Forum.
	   Clay indoors is better than outdoors.It is a little faster and
there is no wind, said veteran Gustafsson.
	   ``We have a 50-50 chance and an edge in the doubles,'' said the
31-year-old. ``That can compensate for the homecourt advantage of
the Italians. In the singles we're roughly equal according to the
rankings.''

Just counting AIDS victims in many countries is a big challenge

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.N. experts compiling figures on HIV infection
worldwide were stunned to learn over the past two years that they
had missed millions of AIDS victims in Africa, a key official said
Tuesday.
	   ``The big rise that we had over the last year was based on some
shocking findings, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where we
reached levels that we never thought could be reached,'' said
Bernhard Schwartlaender, chief epidemiologist at the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS.
	   In the early 1990s, U.N. experts assumed that infection rates
and patterns were the same for all countries in a region.
	   For Africa they took the best data, from Uganda, and projected
the numbers for the whole region. But while infection rates were
leveling off in Uganda, they continued to rise elsewhere,
especially populous countries like Nigeria and South Africa.
	   By last year, more data were available.
	   ``If you had talked to any of us a couple of years back and told
us there would be levels of HIV infection of 25, 30, 40 percent in
some countries, nobody would have believed that,'' Schwartlaender
said.
	   The U.N. agency abandoned the regional approach and started
working with each country, with more accurate figures and better
knowledge of the varying patterns of infection and survival.
	   A year ago, the agency re-calculated the figures it released for
1996 and realized the figures for Africa were incorrect. The real
number of people living with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa was closer
to 18.6 million _ not 14 million previously estimated.
	   The agency concedes that for many countries, it can still only
make estimates.
	   ``We are most comfortable with the accuracy of that number, ''
Schwartlaender said, though he added that researchers may be off by
20 percent to 25 percent in each direction.
	   The numbers need to be accurate so health workers can focus
their efforts where they are most needed.
	   Determining the number of people who have died from AIDS is also
a problem. Many death certificates list only the immediate cause of
death, such as pneumonia, and don't mention AIDS. In some cultures,
the stigma attached to AIDS is great and families try hard not to
have the cause of death known.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record, Rios loses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Rios losing, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras got a perfect start Tuesday
at the ATP World Championship and, unfortunately for Marcelo Rios,
so did Tim Henman.
	   Sampras and Rios, the two top players in the world, are locked
in a battle for the No. 1 ranking at the end of the year.
	   While Sampras beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 in his opening
match, Rios was upset 7-5, 6-1 by the big-serving Henman.
	   Sampras leads Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer rankings
and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first man to
finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record of
five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Rios needs to win at least two matches in the round-robin
portion of the elite event to have a shot at dethroning Sampras in
the final rankings for the year.
	   Sampras showed how badly he wants the record he believes may
never be broken again by crushing Kafelnikov.
	   Rios on the other hand simply faded after falling behind a break
in the second set and never put in a credible attempt to rally.
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras was impressive in the first set with his crisp
serve-and-volley game. Kafelnikov gave him more of a battle in the
second set but Sampras still dominated the opponent he beat in last
year's final, when he won the title for the fourth time.
	   ``The first set, you can't play play like that every match,
every day,'' Sampras said. ``I can't expect to play like that
tomorrow, it's not possible. But I'm not ruling it out.''
	   ``I definitely had a lot of work to do in the second set,''
Sampras said. ``I didn't want to do what I did last year when I
lost my first match and played a little bit flat. I didn't want to
dig myself into a hole, having to win my next two matches.''
	   Sampras had problems closing the match, needing six match
points. He won it after 66 minutes when Kafelnikov made two
straight backhand errors.
	   Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5
million tournament that brings together the eight players with the
best results in the year. The round-robin portion consists of two
four-man groups, with two players from each advancing to the
semifinals.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year and became
the first player to qualify back in August, dropped his serve to
lose the first set.
	   He wasted a break point in the third game of the second and lost
his serve again in the fourth, beginning a series of sloppy errors
that got him boos from the public. The match was over also in 66
minutes, when Rios hit a careless backhand long.
	   In a battle between the other two players in Sampras' Red Group,
Carlos Moya rallied to beat Karol Kucera 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, won his first indoor match of
the year, after going 0-5 until Hanover.
	   The Spaniard turned the match in the second set, when Kucera
first double-faulted to give Moya a set point and then hit a simple
forehand into the net.
	   Moya broke serve for a decisive break of serve in the third set
of the match that lasted 2 1/2 hours.
	   The next opponent for Sampras on Wednesday is Moya, who beat the
American in the opening match last year. In other matches
Wednesday, Kucera plays Kafelnikov and Andre Agassi makes his debut
against Alex Corretja.

NGOs criticize Brazil's plan to cut programs to save rainforests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - More than 300 non-governmental
organizations criticized the federal government's plan Tuesday to
make drastic cuts in programs aimed at saving the Amazon and
Atlantic Coast rainforests.
	   ``Programs that would fight predatory exploitation of mahogany
forests and boost eco-tourism in the Amazon will be adversely
affected,'' Claudionor Alexandre Barbosa da Silva, president of the
Amazon Work Group (GTA), told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper
Tuesday.
	   The GTA, which represents 355 non-governmental organizations, is
irate over a government announcement to cut 90 percent of funding
allocated for programs to fight the devastation.
	   As an example, da Silva pointed to the Pilot Program to Protect
Tropical Forests. He says its budget was slashed from dlrs 61
million (72.9 million reals) to just dlrs 6.3 million (7.5 million
reals). ``It's absurd and unjust,'' he told the newspaper.
	   The cuts are part of an austerity program to save dlrs 24
billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. Pledges of such
reductions helped Brazil secure an International Monetary Fund
rescue package of dlrs 41.5 billion earlier this month.
	   Between 1978-1996, more than 200,000 square miles (330,000
square kilometers) _ or 12.5 percent _ of the Amazon jungle was
destroyed, mainly by farmers, ranchers and loggers.
	   The Atlantic Forest, which once spanned Brazil's
4,500-square-mile (7,200-square-kilometer) eastern coast when the
Portuguese first arrived in 1500, has been reduced to just 3
percent of its original area.
	   The GTA began a campaign Monday to lobby members of Brazil's
congress to fight the proposed cuts.

Council concerned about arms flows to former Rwandan forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council expressed deep
concern Tuesday about the illegal flow of arms to former Rwandan
government forces and urged governments to tighten controls on
weapons sales.
	   The council was responding to a report from a U.N. investigation
into violations of the 1994 embargo imposed on Rwanda after the
start of state-sponsored genocide there that killed an estimated
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The report from the International Commission of Inquiry,
released Friday, said former government forces and members of the
Interahamwe Hutu militia were receiving weapons from throughout the
region to use in neighboring Congo's civil war.
	   It also said there were reports that the forces were smuggling
drugs into Africa to finance their arms purchases.
	   In a statement read by council president Peter Burleigh of the
United States, council members said they reaffirmed the arms
embargo and called for increased political will to implement it.
	   The inquiry commission was established in 1995 to look into
violations of the embargo. Fearing a new outbreak of violence in
Rwanda, the Security Council in April decided to reactivate it.

Russian police officer arrested for smuggling drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian police officer who impressed his
colleagues with his drug busts has been arrested on charges of
smuggling drugs himself, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The officer was caught with 230 grams (8 oz.) of heroin and a
large sum of cash, said Irina Teplyakova, a spokeswoman for
Russia's federal intelligence agency in the southern region of
Tambov.
	   Teplyakov was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as saying the
officer had a good record of drug busts, confiscating 70 kilograms
(144 pounds) of drugs in the past two years.
	   While colleagues were impressed by his success, some grew
suspicious when they noticed the confiscated drugs had been
diluted.
	   Investigators say the officer was conspiring with smuggling
groups to help them cross through Russia, ITAR-Tass said. Tambov is
located about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Moscow.

France tries eight alleged members of terrorist network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France continued its push to prosecute suspected
Muslim militants with the trial this week of eight men accused of
being part of a cross-border network between Italy and France
funneling arms to Algerian insurgents.
	   The defendants, who deny the charges, contend that what the
prosecution claims was logistical support for Islamic insurgents
was really simple business deals or efforts to make money to
survive.
	   On the second day of the hearing Tuesday, Judge Bruno Laroche
tried to unravel what he said was coded language in telephone calls
that prove the defendants were providing false identity papers and
arms.
	   The word ``shoes,'' the judge contended, stands for ``arms.''
	   Rabah Boumaiza, one of four defendants guarded in a glass box by
eight police, claimed he brought a pair of shoes from Naples to
Paris ``as a service'' to an acquaintance.
	   He admitted forging false papers, but claimed the counterfeiting
was not part of a scheme to aid Muslim militants.
	   The prosecution alleges the defendants, arrested in 1994 and
1995, were part of a network led by Djamel Lounici, an Algerian
under house arrest in Italy. Lounici, already sentenced in absentia
by a French court to five years in prison, is considered by
prosecutors here as a top leader of a European network helping to
arm Algerian insurgents.
	   The defendants, who face up to 10 years each in prison, are
charged with being part of a group planning terrorist acts.
	   In September, France held a mass trial of 138 suspected members
of a similar network allegedly mounted to supply insurgents with
arms and medicine in Algeria and with a refuge in France. That
verdict is due in February.
	   This week's trial was expected to last about eight days with the
verdict also deferred to a later date.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the Algerian
insurgency that erupted in 1992 to topple that nation's
military-backed government.

Grasshoppers Zurich 3-Girondins de Bordeaux 3 in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Sylvain Wiltord showed his scoring
qualities as he helped Girondins de Bordeaux to a 3-3 draw against
hosts Grasshoppers of Zurich in a thrilling UEFA Cup third round
match Tuesday.
	   Wiltord took advantage of the Zurich team's sloppiness on the
icy pitch to shoot Bordeaux into the lead in the sixth minute.
Johan Micoud made it 2-0 in the 20th minute.
	   But then Grasshoppers woke up with a goal by Mikhail
Kavelashvili just one minute later.
	   Forward Kubilay Tuerkyilmaz, who has been plagued by injury and
his own touchy temperament, scored for 2-2 in the 33rd minute.
	   Tuerkyilmaz set up Grasshoppers' third goal in the 53rd minute,
when Alexandre Comissetti scored an acrobatic goal after a goal
mouth muddle and suspected hand ball.
	   Capping a superb performance, Wiltord demonstrated why he is the
top scorer in the French league with a stylish 3-3 equalizer in the
73rd minute.
	   Grasshoppers advanced to the third round by default after
Fiorentina was kicked out of this season's cup after an Italian
spectator hurled an explosive device on to the pitch and injured a
match official.
	   The Zurich underdog considered itself unlucky not to emerge from
Tuesday's match with a clear win. Tuerkyilmaz and substitute
Patrick De Napoli both hit the bar on what should have been easy
goals.
	   It will now be an uphill struggle for Grasshoppers to overcome
the Bordeaux home advantage in the second leg and advance past the
team which is currently second in the French league standings.
	   Only 7,200 fans braved the icy weather to watch the match.

Opening of Gaza airport marks emotional day for Palestinians

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched
with glee Tuesday as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched
down at their new Gaza International Airport _ a concrete sign for
Palestinians that their homeland was one step closer to statehood.
	   As crew members waved the Palestinian flag from the pilot's
window of the Fokker 50, the emotional crowd began a spontaneous
celebration of dance and song set to last for days.
	   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you
are a citizen in a country,'' Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man from
Gaza City, said jubilantly.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat smiled broadly and flashed a
victory sign on the tarmac as he greeted each of the seven planes
that landed Tuesday. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of
the Palestinian state,'' he said.
	   Built with dlrs 75 million in contributions mainly from Japan,
Gaza International has one 2-mile-long (3.5-kilometer-long) runway
_ long enough to accommodate all but the biggest jumbo jets.
	   The one passenger terminal for arrivals and departures resembles
an Arabian desert palace with arches and multi-colored Moroccan
tiles and includes a VIP lounge.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including those for the
control tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Tuesday's
planes were guided in by a portable control panel installed in a
van.
	   Israel, which feared a solely Palestinian-run airport would mean
enemies could land at its doorstep or smuggle weapons to the
Palestinians, held up the opening for two years over security
concerns.
	   Under the airport agreement negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Middle East summit in Maryland, Israel will continue
to control the airspace and can shut down the airport at any time.
	   With a full-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel
will pre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists, although
no Israeli will sit in the control tower or operate any area of the
airport.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an
Egypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,
including Egyptian Cabinet ministers.
	   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence
will be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses
from the planes to a security check area in the airport where they
will go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-ray
luggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security
checks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other
crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage
will be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an
additional check while Palestinian agents observe.
	   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to
Jordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza
International. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with
a fleet of three planes, including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a
Saudi prince.
	   The airport will also be the permanent home of Arafat's
presidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung
from the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat
was on hand to personally greet the planeloads of dignitaries.
	   Next month, President Bill Clinton is expected to land there too
_ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least in
Palestinian eyes
	   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the
Palestinian people. Despite the monitoring role, the airport marks
a significant loosening of the Jewish state's security grip over
the Palestinians.
	   Years of requests for Israeli permission, often denied, to
travel anywhere by land or air are slowly ending. For people in the
cramped Gaza Strip, which is surrounded by barbed-wire on three
sides and the sea on a fourth, the airport will provide the only
unfettered way out.
	   Palestinians in the West Bank still need Israeli permission to
travel across its territory to Gaza but a safe passage route in the
works will make the land journey easier.
	   For Arafat, Tuesday was a chance to share the fruits of peace
with his people. As the first plane touched down and the pilot and
copilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads, a chant of
``Allahu Akbar,'' _ God is Great _ rose from the crowd of thousands
of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join
the celebrations.
	   ``You are a beautiful sight,'' Arafat told the Palestinian crew
in the VIP lounge, lavishly decorated with deep red Oriental
carpets and wall mosaics.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hundreds of Iraqis poured into the streets
Tuesday to protest eight years of U.N. sanctions, and its leaders
promised not to relent to pressure in its standoff with the United
Nations over documents on its weapons programs.
	   The tough words came a day after the government acknowledged an
assassination attempt on one of its most powerful officials.
	   Hundreds of Iraqis, many of them elderly women clad in black,
arrived by bus outside the U.N. headquarters to protest their
plight under sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Women cried, and others beat their chests in anguish.
	   ``There is no god but God, America is the enemy of God,'' the
crowd shouted. ``Down USA,'' others chanted in the
government-orchestrated demonstration.
	   A convoy of cars drove along the street carrying wood coffins
meant to symbolize children who died during the hardships.
	   At the heart of Iraq's dispute with the United Nations is the
sanctions, which have wrecked what was one of the Arab world's most
prosperous countries. Iraq claims 5,000 children die every month,
and U.N. officials acknowledge one in three suffer from
malnutrition.
	   The U.N. Security Council cannot lift the sanctions until U.N.
inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to build
them.
	   Last week, the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, asked
for more documents _ from personal diaries to a log of weapons used
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ as part of that search. But Iraq has
repeatedly insisted that the documents had been destroyed, were
already turned over to inspectors or irrelevant to their searches.
	   Failing to cooperate could delay a U.N. review of progress on
dismantling the weapons that Iraq hopes will ease the sanctions,
and the United States has warned it is still willing to attack Iraq
if it does not do everything the U.N. inspectors ask.
	   The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and five escort ships joined
the American naval fleet in the Gulf, U.S. military officials said
Tuesday. Its arrival brought to 19 the number of warships in the
region, in all carrying 17,000 sailors and marines.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz declared Tuesday that Iraqis
would not submit to the demands, ``regardless of the dangers.''
	   ``Surrendering to their will ... is death itself,'' he told a
poetry festival in the capital Baghdad.
	   Iraq averted what appeared to be an imminent U.S. and British
attack by agreeing to resume the work of U.N. inspectors on Nov.
14. Since then, inspectors have made daily visits to suspected
weapons sites, and Iraqi officials have provided full cooperation.
	   Butler, whom the Iraqi government views as instrumental in
prolonging the sanctions, is still the subject of rancor. Al-Iraq,
an official newspaper, called Butler on Tuesday a ``cursed devil
and mad bull.''
	   The assassination attempt on Izzat Ibrahim, President Saddam
Hussein's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command Council,
startled Iraqis, accustomed to the iron-fist security that reigns
in the country.
	   Official media said an assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim
as he got out of his car in the Shiite Muslim holy city of Kerbala
in southern Iraq. He escaped but several bodyguards and bystanders
were wounded.
	   The assailant was reportedly shot in the neck and killed.
	   The assassination attempt was the first known attack on a senior
official since December 1996, when gunmen shot Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, about 10 times while he waited in his car in an upscale
Baghdad neighborhood. Odai survived with grievous injuries.
	   Southern Iraq was the site of fierce fighting in the aftermath
of the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi military crushed an uprising by
Shiite Muslim rebels. Iraqi opposition groups in London have said
fighting has flared again there in recent months.

Netanyahu tries to woo defector back to his government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move to broaden support for peace within
his crumbling hard-line coalition, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu tried to woo a moderate defector back into his Cabinet
Tuesday.
	   Stacked with staunch right-wingers who oppose ceding
war-captured land to the Palestinians, the Cabinet narrowly
approved the latest Mideast land-for-peace peace accord and a
minority of the ministers voted for the deal in parliament.
	   It was only with the help of dovish opposition parties that the
peace agreement was approved and Netanyahu's government remained in
tact.
	   But facing no-confidence motions on tricky budgetary legislation
in December, the return of former foreign minister David Levy to
Netanyahu's pack would bolster his majority and help ensure a
smooth ride through the Knesset and into the new year.
	   Asked if Levy was about to rejoin the government, Netanyahu said
Tuesday, ``that possibility exists. I hope that it will also be
practical. That is why the contacts are taking place.''
	   Levy, a moderate who leads the small Gesher party, resigned from
government in January over the premier's peace policies. At the
time, negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians had been
frozen for nearly a year. Levy described the government as being
``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told
Channel Two TV.
	   Barring last-minute hitches Gesher is expected to vote Wednesday
morning to rejoin the coalition.
	   Netanyahu has reportedly offered Levy the Ministry for National
Infrastructure, vacated after Ariel Sharon filled Levy's spot at
the foreign ministry.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in front of the German
Embassy Tuesday, killing a Yemeni boy and two policemen, witnesses
and officials said.
	   The bomb shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into
the embassy, and damaged the embassy's wall, said the witnesses,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The explosion also set a
nearby car afire.
	   No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat who
also insisted on anonymity.
	   The official Yemeni news agency SABA quoted an interior ministry
source as saying that preliminary information indicates that the
target was not the German Embassy but a prominent political figure,
Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, whose house is next to the embassy.
	   SABA said three people were killed and four were injured but it
did not identify the victims. Security officials said two of the
injured were discharged from hospital later Tuesday.

Thumping win for center-left party in Sao Tome election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MANUEL DENDE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ A center-left party won
31 seats in Sao Tome's 55-seat parliament in the Nov. 8 general
election, according to final official results Tuesday, and is
expected to form a government within two weeks.
	   MLSTP/PSD leader Manuel Pinto da Costa, who ran the small West
African island nation under a single-party Marxist system for 16
years following its 1975 independence from Portugal, was widely
expected to be named Prime Minister by his party.
	   Pinto da Costa's appointment likely will open a period of uneasy
cohabitation with President Miguel Trovoada, his longtime political
rival, whose Independent Democratic Alliance won 16 seats.
	   The Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) snared eight seats. The
abstention rate was 35.3 percent.
	   Trovoada, who must formally invite the winning party to form a
government, is currently abroad on a series of state visits.
	   The MLSTP/PSD was defeated in the country's first democratic
ballot in 1991 but regained power in 1994 elections.
	   Since 1996, when the government was dissolved after an abortive
military coup, it has governed as the major partner in a coalition
with the PCD.
	   The MLSTP/PSD shook off criticism of its economic record to win
the election in this country of 120,000 people.
	   The unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent and the average
salary is about dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs
50.
	   Tthe government entered a joint venture with U.S. company
Environmental Remediation Holding Corp. earlier this year to
develop the country's oil and gas reserves.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to the country's economy
and help pay off a foreign debt estimated at dlrs 300 million.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.
	   The next general election is scheduled for 2002.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record, Rios loses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Rios saying his hurting back may force him
to drop out &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras got a perfect start Tuesday
at the ATP World Championship and, unfortunately for Marcelo Rios,
so did Tim Henman. Even worse for Rios, his back is hurting again.
	   Sampras and Rios, the two top players in the world, are locked
in a battle for the No. 1 ranking at the end of the year.
	   While Sampras beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 in his opening
match, Rios was upset 7-5, 6-1 by the big-serving Henman.
	   Sampras leads Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer rankings
and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first man to
finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record of
five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Rios needs to win at least two matches in the round-robin
portion of the elite event to have a shot at dethroning Sampras in
the final rankings for the year.
	   Sampras showed how badly he wants the record he believes may
never be broken again by crushing Kafelnikov.
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   Rios on the other hand simply faded after falling behind a break
in the second set.
	   The Chilean blamed a recurring back problem for his poor
performance and indicated he may even drop out of the tournament.
	   ``My back is hurting really a lot. I'm not in a good condition
to continue playing,'' Rios said.
	   ``I'm going to see how I feel tomorrow. I want to play, I want
to be No. 1 but you have to listen to your body,'' he said. ``It's
tough to run, it's tough to play when you are in pain.''
	   Henman said beating the No. 2 in the world was always
satisfying.
	   ``If things don't go your way, you may feel the injury is worse
than it really is,'' he said.
	   If Rios drops out, Sampras will be certain to secure the No. 1
spot and break the record.
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras was impressive in the first set with his crisp
serve-and-volley game. Kafelnikov gave him more of a battle in the
second set but Sampras still dominated the opponent he beat in last
year's final, when he won the title for the fourth time.
	   ``The first set, you can't play play like that every match,
every day,'' Sampras said. ``I can't expect to play like that
tomorrow, it's not possible. But I'm not ruling it out.''
	   ``I definitely had a lot of work to do in the second set,''
Sampras said. ``I didn't want to do what I did last year when I
lost my first match and played a little bit flat. I didn't want to
dig myself into a hole, having to win my next two matches.''
	   Sampras had problems closing the match, needing six match
points. He won it after 66 minutes when Kafelnikov made two
straight backhand errors.
	   Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5
million tournament that brings together the eight players with the
best results in the year. The round-robin portion consists of two
four-man groups, with two players from each advancing to the
semifinals.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year and became
the first player to qualify back in August, dropped his serve to
lose the first set.
	   He wasted a break point in the third game of the second and lost
his serve again in the fourth, beginning a series of sloppy errors
that got him boos from the public. The match was over also in 66
minutes, when Rios hit a careless backhand long.
	   In a battle between the other two players in Sampras' Red Group,
Carlos Moya rallied to beat Karol Kucera 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, won his first indoor match of
the year, after going 0-5 until Hanover.
	   The next opponent for Sampras on Wednesday is Moya, who beat the
American in the opening match last year. In other matches
Wednesday, Kucera plays Kafelnikov and Andre Agassi makes his debut
against Alex Corretja.

Spaniards feared held by suspected Pinochet supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A report that a Spanish economist and his
daughter are being held by suspected supporters of former dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet was under investigation on Tuesday, officials
said.
	   Spanish officials said the family of economist Gonzalo de
Cordoba Lopez, 64, received an e-mail message from him saying he
and his daughter Ana, 23, were seized after entering northern Chile
as tourists.
	   ``We are being held until Wednesday, when the ruling in London
on Sen. Augusto Pinochet will be announced,'' read the message,
according to embassy officials. The message apparently did not
include any threats.
	   ``We have informed the Chilean authorities, who are
investigating,'' embassy spokesman Julio Rodriguez told the
Associated Press by telephone.
	   The message was addressed to two of the economist's daughters of
who live in Chile.
	   De Cordoba and his daughter entered Chile from Bolivia last
Friday as tourists.
	   Pinochet was arrested last Oct. 16 in Britain on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon who wants to extradite him to face
charges of genocide, torture and murder.
	   The British House of Lords will rule Wednesday, the day of
Pinochet's 83rd birthday, whether state immunity must be recognized
to him.

Russia's talks with IMF for more loans bring no progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2, 13, with central bank only to offer dlrs
1.7 billion to bail out banks. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is still critical
of the Russian government's plans to tackle the country's economic
crisis and is reluctant to release more loans, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank said the bank
could only provide 30 billion rubles (dlrs 1.7 billion) to bail out
the crippled banking sector. The money could save a few hundred
banks, but hundreds more are likely to fold.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has been pushing the
IMF to release the next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion
aid package, saying it is crucial to pay off huge domestic and
foreign debts.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse following government default on loans in August and
devaluation of the currency.
	   The IMF team wrapped up a week of talks Tuesday after meeting
with senior Cabinet officials and studying the government's 1999
budget estimates.
	   ``The talks aren't over yet and no agreements have been
reached,'' said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who met
with the IMF mission on Wednesday. ``They are studying us and we,
them.''
	   The IMF is expected to come back to Moscow for more talks later
this year.
	   Maslyukov voiced hope that those talks will be successful, but
said that the Fund remained dissatisfied with the budget plan and
specifically urged the government to boost tax collection. ``We
agree with that, but we can't go beyond the limits of what is
possible,'' Maslyukov told reporters.
	   The IMF disapproved of the government's plan to support ailing
industries and insisted that state regulation of the economy should
be minimal.
	   The IMF believes that the ``the state intervention only brings
harm, while the Russian Cabinet thinks that it should control the
process,'' Maslyukov said, according to Russian news reports.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin, who took part in the talks,
said IMF experts also criticized the government's 1999 budget as
not austere enough and its revenue forecast as overly optimistic.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
strict economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for next
year as the main condition for more loans.
	   Also Tuesday, Andrei Kozlov, first deputy head of the central
bank, said the bank could only afford to prop up a few hundred of
Russia's estimated 1,500 banks, most of which have frozen accounts
since August. The government has long said it could not afford to
rescue all of them.
	   Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the population
were living below the official poverty line of 644 rubles (just
under dlrs 40) a month, compared to 31 million (21 percent) a year
ago.
	   Russia is also urging the IMF and other creditors to reschedule
its foreign debt, which will require dlrs 17.5 billion to service
next year.
	   The government has already included prospective IMF credits in
next year's budget and deducted from it debt payments it hopes to
reschedule _ an approach that drew the IMF's complaints, Vyugin
said.
	   Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the
government will issue new treasury bonds by Dec. 10 to replace
those it froze in August, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF and other foreign lenders have demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with holders of the dlrs 40 billion
worth of frozen treasury bills, or GKOs _ including several major
foreign banks.

Own-goal helps Real Sociedad down Atletico de Madrid 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ An own-goal in the 85th minute gave
Real Sociedad a 2-1 victory over fellow Spanish team Atletico de
Madrid which was left with nine men following two red cards in this
first-leg game of the UEFA cup third round.
	   Atletico took the lead in the third minute with a superb 22-yard
(meter) drive home by Brazilian midfielder Juninho.
	   But with a goal in the bag Atletico appeared to relax and
Sociedad fought back to clinch an equalizer seconds before
half-time with a goal by Yugoslav Darko Kovacevic.
	   In a game that saw 15 cards being shown by British referee
Graham Poll, Atletico ended with nine men on the field midway
through the second half with Italian defender Stefano Torisi
expelled in the 64th minute and Spaniard Carlos Aguilera following
him 10 minutes later.
	   Poll was booed and jeered as he left the field at half-time.
	   Sociedad had a goal by Oscar de Paula annulled for offside in
the 84th minute but a minute later right winger Aitor Aldeondo sent
a cross in from the edge of the box which Roberto Fresnedoso
side-kicked into his own net.

UN restarts bilateral talks on East Timor

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. envoy for East Timor resumed
bilateral talks with Indonesia and Portugal on Tuesday after a
brief delay prompted by reports of massacres in the disputed
territory.
	   Jamsheed Marker met in the morning with the representative of
Indonesia, Nugroho Wisnumurti and was meeting later in the day with
Portugal's delegate to the talks, Fernando Neves, U.N. officials
said.
	   He met with each side Thursday, and was to have resumed talks on
Saturday, but Portugal suspended the meeting following reports of a
massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes
with Indonesian troops.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it the following year. The United Nations, however, does
not recognize Indonesia's claim.
	   Indonesia on Tuesday denied that its troops had killed more than
40 East Timorese recently, and it criticized Portugal for
suspending the talks.
	   In response, Portugal's Foreign Ministry accused Indonesia of
breaking promises to reduce its military presence in East Timor and
called for a permanent U.N. mission in the territory.
	   The talks were centering on an Indonesian offer to give East
Timor autonomy in return for international recognition of
Indonesian sovereignty there.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups have rejected
the offer and have insisted that a referendum be held in the
territory to decide its future.

State leaders urge Schroeder to make eastern development a
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead UPDATES with Schroeder assuring leaders eastern
states a top priority, new throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his first meeting
with state leaders of Gemany's five eastern states, on Tuesday
assured the governors his government would make economic
development of their states a priority.
	   Building up the East was decisive to the fate of all of Germany,
Schroeder told the meeting in Berlin that also included the mayor
of that city-state.
	   Unemployment is almost twice as high in the East as in the West,
just one example of the east's ongoing struggle to adapt to a
market economy eight years after German reunification.
	   Schroeder said that he spoke to the governors and mayor about
plans to decide on an immediate employment program to put jobless
youth to work, that is expected to be finalized at a cabinet
meeting on Wednesday.
	   Governor Harald Ringstorff of Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania
said the group also discussed the difference in electricity prices
that are higher in the East than the West, without bringing up a
proposed ecology tax that is to go into effect next year that is
expected to drive up the price even higher.
	   The state leaders decided that they will hold talks with power
companies to try to reach a solution, Ringstorff said. The state
leaders say they fear the high cost of electricity will drive away
would-be investors.
	   Also discussed was the transportation infrastructure of eastern
Germany, with the governors proposing they move forward by
financing individual projects and the federal government pay for
them later. Schroeder showed interest in the proposal, Ringstorff
said.
	   Schroeder also assured the governors that plans to keep the
so-called solidarity tax to support eastern German development will
be carr ied out through 2004, and consideration given to possibly
extending it.
	   Biedenkopf warned that the eastern states would not be strong
enough economically to overcome the loss of the solidarity tax that
soon.
	   The eastern leaders also decided to schedule two or three
meetings a year to discuss their mutual problems and progress, and
Schroeder said future cabinet committee meetings would often be
held in the eastern states to deal with specific problems.
	   The first such meeting is to take place in Dresden in December,
Schroeder said.
	   Not discussed as expected Tuesday was low-wage jobs and ecology
tax proposals because they weren't on the planned agenda, Schroeder
said.

Bak strikes again as ten-man Lyon beats FC Brugge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - Lyon secured a 1-0 win against FC Brugge on
Wednesday despite having Swiss striker Marco Grassi sent off in the
first half.
	   Grassi was shown the red card in the 40th minute of the UEFA Cup
third round first leg contest after striking Yugoslav defender
Milan Lesnjak.
	   But Polish defender Jacek Bak scored a vital goal in the third
minute of first half injury time to make the French side favorite
going into the second leg in two weeks.
	   Bak, left unmarked by the Belgian defense, rose to head in a
right-wing Alain Caveglia cross past goalkeeper Nader El Sayed.
	   It was Bak who scored a brilliant goal in Lyon's 1-0 first
round, first leg match at Blackburn Rovers.
	   In sub-zero (celsius) temperatures, Lyon, in confident mood
after beating league leader Marseille in its last game, looked to
play on the break after losing Grassi, and Brugge rarely troubled
home goalkeeper Gregory Coupet.
	   Early in the second half, Egyptian El Sayed made a stunning save
from point blank range to deny Alain Caveglia a goal and keep his
team in the match.
	   Lyon was missing first choice midfielders David Linares and
Christian Bassila.
	   Belgian league leader FC Brugge, which had players from eight
different countries on view, was without suspended Belgian
international defender Tjorven de Brul.

Jewish group nominates Jordan's king for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The prominent Jewish group, B'nai B'rith
International, said Tuesday it has nominated Jordan's King Hussein
for this year's Nobel Peace Prize for his assistance during the Wye
Plantation talks that led to an Israeli-Palestinian accord.
	   Hussein's ``personal participation ... was instrumental in the
success'' of the October talks at Wye River, B'nai B'rith president
Richard Heideman said in a letter to the Nobel Committee, a
statement by the group said.
	   The statement, issued by the group's office in Washington D.C.,
was received by The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The Wye talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat led to the accord on Israeli
troops withdrawal from more West Bank land in exchange for
Palestinian efforts to crack down on terrorists.
	   ``The king's involvement, by itself, would merit this
nomination,'' Heideman said in the letter.
	   Hussein left the Mayo Clinic, where he is undergoing cancer
treatment, to help push the talks that often appeared at the verge
of collapsing.
	   ``As perhaps the one person with sufficient trust and respect of
the parties to guide them to an agreement they might not otherwise
have reached, he was indispensable,'' Heideman said.
	   Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, making Jordan
only the second Arab country after Egypt to make peace with Israel.
	   The 1978 Camp David Accords that led to the Israel-Egypt peace
treaty earned the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize for the then leaders of
the two countries, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   Late former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel shared the
1994 Nobel Peace Prize with his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and
Arafat for reaching the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accords in Oslo.

Dortmund wins to move back in range of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Veteran defender Juergen Kohler's goal with three
minutes to play Tuesday lifted Borussia Dortmund to a 2-1 victory
against Hamburger SV and into UEFA Cup range.
	   Dortmund's comeback after two hard years since capturing the
Champions Cup continued as the side reached fifth in the table for
the first time in 15 months.
	   Koehler connected from 20 meters (20 yards) at Dortmund's
Westfalenstadium in a match watched by 67,000 despite a cold snap
that left the pitch frozen.
	   Togo international Bachirou Salou scored for Dortmund in the
27th minute, the first for the striker in 10 matches. Denmark's
Allan Jepsen equalized in the 58th off a cross.
	   The match also marked the return of a longtime Dortmund
mainstay, defender Julio Cesar who left earlier in the year to play
for a Brazilian club.
	   Schalke, which captured the UEFA Cup the same season as Dortmund
won Europe's biggest club trophy, didn't fare as well Tuesday.
	   The side fell into 15th place and the demotion zone after losing
at home 2-1 to Werder Bremen, which scored in the 55th and 59th
minute on shots by Jens Todt and Austria's Andreas Herzog.
	   Schalke's inability to find the net again proved fatal. The team
now has generated just 14 goals in 14 matches, with defender Nico
van Koerkhoven scoring a consolation goal in the 86th minute.

Conference urges speedy elimination of ozone-depleting chemicals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Environmentalists and government ministers
from 130 countries Tuesday called for boosting global efforts to
reverse the destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer.
	   Ending a six-day meeting, the participants issued a statement
that also called on developing countries to speed up preparation,
approval and completion of projects to phase out environmentally
harmful substances.
	   The Cairo meeting comes just weeks after scientists reported the
largest ever recorded ozone hole over Antarctic _ covering 26
million square kilometers (10.4 million square miles) at its
widest, an area larger than North America.
	   The high-altitude natural ozone forms a barrier against
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Excessive levels of UV
radiation cause skin cancer in humans and can damage many plants
and animals.
	   Fears that severe ozone depletion could spread to populated
areas of the world led to the 1989 Montreal Protocol under which
168 countries have so far agreed to reduce or eliminate
ozone-damaging chemicals.
	   The Cairo meeting, organized by the United Nations Environment
Program, was aimed at tracking the progress of the Montreal
Protocol, which according to experts is beginning to have a
positive effect.
	   ``For the first time we are seeing the emergence of an
integrated approach to the global atmosphere,'' Klaus Toepfer, UNEP
executive director was quoted as saying by the statement issued
after the Cairo meeting.
	   A U.N. assessment earlier this year said gases and other
chemicals are now entering the atmosphere at a slower rate, but it
could be 20 years before ozone levels recover noticeably. It said
they should return to their pre-1980s levels around the middle of
the next century.
	   One of the main chemicals that is damaging the ozone layer is
CFC-12, a chlorofluorocarbon once commonly used in refrigerators
and air conditioning systems.
	   The Montreal Protocol bans the production and import of CFCs in
developed countries, and has given developing nations until 2010 to
phase them out. They must start doing so next year.
	   Although CFC concentrations in the atmosphere have started to
decline, levels are rising for halon, which are no longer produced
but are still used to fight fires.
	   The Cairo statement called on all parties to develop and submit
a national or regional strategy for the management of halons,
including emissions reduction and ultimate elimination of their
use.
	   At the meeting, 10 donors pledged a special contribution of dlrs
19 million to shut down Russian CFC and halon production factories
by the year 2000, the statement said.
	   The production capacity of the Russian Federation accounts for
nearly half of the CFC capacity in the world.
	   The statement called for steps against dumping of used CFC
products in developing countries and requested pledges from
companies not to manufacture or sell any new CFC using equipment or
technology in developing countries.

Second Alomar solves Indians' second-base mess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ A second Alomar was all the Cleveland Indians
ever wanted or needed to end their second-base mess.
	   Roberto Alomar joined his brother Sandy on the American League
Central champions, agreeing Monday to a dlrs 32 million, four-year
contract.
	   Indians general manager John Hart announced the contract on
Tuesday at Jacobs Field with the nine-time All-Star.
	   ``In Roberto Alomar, the Indians have acquired one of the elite
second basemen in the game today,'' Hart said. ``We are elated to
have the Alomar brothers in the Indians family.''
	   Roberto Alomar, coming off an dlrs 18 million, three-year
contract with Baltimore, gets a dlrs 1 million signing bonus, dlrs
6.5 million next season, dlrs 7 million in 2000, dlrs 7.5 million
in 2001 and dlrs 8 million in 2002. Cleveland has an dlrs 8 million
option for 2003 with a dlrs 2 million buyout.
	   Roberto Alomar said he was proud to be playing with his brother.
	   ``It means a lot to be beside my brother, not only to me but to
my family,'' he said after Sandy presented him with an Indians
jersey with the No. 12. ``This has always been a dream. And for us,
this dream has come true.''
	   Alomar's addition finally gives the Indians stability at second
base, ending a revolving-door of 15 players who have played the
position since the club traded away Carlos Baerga in 1996.
	   Cleveland will also have one of the strongest and flashiest
middle infields in baseball history with Alomar pairing with Omar
Vizquel for a deadly double-play combination. Both players have won
six Gold Gloves at their respective positions.
	   ``It would be worth the price of a ticket just to watch Omar and
Robbie turn a double play,'' Hart said last week.
	   The Indians used six players at second during the '98 season
alone, and went into the postseason with Joey Cora there after
acquiring him in a late-season trade with Seattle.
	   Cora hit just .059 in the playoffs and he became a free agent
after Cleveland declined to exercise his 1999 option.
	   Roberto, 30, has been in Hart's sights for several years, and
when Alomar became a free agent this winter, Hart made him his No.
1 priority. Alomar and his agent, Jaime Torres, met with Hart and
Indians owner Dick Jacobs in Cleveland last week, and reports had
the sides close to striking a deal.
	   With Alomar playing second and likely batting second behind
Kenny Lofton, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has a lineup with a
current or former All-Star at every position, and one only rivaled
by the World Series champion New York Yankees.

Grasshoppers Zurich, Girondins de Bordeaux play 3-3 tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Sylvain Wiltord showed his scoring
qualities as he helped Girondins de Bordeaux to a 3-3 draw against
hosts Grasshoppers of Zurich in a thrilling UEFA Cup third round
match Tuesday.
	   Wiltord took advantage of the Zurich team's sloppiness on the
icy pitch to shoot Bordeaux into the lead in the sixth minute.
Johan Micoud made it 2-0 in the 20th minute.
	   But then Grasshoppers woke up with a goal by Mikhail
Kavelashvili just one minute later.
	   Forward Kubilay Tuerkyilmaz, who has been plagued by injury and
his own touchy temperament, scored for 2-2 in the 33rd minute.
	   Tuerkyilmaz set up Grasshoppers' third goal in the 53rd minute,
when Alexandre Comissetti scored an acrobatic goal after a goal
mouth muddle and suspected hand ball.
	   Capping a superb performance, Wiltord demonstrated why he is the
top scorer in the French league with a stylish 3-3 equalizer in the
73rd minute.
	   Grasshoppers advanced to the third round by default after
Fiorentina was kicked out of this season's cup after an Italian
spectator hurled an explosive device on to the pitch and injured a
match official.
	   The Zurich underdog considered itself unlucky not to emerge from
Tuesday's match with a clear win. Tuerkyilmaz and substitute
Patrick De Napoli both hit the bar on what should have been easy
goals.
	   It will now be an uphill struggle for Grasshoppers to overcome
the Bordeaux home advantage in the second leg and advance past the
team which is currently second in the French league standings.
	   Only 7,200 fans braved the icy weather to watch the match.

Saudi Arabia, Yemen reach agreements on easing tensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Uneasy neighbors Saudi Arabia and Yemen have
agreed to prevent hostile political activities and media campaigns
against each other, officials said Tuesday.
	   The two countries also agreed on the need to implement a
tentative border agreement signed in 1995, said the Yemeni
officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   They gave no details of the agreements. Saudi officials also
were not immediately available for comment.
	   Officials said the agreements were reached during the visit of
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz. He ended his
two-day visit Tuesday after meeting with President Ali Abdullah
Saleh.
	   The agreements could help ease tensions between the two
countries whose troops have often engaged in skirmishes along the
2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with
potentially lucrative oil fields. The two nations have yet to
demarcate a mountainous border in the east.
	   Border talks have been stalled since four months and Yemen is
frustrated by the lack of progress and has said it will consider
seeking international arbitration.
	   Yemen accuses Saudi Arabia of helping finance its exiled
opposition and of being behind a series of explosions in the
southern port city of Aden last year. Yemen also claims that a
number of men implicated in an assassination attempt against Arab
last year are hiding out in Saudi Arabia.
	   For its part, Saudi Arabia accuses Yemen of allowing arms and
drugs to be smuggled through its borders to Saudi Arabia, the
official said.

Monaco draws 2-2 with Marseille in stormy first leg match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) - Monaco twice came from behind Wednesday to secure
a 2-2 draw against Marseille in the first ever UEFA Cup match
between two French teams.
	   But it was Belgian referee Amand Ancion who was at the center of
attention, sending off Marseille's Florian Maurice and Monaco's
Franck Dumas for innocuous challenges.
	   Robert Pires opened the scoring in the tenth minute of the third
round, first leg game, after poor defending from Monaco.
	   Maurice collected a misplaced pass from Dumas near Monaco's
right corner flag and set up Pires who fired impressively past
Fabien Barthez from 15 yards (meters).
	   Marseille was in total domination until Ancion made his first
controversial decision of the night, awarding a penalty to the home
side in the 17th minute penalty.
	   Ancion harshly penalized Laurent Blanc for holding Victor
Ikpeba, and David Trezeguet made no mistake from the penalty spot.
	   A 38th minute strike from Tita Camara gave Marseille the lead
for a second time, after more errors from the Monaco back line.
	   Two Monaco defenders failed to head out a long kick from
goalkeeper Stephane Porato and the ball found its way through to
Camara, who fired through the legs of Barthez from the edge of the
penalty area.
	   The impressive Ludovic Giuly scored a brilliant 57th minute
equalizer with a 20 yard (meter) strike past Porato, a player sold
by Monaco to Marseille at the start of the season.
	   Maurice was shown his second yellow card in the 63rd minute
after sliding to stop a Barthez clearance, but making minimal
contact.
	   The Marseille striker had been shown a yellow card for a
innocuous seventh minute tackle.
	   Six minutes later, Dumas was ordered off after remonstrating
with Camara, who had lunged dangerously at Barthez.
	   The second red card sparked more angry scenes between the
players.
	   Monaco and Marseille have shared several bruising encounters in
recent years, with 31 yellow cards and three sendings off in the
previous six meetings between the two teams.

Council takes up documents issue

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with detailed letters to and from
Iraq, the Security Council met Tuesday for their first in-depth
discussion of Baghdad's reluctance to hand over documents sought by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector.
	   Richard Butler was attending the meeting as well, but it wasn't
known if he would be pressed to explain his requests.
	   Last week, he sent Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz three
letters seeking papers _ personal diaries, official memos and
minutes from meetings among others _ in one of the first tests of
Iraq's pledge to resume full cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   Baghdad has balked at turning over the papers, arguing in three
separate letters that they don't exist, were already shown to
inspectors or had no relevance to the work of Butler's U.N. Special
Commission, responsible for disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The council won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until inspectors report that Baghdad's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and missiles have been destroyed.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said military
airstrikes are still an option, U.S. officials seem willing to wait
to assess the full scope of Iraq's cooperation before deciding how
to proceed.
	   ``As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have no doubts at all that
these are important documents, and we would hope and expect that
the Iraqis would cooperate and supply them,'' Deputy U.S.
Ambassador Peter Burleigh said Monday.
	   He rejected suggestions that Butler may have asked for too much,
too soon from Iraq, which only narrowly avoided U.S. and British
airstrikes by agreeing on Nov. 14 to reverse its decision and
resume cooperation with inspectors.
	   ``I am both personally and officially sure that UNSCOM wouldn't
have asked for documents that it didn't need, that weren't
important to its work in verifying the disarmament process in
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Other council members, however, said they would try to use the
meeting to determine whether Butler's requests, and Baghdad's
responses were appropriate.
	   ``We want to make sure that what we are discussing is based on
fact,'' said Sergey Lavrov of Russia, which generally takes a more
sympathetic line towards Iraq.
	   The council has promised Iraq a review of its efforts to
dismantle the weapons programs _ which Baghdad hopes will ease
sanctions _ but has said it will only do so after inspectors report
that they have received full cooperation in their work.

Jewish group nominates Jordan's king for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A leading Jewish fraternal organization has
nominated Jordan's King Hussein for the Nobel Peace Prize for his
assistance during the Wye Plantation talks that led to an
Israeli-Palestinian accord.
	   Hussein's ``personal participation ... was instrumental in the
success'' of the October talks at Wye River, B'nai B'rith
International president Richard Heideman said in a letter to the
Nobel Committee, a statement by the group said.
	   The statement, issued by the group's office in Washington D.C.,
was received by The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The Wye talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat led to the accord on Israeli
troops withdrawal from more West Bank land in exchange for
Palestinian efforts to crack down on terrorists.
	   ``The king's involvement, by itself, would merit this
nomination,'' Heideman said in the letter.
	   Hussein left the Mayo Clinic, where he is undergoing cancer
treatment, to push forward the talks at a moment when they appeared
on the verge of collapsing.
	   ``As perhaps the one person with sufficient trust and respect of
the parties to guide them to an agreement they might not otherwise
have reached, he was indispensable,'' Heideman said.
	   Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, making Jordan
the second Arab country after Egypt to make peace with Israel.
	   The 1978 Camp David Accords that led to the Israel-Egypt peace
treaty earned the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize for the then leaders of
the two countries, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat.
	   Late former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel shared the
1994 Nobel Peace Prize with his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and
Arafat for reaching the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accords in Oslo.

Rangers 1, Parma 1 in UEFA Cup third-round first-leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Colin Hendry saved his own net and then
fed teammate Rod Wallace for the equalizer in a hard-fought 1-1
draw between Rangers and Parma in a third-round first-leg game of
the UEFA Cup match Tuesday night.
	   The Scottish team, which fell behind on a 51st minute goal by
Argentine veteran striker Abel Balbo, fought back, tied the score
in the 68th and missed the game winner with Gordon Durie in injury
time.
	   The draw, in the sold-out Ilbrox park, left unchanged qualifying
chances of both teams for the Dec. 8 second-leg at Parma.
	   Balbo put the Italian team in front kicking in from a few meters
a ball lost by Finnish keeper Antti Niemi on a powerful drive by
the other Argentine forward of Parma, Hernan Crespo.
	   It was an all-Argentine combination, started by midfielder Juan
Sebastian Veron.
	   Crespo had the opportunity to make it 2-0 seven minutes later
but Hendry managed to clear the ball from the netline as the young
Argentine prepared to kick into the empty net.
	   In the action, Hendry bruised his chest hitting the post.
	   However he did not show any pain ten minutes later as he jumped
higher than two Parma defenders and headed a perfect pass for
Wallace who kicked in from a few meters.
	   As Parma faded out, Rangers attacked furiously in the last 20
minutes.
	   Durie, a second half substitute, headed past the bar from a few
meters a perfect cross from Argentine teammate Gabriel Amato in the
91st.
	   And it was up to keeper Niemi to save Rangers net with a
spectacular dive, in the 92nd, on a short-range shot by midfielder
Stefano Fiore.
	   Hendry and Jorg Albertz were the best men on the Scottish side
while French world champion Lilian Thuram made decisive defensive
moves for Parma.

Portuguese riot police break up protest by pig farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Riot police used water cannon, horses
and dogs Tuesday to break up a demonstration by dozens of
protesting pig farmers who had blockaded a road in a rural town,
according to news reports. One farmer reportedly was injured.
	   About 50 police advanced under a barrage of stones and bottles
to clear the road at Rio Maior, about 60 kilometers (36 miles)
north of Lisbon, television station TV Independente reported from
the town.
	   A protesting farmer was knocked unconscious and was taken away
by ambulance,. It was not clear how he was injured, TV Independente
said.
	   Television pictures showed riot police with shields and batons
advancing across a roadblock of boulders and small fires to
disperse the farmers shortly after nightfall.
	   The farmers spent most of the day in the town where they
gathered to protest falling pork prices.
	   In recent weeks, the farmers have released piglets in the center
of major cities to pressure the government into giving them more
financial aid.

Brazil court to reconsider kidnappers' sentence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian court will again
consider reducing the sentences of eight convicted kidnappers in a
bid to end a hunger strike.
	   Ten justices of the Sao Paulo criminal court agreed Tuesday to
reconsider 26-to-28-year sentences of five Chileans, two Argentines
and a Brazilian imprisoned since 1989 for the kidnapping of Abilio
Diniz, a supermarket magnate, human rights activist Breno Altman
said.
	   Last Friday, two Canadians who belonged to the group, David
Spencer and Christine Lamont, took advantage of a prisoner transfer
treaty between Canada and Brazil and were flown to a Vancouver
prison.
	   The Sao Paulo court agreed to reconsider the sentences last
April after the kidnappers went on a 16-day hunger strike. But a
lack of movement on the mattter led the kidnappers to re-start the
hunger strike eight days ago.
	   The prisoners' lawyers want the court to reduce the sentences to
8 years, the original time given the five Chileans in 1990 before
being increased the next year to the the maximum penalty by an
appellate court. The five would then be expelled from Brazil since
they have completed their time.
	   Although the other three _ two Argentines and a Brazilian _ were
originally sentenced to between 12-to-15 years, they would not
accept anything more than eight years, and would continue to drink
only water.
	   ``Only their immediate release can stop the hunger strike,''
said Altman, president of the Sao Paulo-based Committee to Free
Political Prisoners.
	   Chilean Maria Emilia Marchi was transferred Tuesday to Sao
Paulo's Mandaqui hospital, suffering from a high fever and a
urinary tract infection. The health of the others has also
deteriorated, according to prison physician Ricardo Cypriani.
	   Prison authorities have placed the mattresses of the weakest
inmates on the floor for fear they will fall out of bed. All have
lost considerable weight.
	   At their trial, the kidnappers claimed to be political prisoners
since they belonged to a leftist group that wanted to funnel the
dlrs 30 million ransomto Salvadoran guerrillas, who were then
waging war against that nation's right-wing government.
	   Diniz was held hostage for six days in an underground cell
before police freed him unharmed.
	   Officials from the Argentine and Chilean consulates visited the
inmates this week, pleading with them to end the hunger strike and
wait for Brazilian authorities to resolve their case.

Parties fail to agree on unity candidate to defeat former coup
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan political parties have
failed to agree on a unity candidate who could defeat a former coup
plotter now leading all polls for next month's presidential
elections, a top party official confirmed Tuesday.
	   A unity candidate ``hasn't been possible due to individualism
and conflicting personalities,'' Donald Ramirez, secretary-general
of the Social Christian COPEI Party, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   The failure will probably amount to yet another boost for Hugo
Chavez, the populist former coup leader whose Patriotic Pole
coalition won a plurality of Venezuela's bicameral legislature in
Nov. 8 regional elections. Chavez is also the front-runner in the
Dec. 6 presidential race.
	   COPEI and its presidential candidate, former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, began talks on Nov. 16 with candidates, parties, businessmen
and the Catholic Church about creating a united front _ a so-called
Democratic Pole _ to oppose Chavez's Patriotic Pole.
	   The idea was to ``strengthen ourselves in order to defend
democracy, institutions and our freedom,'' Ramirez said.
	   Chavez led an unsuccessful military revolt against the
government in 1992. His candidacy has polarized Venezuela between
the poor who see him as a hero and the wealthy establishment that
fears he will impose a dictatorship and roll back free-market
economic reforms.
	   Ramirez did not offer any specific reasons for the failure to
agree, but acknowledged that one factor was the insistence by by
the presidential candidate of the center-left Democratic Action
Party, Luis Alfaro, that he be the unity candidate.
	   Yale-trained businessman Henrique Salas is in second place in
the polls. An independent, he has refused to join forces with COPEI
and Democratic Action, apparently fearing association with
discredited political parties could hurt his candidacy.
	   Saez, the former beauty queen, has gone from first place in the
polls to fourth in recent months.

 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Surrounded by pageantry, Queen Elizabeth II opened
a new session of Parliament on Tuesday with a starkly untraditional
announcement: The government plans to strip unelected aristocrats
of their 600-year-old birthright to vote in the House of Lords.
	   Rows of lords in ermine-collared scarlet robes broke with
another tradition after the announcement, when instead of listening
to the monarch in silence they let out muted growls.
	   Elected lawmakers of the House of Commons who clustered behind
the Lords chamber also violated the tradition with occasional
cheers.
	   The move is part of a legislative program for the coming year
that the queen, reading out a speech written by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government, described as focusing ``upon the
modernization of the country.''
	   Well, a bit of modernization.
	   With Her Majesty's assent, for example, the Lord Chancellor _
the country's chief judicial officer _ turned his back on the queen
and walked away after handing her the government's speech, instead
of shuffling backward. And a handful of quaintly named officials,
such as Silver Stick in Waiting and Maltravers Herald
Extraordinary, were absent.
	   But much of the elaborate show was right on track.
	   The queen rode from Buckingham Palace with her husband, Prince
Philip, in a horse-drawn carriage escorted by a cavalry regiment in
scarlet and gold tunics astride magnificent horses.
	   An official called Black Rod, in knee breeches and stockings,
summoned the commoners to the chamber to hear the queen. And even
though the Lord Chancellor thought it all right to turn his back,
others inched backward ahead of the queen.
	   The legislative program she read out _ the second since Labor
swept the long-ruling Conservative Party from office 19 months ago
_ also included a shakeup of welfare benefits designed to make
things tougher for the work-shy, a reform of legal funding and
greater protection for rape victims.
	   But one item promises to provoke the most debate.
	   ``A bill will be introduced to remove the right of hereditary
peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords,'' the queen intoned.
``It will be the first stage of a process of reform to make the
House of Lords more democratic and representative.''
	   The House of Lords, which revises and examines government
legislation, is composed of lords who inherited their titles, and
life peers, who are awarded titles.
	   The elected House of Commons has the power to pass legislation
even if the House of Lords rejects it, but the nobles can stretch
out the process, stalling bills for months.
	   Critics charge that Blair is wrong to remove the often
independent-minded blue bloods before setting up a new arrangement.
A commission is due to report within two years on a new version of
the chamber.
	   ``He wants to create a House of Cronies, beholden to him
alone,'' Conservative Party leader William Hague jeered at Blair in
the Commons later Tuesday.
	   Some blue bloods prepared for a filibuster in the chamber, which
could delay the legislation for up to a year.
	   ``It is exceedingly easy to bung up the system,'' said the Earl
of Onslow, whose family motto is ``Quick without Impetuosity.''
	   ``I am happy to go to this sort of extent and length to make
sure that what comes after me is better and can act as a check,''
he said.''

Death row inmates apply for stay of execution in Jamaica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Two convicted killers on Tuesday asked
Jamaica's highest court to block their imminent hangings, claiming
their cases are still being heard by international tribunals.
	   Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine are scheduled for the gallows on
Thursday. Blaine was convicted of killing a golf consultant in
1992; Daley was convicted of killing three people the same year.
	   They claim their appeals to the Interamerican Human Rights
Commission, a tribunal organized by the Organization of American
States, have not been decided yet.
	   Jamaica and Trinidad have said they plan to withdraw from the
human rights agreement that gives prisoners the right to appeal to
the commission. Jamaica has meantime placed a six-month limit on
death row appeals to international bodies.
	   Former British colonies in the Caribbean are increasingly
resisting pressure from Britain to eliminate the death penalty.
	   Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana have led efforts to form
their own supreme court and sever ties to the British Privy
Council, the final authority in criminal cases for most of the
English-speaking Caribbean.
	   In 1993, the Privy Council ruled it is inhumane to keep
prisoners on death row for more than five years, effectively
overturning the death sentences of dozens of convicts.
	   Caribbean countries say they need to preserve the death penalty
because it deters crime linked to drug trafficking through the
region.
	   The two men, together with Milton Montaque _ who is scheduled to
be hanged Dec. 1, _ have been held in the death row cell at St.
Catherine Adult Correctional Center for the last 10 days awaiting
execution.
	   The Bahamas hanged two men on Oct. 15, its first executions in
12 years. St. Kitts and Nevis executed its first prisoner since
1985 on July 20.

Peru's Fujimori keeps mystery around re-election plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Venezuelan President Alberto Fujimori said
Tuesday that he has yet to decide whether he will run for a third
consecutive term in office _ a possibility that has triggered a
bitter constitutional debate.
	   Fujimori was responding to reports that members of his family
had said he would not run again in 2000.
	   ``My family members cannot detect my thoughts because there is
no such thing as a thought detector,'' Fujimori told reporters. ``I
have not decided anything.''
	   Peru's 1993 Constitution prohibits the president from running
for three consecutive terms, but the government-controlled Congress
has passed legislation circumventing the apparent constitutional
ban on his candidacy.
	   That move has been decried by opposition legislators as a
blatant attempt to keep the road open for a possible re-election
bid.
	   A November poll by the company Apoyo showed that Fujimori's
approval rating has fallen to 32 percent, one of its lowest points
in his eight-year tenure as president. The poll had a margin of
error of 3.1 percent.
	   Caretas, Peru's leading newsmagazine, speculated last week that
the low public support and Fujimori's health made it unlikely he
would run again.
	   The magazine said a May 1997 operation for a benign tumor in
Fujimori's mouth had failed to catch the growth and it had become
malignant.
	   Caretas gave no source for the information, but rumors about
Fujimori's failing health have circulated for months.
	   Fujimori was elected as a political outsider in 1990 and
re-elected in a landslide in 1995.

Do the math: World Ranking important in new world of golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Every Monday morning, Tony Greer arrives
at his London office and spends the next two hours crunching
numbers for a ranking system that can be even more baffling than
the Bowl Championship Series.
	   Not everyone agrees with the Official World Golf Ranking. A safe
bet is that even fewer understand it.
	   ``It is complicated,'' Greer said Tuesday. ``But it really
isn't, once you know how it works.''
	   It may be time for players to take a crash course.
	   Because as golf becomes more global, and as more major
tournaments start relying on the rankings to issue invitations or
exemptions, the OWGR will become as meaningful to them as the BCS
has become to Kansas State.
	   For the first time this year, the U.S. Golf Association created
a new exemption for the U.S. Open by taking the top 20 in the world
rankings. That's how Tom Watson made it back to The Olympic Club,
even if he didn't make it to the weekend.
	   On Monday, Augusta National gave the rankings even more
credibility when it announced the top 50 in the world at the end of
the year would be invited to the Masters.
	   ``Excellent idea,'' said Greer.
	   Greg Norman (No. 15) couldn't agree more.
	   The Masters was the final piece to Greer's own Grand Slam. The
British Open has exempted the top 50 in the rankings for years, and
Greer suspects the PGA Championship has been using the rankings to
invite international players for the past five years.
	   ``It's amazing how many use them at the moment,'' Greer said.
	   It probably is no coincidence, either, considering that
representatives of all major championships and the five PGA tours
endorsed the Official World Golf Ranking at a meeting in Turnberry,
Scotland in the summer of 1997.
	   When the World Golf Championships start next year, the ranking
will largely determine which players get a crack at the dlrs 1
million winner's check in the three world events.
	   That series starts in February with the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship at La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, California,
where the field of 64 will be based solely on the world ranking.
	   ``I'm already having queries from players who are around the 64
mark, wanting to know what they've got to do,'' Greer said.
	   One call came from Andrew Coltart of Scotland, who wanted to
take the winter off because he's getting married. Because he's No.
63 by the slimmest of margins, a less elaborate honeymoon may be in
order if he wants to be at La Costa.
	   Twice this year, Greer has explained to Nick Faldo's manager
exactly what the three-time Masters and British Open champion has
to do to get back into the top 64. Faldo is currently No. 66,
although he can improve by the end of the year even without playing
another event.
	   Greer is the manager of the Official World Golf Ranking for
International Management Group, which developed the formula in
1968, went public in 1986 with Sony as the sponsor, then sold the
golfing powers on it during the Turnberry meeting.
	   It has been tweaked over the years _ the biggest change was
rating performance over two years instead of three _ but is no less
complicated.
	   Points count in a rolling, 52-week cycle and count double for
the current year.
	   The four majors are worth 50 points for the winner, 30 for
second place, 20 for third, on down to one point for 43rd place and
everyone who makes the cut.
	   Points for other tournaments are decided by how many of the top
100 players are in the field. So a tournament like the Bay Hill
Invitational, traditionally one of the stronger fields on the
strongest tour in golf, will be worth substantially more than the
Portuguese Open.
	   And if a field is particularly weak, points may only be awarded
to the top 10 finishers.
	   Bonus points are awarded to a tournament that has the top 30
money-winners on its respective tour in the field. Also, each tour
has its own flagship event worth a minimum amount of points: The
Players Championship (40), the Volvo Masters (32), the Australian
and Japan Open (16).
	   Those are simply the guidelines. Leave the calculations to
Greer. He can explain why Jumbo Ozaki (No. 13), who rarely plays
outside of Japan, is still ranked higher than Justin Leonard (No.
16), and why Norman is still in the top 15 without having played
golf for seven months.
	   No matter. The Masters invitation will be in the mail.

Netanyahu tries to woo defector back to his government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES report Netanyahu delaying Swiss trip, graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move to broaden support for peace within
his crumbling hard-line coalition, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu tried to woo a moderate defector back into his Cabinet
Tuesday.
	   Stacked with staunch right-wingers who oppose ceding
war-captured land to the Palestinians, the Cabinet narrowly
approved the latest Mideast land-for-peace peace accord and a
minority of the ministers voted for the deal in parliament.
	   It was only with the help of dovish opposition parties that the
peace agreement was approved and Netanyahu's government remained in
tact.
	   But facing no-confidence motions on tricky budgetary legislation
in December, the return of former foreign minister David Levy _ and
the five parliament seats he controls _ to Netanyahu's pack would
bolster his majority and help ensure a smooth ride through the
Knesset and into the new year.
	   Asked if Levy was about to rejoin the government, Netanyahu said
Tuesday, ``that possibility exists. I hope that it will also be
practical. That is why the contacts are taking place.''
	   Levy, a moderate who leads the small Gesher party, resigned from
government in January over the premier's peace policies. At the
time, negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians had been
frozen for nearly a year. Levy described the government as being
``on a flight to nowhere.''
	   Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast
accord last month, the government looked more appealing.
	   ``Now that the government is taking the political course that I
demanded ... we in Gesher will convene and decide,'' he told
Channel Two TV.
	   Negotiations for Levy's return were expected to continue into
the night Tuesday and Israel radio said Netanyahu may delay his
departure to Switerland for an official visit Wednesday by several
hours.
	   Gesher was expected to vote Wednesday morning to rejoin the
coalition.
	   Netanyahu has reportedly offered Levy the Ministry for National
Infrastructure, vacated after Ariel Sharon filled Levy's spot at

Celta sinks Liverpool 3-1 in UEFA cup third round first leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIGO, Spain (AP) _ A goal by Bosnian Vladimir Gudlej two minutes
into injury time helped modest Spanish side Celta outclass troubled
English powerhouse Liverpool 3-1 in the first leg of the UEFA cup
third round Tuesday.
	   Liverpool looked dangerous in the opening quarter and took the
lead when ace 20-year-old forward Michael Owen slotted outran three
Celta defenders to take a lobbing pass from the midfield by David
Thompson. Owen then raced into the box and from 12 yards fired the
ball home.
	   The England World Cup star had almost scored 10 minutes earlier
in a similar move but sent the ball wide.
	   Celta's Bulgarian forward Luboslav Penev came close to scoring
for the homeside in the 17th minute when his thunderbolt free-kick
from the edge of the box grazed the crossbar.
	   Moments later Liverpool 'keeper David James was hard pushed to
finger away a header from one of his own defenders following a
corner kick, but by the break, Liverpool looked to be comfortably
in control.
	   Celta came out somewhat stronger in the second half and in the
48th minute got a deserved equalizer when Russian midfielder
Alexandre Mostovoi pummeled the ball home from 12 yards (meters)
after receiving a headed back-pass from Juan Sanchez on the edge of
the six-yard (meter) area.
	   Nine minutes later Estonian Valeri Karpin slammed home Celta's
second from 11 yards (meters) after Liverpool's Norwegian defender
Vegard Heggem fumbled a clearance from a corner kick.
	   Celta's Sanchez and Mostovoi came close to scoring again with
two shots and header in the final 20 minutes with Liverpool in
total disarray and rarely able to get the ball into the opponent's
half.
	   Gudelj, who substituted Penev in the 82nd minute, sealed the 3-1
victory when he made the most of the confusion among three
Liverpool defenders trying to clear the ball out only to see the
Bosnian drive it home two minutes into injury time.
	   Celta, playing for the first time ever in Europe, eliminated
England's Aston Villa in the second round. The side lies No.2 in
the Spanish first division ahead of giants Real Madrid and FC
Barcelona.
	   Liverpool, which has won six European trophies, is going through
a rough patch in recent months as the recent resignation of
assistant coach Roy Evans demonstrated. On Tuesday it was without
key players Steve McManaman, through injury, and Paul Ince for
suspension.

Golf companies gather under one roof

<TEXT>
	   ST. AUGUSTINE, Florida (AP) _ Except for the putting green with
water hazards, the 60 television monitors and aisles that look more
like cart paths, the PGA Tour Stop would seem like any other
department store.
	   It doesn't take long to realize that it's not.
	   Inside the two-story building that sits across from the World
Golf Hall of Fame is an electronic leaderboard that gives
up-to-minute results of tournaments halfway around the globe.
	   Three miniature replicas of famous golf holes are set in the
tile and covered by a thick slab of glass on the ground floor,
where clothing lines such as Liz Claiborne, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger
and Polo have their own departments.
	   The Titleist department is on the second floor, complete with
the bags of touring pros David Duval and Dottie Pepper _ hers has
the picture of a chow stitched in gold. Across the way and out the
patio door are five driving stations, where shoppers can try out
equipment from Callaway, Taylor Made, Ping and other major
manufacturers.
	   Any questions? Meet Kevin Perrigo, one of the employees. He can
tell you the difference between graphite and steel, custom-fit you
for clubs and then provide swing tips you can only get from a
teaching pro _ because he is one.
	   Clearly, this is no ordinary department store.
	   ``It's like a PGA merchandise show that's open for 365 days a
year,'' said Perrigo, one of two Class A teaching pros on staff.
``Only here, you can actually buy things.''
	   That's what the PGA Tour had in mind when it licensed W.C.
Bradley Co. to run its first retail store, a shrine to shopping in
the World Golf Village.
	   ``I've tried to describe it as the ultimate retail experience
for golfers and non-golfers alike,'' said Chris Martin, executive
vice president of W.C. Bradley. ``What we want to do is create an
entertaining and educational environmental with the highest line of
qualify products you could ever find under one roof.''
	   The Tour Stop brings together every major company that sells
golf goods _ clothing, clubs, shoes, balls, books, furniture,
paintings, video games, bags _ all under one very large roof.
	   The store at the World Golf Village is the flagship. Others are
planned in either major markets (New York, Chicago) or golf markets
(Las Vegas, Palm Springs).
	   ``Most of the golf manufacturers are not retailers,'' said Leo
McCullagh, vice president of retail licensing and consumer
marketing for the PGA Tour. ``They didn't want to have to operate
this, so part of our mission was to find somebody who would operate
for them and allow them a chance to do their branding.''
	   That goes for the PGA Tour, as well, which is on a
brand-building mission. Retail is simply one more way to bring
people into golf, whether through fashion or furniture, video games
or paintings that come with authentic scorecards signed by a
tournament champion.
	   ``The more people we can touch and have associated with our
sport, the more people we're attracting to the game,'' McCullagh
said.
	   For the most part, apparel can be found among the lower level.
Ashworth, Cutter and Buck and Izod Club are divided into ``concept
shops,'' where each has its own identity.
	   The most popular department belongs to FootJoy, which has a
three-dimensional, computerized Laser Fitting System that can't be
found in any other store in the world.
	   ``I think it's worked out terrific,'' said Christine Kasper,
public relations and advertising director for the Greg Norman
Collection, which occupies one of the prime corner locations in the
Tour Stop.
	   ``You would think with so many vendors it would look kind of
choppy, but everyone is able to keep within their brand identity,''
she said. ``If it was just a shop and no one had any identity, it
would just be a lot of stuff. This is laid out in a smart way.''
	   Upstairs are the equipment manufacturers. Titleist, Ping,
Callaway and Taylor Made anchor the four corners, with Orlimar and
Adams fairway metals, Cleveland wedges and Cobra among those with
sections linking it all together.
	   ``Golf has always been five to 10 years behind other products,''
said Steve Bostwick, the marketing product manager for Ping. ``It
has finally reached where it should be in merchandising.''
	   Finding something to buy is not a problem; neither is finding
something to do.
	   W.C. Bradley, a Georgia company that has been privately owned
for 113 years, thinks customers must be not only educated on the
goods available but also entertained.
	   ``The whole idea was to get someone in there and to stay in our
store for more than 15 minutes,'' Martin said. ``And to do that
with a wide variety of shopping. We have the putting green,
interactive areas where people can play the video games, the club
demonstration area.''
	   The store has only been open 10 days, but Martin already has
surveyed some shoppers from the minute they walked in the door to
the minute they walked out _ two hours later.
	   ``I think we're accomplishing what we wanted,'' he said.

Conference urges speedy elimination of ozone-depleting chemicals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Environmentalists and government ministers
from 130 countries Tuesday called for boosting global efforts to
reverse the destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer.
	   Ending a six-day meeting, the participants issued a statement
that also called on developing countries to speed up preparation,
approval and completion of projects to phase out environmentally
harmful substances.
	   The Cairo meeting comes just weeks after scientists reported the
largest ever recorded ozone hole over Antarctic _ covering 26
million square kilometers (10.4 million square miles) _ is at its
widest, an area larger than North America.
	   The high-altitude natural ozone forms a barrier against
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Excessive levels of UV
radiation cause skin cancer in humans and can damage many plants
and animals.
	   Fears that severe ozone depletion could spread to populated
areas of the world led to the 1989 Montreal Protocol under which
168 countries have so far agreed to reduce or eliminate
ozone-damaging chemicals.
	   The Cairo meeting, organized by the United Nations Environment
Program, was aimed at tracking the progress of the Montreal
Protocol, which according to experts is beginning to have a
positive effect.
	   ``For the first time we are seeing the emergence of an
integrated approach to the global atmosphere,'' Klaus Toepfer, UNEP
executive director was quoted as saying by the statement issued
after the Cairo meeting.
	   A U.N. assessment earlier this year said gases and other
chemicals are now entering the atmosphere at a slower rate, but it
could be 20 years before ozone levels recover noticeably. It said
they should return to their pre-1980s levels around the middle of
the next century.
	   One of the main chemicals that is damaging the ozone layer is
CFC-12, a chlorofluorocarbon once commonly used in refrigerators
and air conditioning systems.
	   The Montreal Protocol bans the production and import of CFCs in
developed countries, and has given developing nations until 2010 to
phase them out. They must start doing so next year.
	   Although CFC concentrations in the atmosphere have started to
decline, levels are rising for halon, which are no longer produced
but are still used to fight fires.
	   The Cairo statement called on all parties to develop and submit
a national or regional strategy for the management of halons,
including emissions reduction and ultimate elimination of their
use.
	   At the meeting, 10 donors pledged a special contribution of dlrs
19 million to shut down Russian CFC and halon production factories
by the year 2000, the statement said.
	   The production capacity of the Russian Federation accounts for
nearly half of the CFC capacity in the world.
	   The statement called for steps against dumping of used CFC
products in developing countries and requested pledges from
companies not to manufacture or sell any new CFC using equipment or
technology in developing countries.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorites have seized three
five-star hotels in the southeastern resort of Cancun, saying they
were owned by a major drug cartel, a Mexico City newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The newspaper Reforma said the attorney general's office had
seized the Costa Real, Porto Real and Laguna Real hotels, between
them worth almost dlrs 200 million, and said they were owned by
members of the Juarez drug-smuggling organization.
	   The attorney general's office also is investigating possible
ties between the smugglers and several high-ranking officials of
Quintana Roo state, Reforma reported.
	   The newspaper previously has published articles claiming alleged
ties between Quintana Roo Gov. Mario Villanueva and drug dealers.
It also has accused him of intimidating a U.S. consul.

Celta out classes Liverpool 3-1; Monaco, Marseille draw 2-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russian Alexandre Mostovoi, Estonian Valery Karpin
and Bosnian Vladimir Gudelj scored second-half goals Tuesday as
Spain's Celta rallied for a 3-1 win over England's Liverpool in the
third round, first leg of the UEFA Cup.
	   In the first-ever all-French UEFA Cup match, Monaco came from
behind twice against French league leaders Marseille for a 2-2
draw.
	   Spain _ like France _ with four teams in the competition had its
own national showdown as Real Sociedad upset Altetico Madrid 2-1 on
a late Atletico own-goal.
	   Two of Italy's three clubs in the competition got victories:
Roma 1-0 at home over FC Zurich and home-standing Bologna 4-1
against Spain's Betis. Parma drew 1-1 at Scotland's Rangers.
	   The two other French clubs in the UEFA Cup prospered as Bordeaux
rallied for a 3-3 draw at Swiss side Grasshoppers, and Lyon beat
Club Brugge 1-0.
	   In Vigo, Spain, Liverpool was playing its 178th European tie and
Spain's Celta only its seventh. But Celta was the class act.
Strugging Liverpool, out-played for much of the match by the
quick-passing Spanish side, took a 1-0 lead on 18-year-old Michael
Owen's breakaway goal in the 35th.
	   But Celta leveled in the 48th with perfect passing as Juan
Sanchez chipped a header to Mostovoi who scored from 12 meters
(yards). Nine minutes later, Karpin slotted home the winner from 15
meters (yards). Gudelj made it 3-1 in second-half injury time on
more poor Liverpool defending.
	   The late goal could prove crucial in the second leg in two weeks
as club bid for he quarterfinals.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco rallied twice for the 2-2 draw as
Belgian referee Amand Ancion sent off Marseille's Florian Maurice
and Monaco's Franck Dumas for innocuous challenges.
	   Robert Pires gave Marseille a 1-0 lead in the 10th, but Monaco
equalized on a 17th minute penalty by David Trezeguet after a
controversial call against Laurent Blanc. Tita Camara again gave
Marseille a 2-1 lead but Ludovic Giuly scored Monaco's equalizer in
the 57th. Maurice got his second yellow card in the 63rd. Dumas was
ordered off six minutes later for arguing a call.
	   In Rome, Francesco Totti converted a penalty in second-half
injury time to give AS Roma a 1-0 win over FC Zurich. Zurich
protested the referee's decision when Totti himself was pushed by
defender Franco Di Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to
reach a long cross in the 91st minute.
	   Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 15 games at
Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite home fans who
occasionally jeered the unimpressive play.
	   In Bologna, Italy, Russian Igor Kolyvanov scored one goal and
set up two others _ and Daniele Fontolan scored twice _ as Bologna
trounced Spain's Betis 4-1. Fontolan opened the scoring in the 26th
and Kolyvanov got his in the 52nd. Brazilian Eriberto made it 3-0
in the 58th. Midfielder Benjamin Zarandona scored Betis' only goal
in 64th, and Fontolan got his second 10 minutes later on a pass
from Kolyvanov.
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon defeated FC Brugge 1-0 despite having
Swiss striker Marco Grassi sent off in the first half. Grassi was
shown the red card in the 40th minute after striking Yugoslav
defender Milan Lesnjak. Polish defender Jacek Bak scored the vital
goal in the third minute of first-half injury time to make the
French favorites going into the second leg.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad edged Spanish rival
Atletico Madrid 2-1 when Atletico's Roberto Fresnedoso scored an
own-goal in the 85th minute after Atletico was reduced to nine men.
Juninho gave Atletico a 1-0 led in the 3rd minute on a 22-yard
(meter) shot, but Sociedad equalized seconds from half time with
Darko Kovacevic's goal. Fifteen 15 cards were shown by British
referee Graham Poll. Atletico ended with nine men on the field
midway through the second half when Italian defender Stefano Torisi
went off in the 64th and Spaniard Carlos Aguilera 10 minutes later.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Sylvain Wiltord scored in the 6th to
give Bordeaux a 1-0 lead, and then his goal in the 73rd salvaged a
3-3 draw as Grasshoppers of Zurich came from behind to take the
lead. Johan Micoud gave Bordeaux a 2-0 lead in the 20th, but
Grasshoppers equalized in the next 13 minutes from Mikhail
Kavelashvili and Kubilay Tuerkyilmaz. Alexandre Comisetti gave
Grasshoppers the 3-2 lead in the 53rd. Grasshoppers reached the
third round when Italians Fiorentina were kicked out when a fan
threw an explosive device on to the pitch in the second-round,
second-leg.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rod Wallace got the equalizer for Rangers
in a 1-1 draw with Parma. The Scots fell behind on Abel Balbo's
51st-minute goal, but evened in the 68th on Wallace's goal and then
missed a potential game winner by Gordon Durie in injury time.

OPEC under pressure, Iraq complains of low oil earnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with more details thruout, U.N. vote on Iraqi oil
sales, closing oil price in New York. EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure on OPEC to finally come up with
a way to reverse a steep slide in oil markets grew Tuesday as
prices hovered near 12-year lows.
	   Iraq complained on the eve of a meeting of OPEC ministers that
the oil slump was sharply reducing what it could earn for the
exports it is allowed under an ``oil-for-food'' deal with the
United Nations.
	   While the U.N. is allowing Iraq to sell up to dlrs 5.2 billion
of oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its people, low
prices have reduced the proceeds by about dlrs 2 billion, an
official said.
	   ``We have been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day
and exporting between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we
failed to meet our own financial ceiling,'' Faleh al-Khayat,
director-general of studies and planning in Iraq's Oil Ministry,
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We could have easily done the dlrs 5.2 billion or even more
had it not been for the drastic decline in oil prices,'' al-Khayat
said.
	   Ministers and representatives of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna on Wednesday and
prices and production levels will be the center of attention.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel has slumped by about a third
over the past year.
	   The retreat continued on world markets Tuesday.
	   In New York, light sweet crude oil for January delivery was off
33 cents at dlrs 12.12 a barrel in trading Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, sinking toward the 12-year low of dlrs 11.42
reached in June.
	   OPEC's predicament results from an untimely decision to boost
production last winter, just as demand for oil was shrinking
because of Asia's financial crisis. The resulting oil glut hammered
prices, helping consumers but hurting oil-dependent economies back
home.
	   Publicly, OPEC members have been tightlipped on solutions.
	   Arriving Tuesday afternoon, Venezuelan oil minister Dr. Erwin
Jose Arrieta said only that both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers
needed to seek out new markets.
	   ``It's a ... challenge,'' said Arrieta, whose country is widely
believed to be a key offender in overproduction, an issue expected
to figure high on the talks' agenda.
	   Possible strategies that have emerged in advance of the meeting
include trying to tighten compliance with production cuts,
introduced in June to soak up the glut; extending the cuts; cutting
further, and calling an emergency meeting of heads of state of 11
OPEC countries, an idea proposed by Algeria and supported by the
United Arab Emirates.
	   Kuwait, backed by Algeria and Libya, is pushing hard for further
cuts to the 2.6 million barrels a day agreed in June.
	   OPEC now produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million barrels a
day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts.
	   Excluding Iraq, which continues to be limited in oil sales by
U.N. sanctions, compliance overall is about 93 percent, the
International Energy Agency said in a report based on the latest
October figures.
	   However, Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia vary from quotas by 50
percent to 84 percent, analysts believe.
	   Iran questions the level the cuts should be judged from, while
Venezuela is worried at losing market share in the United States.
	   Indonesia is not a major exporter and is less closely
scrutinized.
	   Russia, which does not belong to OPEC, promised in the spring it
would cut exports. Instead local producers have pushed exports to
record volumes as oil becomes a precious source of cash amid
economic crisis, analysts say.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.
	   Iraq has stayed away from past meetings because of the U.N
restrictions that keep it from selling its oil freely. It also was
not sending a minister to the Vienna meeting.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War.
	   In a 15-0 vote Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council authorized an
additional six months of oil sales and also agreed to let Iraq buy
dlrs 300 million more in spare parts to repair its dilapidated oil
facilities.

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched
with glee Tuesday as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched
down at their new Gaza International Airport _ a concrete sign for
Palestinians that their homeland was one step closer to statehood.
	   As crew members waved the Palestinian flag from the pilot's
window of the Fokker 50, the emotional crowd began a spontaneous
celebration of dance and song set to last for days.
	   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you
are a citizen in a country,'' Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man from
Gaza City, said jubilantly.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat smiled broadly and flashed a
victory sign on the tarmac as he greeted each of the seven planes
that landed Tuesday. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of
the Palestinian state,'' he said.
	   Built with dlrs 75 million in contributions mainly from Japan,
Gaza International has one 2-mile-long (3.5-kilometer-long) runway
_ long enough to accommodate all but the biggest jumbo jets.
	   The one passenger terminal for arrivals and departures resembles
an Arabian desert palace with arches and multi-colored Moroccan
tiles and includes a VIP lounge.
	   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some
improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including those for the
control tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Tuesday's
planes were guided in by a portable control panel installed in a
van.
	   Israel, which feared a solely Palestinian-run airport would mean
enemies could land at its doorstep or smuggle weapons to the
Palestinians, held up the opening for two years over security
concerns.
	   Under the airport agreement negotiated during last month's
U.S.-sponsored Middle East summit in Maryland, Israel will continue
to control the airspace and can shut down the airport at any time.
	   With a full-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel
will pre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists, although
no Israeli will sit in the control tower or operate any area of the
airport.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an
Egypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,
including Egyptian Cabinet ministers.
	   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence
will be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses
from the planes to a security check area in the airport where they
will go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-ray
luggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security
checks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other
crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage
will be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an
additional check while Palestinian agents observe.
	   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to
Jordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza
International. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with
a fleet of three planes, including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a
Saudi prince.
	   The airport will also be the permanent home of Arafat's
presidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung
from the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat
was on hand to personally greet the planeloads of dignitaries.
	   Next month, President Bill Clinton is expected to land there too
_ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least in
Palestinian eyes
	   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the
Palestinian people. Despite the monitoring role, the airport marks
a significant loosening of the Jewish state's security grip over
the Palestinians.
	   Years of requests for Israeli permission, often denied, to
travel anywhere by land or air are slowly ending. For people in the
cramped Gaza Strip, which is surrounded by barbed-wire on three
sides and the sea on a fourth, the airport will provide the only
unfettered way out.
	   Palestinians in the West Bank still need Israeli permission to
travel across its territory to Gaza but a safe passage route in the
works will make the land journey easier.
	   For Arafat, Tuesday was a chance to share the fruits of peace
with his people. As the first plane touched down and the pilot and
copilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads, a chant of
``Allahu Akbar,'' _ God is Great _ rose from the crowd of thousands
of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join
the celebrations.
	   ``You are a beautiful sight,'' Arafat told the Palestinian crew
in the VIP lounge, lavishly decorated with deep red Oriental
carpets and wall mosaics.

Hamas wins student election at Palestinian university
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) - Militant parties who oppose peace with
Israel won student elections Tuesday at the largest of Palestinian
university.
	   In a blow to Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, Hamas and its allies
picked-up two crucial seats and now hold 42 of the 81 slots on the
student council at Al-Najah University in the West Bank city of
Nablus.
	   Fatah won 35 seats.
	   The elections are seen as a bellwether of public support in a
society devoid of local elections and which has had only one
national election in its history.
	   Hamas student leader Mohammed Khader said the victory reflects
Palestinian support for armed struggle against Israel and
opposition to Yasser Arafat and the peace process.
	   ``The Palestinian people support the Hamas choice, the Jihad
(holy war)'' he told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters.
	   Hamas also came out top in last year's election. The military
wing of the Islamic movement Hamas has claimed responsibility for
dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis.
	   The prolonged deadlock in the peace process before the latest
Mideast accord was signed last month in Washington was believed to
have eroded support for Arafat and increased support among his
opposition.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A report that a Spanish economist and his
daughter are being held by suspected supporters of former dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet was under investigation on Tuesday, officials
said.
	   Spanish officials said the family of economist Gonzalo de
Cordoba Lopez, 64, received an e-mail message from him saying he
and his daughter Ana, 23, were seized after entering northern Chile
as tourists.
	   ``We are being held until Wednesday, when the ruling in London
on Sen. Augusto Pinochet will be announced,'' read the message,
according to embassy officials. The message apparently did not
include any threats.
	   ``We have informed the Chilean authorities, who are
investigating,'' embassy spokesman Julio Rodriguez told the
Associated Press by telephone.
	   A private Spanish news agency, Europa Press, said Spanish
authorities were in constant contact with the family in Chile.
Spain's Foreign Ministry said it could ``neither nor confirm nor
deny'' a kidnapping.
	   The message was addressed to two of the economist's daughters of
who live in Chile.
	   De Cordoba and his daughter entered Chile from Bolivia last
Friday as tourists.
	   Pinochet was arrested last Oct. 16 in Britain on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon who wants to extradite him to face
charges of genocide, torture and murder.
	   The British House of Lords will rule Wednesday, the day of
Pinochet's 83rd birthday, whether state immunity must be recognized
to him.

DiMaggio marks 84th birthday in hospital amid reports of illness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio marks his
84th birthday Wednesday in a Florida hospital where he reportedly
is battling lung cancer and had a heart attack last week.
	   DiMaggio's lawyer denied reports by two television stations that
the Hall of Famer had a heart attack or is gravely ill.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said Tuesday after
TV stations in New York and Miami reported that DiMaggio's
condition had worsened. ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this
information on the television and were very upset.''
	   The first report came Monday night from WPIX in New York, which
televised New York Yankees games for 48 years before losing the
broadcast contract after last season. The station cited three
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and added that
DiMaggio had a tumor removed from his lung last month.
	   Then on Tuesday, WTVJ-TV in Miami, also citing unidentified
sources close to DiMaggio, broadcast the same report. The NBC
affiliate said it had confirmed that DiMaggio had a heart attack
and lung cancer and said he was on a ventilator.
	   Engelberg, a longtime friend who has communicated DiMaggio's
condition to the media since the baseball icon was hospitalized on
Oct. 12, responded to the reports angrily.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack,'' Engelberg said in
statement transmitted to news media. ``This is totally false and he
is not in `grave condition.' ''
	   The statement went on to say that DiMaggio had advised Engelberg
to no longer discuss his health condition with anyone other than
his doctors and his immediate family.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio will be celebrating his 84th birthday at Memorial
Hospital with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, some of
the hospital staff, his brother, Dom, myself and a few close
friends,'' Engelberg said.
	   ``Again, Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack. We were all
shocked by this false rumor.''
	   Engelberg's statement did not address the issue of lung cancer
or any surgery to remove a tumor. When DiMaggio entered the
hospital in Hollywood, Florida, the attorney said his friend was
suffering from pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had been scheduled to see
DiMaggio last week but was forced to cancel his visit. WPIX's
report said he was told DiMaggio ``probably wouldn't have
recognized him anyway.''
	   The report also said friends of DiMaggio were concerned about
who was in control of his estate, which WPIX said includes a
memorabilia fortune worth about dlrs 20 million.
	   Personnel at Memorial Regional Hospital have not provided
information on DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators have
even denied DiMaggio is a patient.

Former Argentine military junta leader detained on child kidnap
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A leader of the military junta
that ruled Argentina during the ``dirty war'' years was detained
Tuesday on child kidnapping charges, the second top official
ordered held this year.
	   Emilio Eduardo Massera, 73, a former admiral during the armed
forces' reign from 1976-83, was ordered by a federal judge to
remain in custody after a day-long court appearance in Buenos
Aires, his lawyer said.
	   Massera's lawyer Miguel Arce Aggeo denied the accusations and
said he planned to appeal. Details on the next court appearance
were not immediately available.
	   The accusations are similar to those brought earlier this year
against Jorge Videla, a former army lieutenant general who headed
the junta with Massera.
	   As chief of the military, Videla had final authority over death
squads that waged a ``dirty war'' of torture and murder against
political opponents, mainly leftists.
	   Videla is under house arrest, allowed under Argentine law for
prisoners over the age of 70.
	   Massera was responsible for the Navy Mechanics School, a
training facility converted into a clandestine torture and killing
center during the seven-year military dictatorship.
	   Both men are only now being investigated on allegations that
some children of slain dissidents were handed over to members of
the military, who then raised them.
	   The case against Massera involves the children of Patricia
Roisinblit and Cecilia Vinas, two women who disappeared in 1976
from the Buenos Aires naval facility.
	   The fate of the two women was similar to that of nearly 9,000
Argentines, according to the government, who disappeared during the
military regime's war on leftists and dissidents. Human rights
groups say the figure is closer to 30,000.
	   Cecilia Vinas' son was eventually raised by Jorge Vildoza, one
of Massera's chief assistants, until the son at age 20 took a DNA
test that helped reveal his real parents. His biological father,
Reynaldo Penin, was also among the disappeared.
	   A civilian court sentenced Massera and Videla to life in prison
in 1987 for human rights violations, but they were pardoned in 1990
by President Carlos Menem.
	   Despite the pardon, Massera has faced several legal
entanglements.
	   He was ordered in 1996 to pay dlrs 150,000 compensation to
Daniel Tarnopolsky, the sole surviving member of a family that
disappeared during the military regime. The Tarnopolskys were
abducted by members of the Navy on July 6, 1976 and never seen
again. Only Daniel, 20 at the time, was at a friend's house that
night.
	   On Dec. 3, Massera is to appear in court in a separate case
involving other children born to parents in captivity.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with detailed letters to and from
Iraq, the Security Council met Tuesday for their first in-depth
discussion of Baghdad's reluctance to hand over documents sought by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector.
	   According to his speaking notes, Richard Butler planned to
remind council members that their own resolutions grant him the
right to the documents and to note that verifying Iraq's
disarmament through documents was actually less confrontational
than intrusive inspections.
	   The speaking notes said the conditions Iraq placed on one
particular document _ an air force diary of munitions used during
the Iran-Iraq war _ were inappropriate. Iraq has said relevant
portions of the document may be viewed by inspectors only in the
presence of the U.N. envoy to Baghdad.
	   Last week, Butler sent Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz three
letters seeking papers _ personal diaries, official memos and
meeting minutes among others _ in one of the first tests of Iraq's
pledge to resume full cooperation with inspectors.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A leader of the military junta
that ruled Argentina during the ``dirty war'' years was detained
Tuesday on child kidnapping charges, the second top official
ordered held this year.
	   Emilio Eduardo Massera, 73, a former admiral during the armed
forces' reign from 1976-83, was ordered by a federal judge to
remain in custody after a day-long court appearance in Buenos
Aires, his lawyer said.
	   Massera's lawyer Miguel Arce Aggeo denied the accusations and
said he planned to appeal. Details on the next court appearance
were not immediately available.
	   The accusations are similar to those brought earlier this year
against Jorge Videla, a former army lieutenant general who headed
the junta with Massera.
	   As chief of the military, Videla had final authority over death
squads that waged a ``dirty war'' of torture and murder against
political opponents, mainly leftists.
	   Videla is under house arrest, allowed under Argentine law for
prisoners over the age of 70.
	   Massera was responsible for the Navy Mechanics School, a
training facility converted into a clandestine torture and killing
center during the seven-year military dictatorship.
	   Both men are only now being investigated on allegations that
some children of slain dissidents were handed over to members of
the military, who then raised them.
	   The case against Massera involves the children of Patricia
Roisinblit and Cecilia Vinas, two women who disappeared in 1976
from the Buenos Aires naval facility.
	   The fate of the two women was similar to that of nearly 9,000
Argentines, according to the government, who disappeared during the
military regime's war on leftists and dissidents. Human rights
groups say the figure is closer to 30,000.
	   Cecilia Vinas' son was eventually raised by Jorge Vildoza, one
of Massera's chief assistants, until the son at age 20 took a DNA
test that helped reveal his real parents. His biological father,
Reynaldo Penin, was also among the disappeared.
	   A civilian court sentenced Massera and Videla to life in prison
in 1985 for human rights violations, but they were pardoned in 1990
by President Carlos Menem.
	   Despite the pardon, Massera has faced several legal
entanglements.
	   He was ordered in 1996 to pay dlrs 150,000 compensation to
Daniel Tarnopolsky, the sole surviving member of a family that
disappeared during the military regime. The Tarnopolskys were
abducted by members of the Navy on July 6, 1976 and never seen
again. Only Daniel, 20 at the time, was at a friend's house that
night.
	   On Dec. 3, Massera is to appear in court in a separate case
involving other children born to parents in captivity.

Italian and Russian pair share lead compuslory ice dance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's short program &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Federica Faiella and Luciano Milo of
Italy were neck and neck in first place with Russian's Natalia
Romaniuta and Danil Barantsev Tuesday, following the compulsory
dances at the world junior figure skating championships.
	   Faiella and Milo, who won the silver medal at the world's last
year, led the Russian's after the Viennese waltz but dropped behind
the pair after the tango.
	   The result was encouraging for Romaniuta and Barantsev as they
finished a distant seventh a year ago when the championships were
held in New Brunswick, Canada.
	   Jamie Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, of the United
States, took third place at the early stages of this event, while
their compatriots, Melissa Gregory, 17, and James Shuford, 20,
placed eleventh.
	   Compulsory dances make up for 20 percent of the overall score.
The original dances, counting for 30 percent of the total, will
take place on Thursday, to be followed by the free skate on Friday.
	   In the men's short program, rising Russian star Ilia Klimkin
made up in artistic impression what he failed in technical elements
to maintain an overall lead, which he gained in qualifications that
counts towards 20 percent of the total score.
	   The eighteen year-old stumbled in his opening combination but
put up an outstanding display in the remaining essentials and
presentation to be aptly reward by the judges.
	   Frenchman Vincent Restencourt, the winner of the short program,
moved to second place, followed by Japan's Yosuke Takeuchi in
third. The highest placed American was Mathew Savoi, who landed
seventh position.
	   The men's free skate, which will make up the remaining 50
percent of the final score and decide the title, will take place on
Thursday.

America Online purchase of Netscape creates formidable foe to

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ America Online Inc., the computer online service
that naysayers once said would surely be crushed by Microsoft or
the Internet, emerged as a newly formidable competitor Tuesday with
its deal to buy Netscape Communications Corp.
	   The dlrs 4.21 billion merger could fundamentally alter the
balance of power on the Internet.
	   While AOL is already the world's largest Internet access and
online service provider, the deal gives the company important
advantages in its battle with Microsoft Corp. to dominate the main
Internet sites where people get information and buy goods and
services.
	   Together, Netscape's and AOL's sites reach a staggering 70
percent of all people who access the Internet, according to
NetRatings, a research firm.
	   The deal also underscores the popularity of Netscape's Navigator
software for browsing the Internet, despite the meteoric rise of
Microsoft's rival Internet Explorer _ a crucial concern in the U.S.
government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and its chairman,
Bill Gates.
	   Microsoft lawyers argued Tuesday that the AOL-Netscape deal
backed up their claim that Microsoft is simply a player in an
extremely competitive software market and not, as the government
claims, a monopolist trying to crush its rivals.
	   The merger also is a vindication for Steve Case, 40, the
boyish-looking chairman of AOL.
	   Just a few years ago, AOL was ridiculed for supplying its own
proprietary online entertainment and information to subscribers at
a time when people could get a far wider choice on the Internet.
Last year, a surge in usage across AOL's network triggered massive
bottlenecks.
	   Despite the problems, Case stuck to AOL's strategy of
mass-mailing start-up diskettes and luring tens of millions of
Americans to ``channels'' of neatly organized subject categories.
AOL also provided online users access to the Internet and set up
its own free Web site, encouraging users to buy products and
services from advertisers.
	   But Case, realizing AOL's limitations, wants to dramatically
step up his Web presence by using Netscape's Web sites and
software.
	   Case said there won't be a big change for consumers right away.
But he said eventually he plans to give AOL's 14 million
subscribers easy links to Netscape's popular NetCenter Web site, a
portal to services and information geared toward businesses.
	   AOL is expected to offer advertisers a single rate to reach
users of its proprietary online service and visitors to the
NetCenter site as well as to its existing AOL.com Internet site.
	   A second plan is to use Netscape's software to eventually create
a new AOL browser that makes it easier for people to view and
retrieve Web information. For now, however, AOL will continue to
use Microsoft's browser.
	   ``We do recognize Microsoft is a major competitor in a lot of
different areas, but we've always said we'd like to work with them
wherever it makes sense,'' Case said in an interview.
	   AOL also hopes to use Netscape's software to help advertisers
set up and manage their own Web sites.
	   AOL's stepped-up efforts could pose a big new challenge to
Microsoft's ambitious plans to expand its Web sites, currently
ranked No. 4 in number of visitors.
	   Also vulnerable is Microsoft's MSN online service, which has yet
to earn a profit.
	   ``MSN now faces a much more daunting task if it wants to
overtake AOL at any point in the future,'' said Jim Balderston, an
industry analyst with Zona Research Inc., based in Redwood City,
California.
	   AOL's expansion also could help it compete with other portal
companies such as Yahoo! Inc., and new rivals such as cable-TV and
phone companies, which hope to soon provide much higher speed
service to the Internet than AOL.
	   Netscape's purchase, in turn, is sure to speed consolidation
among smaller Web companies competing in a two-tier Web world ruled
by either AOL or Microsoft.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Parliament consists of the Sovereign,
the House of Lords and the House of Commons and is one of the
oldest representative assemblies in the world, dating from the 14th
century.
	   The House of Lords has 1,274 members, including 26 archbishops
and bishops _ known as the Lords Spiritual _ and 759 hereditary
peers and 489 life peers, who are the Lords Temporal. Life peers
are chosen by the government and are not succeeded by their heirs.
	   Peers who attend sessions _ average daily attendance is about
380 _ do not receive a salary but can claim expenses.
	   The House of Commons has 659 elected members. The government can
dissolve Parliament and call an election when it chooses, but must
do so within five years of the last general election. The party
that wins a majority forms the government. Legislators are paid
43,860 pounds (dlrs 72,400) a year plus travel and office costs
allowances
	   Legislation passed by the House of Commons and the House of
Lords becomes law when it is given Royal Assent by the monarch, who
personifies the state. In modern times, royal assent has been a
formality, as has been the monarch's reading of the government's
legislation program at the annual State Opening of Parliament.
	   The House of Lords has the power to delay bills by amending them
and returning the to the Commons for further consideration. Bills
that deal only with taxation and expenditure will become law within
one month of going to the Lords, whether they approve them or not.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with detailed letters to and from
Iraq, the Security Council met Tuesday for its first in-depth
discussion of Baghdad's reluctance to hand over documents sought by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector.
	   According to his speaking notes, top arms expert Richard Butler
was to remind council members of his right to the documents, under
their own resolutions, and note that verifying Iraq's disarmament
through documents was actually less confrontational than intrusive
inspections.
	   Russia and China, which along with France take a more
sympathetic line towards Baghdad, pressed Butler to explain how he
knows the requested documents actually exist, diplomats attending
the closed meeting said.
	   Last week, Butler sent Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz three
letters seeking papers _ personal diaries, official memos and
meeting minutes among others _ in one of the first tests of Iraq's
pledge to resume full cooperation with inspectors.
	   Baghdad has balked at turning over the papers, arguing in three
separate letters that they don't exist, were already shown to
inspectors or had no relevance to the work of Butler's U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq of its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The council won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until inspectors report that Baghdad's chemical,
biological and nuclear arms and missiles have been destroyed.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said military
airstrikes are still an option, U.S. officials seem willing to wait
to assess the full scope of Iraq's cooperation before deciding how
to proceed.
	   ``As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have no doubts at all that
these are important documents, and we would hope and expect that
the Iraqis would cooperate and supply them,'' Deputy U.S.
Ambassador Peter Burleigh said.
	   He rejected suggestions that Butler may have asked Iraq for too
much, too soon. Iraq only narrowly avoided U.S. and British
airstrikes by agreeing on Nov. 14 to reverse its decision and
resume cooperation with inspectors.
	   ``I am both personally and officially sure that UNSCOM wouldn't
have asked for documents that it didn't need, that weren't
important to its work in verifying the disarmament process in
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Other council members, however, said they would try to use the
meeting to determine whether Butler's requests, and Baghdad's
responses were appropriate.
	   ``We want to make sure that what we are discussing is based on
fact,'' said Sergey Lavrov of Russia.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, told reporters that the
council itself should decide what documents were relevant to the
work of UNSCOM.
	   ``Then the council should consider what steps to take,'' he
said.
	   Butler's speaking notes said the conditions Iraq placed on one
particular document _ an air force diary of munitions used during
the Iran-Iraq war _ were inappropriate. Iraq has said relevant
portions of the document may be viewed by inspectors only in the
presence of the U.N. envoy to Baghdad.
	   Butler cautioned against transforming the technical task of
evaluating the document into ``something of a political process by
following the procedure proposed by Iraq,'' according to the
speaking notes.
	   The council has promised Iraq a review of its efforts to
dismantle the weapons programs _ which Baghdad hopes will ease
sanctions _ but has said it will only do so after inspectors report
that they have received full cooperation in their work.

NBA cancels Christmas Day games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association informed NBC
on Tuesday that the network's Christmas Day doubleheader, featuring
the Chicago Bulls and possibly Michael Jordan, is the latest
casualty of the nearly five-month-long NBA lockout.
	   In place of the New York Knicks at the Chicago Bulls and the Los
Angeles Lakers at the Phoenix Suns doubleheader, NBC will show
Frank Capra's Christmas movie ``It's A Wonderful Life'' starring
Jimmy Stewart.
	   Unless a deal is reached soon, more of NBC's schedule will be
put in jeopardy. The network is scheduled begins its weekly
telecasts Jan. 16 with regional coverage of three games.
	   There were no talks held on day 147 of the NBA lockout, and the
next full negotiating session won't be held until Saturday.
	   NBC and Turner Sports, in the first year of a dlrs 2.64 billion,
four-year deal with the NBA, are paying rights fees to the league
during the lockout.
	   NBC probably will be reimbursed for lost games through reduced
rights fees in the final years of the contract. Turner, scheduled
to show 29 games on TNT and TBS through Christmas, will be given
additional games.

Gentle Ben says Ryder Cup matches will be fierce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ For all the talk about whether the Ryder
Cup has become too pressure-packed on the players, U.S. captain Ben
Crenshaw had a subtle message for his team Tuesday: Don't expect it
to be easy.
	   ``The matches are keenly watched by practitioners, writers,
everyone knowing that the match is going to be intense,'' Crenshaw
said at a news conference with European captain Mark James at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass, site of next year's event.
	   ``And players have to prepare themselves for that. That's why
the Ryder Cup is what it is. The players know how important it is,
and they're trying their best. If a player is going out for a
picnic, this is not it.''
	   The United States have lost the last two matches. Crenshaw was
on the 1995 team that lost at Oak Hill, only the second time it
lost on American soil.
	   ``The last few meetings, America has not done it,'' Crenshaw
said. ``That's where we feel a sense of urgency.''
	   While still 10 months away, Crenshaw offered one preview. The
rough at The Country Club might not be as high as it was at Oak
Hill, where captain Lanny Wadkins wanted it set up like a U.S.
Open. The last European to win a U.S. Open was Tony Jacklin in
1970.
	   ``I don't think that's quite conducive to match play,'' Crenshaw
said. ``You want people to take a few more chances.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SACKED AGAIN?: &LR;  David Leadbetter already has lost his most
famous client, Nick Faldo. Will Korean sensation Se Ri Pak be the
next to leave him?
	   According to this week's issue of Golf World magazine, Pak began
working with Butch Harmon last week during the LPGA Tour
Championship in Las Vegas. Harmon denied any involvement, but
sources told the magazine that an arrangement is all but finalized.
	   The biggest complaint from Pak's camp is that Leadbetter rarely
travels outside Orlando, Fla., where they both live.
	   Leadbetter was at the Tour Championship, but left after Pak shot
a 77 in the second round. The next day, the 21-year-old rookie
called Harmon.
	   ``I'm not the type of person to take somebody away from
anyone,'' Harmon said. ``She asked me to watch her hit some balls,
and out of respect to her, I said sure. ... She'd also been putting
terribly, so I watched her and suggested some things. Sometimes
change is good.''
	   Pak didn't just get swing tips from Harmon. While hitting balls
for him earlier in the week, Harmon introduced her to Tiger Woods,
who was in town. The two young stars played nine holes together and
Woods talked to her about the trappings of fame.
	   ``I just thought it was good for the two of them to talk,''
Harmon said.
	   Leadbetter could not be reached for comment. His contract with
Samsung _ Pak's sponsor _ is up at the end of the year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOVE LOST: &LR;  A strong, rested back for the Presidents Cup is
more important to Davis Love III than dlrs 1 million.
	   Love, who tweaked his back while going hard at a 3-iron in the
second round of the Shark Shootout, has withdrawn from the Million
Dollar Challenge next week in Sun City, South Africa.
	   He will be replaced by Tom Watson in the 12-man field.
	   ``He's just going to rest up for the Presidents Cup, do his
exercises and stretching,'' agent Giff Breed said. ``He's been
fighting this thing all year, and it can flare up. We're hopeful
he'll bounce back strong.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MILLION-DOLLAR PUTT: &LR;  Golf left him with permanent eye damage
and out of a job. One putt could make Al Flowers a millionaire.
	   Flowers made eight of 10 putts from 7 feet to advance to the
dlrs 2 million Gillette Putting Challenge Sunday at the Westin
Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Fla. If Flowers makes a 10-foot
(3-meter) putt, he'll win dlrs 1 million, with an additional dlrs 1
million donated to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.
	   If he misses, the 37-year-old Flowers and the Komen Foundation
each get dlrs 50,000.
	   ``This is a strange turn of events, having been injured on the
golf course and now getting this opportunity,'' said Flowers, who
lives in Virginia Beach, Va. He lost his job as a sales analyst for
a chemical company after a golf ball struck him in the right eye
and damaged his pupil.
	   No one has made the putt in the 3-year history of the
challenge.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BACK DOWN UNDER: &LR;  First the Presidents Cup, next up the
Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship. Australia is starting
to get its share of worldwide golf events.
	   The Match Play Championship, which debuts in February at La
Costa Resort in Carlsbad, California, plans to move to Australia in
2001.
	   The International Federation of Tours hopes to announce which
course in Australia in two weeks at Royal Melbourne, site of the
Presidents Cup.
	   The Andersen Match Play, the first of the World Championship of
Golf series that starts next year, features the top 64 players from
the world rankings. Prize money is set at dlrs 5 million for the
first year.

White House pledges dlrs 1 million in doping fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The White House pledged unprecedented federal
help Tuesday to fight drugs in sports, including dlrs 1 million in
research and pressure to award medals to athletes cheated by
doping.
	   In a 10-page memo to the International Olympic Committee, White
House drug czar Barry McCaffrey called for establishment of an
independent doping agency and universal adoption of uniform drug
policies, including year-round tests to ``ensure all Olympians are
drug free.''
	   ``Our position is that the Olympics must adopt a comprehensive
anti-drug program that applies 365 days of every year, to all
Olympic athletes,'' McCaffrey wrote to IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
	   He said measures must apply to both performance-enhancing drugs
such as steroids and recreational drugs such as marijuana.
	   ``We raise Olympic athletes up on international pedestals for
all the world's children to look up to as role models _ it is vital
that the message they send is drug free,'' McCaffrey said. ``The
goal of this whole effort must be to prevent Olympic medals and the
Olympic movement from being tarnished by drugs.''
	   The proposal was submitted as part of planning for a worldwide
drug summit called by the IOC for Feb. 2-4. McCaffrey will head the
U.S. government delegation to that meeting.
	   While it spends millions of dollars to fight drug abuse each
year, the White House never before has committed anywhere near dlrs
1 million to battle doping in sports.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee, which budgets more than dlrs 11
million in their own anti-drug efforts, praised McCaffrey's stand.
	   ``We're enthusiastic about the participation and the financial
commitment of the U.S. government in the international fight
against drugs in sports,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said. ``Having
the strong commitment of the executive branch is a forceful
enhancement of the USOC's efforts to detect and eradicate doping.''
	   In his memo to Samaranch, McCaffrey asked the IOC to consider
``supplemental medals'' for athletes who lost to documented acts of
drug cheating.
	   Hybl last month asked Samaranch to award duplicate gold medals
to the U.S. women's 400-meter medley swim relay team from the 1976
Summer Games, which finished second to East Germany. Recent German
court cases have revealed that one member of the gold-medal relay
squad had been helped by anabolic steroids administered secretly by
her coach.
	   McCaffrey wants to expand the USOC request.
	   ``The IOC needs to reward medals to those drug-free athletes _
not just Americans but all international athletes _ who were
deprived of their medals,'' he said.
	   Although the proposal specifically mentions only German
athletes, a spokesman for McCaffrey said that could be broadened to
any drug cases.
	   ``We wanted the door opened,'' spokesman Bob Weiner said.
	   The dlrs 1 million research program would be administered by the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, working on its own
initiatives and on requests from Olympic authorities.
	   ``We will work in consultation with the IOC and the USOC,''
Weiner said.
	   McCaffrey called the White House proposals ``comprehensive and
balanced.'' He said groundbreaking efforts were needed because drug
detectors were losing the current ``cat and mouse game'' to drug
cheats, even if estimates of doping might be inflated.
	   ``The prevailing belief that a large number of elite athletes
are doping causes athletes to believe that they cannot win without
cheating,'' he said. ``The common belief of widespread doping also
detracts from how the public perceives the games and medal
performances. A cynicism now envelopes every great victory.''
	   McCaffrey called for education and prevention programs that will
make doping as ``reviled as any other form of cheating.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraqi opposition leaders, emerging from a meeting
with a U.S. envoy on Tuesday, said that they had received the
backing of the United States for their campaign to overthrow Saddam
Hussein.
	   ``Let Saddam be on notice. The Iraqi opposition now has the
support of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. administration,'' Ahmed
Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, said after the four
hour talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
and 16 leading opposition groups ended.
	   Chalabi, whose group is the largest opposition umbrella
organization, said authorization of military funds under the United
States' Iraq Liberation Act was a ``very important new
development.'' Other opposition leaders at the meeting said their
groups, which have a reputation for being fractious and divided,
would coordinate to plan Saddam's ouster.
	   ``We are determined to come together to coordinate and
cooperate. We are very happy because we feel that the U.S. and
British governments are serious in helping the Iraqi opposition
topple Saddam Hussein,'' said Aziz Kadir-Samancchi, chairman of the
Iraqi-Turkomen Democratic Movement.
	   There was no immediate statement from the U.S. Embassy about the
meeting.
	   The Iraqi groups talked with British Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett on Monday and won support for their efforts to
indict Saddam for crimes against humanity.
	   The Iraq Liberation Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in October,
includes a dlrs 97 million aid package to support Iraqi dissidents.
	   Security analysts are skeptical about the ability of dissident
groups to overthrow Saddam, citing divisions and feuds between the
several dozen Iraqi opposition groups.
	   ``For the last eight years they have not demonstrated themselves
to be a viable alternative,'' said George Joffe, deputy director of
the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
	   Joffe said only a plot by the armed forces or the ruling Ba'ath
party would be likely to succeed.
	   ``Saddam has very effective security arrangements,'' Joffe said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched
with glee Tuesday as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched
down at their new Gaza International Airport _ a concrete sign for
Palestinians that their homeland was one step closer to statehood.
As crew members waved the Palestinian flag from the pilot's window
of the Fokker 50, the emotional crowd began a spontaneous
celebration of dance and song set to last for days. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat smiled broadly and flashed a victory sign on
the tarmac as he greeted each of the seven planes that landed
Tuesday. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the
Palestinian state,'' he said. Israel, which feared a solely
Palestinian-run airport would mean enemies could land at its
doorstep or smuggle weapons to the Palestinians, held up the
opening for two years over security concerns. (PALESTINIAN-AIRPORT)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with detailed letters to and from
Iraq, the Security Council met Tuesday for their first in-depth
discussion of Baghdad's reluctance to hand over documents sought by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector. Richard Butler planned to remind
council members that their own resolutions grant him the right to
the documents and to note that verifying Iraq's disarmament through
documents was actually less confrontational than intrusive
inspections. Hundreds of Iraqis, meanwhile, poured into the streets
Tuesday to protest eight years of U.N. sanctions, and its leaders
promised not to relent to pressure in its standoff with the United
Nations over documents on its weapons programs. The tough words
came a day after the government acknowledged an assassination
attempt on one of its most powerful officials. (UN-IRAQ; IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno declined
Tuesday to order an independent counsel investigation of Vice
President Al Gore over campaign fund raising, heading off _ for now
_ another impending scandal for the beleaguered administration. In
a 19-page court filing, she said, ``There are no reasonable grounds
to believe that further investigation is warranted'' into an
allegation that Gore lied to investigators last year about how a
Democratic media fund was financed. Officials also predict that no
counsel is likely to be named in another pending fundraising matter
involving President Bill Clinton. Gore, whose presidential
ambitions in 2000 could hinge on the outcome, has long predicted
this probe would uncover no wrongdoing on his part. (US-GORE-FUND
RAISING)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A steamrolling corruption scandal appeared
poised Wednesday to crush Turkey's government. In its wake,
lawmakers would again be left with a difficult choice: trying to
set aside feuds and build a coalition of Western-style parties or
accept an alliance with the powerful pro-Islamic bloc. Any return
of the Islamic party, now known as Virtue, is strongly opposed by
Turkey's armed forces, which sees itself as the protector of
secular principles in this mostly Muslim nation. Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz came to power nearly 17 months ago after Turkey's
first pro-Islamic government was forced out of power by the
military in what some people have dubbed a ``soft coup.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Fearing the worst, some supporters of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet are looking for an English
country mansion where he can stay in secure comfort if he has to
fight extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture. Victims of Pinochet's 1973-90 rule and human rights groups
are also nervous _ afraid that Britain's highest court will rule
Wednesday that Pinochet does indeed have immunity from arrest as a
former foreign head of state. A five-judge tribunal of the House of
Lords will deliver their findings on Pinochet's 83rd birthday in
the case that has far-reaching implications. Lawyers for Spain and
Spanish and British prosecutors appealed a High Court ruling that
Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest was illegal because as a foreign head of
state he has immunity for all actions taken during his 1973-90
rule. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks pulled back Tuesday as investors locked
in some gains from Monday's rally, which lifted the Dow to its
first record high since July. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
73.12 points _ or by 0.78 percent _ to 9,301.15, giving back a
third of Monday's 214-point gain. Broader stock indicators also
succumbed to a modest bout of profit-taking. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against most major currencies
Tuesday as confidence in the U.S. economy continued even as Wall

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pressure grew on OPEC to act to lift
sagging oil prices as prices headed to record lows in London.
Ministers from OPEC's 11 member states planned a year-end meeting
Wednesday. In Iraq, an oil official pleaded with OPEC to take
action, saying low prices had stripped about dlrs 2 billion from
the maximum dlrs 5.2 billion it is allowed to export in its current
food-for-oil deal with the United Nations. Iraq is an OPEC member
but has stayed away from past meetings because of the U.N.
restrictions that keep it from selling its oil freely. It also was
not sending a minister to the Vienna meeting. (OPEC)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Economic growth rebounded strongly over the
summer, despite overseas financial turmoil, but profits at the U.S.
corporations fell sharply. Consumers' shaken confidence recovered
this month along with the stock market. The Conference Board, a
private research organization based in New York, said its
confidence index rose 6.7 points in November to 126, partly
recouping a nearly 20-point loss over the previous four months. The
gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced
within U.S. borders, surged at a robust 3.9 percent seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the July-September quarter, the Commerce
Department said Tuesday. That was even better than the 3.3 percent
originally estimated by the department. The deterioration in the
nation's trade deficit was not as severe as first measured.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America Online will buy Netscape in a dlrs
4.21 billion deal that turns the world's largest Internet provider
into a new superpower of the high-tech industry. It also
effectively concludes Netscape's dramatic rise and fall as an
independent Internet pioneer. The agreement, announced Tuesday,
includes Sun Microsystems Inc., which will distribute Netscape's
business-level software in exchange for AOL's purchase of Sun's
powerful computers. AOL, already with more than 14 million
subscribers, becomes the distributor of Netscape's hugely popular
Internet browser software and the owner of two of the four most
popular sites on the Web. (US-AMERICA ONLINE-NETSCAPE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is still critical
of the Russian government's plans to tackle the country's economic
crisis and is reluctant to release more loans, officials said
Tuesday. Meanwhile, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank said
the bank could only provide 30 billion rubles (dlrs 1.7 billion) to
bail out the crippled banking sector. The money could save a few
hundred banks, but hundreds more are likely to fold. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has been pushing the IMF to release the
next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion aid package, saying
it is crucial to pay off huge domestic and foreign debts.

	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ International Paper will acquire Union
Camp Corp., a smaller paper and forest products company, for dlrs
4.9 billion in stock. The deal marks the continuing consolidation
of the paper industry, which has had several big mergers in recent
years as cost-conscious companies try to become more efficient and
competitive. International Paper will also assume dlrs 1.7 billion
of Union Camp's debt, giving the deal a total value of dlrs 6.6
billion. Once the merger is completed, International Paper
shareholders will own 75 percent of the combined company, while
Union Camp shareholders will own 25 percent. International Paper
has operations in 30 countries and employs more than 80,000 people.
Union Camp employs nearly 18,000 people at operations in 40
countries. (US-CANADA-BUSINESS BRIEFS)

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fresh from his successful 30th anniversary gala,
Luciano Pavarotti has agreed to sing three performances of
Puccini's ``Tosca'' at the Metropolitan Opera later this season.
	   Met general manager Joseph Volpe announced Tuesday that the
63-year-old tenor would appear as the painter Cavaradossi on March
16, 20, and 26.
	   Pavarotti, whose performances invariably sell out, was to have
sung the role three times earlier this month but canceled because
he was still recuperating from hip and knee replacement surgery.
	   The Italian superstar, considerably slimmed down and sounding in
surprisingly sturdy voice, sang fully staged acts from three
different operas at Sunday's gala.
	   At the time, he had no future commitments for staged opera
performances, but apparently he was heartened enough by his
reception to sign a contract.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Commuters are furious with Arnold
Schwarzenegger because filming for his latest movie tied up
downtown rush-hour traffic.
	   Despite the traffic, filming of ``End of Days'' on Monday was
too good a deal to refuse, said Michael Bobenko of the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which issues film permits
for the city.
	   If the city had refused, it could have lost the dlrs 100 million
movie and its cast of hundreds to New York, he said.
	   Co-producer Bill Borden didn't see what the problem was, since
the filming involved a one-way street that leads out of downtown.
	   ``Looking around here, we don't see any traffic backup at all,''
he said from the set _ hours after the morning commute.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Shock rocker Marilyn Manson has offered to pay
for all of the damage caused to the band's hotel rooms after a
weekend concert.
	   The group destroyed four rooms in the Poughkeepsie Sheraton,
burning carpets and staining sinks with hair dye, said Donna
McLean, the hotel general manager.
	   McLean said Manson immediately took responsibility and offered
to pick up the bill for the Saturday night destruction. The hotel
said it had not yet added up the bill.
	   Before the concert, the band set fire to a T-shirt and carpeting
and smashed expensive lighting equipment in the group's dressing
room at the Poughkeepsie Civic Center, the New York Post reported.
The fire was out by the time firefighters arrived.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PALM HARBOR, Florida (AP) _ A 77-year-old man with a habit of
sleepwalking awoke to find himself up to his armpits in alligators.
	   James Currens wandered behind his home early Monday and stumbled
into a pond. He woke up in several feet (more than a meter) of
water, his legs stuck in the mud.
	   He said several alligators, some longer than 3 feet (a meter),
came around. Currens said he poked at them with his cane to try to
keep them away.
	   A neighbor heard him yelling and called police, who used lights
to scare off the gators and freed Currens.
	   The retired maintenance supervisor suffered only minor cuts on
his legs and arms from the fall.
	    &UR; ___
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ An Olympic champion ice skater has left her
native Russia for Pittsburgh because she says her country's skating
program is on thin ice.
	   Elena Valova, who won the gold medal for pairs skating in the
1984 Olympics and the silver in 1988, was offered about dlrs 100 a
month to coach in her homeland of Russia. Her expected monthly
salary in the northern city of Pittsburgh could reach dlrs 10,000.
	   The 35-year-old, who is married and has a 2-year-old son, said
she couldn't afford to support her family on the Russian salary.
	   Ms. Valova also said former Soviet Union's world-class athletes
are seeing opportunities dwindle as state aid diminishes in Russia.
	   She has signed a three-year contract to become assistant
director of skating at Pittsburgh's Island Sports Center, which has
two ice rinks.
	   Ms. Valova won her medals with her skating partner and first
husband, Oleg Vasiliev.
	    &UR; ___
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Some of the millions that Bill Gates has made off
computer users are going to people who read books.
	   The Microsoft chairman and his wife, Melinda, are donating dlrs
20 million to the Seattle Public Library.
	   It's the biggest single gift ever made to a public library
system, said Rose Berg-Fosnaugh, a Gates spokeswoman.
	   About dlrs 15 million of Monday's pledge will help expand and
improve neighborhood libraries, dlrs 4 million will beef up book
collections, and dlrs 1 million will support literacy and English
language programs.
	    &UR; ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Movie costumes worn by Madonna and Leonardo
DiCaprio didn't live up to their star billing Tuesday at an auction
of Hollywood memorabilia.
	   A silk floral dress worn by Madonna in ``Evita'' went to an
unidentified buyer for dlrs 2,200. It had been expected to go for
at least dlrs 4,800 at the Bonhams auction house.
	   A shirt, tunic, breeches and coat that DiCaprio wore in ``The
Man in the Iron Mask'' were expected to bring dlrs 4,800 to dlrs
6,400. But the top bid from an unidentified American collector was
just dlrs 3,600.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW BEDFORD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Things are looking up for Ruth
the elephant, who nearly lost some of her sight three weeks ago
when she poked herself in the eye with a piece of straw.
	   Veterinarians suspect the hay was carrying a fungus, and the
7,200-pound (3,266-kilo) elephant at the Buttonwood Park zoo soon
developed an infection in her right cornea.
	   ``It scared us and it scared her, frankly. She was very
sensitive to anyone being on that side of her,'' said David Raboy,
director of zoological services.
	   Veterinary eye specialists from Tufts University were called in
and prescribed a specialized ointment, which was mixed by a
pharmacy.
	   ``This is the biggest patient I've ever had,'' said the
pharmacist, Richard Brisson.

Study: Start diabetes screening much earlier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ People should be considered for diabetes testing
beginning at age 25 _ 20 years earlier than now recommended _ to
save them from blindness, kidney failure and amputations,
government researchers say.
	   Earlier screening likely would mean earlier diagnoses and
treatment to avoid the debilitating complications of the disease,
said the researchers, led by Dr. Michael M. Engelgau of the federal
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
	   Their report was published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
	   Diabetes afflicts 16 million Americans, and at least a third of
them are unaware they have the illness, experts estimate. It is the
leading U.S. cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputations and
kills 180,000 a year.
	   Dr. Gerald Bernstein, president of the American Diabetes
Association, agrees with the study's conclusions, even though his
group recommended last year that routine screening begin at age 45
among the general population.
	   The ADA also recommends that testing be considered earlier than
age 45 among people in high-risk groups, such as non-Caucasians,
the obese and people with a family history of diabetes.
	   Bernstein said in a telephone interview Tuesday that even though
the CDC report differs from the guidelines, it is consistent with
their intent and approach.
	   ``What we are learning, unfortunately, is this is now a disease
of children,'' said Bernstein, director of diabetes management
programs at Beth Israel Health Care Systems in New York. One-fourth
of new diabetes cases among people under age 20 are now type 2, he
said.
	   Formerly called adult-onset or insulin-independent diabetes,
type 2 diabetes generally develops after age 40 and is treated only
with dietary changes and pills, though many type 2 patients now
take insulin shots.
	   Type 2 is making alarming gains among youth because of rising
childhood obesity and the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles, said
Bernstein, who was not involved in the new study.
	   ``If you can pick up type 2 diabetes in a 12-year-old or a
15-year-old and begin an intervention, you can prevent these people
from suddenly appearing with end-stage diabetes when they're 35,''
Bernstein said. ``I've seen these cases in my office.''
	   He noted that diabetes already costs about dlrs 100 billion
annually, more than heart disease, cancer or AIDS.
	   Type 2 diabetes is often preceded by obesity or other health
problems. It accounts for 95 percent of all diabetes cases. A
slow-developing disease, it occurs when the body gradually loses
its ability to use insulin properly and-or the pancreas, which
produces insulin, fails to keep up with the body's need for it.
Insulin is the hormone needed for cells to convert sugar into
energy.
	   Type 1, formerly called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent
diabetes, develops much more rapidly and usually appears suddenly
between ages 10 and 16. In type 1, the pancreatic cells that made
insulin are destroyed by the body's immune system mistakenly
attacking them.
	   The CDC researchers used a computer model to gauge the effects
that screening various age groups would have on later diabetes
complications, based on existing data about treatment.
	   The study found that routine screening of young adults _ ages 25
to 34 _ would have the best value, and the later screening began
the less disability per dollar it would prevent. Screening all
adults age 25 and up would decrease the average age at diagnosis by
nearly six years, the researchers predicted. Without such
screening, type 2 diabetes typically exists nine to 12 years before
diagnosis, they said.
	   Screening involves an inexpensive test for blood-sugar level,
which is elevated in diabetics. If the level is found to be
elevated, a second blood test is required on another day.

	   Joao Batista de Queiroz, 38, and Paulo Rogerio Garcia Barreto,
34, were each sentenced to four years in an open prison for their
part in the March 1997 beatings and shootings in a Sao Paulo slum.
	   The pair walked free because they have already completed a sixth
of the sentence in a regular Brazilian prison which, unlike an open
prison, inmates cannot leave at night.
	   An amateur cameraman captured the police violence, involving
eight officers, and it was aired on national television.
	   In October, a court convicted former police officer Otavio
Lourenco Gambra, nicknamed Rambo, in the killing of 27-year-old
mechanic Mario Jose Josinho during the violence.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Striking public sector workers
Tuesday left hospitals closed and police off the streets for a
seventh day in a Brazilian state, trade union leaders said.
	   Some 70,000 workers, unpaid since July, are refusing to work in
Espirito Santo, said Adimar Joemarais, president of the public
sector workers trade union in state capital, Vitoria.
	   State governor Vitor Buaiz, speaking on television, called the
situation ``critical''. He blamed federal government, saying it
owes the state dlrs 246 million reals (reals 293 million). No-one
at Brazil's Treasury Minister could be reached for comment.
	   Espirito Santo, a southeastern port state, has a population of
around 2.5 million people. Its capital, Vitoria, is 315 miles (509
kms) northeast of Rio.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - More than 300 non-governmental
organizations criticized a federal government plan Tuesday to make
heavy cuts in programs to protect the Amazon and Atlantic Coast
rainforests.
	   Programs to fight predatory exploitation of mahogany forests and
boost eco-tourism in the Amazon will be hit, Claudionor Alexandre
Barbosa da Silva, president of the Amazon Work Group (GTA), told
the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   The GTA, which represents 355 non-governmental organizations, is
irate over a government announcement to cut 90 percent of funding
allocated for programs.
	   The cuts are part of an austerity program to save dlrs 24
billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. It has helped Brazil
secure an International Monetary Fund rescue package of dlrs 41.5
billion.
	   Between 1978-1996, 12.5 percent of the Amazon jungle was
destroyed, mainly by farmers, ranchers and loggers. The Atlantic
Forest, which once spanned Brazil's eastern coast has been reduced
to just 3 percent of its original area.

	   NOGALES, Mexico (AP) _ Officials raised the American flag to
herald the opening of a U.S. consulate here, the first the United
States has opened along its border with Mexico for years.
	   ``This is the first consulate that we've opened in the western
hemisphere for more than 20 years, during a time in which we've
closed many,'' U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow said.
	   The facility's official opening Monday is the second U.S.
consulate in the northern Mexico state of Sonora. The other is in
Hermosillo.
	   The Nogales consulate was authorized primarily to help deal with
the U.S. government's new visa requirements for Mexican visitors.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuadoreans think that corruption is their
poor Andean nation's main problem, followed by unemployment and
poor schools, a poll released Tuesday showed.
	   The poll reflected Transparency International's 1998 corruption
rankings, placing Ecuador as one of the most corrupt countries in
the world _ 8th out of 85 countries.
	   The poll by the private company Market showed that 18.3 percent
of Ecuadoreans name corruption is the top problem, followed by
unemployment at 17.5 percent and poor education at 15.5 percent.
	   Former President Abdala Bucaram was removed from office by
Congress in 1997 for ``mental incapacity'' amid charges he looted
the state during his six-month government.
	   Market surveyed 1,600 people in Ecuador's four largest cities on
Nov .3, with a margin for error of plus or minus three percent.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Costa Rica declared a temporary
amnesty Tuesday for illegal immigrants from other Central American
countries in a bid to help those nations recovery from damage
caused by Hurricane Mitch.
	   The measure would suspend deportations of Central American
workers for six months to give them time to apply for legal working
papers or residence permits. Costa Rica was largely spared the
flooding and mudslides that the storm caused in most of the region
in early November.
	   ``With this measure, we guarantee that our Central American
brothers can work legally and have access to health and education
systems,'' said President Miguel Angel Rodriguez.
	   The amnesty applies only to those who entered Costa Rica prior
to Nov. 9, a week after the storm hit neighboring Nicaragua. An
estimated 500,000 Nicaraguans live in Costa Rica, most illegally.

Fairly strong earthquake hits northeastern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 4.9 hit parts of northeastern Japan early Wednesday
but caused no injuries or damage, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   The quake, centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) below the
ocean floor at a point 260 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, struck at 2:44 a.m. (1744 GMT Tuesday), the agency said.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, seismic waves caused by undersea
earthquakes or volcanic activity, resulting from the temblor, it
said.
	   The day before, some areas in the region were hit by a magnitude
5.4 quake, which caused no injuries or damage. It was not
immediately known whether the two earthquakes were related, the
agency said.
	   Wednesday's quake was felt most strongly in the city of
Shirakawa in Fukushima prefecture, or state), about 180 kilometers
(110 miles) northeast of Tokyo, according to the agency.
	   A magnitude 4 earthquake can shake houses and buildings and
cause hanging objects, such as lamps, to swing. One of magnitude 5
can damage homes if it occurs in a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
its sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Japan criticized for slack policing of Internet child pornography

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hundreds of pornographic images of children flood
Internet sites with addresses ending in ``jp.''
	   It's a tip off that they originate in Japan _ and that there is
basically nothing officials can do about it.
	   With no laws explicitly banning child pornography, Japan has
acquired the dubious distinction of being the global leader in the
fast-growing Internet child pornography business.
	   Japanese police say there are about 1,200 commercial child
pornography Internet sites in Japan. Some feature photos of
children from Japan, others of Southeast Asian children.
	   Keiji Goto, a senior official at the National Police Agency,
said police are frustrated by cases in which they identified the
source of a pornographic site but were unable to take further
action.
	   Because Japan has no law on child porn, officers must apply the
general criminal code on pornography _ which is vaguely worded, but
defined in practice as including material depicting sexual organs.
	   Most child porn sites skirt that law by using images that show
abuse or torture of children without directly showing sexual
organs.
	   A bill to outlaw child pornography, on and off the Internet, was
submitted to Parliament earlier this year, backed almost entirely
by female legislators. But the bill has not made it onto
Parliament's agenda and is not likely to come up for consideration
soon.
	   ``No nation that values democracy and freedom should condone
child pornography,'' said Mayumi Moriyama, a former Cabinet
minister who is behind the bill. ``We must pass the law for the
honor of Japan.''
	   Activists say the real root of the problem lies in the lack of
sensitivity among Japanese to children's and women's issues.
	   Nude photos of women and sexual drawings are routinely carried
by tabloid newspapers that are read by men in public, often on
commuter trains in plain view of children and women.
	   ``People need to realize that Japan is being targeted as a major
problem by the international community,'' said Junko Miyamoto, head
of a group that has been working for six years to ban child
pornography. ``The situation is totally out of control.''
	   Carol Smolenski, coordinator for the U.S. branch of the group
End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of
Children, said that because of the reach of the Internet, Japan has
a responsibility to the world to crack down.
	   ``We are affected by Japan's laws. The Internet has changed the
field,'' she said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``We're
absolutely outraged by how easy it is to get.''
	   Donald Huycke, a U.S. Customs agent, said he gets four or five
complaints a week from American groups about Japanese child
pornography sites on the Internet.
	   ``I see the same Japan sites all the time,'' he said from his
office in Virginia. ``I'd like to see stronger laws in Japan to
attack the problem.''

	   SOMERSET WEST, South Africa (AP) _ For most of this century,
Africa scrambled to catch up with the industrialized world.
	   But just as tap water and e-mail, international banking and
modern factories have become more commonplace, a new problem
threatens the gains.
	   The ``millennium bug,'' a computer glitch expected to emerge on
Jan. 1, 2000, means authorities ``almost have to go at the end of
next year into a warlike situation,'' said Mohamed Madhi, director
of South Africa's National Year 2000 Decision Support Center.
	   The problem _ also known as Y2K _ affects many computers and
computer chips because they were programmed to recognize only the
last two digits of a year. Unless reprogrammed or replaced, they
will be baffled when the millennium kicks over.
	   Madhi's concern is directed at systems like water delivery,
where computer-controlled dispensing and billing systems are in the
hands of underfinanced and inefficient local governments.
	   South Africa fears it could see 300 hospital deaths because of
the bug's shutting down intensive care machinery regulated by
imbedded computer chips.
	   Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town, one of the country's top
medical institutions, hopes to replace 80 percent of its
administrative computers by 2000, but says it is difficult to
determine which machinery _ for example, respirators _ might cease
functioning.
	   With a sophisticated urban infrastructure, South Africa is rated
by some consultants among the world's top five countries for Y2K
preparedness _ along with the United States and Britain, and ahead
of Germany and Japan.
	   Even so, the cost to South Africa's economy could be as high as
30 billion rand (dlrs 4.8 billion), or 10 percent of its economic
output, government officials say. There's also the likelihood of
lawsuits over service or product delivery failure, which Madhi's
office says could cost three times the expense of upgrading
equipment.
	   For more advanced African countries, many problems center on the
lack of preparedness in trading partner nations.
	   The computer-driven production line at Amka Products, a
cosmetics manufacturer in Pretoria, for example, is 100 percent
ready for the year 2000, said one of its directors, Nizam Kalla.
	   But it exports many of its products to Zimbabwe and Malawi, two
countries where the computer glitch has not received attention at
top levels of government and industry.
	   That means distribution of and payment for South African exports
could be affected, with severe economic consequences for the
country, said Jay Naidoo, head of South Africa's Ministry of Posts,
Telecommunications and Broadcasting.
	   Glum expressions at a regional gathering of computer experts and
politicians near Cape Town in August reflected Madhi's worries.
	   ``It is a daunting task because we are just starting,'' said
Moatshe Moatshe, deputy secretary of Botswana's Ministry of Works,
Transport and Communications.
	   Only six of Africa's four dozen countries south of the Sahara
have national government-backed programs to tackle Y2K _ South
Africa, Mauritius, Seychelles, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Namibia.
	   South African officials expect that most government systems,
including payment of pensions, and large industries will be ready
by 2000.
	   It is now focusing on the 800,000 medium and small businesses
that employ 44 percent of the country's workers and account for a
third of the economy.
	   Many Africans live near the poverty line, buying cooking fuel,
tinned goods and corn meal on a daily basis. The Y2K glitch could
disrupt transportation networks and shut down supplies,
contributing to social unrest and crime, said Jaiswanth Ramdin at
the government's Y2K center.
	   Even wildlife could be affected.
	   Iain Douglas-Hamilton of Save the Elephants in Kenya thinks the
computer-and-satellite system he uses to track elephants will be
replaced with updated versions. But consultants say new equipment
is not always the solution because it often rejects old data and
programs.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ It's an island of rolling green
countryside with a choppy Atlantic coast, where they drive on the
left, take tea before supper, worship cricket, spell the Queen's
English and give Elizabeth II her due.
	   But ``Little England'' may be ready to go its own way.
	   As Barbados prepares to mark 32 years of independence in a
flurry of gold-and-blue flags on Nov. 30, there is a growing clamor
to break the last links with Britain's dwindling empire.
	   Among those ties are a British-based supreme court, the queen's
status as head of state _ and even a statue of 18th century British
naval hero Horatio Nelson.
	   ``What's Nelson doing up there anyway?'' fumes taxi driver
Patrick Lloyd, referring to the 30-foot (nine-meter) statue that
looms imperiously over Bridgetown harbor. ``What did he ever do for
Barbados? Let's put up one of our own!''
	   Resentment against the British might well be expected. Nine of
every 10 Barbadians are descendants of Africans brought here by the
British for backbreaking slave labor on sugarcane plantations.
	   But the 270,000 ``Bajans'' often display a poignant appreciation
of what England has given them, stressing that their island was
spared the slave rebellions and retributions that laid waste to
Jamaica, Haiti and other Caribbean lands.
	   Decolonization came gradually here, and the result is a
widespread feeling that Barbados was somehow favored by Britain and
that this helped the former slaves create a relatively prosperous
state with a sizable middle class, some of the best-educated people
in the Caribbean and an orderly civil service.
	   As Barbadian pop star John King sings in his hit song ``Fool's
Paradise'': ``We got a lot to be thankful for, we never had a coup,
we never had a civil war.''
	   The English cultural influence is everywhere _ from bars with
names like ``Nelson's Arms'' to a stoic reserve to a national
obsession with the game of cricket.
	   More than three decades after independence, Britain's queen
remains the titular head of state, formally appointing
governors-general. When she has visited _ the last time was in the
1980s _ Barbadians lined the streets to greet her, waving the Union
Jack.
	   But that could soon be a thing of the past. All over the world,
British territories and others joined in the Commonwealth are
questioning such ties. Australia, where the British monarch has
been head of state for 210 years, will vote next year whether to
become a republic.
	   In Barbados, the governing Labor Party reflected a growing
current of opinion in a policy statement issued in early November:
	   ``Whereas many Barbadians have expressed their disapproval of
the Queen of England being the Head of State, and whereas it is the
will of most Barbadians to sever such a relationship with the
colonial past ... the party (seeks to) establish a genuine
sovereign state in the form of a republic.''
	   Reginald Farley, the industry minister who is widely touted as a
possible heir to Prime Minister Owen Arthur, predicted a
much-anticipated report by a constitutional commission will
recommend the same.
	   ``A nation that says to its citizens that they can never aspire
to be the head of state _ that's a little vulgar,'' Farley said.
	   He also predicts a Caribbean court will replace the British
Privy Council _ a supreme court drawn from London's House of Lords
that has angered former British colonies in the region by impeding
executions.
	   All this could happen ``as soon as Parliament wills it,'' said
Farley, smiling broadly.
	   But such changes will not be unanimous.
	   ``I disagree with any such severance,'' said Sir Donald Wiles,
former head of the Barbados National Trust. ``I think the island
has derived so very much from our links with England. For example,
the English language, British law, the parliamentary system.''
	   ``The child grows up and goes on to live on his own _ but he
doesn't have to sever his links to his father and his mother!''
Wiles added.
	   Reudon Eversley, editor of the Barbados Advocate newspaper, said
that more than nationalism, it is the growing cultural influence of
the United States that may finish off what remains of the British
empire in Barbados.
	   It's also reflected in trade. Once Barbados' biggest trading
partner, Britain now provides only 8 percent of imports, compared
to 38 percent from the United States.
	   ``We still prefer the BBC to CNN,'' Eversley said. ``But more
and more, we are spelling `honour' without the `u'. And the kids _
they're playing basketball instead of cricket.''
	   With a look of resignation, he predicted what would once have
been unthinkable to a nation weaned on cricket: ``They'll be
playing baseball, too, before it's over. I have absolutely no doubt
about it.''

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ It melts away distances and racial
barriers, is immune to hurricanes and requires no physical space.
	   The Internet, along with other computer technology, is seen as a
perfect vehicle for Barbados, a remote, densely populated and
relatively developed Caribbean island whose people want much more
than harvesting sugarcane and marketing white-sand beaches.
	   ``The Internet is a way for us to overcome the traditional
boundaries of distance,'' said Ian Weithers of Sanga International,
which provides Internet-based financial software to firms in
Europe, North America and Asia.
	   Sanga is among dozens of new companies that have sprung up
around Bridgetown, the capital of this island of 270,000 people.
The process began several years ago, when generous tax breaks and
salaries a third or less of those in the United States, drew
companies like Canada's ManuLife to move data processing to
Barbados.
	   Bryan Pearce, a partner with the local Ernst and Young office,
said Barbados is a good offshore location because its people speak
English and are well-educated, the time zone is the same as in the
eastern United States, government is stable and telephone service
is dependable, if expensive.
	   ``It's a nice, stable place to relocate to,'' said Pearce, a
Canadian who moved here from London, Ontario, with his wife and
three children.
	   In addition, liberal immigration laws have enabled companies to
bring computer programmers from countries like India to the
doorstep of the United States.
	   The largest of these, the PRT group, has hundreds of Indian
programmers developing financial software in Barbados.
	   Weithers, who is director of operations at Sanga, wants to use
the momentum to develop homegrown talent. ``Like Japan, Barbados is
devoid of all natural resources except people,'' he said, noting
proudly that all 70 of his programmers are Barbadians.
	   The company sponsors courses at local colleges on financial
programming and Internet software.
	   Industry Minister Reginald Farley said the diversification of
the economy away from tourism and traditional light industry will
ensure that young Barbadians who go abroad to study are attracted
to return.
	   Computer technology also is ideal for the fragile environment of
islands that fear too much tourism could damage coral reefs and
other attractions while many industries are polluting.
	   In his recent budget proposal, Prime Minister Owen Arthur
announced a 300 million Barbados dollar (U.S. dlrs 152 million)
plan to equip all classrooms with computers ``to prepare our
citizens to deal with the realities of life in a post-industrial
age.''
	   Today, some 2,500 Barbadians _ about 2 percent of workers _ are
employed in information technology, said Basil Levine of the
Barbados Investment and Development Corp.
	   But some people say the numbers mislead.
	   ``Much of what they call information technology is actually
simply data entry done for mainland firms. This is not very
sophisticated,'' said Pat Hoyos, publisher of the Broad Street
Journal, a financial weekly.

Sampras wins in impressive style, Rios fades in pain

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Perhaps Pete Sampras won't have to
battle that hard to secure the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth
year.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, lost to
Tim Henman 7-5, 6-1 on Tuesday and later said a recurring back
injury may force him to drop out of the ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras leads Rios by a slim 33 points in the computer rankings
and he is seeking to make history by becoming the first man to
finish as No. 1 for six years in a row. He shares the record of
five with Jimmy Connors.
	   Kicking off the elite season-ending dlrs 3.5 million event that
brings together the top eight players of the year, Sampras posted
an impressive 6-2, 6-4 victory over Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
	   Rios needs to do better than Sampras at the tournament to have a
shot at the No. 1 and with his painful back this looks a like
distant prospect now.
	   ``My back is hurting really a lot. I'm not in a good condition
to continue playing,'' Rios said.
	   ``I'm going to see how I feel tomorrow. I want to play, I want
to be No. 1 but you have to listen to your body,'' he said. ``It's
tough to run, it's tough to play when you are in pain.''
	   Rios, who has held the No. 1 spot for a total of six weeks this
year and leads the tour with seven titles, could have grabbed the
top spot again two weeks ago in Santiago but he crashed out in the
quarterfinals.
	   Spending 15 hours on a plane and switching back to a hard indoor
court from clay didn't help his back either, Rios said.
	   Sampras on the other hand looked in perfect condition after
taking a break following six grueling weeks on the indoor circuit
in Europe.
	   ``It was good to let my body and mind rest. I'm obviously very
fresh in the legs,'' he said.
	   Sampras cruised in the first set with his sharp serve-and-volley
game. Kafelnikov gave him more of a battle in the second set but
Sampras still dominated the opponent he beat in last year's final,
when he won the title for the fourth time. Sampras
	   ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely was
very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that
this is an important week and it showed.''
	   ``I just hope I can maintain this level throughout the week,
which is not going to be easy. But today was definitely a good
start,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras next faces Carlos Moya, the French Open champion who
beat Karol Kucera 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3. Moya beat Sampras in the
opening round last year.
	   In other matches Wednesday, Kucera plays Kafelnikov and Andre
Agassi makes his debut against Alex Corretja.

Cholera sickens hundreds in northeastern Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - A cholera outbreak has killed one
and sickened some 320 others in a poor northeastern state,
according to Brazilian health officials.
	   Contaminated water from the Rio Serinhaem has affected the
drinking supply of four municipalities located 63 miles 105 kms
from Recife, the Pernambuco state capital. In all, 550 cases have
been confirmed, the state health department said Tuesday.
	   ``The situation is difficult but under control,'' Christiane
Holmes, director of health control told reporters.
	   In Cortes, one of the affected cities, Mayor Manuel Jose da
Silva has declared a public emergency and health workers are
handing out chlorine for drinking water and pamphlets to educate
the populace.
	   ``The population is aprehensive. There are few doctors and we
lack resources,'' Dalva Maria dos Santos, a Catholic nun, told the
Jornal do Brasil newspaper.
	   Cholera is caused by a bacteria transmitted by human feces and
carried by tainted water. It causes quick, massive dehydration and
can be fatal if not treated.

North Korea threatens to abrogate 1994 nuclear accord with U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea, again denying it is
building an underground nuclear facility, has repeated its threat
to abrogate a 1994 agreement requiring it to abandon its suspect
nuclear weapons program.
	   In a report by its official Korean Central News Agency late
Tuesday night, the communist country's Foreign Ministry said it
made its position clear in negotiations with U.S. officials last
week.
	   Charles Kartman, a U.S. special envoy, visited North Korea Nov.
15-17 to demand U.S. access to the suspect facility. The next round
of negotiations is scheduled to be held in New York in early
December.
	   ``We have no obligation to allow inspection merely because they
suspect our underground facility,'' an unidentified Foreign
Ministry spokesman said in the KCNA report.
	   ``This is as good as asking to search another's house. This is a
grave violation of and insult to our sovereignty and dignity. We
can never accept their demand,'' it said.
	   The North's spokesman said, however, that Pyongyang could allow
a one-time inspection of the facility if the United States
compensates for its ``groundless'' accusation concerning the
facility.
	   North Korea reportedly is seeking dlrs 300 million in cash in
return for an inspection. The United States has rejected the
demand.
	   ``If the U.S. wants to break the (1994) framework agreement
while having no idea of making compensation merely because we do
not show them the underground facility, we no longer need to
observe the agreement inconveniently,'' the North's spokesman said.
	   ``We have always thought of how to respond in case the framework
agreement breaks down,'' he said.
	   Under the 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspect nuclear weapons program. In return,
it will get two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion plus
substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   North Korea has threatened to abrogate the agreement several
times since it was reached.
	   Before the agreement was signed, the country was suspected of
having extracted enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two
nuclear bombs.
	   The spokesman said there are many underground facilities and
tunnels in North Korea. But he added that the disputed facility at
Kumchang-ri north of Pyongyang, the capital, is not
nuclear-related.
	   U.S. officials said they have ``compelling evidence'' that the
disputed facility, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the North's
main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, is for nuclear development.
	   President Bill Clinton warned during his visit to Seoul over the
weekend that U.S.-North Korea relations would be thrown into danger
if suspicions over the facility are not promptly cleared up.

Polarized politics surrounding vote threaten Albania's democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Wildly conflicting claims, little
reliable information and the lack of a political center have left
Albanians confused after last weekend's constitutional referendum _
and have raised questions about the viability of their nation's
fledgling democracy.
	   Despite the fact Sunday's vote came off without unrest _ no
small feat in unstable Albania _ political experts said the
problems partly overshadow the all-but-certain adoption of
Albania's first post-communist constitution.
	   There were still no official results Tuesday, but a boycott by
the opposition and the lack of a minimim turnout provision left
little doubt the referendum had been approved.
	   The problem was that most voters didn't know what they were
approving, political analyst Remzi Lani says _ a result of the
twisting of figures and facts by politicians and media.
	   ``We can't know what to think or whom to support,'' Lani,
director of the independent Albanian Media Institute, said of the
lack of reliable information. ``In this situation, Albania is a
land with no hope.''
	   Albanian politics, bitterly divided between the Socialist
government, which includes many former communists, and the fiery
nationalist Democratic Party, needs a third, moderate
representative, he said.
	   But ``there is no possible third person visible and one can't
emerge in the current climate,'' he said. ``There are only the
ex-communists and the nationalists _ radicals. In elections,
everybody loses.''
	   Contradictions surrounding the vote on the constitution _ meant
to outline civil, human and democratic rights in Albania _ left
most of the nation of 3.2 million unaware of the draft's contents,
Lani said.
	   Conflicting accounts left Albanians with questions about both
the turnout and whether there was any violence.
	   The government and Western observers said calm prevailed
nationwide. Opposition newspapers reported a catastrophic outburst
of bloodshed and vote-rigging.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
has praised the Western-style constitution as a steppingstone to a
stronger democracy, said turnout was higher than expected but
criticized the ``tense'' campaign.
	   ``Extreme polarization, disinformation'' and ``misleading
statements'' characterized debate before the vote, said a statement
by the OSCE, which blamed mostly the opposition Democratic Party.
	   Overall, said the OSCE, the referendum was an improvement over
1997 national elections, marred by violence at polling booths.
	   In that election, where the two sides campaigned by calling each
other ``murderers'' and ``mafia,'' the Socialist victors ended the
Democrats' five years in power.
	   This time, the Democrats of fiery Democrat leader Sali Berisha
cited nonexistent clauses saying the draft would give the governing
Socialists 50 more years in power. They also said the constitution
would bring back collectivization and communism and, through a
freedom of religion clause, undermine Islam, the national religion.
	   The government also came in for criticism by the OSCE for
eliminating law requiring a turnout of more than 50 percent .

Iraq pours hundreds into the streets, stands tough in crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government pledged not to relent
in its standoff with the United Nations over documents on its
weapons programs, pouring hundreds of people into the streets to
protest U.N. sanctions.
	   The government's tough words Tuesday came a day after it
acknowledged an assassination attempt on one of its most powerful
officials. The assailant was reportedly shot to death in the attack
on Izzat Ibrahim, a deputy with the influential Revolutionary
Command Council.
	   Hundreds of Iraqis, many of them elderly women clad in black,
arrived by bus for the government-orchestrated demonstration
outside the U.N. headquarters to denounce their suffering under the
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   A convoy of cars drove along the street carrying wooden coffins
meant to symbolize children who have died as a result of the
sanctions.
	   At the heart of Iraq's dispute with the United Nations are the
sanctions, which have wrecked an economy that was once one of the
Arab world's most prosperous. Iraq claims 5,000 children die every
month, and U.N. officials acknowledge one in three suffer from
malnutrition.
	   The U.N. Security Council cannot lift the sanctions until U.N.
inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to build
them.
	   Last week, the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, asked
for more documents _ from personal diaries to a log of weapons used
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ as part of that search. But Iraq
insists the documents were either irrelevant, have already been
destroyed or were already turned over to inspectors.
	   Failing to cooperate could delay a U.N. review of progress on
dismantling the weapons that Iraq hopes will ease the sanctions,
and the United States has warned it is still willing to attack if
Iraq fails to do everything the U.N. inspectors ask.
	   ``I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring
unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and
requests of the (U.N.) inspectors,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Tuesday in Washington.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Iraqis were
clearly trying to ``dodge their obligations'' to provide the
documents. But, he noted, ``It's fair to point out that ... the
monitoring teams continued their activities for the seventh
straight day and have not reported any problems.''
	   The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and five escort ships
arrived Tuesday in the Persian Gulf, bringing the number of U.S.
warships in the region to 19.
	   Despite the military buildup, however, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz declared the Iraqis would not submit to the demands,
``regardless of the dangers.''
	   Iraq averted what appeared to be an imminent U.S. and British
attack by agreeing on Nov. 14 to allow U.N. inspectors to resume
their work. Since then, inspectors have made daily visits to
suspected weapons sites, and Iraqi officials have provided full
cooperation.
	   Still, anger remains directed at Butler, who the Iraqi
government views as instrumental in prolonging the sanctions.
Al-Iraq, an official newspaper, called Butler a ``cursed devil and
mad bull'' on Tuesday.
	   The assassination attempt on Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam Hussein's
deputy on the council, startled Iraqis accustomed to the iron-fist
security that reigns in the country.
	   The assassination attempt was the first known attack on a senior
official since 1996, when gunmen shot Saddam's eldest son, Odai,
about 10 times in his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood. Odai
survived with serious injuries.

Stocks, dollar lower in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell in early trading
Wednesday following an overnight drop on Wall Street. The U.S.
dollar was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 179.26
points, or 1.18 percent, to 14,985.38 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. The index had risen 384.70 points, or 2.60 percent
Tuesday, closing above the psychologically-important 15,000-point
level for the first time since Aug. 25.
	   Traders said share prices fell Wednesday on selling after the
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.12 points overnight to close
Tuesday's session at 9,301.15. On Monday, the Dow rose 214.72
points, closing at a record high of 9,374.27. Its previous record
was 9,337.97 points, set in July.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 8.04 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,147.57. The
TOPIX gained 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar was confined to
narrow ranges as investors avoided major moves ahead of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday in the United States, traders said.
	   The dollar bought 121.42 yen in early trading, down 0.20 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
121.18 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early trading. It's yield finished at 0.920
percent Tuesday, up from Friday's 0.900 percent, driving its price
down to 107.73 yen from 107.92.

Brazil court reconsiders kidnappers' sentences,0139

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian court has its delayed
its judgement for a week on whether to reduce sentences for eight
convicted kidnappers on hunger strike, according to media reports.
	   The Sao Paulo criminal court spent Tuesday reconsidering the
sentences of five Chileans, two Argentines and a Brazilian, serving
26-to-28-years for the 1989 kidnapping of supermarket magnate
Abilio Diniz.
	   Two of ten sitting justices have already decided to reduce the
sentences, reported the Agencia Estado news agency. It was not
clear why the judgement was delayed.
	   Last Friday, two Canadians who belonged to the group, David
Spencer and Christine Lamont, took advantage of a prisoner transfer
treaty between Canada and Brazil and were flown to a Vancouver
prison.
	   The agreed to reconsider the sentences last April after the
kidnappers went on a 16-day hunger strike. But a lack of movement
on the mattter led the kidnappers to re-start the hunger strike
eight days ago.
	   The prisoners' lawyers want the court to reduce the sentences to
8 years, the original time given the five Chileans in 1990 before
being increased the next year to the the maximum penalty by an
appellate court. The five would then be expelled from Brazil since
they have completed their time.
	   Although the other three _ two Argentines and a Brazilian _ were
originally sentenced to between 12-to-15 years, they would not
accept anything more than eight years, and would continue to drink
only water.
	   At their trial, the kidnappers claimed to be political prisoners
since they belonged to a leftist group that wanted to funnel the
dlrs 30 million ransomto Salvadoran guerrillas, who were then
waging war against that nation's right-wing government.
	   Diniz was held hostage for six days in an underground cell
before police freed him unharmed.

Both sides apprehensive on Pinochet extradition judgment day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS; Judgment due 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fearing the worst, some supporters of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet are looking for an English
country mansion where he can stay in secure comfort if he has to
fight extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture.
	   Victims of Pinochet's 1973-90 rule and human rights groups are
also nervous _ afraid that Britain's highest court will rule
Wednesday that Pinochet does indeed have immunity from arrest as a
former foreign head of state.
	   That would mean he could be whisked immediately from a north
London hospital to board a waiting jet for Chile.
	   A five-judge tribunal of the House of Lords will deliver their
findings on Pinochet's 83rd birthday in a case that has
far-reaching implications.
	   Lawyers for Spain and Spanish and British prosecutors appealed a
High Court ruling that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest was illegal
because as a foreign head of state he has immunity for all actions
taken during his 1973-90 rule.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of secret police after Pinochet ousted
President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued that though it might be morally
regrettable, Britain's 1978 State Immunity Act was sufficiently
sweeping to give even Adolph Hitler immunity.
	   Prosecutors' lawyers, meanwhile, pointed to the Nuremberg trials
of World War II Nazi leaders and recent trials of Rwandan Hutus and
Bosnians for mass murder or war crimes, and said the development of
international law and custom has put some offenses beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested on a
Spanish warrant while in a London hospital recuperating from back
surgery.
	   With his wife, Lucia, he awaited the Lords' ruling in his room
at Grovelands Priory, the north London hospital where he is under
police guard, although lawyers have said he is well enough to be
moved.
	   The verdict was being carried live on television in Britain and
Chile.
	   In Santiago, the Chilean government banned a pro-Pinochet rally
scheduled Wednesday because of fears of violence. But an organizer,
Ximena Garin, warned ``we will not stay with our arms crossed at
our houses.''
	   A wealthy Greek-born columnist who lives partly in London, Taki
Theodoracopulos, said friends were looking for a house for Pinochet
in case the judgment goes against him.
	   ``We are simply concerned that if he is detained in Britain he
should be kept in dignified circumstances,'' Theodoracopulos told
London's Sunday Telegraph newspaper.
	   France and Switzerland have also lodged extradition requests.
But if the Lords uphold Pinochet's immunity, Britain would not be
able to act on any warrants.
	   Conversely, a win for prosecutors would touch off a lengthy
extradition battle.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw would have to decide by Dec. 2 whether
to allow the Spanish extradition request to go before the courts.
Pinochet, health permitting, would also make his first public
appearance since his arrest at a preliminary hearing at Bow Street
Dec. 2.

With arrests, expulsions, China determined to tighten secrecy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In many ways, China has signaled its openness to
change: allowing a U.S. president to speak on state-run television,
giving its citizens more freedom to travel and work as they choose,
signing human rights treaties.
	   At the same time, the government has expelled foreign reporters
and imprisoned Chinese journalists. On Thursday, it will put on
trial Lin Hai, a Shanghai man accused of trying to overthrow the
state by distributing e-mail addresses to a U.S.-based Internet
democracy magazine.
	   Behind the more open, liberal face, China is fighting an
information counterrevolution. Its state security apparatus uses
laws on secrecy and subversion to suppress information the ruling
Communist Party dislikes and to lock up the messengers.
	   Recently, those efforts have focused on trying to curb the
fast-growing reach of the Internet in Chinese society _ although
with the number of web users growing exponentially it appears to be
a losing battle.
	   In China, practically all information that has not been
published in the tightly controlled state media is regarded as
classified. The government also sets strict rules for foreign
reporting, although enforcement is sporadic and arbitrary.
	   Last Friday, the government expelled a reporter for the German
magazine Der Spiegel, Juergen Kremb, for allegedly possessing state
secrets. In October, a reporter for the Yomiuri, Japan's
largest-circulation newspaper, was forced to leave the country for
the same alleged offense.
	   In both cases, government officials refused to say what the
alleged secrets were _ because they were secret.
	   Foreign journalists working in China live with constant
government surveillance and possibility of having homes and offices
searched or of being detained while conducting news coverage that
would be considered routine elsewhere.
	   For Chinese citizens, the stakes are much higher. The maximum
penalty for violating the state secrets law is death.
	   Under the law, state secrets can be anything that affects
national unity or social stability, or matters concerning economic
and social development _ a broad definition that makes it
impossible to know what kind of information the authorities will
view as sensitive.
	   The public was allowed to watch U.S. President Bill Clinton
voice his views about democracy on state-controlled television. In
United Nations accords, the government has pledged to uphold basic
civil, economic and social rights. But Chinese citizens who attempt
to exercise those rights can find themselves in trouble.
	   Lin Hai, the 30-year-old founder and manager of a computer
software company in Shanghai who goes on trial Thursday, was taken
from his home on March 25 and arrested on charges of ``inciting the
overthrow of state power'' for providing 30,000 e-mail addresses to
the electronic pro-democracy magazine ``Big Reference.'' He will be
tried in secret.
	   The case highlights the government's determination to restrain
the freewheeling Internet and control information to its 1.2
million registered users in China.
	   The Ministry of Information Industry, which operates the servers
that permit access to the Internet, has created what some hackers
have dubbed the ``Great Firewall of China'' _ a filter to block out
the salacious and the subversive _ everything from Penthouse to
CNN.
	   Yet, efforts to put on-line democracy magazines under electronic
siege through Chinese government-engineered electronic interference
appear to have failed.
	   Although authorities arrested the publishers of ``Tunnel,'' a
weekly on-line magazine featuring dissident writings and, according
to dissident sources, tried wiping out its web site with computer
programs, the journal is still being published.
	   ``Big Reference,'' too, continues to flood China. Both magazines
operate from roving addresses on the Worldwide Web and are sent by
e-mail directly to Chinese, a method difficult to block.

Yankees and Cablevision said to break off talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and
Cablevision Systems Corp. have broken off talks about the possible
sale of a major interest in the team, Dow Jones newswires reported
Tuesday.
	   The sides couldn't agree on how much control Steinbrenner would
retain over the team and talks broke off Monday, the report said.
The sides have been trying to negotiate a deal for a month.
	   Steinbrenner has told people that an agreement would still allow
him to remain as managing general partner, and that he would still
have total control of the Yankees even if Cablevision becomes a
limited partner with a large percentage of shares, perhaps as much
as 70 percent.
	   Dow Jones quoted an individual familiar with the negotiations as
saying the deal was ``dead'' for the time being, but that talks
could resume at some point.
	   Steinbrenner spokesman Howard Rubenstein did not return
telephone calls and Cablevision spokeswoman Susan Pelcher said the
company did not have any immediate comment.
	   Cablevision owns the Yankees television rights under a dlrs 486
million, 12-year contract that expires after the 2000 season. In
the open market, the Yankees' TV rights are estimated to be worth
an average of dlrs 100 million to dlrs 150 million under a new 8-
to 10-year deal.

Marijuana in the making displayed on `Cannabis Castle' tour

<TEXT>
	   OOSTERHOUT, Netherlands (AP) _ Flashes are permitted at this
popular tourist site. You might even get away with flashbacks.
	   With management's blssing, tourists snapped shots and rolled
video cameras at the ``Cannabis Castle,'' taking in _ if not
inhaling _ the 2,000 leafy marijuana plants growing on a central
Holland estate.
	   It's all part of the 11th annual Cannabis Cup, the weeklong
potfest that draws several thousand people _ mostly Americans _ to
the drug-tolerant Netherlands every year.
	   An added attraction to this year's festivities was Tuesday's bus
tour to the Cannabis Castle. A marijuana user's mecca, the castle _
owned by the Sensi Seed Co. _ produces potent strains of marijuana
with names such as ``Northern Lights'' and ``Skunk.''
	   ``It's like walking into a wonderland,'' said Patty Collins,
wearing a shirt that read ``Stoner Chicks Rule.'' She marveled
Tuesday at the size of one variety of cannabis growing tall toward
a ceiling of ultraviolet lights.
	   Collins, who owns a pipe store in Portland, Oregon, is in the
Netherlands this week for the so-called ``harvest festival''
sponsored by the American magazine ``High Times.''
	   Cup participants pay dlrs 200 for the right to judge the best
cannabis of the year. The winner is crowned on Friday from among
the ``coffeeshops'' of Amsterdam, where hashish and marijuana can
be purchased in small amounts.
	   Though technically illegal in the Netherlands, those soft drugs
are decriminalized and Dutch authorities don't prosecute people who
sell or use small amounts.
	   The castle _ actually a stately 18th century home _ is tucked in
peaceful countryside 75 kilometers (40 miles) from the bustle of
the bohemian capital, Amsterdam. Sheep graze nearby, and church
spires dot the horizon.
	   Catacombs beneath the house protect the ``mother plants,'' which
generate the castle's crop. Some of the original plants are more
than 20 years old.
	   ``Amazing,'' gushed Doug Biggs, an American who traveled from
Indiana to smoke the drug he says eases his frequent migraine
headaches.
	   Don Wirtshafter, an attorney from Athens, Ohio, was less
impressed by the castle's treasures. ``I made pot my issue,'' he
says of his 25-year legal career. ``Everyone's so impressed _ I see
this all the time in my travels.''
	   Still, he enjoyed the castle's gourmet lunch buffet of
tangerines, smoked salmon sandwiches, Belgian chocolates, and, of
course, marijuana.
	   A man dressed as the ``king of cannabis'' in a red robe and
makeshift crown of marijuana stalks offered visitors snippets from
branches of the castle's newest offerings.
	   Most lit up their sweet-smelling samples after the communal
grace. Laurence Cherniak gave thanks that the group could come
together and ``speak another language.'' He asked everyone to be
kind and encouraging to one another.
	   Linda Dronkers, co-owner of the castle and seed company with her
husband and son, gave tours of her family home.
	   Small details in the decorating show her passion for pot. Prints
on the wall show artists' renderings of joint-smoking, and the
cushions on her wicker chairs are stenciled with the five-fingered
green leaf.
	   ``It's the most beautiful plant in the world,'' she said as she
set down a fresh-baked plate of hemp cookies.
	   ``It's very spiritual,'' she added. ``You have to give yourself
completely to the plant.''

DiMaggio marks 84th birthday in hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with ESPN report &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio marks his
84th birthday Wednesday in a Florida hospital where he reportedly
is battling lung cancer and had a heart attack last week.
	   DiMaggio's lawyer denied reports by two television stations that
the Hall of Famer had a heart attack or is gravely ill.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said Tuesday after
TV stations in New York and Miami reported that DiMaggio's
condition had worsened. ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this
information on the television and were very upset.''
	   The first report came Monday night from WPIX in New York, which
televised New York Yankees games for 48 years before losing the
broadcast contract after last season. The station cited three
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and added that
DiMaggio had a tumor removed from his lung last month.
	   On Tuesday, WTVJ-TV in Miami, also citing unidentified sources
close to DiMaggio, broadcast the same report. The NBC affiliate
said it confirmed that DiMaggio had a heart attack and lung cancer
and said he was on a ventilator.
	   However, ESPN reported Tuesday that DiMaggio's condition
improved enough so that he was off life support. The all-sports
cable station said that last week DiMaggio's health was so poor
following a heart attack that he was given last rites.
	   Engelberg, a longtime friend who has communicated DiMaggio's
condition to the media since the baseball great was hospitalized on
Oct. 12, responded to the reports angrily.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack,'' Engelberg said in
statement transmitted to news media. ``This is totally false and he
is not in `grave condition.' ''
	   The statement went on to say that DiMaggio had advised Engelberg
to no longer discuss his health condition with anyone other than
his doctors and his immediate family.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio will be celebrating his 84th birthday at Memorial
Hospital with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, some of
the hospital staff, his brother, Dom, myself and a few close
friends,'' Engelberg said.
	   ``Again, Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack. We were all
shocked by this false rumor.''
	   Engelberg's statement did not address the issue of lung cancer
or any surgery to remove a tumor. When DiMaggio entered the
hospital in Hollywood, Fla., the attorney said his friend was
suffering from pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had been scheduled to see
DiMaggio last week but was forced to cancel his visit. WPIX's
report said he was told DiMaggio ``probably wouldn't have
recognized him anyway.''
	   The report also said friends of DiMaggio were concerned about
who was in control of his estate, which WPIX said includes a
memorabilia fortune worth about dlrs 20 million.
	   Personnel at Memorial Regional Hospital have not provided
information on DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators have
even denied DiMaggio is a patient.

	   WINTER PARK, Colorado (AP) _ American Sacha Gros overcame balmy
temperatures and softening snow Tuesday to win a slalom ski race in
a field thick with World Cup skiers from Europe.
	   Gros' two-run time for the event at Winter Park Resort in the
first men's slalom in the U.S. Ski Team Visa Super Series of races
for the Nor Am Cup was was 1 minute, 18.08 seconds. Benjamin Raich
of Austria was next in 1:18.33.
	   Three other Americans broke into the top-15, including a
surprise ninth-place finish by Kevin Stell of Juneau, Alaska. Andy
LeRoy of Steamboat Springs, Colorado was 11th with Drew Thorne
Thomsen of Stratton Mountain, Vermont, 13th.
	   ``Sacha was super,'' said U.S. coach Bill Egan. ``There were
eight or nine guys out of the top 30 in the world. Sacha had some
pretty soft snow for the second run.''

Heeb wins Nor Am event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEAVER CREEK, Colorado (AP) _ Giant slalom specialist Birgit
Heeb of Liechtenstein followed the best result of her World Cup
career by winning a Nor Am Cup GS Tuesday in a near-World Cup
field.
	   Heeb was clocked in 2 minutes, 6.29 seconds for the first
women's Visa Super Series race of the season. She held a lead of
more than four-tenths of a second from the first run, and despite
poor visibility from overcast skies breezed to victory over
Spaniards Maria Jose Rienda Contreras and Ana Galindo Santolaria.
	   American women struggled. Local favorite Sarah Schleper, who
registered her best World Cup result in Park City, Utah, when she
was 16th, had the best result Tuesday _ a 19th-place finish.

Turkish government faces no-confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Parliament scheduled to convene at 1300 gmt &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A growing corruption scandal appears to be
on course to topple Turkey's government.
	   If, as expected, the government collapses in a parliamentary
vote of no confidence, lawmakers would again be left with a
difficult choice: trying to set aside feuds and build a coalition
of Western-style parties or accept an alliance with the powerful
pro-Islamic bloc.
	   Turkey's powerful army strongly opposes any return of the
Islamic party, now known as Virtue. The military sees itself as the
protector of secular principles in this mostly Muslim nation.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz came to power nearly 17 months ago
after Turkey's first pro-Islamic government was forced out of power
by the military in what some people have dubbed a ``soft coup.''
	   But Yilmaz's coalition had little chance of surviving
Wednesday's confidence vote after a key partner defected to the
opposition.
	   Opponents need 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament to topple
Turkey's fourth government since 1995. The three parties that
presented the confidence motion have 298 seats.
	   Yilmaz and his economy minister, Gunes Taner, are accused of
entertaining ties with the mafia and tampering with the sale of a
state bank. It is part of a widening probe into ties between
political leaders and underworld figures.
	   A government collapse could distract officials during a tense
diplomatic battle for the return of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who is seeking asylum in Italy.
	   If Yilmaz is ousted, it would be up to President Suleyman
Demirel to name a premier-designate to try to form a new government
among Turkey's often quarreling parties.
	   Traditionally, the job goes to the head of parliament's largest
party _ now Recai Kutan of the Virtue Party.
	   But Demirel may seek to avoid a confrontation with the military
and pick someone from Turkey's deeply divided secular parties.
	   Most analysts seemed to point at a coalition between Yilmaz and
his longstanding rival, former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
	   The first signals of a rapprochement came Monday when Yilmaz and
Mrs. Ciller had their parties spare each other from corruption
probes in parliament. But the two center-right parties do not have
enough votes in parliament to survive alone.
	   Many believe that Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, could be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
rivalry already brought down a government in 1996.
	   Parties would have 45 days to set up a coalition. If they fail,
the president will appoint a caretaker government to rule until
elections scheduled for April.

Council takes up documents issue, Butler defends his right to

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with council meeting over, statement
expressing support for UNSCOM &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NYR109-110 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In its first response to the new dispute
over sensitive Iraqi documents, the Security Council said it fully
supported the work of U.N. weapons inspectors charged with
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council's one-line and relatively innocuous statement was
issued Tuesday after a three-hour council meeting during which
members were briefed by the top inspector, Richard Butler, on his
efforts to obtain documents he says are necessary to his work.
	   According to his speaking notes, Butler reminded members of his
right to the documents under their own resolutions and noted that
verifying Iraq's disarmament through documents was actually less
confrontational than intrusive inspections.
	   In its statement, the council didn't address the issue of
whether Iraq's reluctance to turn over the documents showed it
wasn't cooperating fully with the inspectors. Iraq promised that
cooperation when _ confronted with U.S. and British airstrikes _ it
agreed Nov. 14 to resume working with arms experts after a two-week
hiatus.
	   The council won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until inspectors report that Baghdad's chemical,
biological and nuclear arms and missiles have been destroyed.
	   Baghdad has balked at turning over the papers, arguing in three
separate letters over the past week that they don't exist, were
already shown to inspectors or had no relevance to the work of
Butler's U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Russia and China, which along with France take a more
sympathetic line towards Baghdad, pressed Butler on Tuesday to
explain how he knows the requested documents actually exist,
diplomats attending the closed meeting said.
	   ``We want to make sure that what we are discussing is based on
fact,'' said Sergey Lavrov of Russia.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, told reporters that the
council itself should decide what documents were relevant to the
work of UNSCOM.
	   ``Then the council should consider what steps to take,'' he
said.
	   While the council only authorized its president, Peter Burleigh
of the United States, to issue a statement saying members
``expressed their continued full support for UNSCOM in fulfilment
of its mandate,'' other ambassadors went further in describing the
tone of the debate.
	   ``Most members of the council were disappointed that Iraq so far
has not produced any documents,'' British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said. ``There are documents that exist that the council
felt should be produced.''
	   He noted that Tuesday's statement was only the first in what he
said was a continuing matter.
	   Although the United States and Britain have said military
airstrikes are still an option, U.S. officials seem willing to wait
to assess the full scope of Iraq's cooperation before deciding how
to proceed.
	   ``As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have no doubts at all that
these are important documents, and we would hope and expect that
the Iraqis would cooperate and supply them,'' Burleigh said earlier
Monday.
	   He rejected suggestions that Butler may have asked Iraq for too
much, too soon.
	   ``I am both personally and officially sure that UNSCOM wouldn't
have asked for documents that it didn't need, that weren't
important to its work in verifying the disarmament process in
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Butler's speaking notes said the conditions Iraq placed on one
particular document _ an air force diary of munitions used during
the Iran-Iraq war _ were inappropriate. Iraq has said relevant
portions of the document may be viewed by inspectors only in the
presence of the U.N. envoy to Baghdad.
	   Butler cautioned against transforming the technical task of
evaluating the document into ``something of a political process by
following the procedure proposed by Iraq,'' according to the
speaking notes.

Australian state bans boxing for under 14s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ New South Wales Sports Minister
Gabrielle Harrison announced Wednesday an immediate ban on children
aged under 14 from taking part in competitive boxing.
	   Harrison said cabinet agreed to the ban and she had legal advice
it could be enforced immediately.
	   Promoters will face fines of 2,200 Australian dollars (1,400 US
dlrs) for breaking the order.
	   ``It's a shame that children will still be able to go across the
border and fight in other states but at least New South Wales has
done the right thing,'' she said.
	   The ban would also apply to competitive kickboxing.
	   She said support for the ban from the public and the boxing
community had been strengthened since the issue emerged earlier
this month after children as young as 10 competed in underage
boxing titles on the Gold Coast in Queensland state, where there is
no age ban. (djp)

FDA issues new warnings about Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued
new warnings about the popular impotence drug Viagra, saying that
doctors should be cautious about prescribing it to whole groups of
men, including those who recently had heart attacks or have very
high blood pressure.
	   Some 130 Americans who took Viagra have died since the drug hit
the market last spring, the majority from heart attacks, the FDA
said Tuesday.
	   There's no proof Viagra caused the deaths, the FDA stressed.
Heart disease kills hundreds of Americans daily, and manufacturer
Pfizer Inc. estimates that 6 million prescriptions have been filled
since April and that 3 million Americans use it.
	   Still, the FDA notified doctors Tuesday that Pfizer was changing
the drug's label to add more explicit warnings.
	   ``We want to make sure people are aware there are some men (for
whom) it's not advisable,'' said the FDA's Dr. Lisa Rarick. But if
used by the right men, she said, ``we still believe it's safe and
effective.''
	   Viagra's label already stressed that anyone who takes
nitrate-containing medicines, such as the heart drug nitroglycerin,
should never take Viagra. The mix can cause a deadly drop in blood
pressure. It also can cause vision problems.
	   But added to Viagra's label were warnings that:
	   _The FDA has received reports of heart attacks, sudden cardiac
deaths and hypertension among Viagra users.
	   _Doctors should be cautious about prescribing Viagra to men who
had a heart attack, stroke or life-threatening arrhythmia in the
last six months, or who have significantly low blood pressure,
significantly high blood pressure _ greater than 170/110, a history
of cardiac failure or unstable angina or the eye disease retinitis
pigmentosa. Viagra has never been studied in men with these
conditions, so no one knows its safety.
	   _Sexual activity itself is risky for certain men with
cardiovascular disease; and for those men, Viagra obviously ``is
inadvisable.''
	   _Doctors should consider whether temporary drops in blood
pressure caused by Viagra, especially during sexual activity, would
harm a heart patient before prescribing him the drug.
	   _The FDA has received reports of men suffering painful,
prolonged erections after taking Viagra. An erection that lasts
longer than four hours requires prompt medical attention.
	   Impotence often is a symptom of underlying heart disease or high
blood pressure, or even a side effect from drugs used to treat
those conditions. Thus, Pfizer stressed Tuesday that men seeking
Viagra first need a full medical exam.
	   But a consumer advocate long critical of Viagra called the
warnings inadequate, saying Britain two months ago barred men who
had had heart attacks or strokes from using Viagra while the FDA
just urges cautious consideration of those men.
	   ``FDA's dangerous collaboration with Pfizer, resulting in
inadequate warnings, will help maintain sales of Viagra while
jeopardizing the health of American men,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of
Public Citizen, who said there is no way to know how many men may
have suffered side effects. ``This is a drug that affects blood
vessels all over the body.''
	   The FDA has reports of 242 possible deaths among Viagra users,
but only could verify that 130 occurred among Americans. The rest
were foreign reports or hearsay, Rarick said.

Former junta leaders facing problems eight years after pardon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Eight years after a presidential
pardon freed the leaders of Argentina's junta, they are once again
answering to charges from the ``dirty war.''
	   Accusations of child kidnapping have landed two of the junta's
top leaders, Emilio Eduardo Massera and Jorge Videla, back in court
and in the hands of authorities.
	   Massera, a former naval admiral, was detained on Tuesday, after
spending the day in a Buenos Aires court answering questions by a
federal judge investigating a case of two children born to parents
in captivity.
	   His lawyer, Miguel Arce Aggeo, vehemently denied the accusations
and said he planned to appeal the charges. Massera faces another
court appearance on Dec. 3, in a separate case involving other
children born to parents in captivity.
	   Aggeo said he would seek to have Masseras, 73, put under house
arrest _ an option for accused persons over the age of 70.
	   Videla, a former army lieutenant general, is already confined to
his home following a judge's ruling in June.
	   A civilian court sentenced Massera and Videla to life in prison
in 1985 for human rights violations, but they were pardoned in 1990
by President Carlos Menem. The child kidnapping charges are not
covered by the pardon.
	   Children born to dissidents in captivity were frequently adopted
by military officials. Massera's case involves the children of
Patricia Roisinblit and Cecilian Vinas, two women who disappeared
in 1976 from the Navy Mechanics School.
	   Vinas' son was raised by one of Massera's chief assistants,
until learning the identity of his real parents when he was 20,
after DNA test. His biological father, Reynaldo Penin, was also
among the disappeared.
	   As the navy's highest ranking officer, Massera was responsible
for the Navy Mechanics School, a training facility converted into a
clandestine torture and killing center during the seven-year
military dictatorship.
	   The Argentine government says nearly 9,000 people disappeared
during the military regime's war on leftists and disidents. Human
rights groups allege the figure is closer to 30,000. Those groups
praised Massera's detention on Tuesday.

until learning the identity of his real parents when he was 20,
after DNA test. His biological father, Reynaldo Penin, was also
among the disappeared.
	   As the navy's highest ranking officer, Massera was responsible
for the Navy Mechanics School, a training facility converted into a
clandestine torture and killing center during the seven-year
military dictatorship that became known as the ``dirty war.''
	   The Argentine government says nearly 9,000 people disappeared
during the military regime's war on leftists and dissidents from
1976-1983. Human rights groups allege the figure is closer to
30,000. Those groups praised Massera's detention on Tuesday.

Iraq pours hundreds into the streets, stands tough in crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government pledged not to relent
in its standoff with the United Nations over documents on its
weapons programs, pouring hundreds of people into the streets
Tuesday to protest U.N. sanctions.
	   The government's tough words came a day after it acknowledged an
assassination attempt on one of its most powerful officials. The
assailant was reportedly shot to death in the attack on Izzat
Ibrahim, a deputy with the influential Revolutionary Command
Council.
	   Hundreds of Iraqis, many of them elderly women clad in black,
arrived by bus for the government-orchestrated demonstration
outside the U.N. headquarters to denounce their suffering under the
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   A convoy of cars drove along the street carrying wooden coffins
meant to symbolize children who have died as a result of the
sanctions.
	   At the heart of Iraq's dispute with the United Nations are the
sanctions, which have wrecked an economy that was once one of the
Arab world's most prosperous. Iraq claims 5,000 children die every
month, and U.N. officials acknowledge one in three suffer from
malnutrition.
	   The U.N. Security Council cannot lift the sanctions until U.N.
inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to build
them.
	   Last week, the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, asked
for more documents _ from personal diaries to a log of weapons used
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ as part of that search. But Iraq
insists the documents were either irrelevant, have already been
destroyed or were already turned over to inspectors.
	   Failing to cooperate could delay a U.N. review of progress on
dismantling the weapons that Iraq hopes will ease the sanctions,
and the United States has warned it is still willing to attack if
Iraq fails to do everything the U.N. inspectors ask.
	   ``I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring
unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and
requests of the (U.N.) inspectors,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Tuesday in Washington.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Iraqis were
clearly trying to ``dodge their obligations'' to provide the
documents.
	   Late Tuesday, the Security Council said in a statement that it
fully supported the inspectors, though it didn't address the
documents controversy. Diplomats said that during the three-hour
meeting, Russian and Chinese officials pressed Butler to explain
how he knows the requested documents actually exist.
	   The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and five escort ships
arrived Tuesday in the Persian Gulf, bringing the number of U.S.
warships in the region to 19.
	   Despite the military buildup, however, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz declared the Iraqis would not submit to the demands,
``regardless of the dangers.''
	   Iraq averted what appeared to be an imminent U.S. and British
attack by agreeing on Nov. 14 to allow U.N. inspectors to resume
their work. Since then, inspectors have made daily visits to
suspected weapons sites, and Iraqi officials have provided full
cooperation.
	   Butler remains the subject of rancor by the Iraqi government,
which views him as instrumental in prolonging the sanctions.
Al-Iraq, an official newspaper, called Butler a ``cursed devil and
mad bull'' on Tuesday.

Big Japan banks to request up to 5.78 trillion yen in funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's big banks plan to ask the government for up
to 5.78 trillion yen (47.8 billion) in public bailout funds, but
the government says it could press the banks to accept even more
money.
	   Releasing interim earnings Tuesday, seven of the country's nine
trust and long-term credit banks announced they would apply for
between 1.48 trillion yen (dlrs 12.2 billion) and 1.68 trillion yen
(dlrs 13.9 billion) in public funds to boost their capital bases.
	   Added to the plans that nine commercial banks announced last
week, Japan's big banks will request between 4.88 trillion yen
(dlrs 40.3 billion) and 5.78 trillion (dlrs 47.8 billion).
	   The money will come from a 25 trillion yen (dlrs 206.6 billion)
pool of public funds created last month to help stabilize Japan's
ailing financial system.
	   But the planned funding requests, while huge, are still dwarfed
by Japan's mountain of bad and doubtful bank loans, estimated by
some analysts at over 80 trillion yen (dlrs 660 billion).
	   Asked at a news conference Tuesday whether the banks' plans were
sufficient, an official of the government's Financial Supervisory
Agency said the agency would study the applications.
	   The government will ask banks to ``deepen their plans if
necessary,'' said FSA deputy head Hideichiro Hamanaka.
	   The nine trust and long-term credit banks all reported parent
pretax profits for the six months of the fiscal year through
September, but six forecast losses for the full year as they write
off huge amounts of bad loans.
	   Most of the nine banks also announced stepped-up plans to
streamline their operations, including staff cuts, salary
reductions, and branch closures at home and abroad.
	   Yasuda Trust and Banking Co., for example, said it would halve
its number of employees to about 2,000 by March 2001. Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corp. said it would reduce overseas operations by
one-third next fiscal year, from about 23 currently.
	   ``Public funds are a necessary condition for stability of the
Japanese financial system, but not an adequate solution,'' said
Yuji Watanabe, a managing director at Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   He said the outlook for Japanese banks still depended on how
soon the economy emerged from recession and whether slumping stock
prices began to rebound.

Friendship soccer match between Thailand and Qatar turns ugly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A friendly soccer match ahead of next
month's Asian Games between Thailand and Qatar degenerated into a
brawl Tuesday after a Thai referee handed a yellow card to a Qatar
player.
	   The match was suspended without further play after players from
both sides punched, kicked and body-slammed each other for several
minutes.
	   Several players on both teams suffered slight injuries.
	   There were no problems in the first half, which saw both sides
go scoreless.
	   But when referee Ekchai Thanatdeunkhao yellow-carded a Qatar
striker for knocking down a Thai player seven minutes into the
second half, his teammates protested vociferously.
	   After five minutes of arguing, the fighting started when a Qatar
player pushed the chest of a Thai player.
	   Fans and, according to Thai TV Channel 7, some Thai reporters,
also joined in the fighting, throwing debris from the sidelines.

OPEC faces oil glut dilemma, though production cuts not seen
</HEADLINE>
likely &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries meets Wednesday in Vienna with oil prices
hovering at their lowest point in a decade, though it doesn't
appear further production cuts are likely.
	   Despite some voices in favor of cutting production _ Kuwait and
Algeria foremost among them _ most believe heavyweight Saudi
Arabia's fear of losing market share to overproducers in the group
may immobilize the organization.
	   But OPEC can't duck the issue, analysts say.
	   ``OPEC has two options. They can address the issue today, or
they can address this issue in January or February,'' said Doug
Terreson, international oil analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Houston.
	   ``There's no way the market can recover without reductions in
supply, which is painful _ but not as painful and unpopular as
13-dollar a barrel oil,'' said Terreson.
	   Possible strategies that have emerged in advance of the meeting
include trying to tighten compliance with production cuts,
introduced in June to soak up the glut; extending the cuts; cutting
further; and calling an emergency meeting of heads of state of 11
OPEC countries, an idea proposed by Algeria and supported by the
United Arab Emirates.
	   Prices and production levels will be the center of attention.
OPEC's average price per barrel has slumped by about a third over
the past year.
	   The low prices are the consequence of OPEC's decision last
winter to boost production. That coincided with a slump in demand
from economically weakened Asia, resulting in an oil glut.
	   In New York, light sweet crude oil for January delivery fell 33
cents to dlrs 12.12 a barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, sinking toward its 12-year low of dlrs 11.42 reached in
June.
	   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, where prices are
normally lower, Brent crude for delivery in January fell to a
15-year low of dlrs 11.19 a barrel.
	   OPEC cut production by 2.6 million barrels a day in June in an
attempt to address the excess oil. Including Iraq, which is under
U.N. export sanctions, OPEC produces 26.9 million barrels a day.
	   But the move hasn't worked, and members are getting nervous.
	   Iraq on Tuesday called on OPEC to take action, saying it has
lost around dlrs 2 billion in revenue in its food-for-oil deal with
the United Nations.
	   ``We have been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day
and exporting between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we
failed to meet our own financial ceiling,'' Faleh al-Khayat,
director-general of studies and planning in Iraq's Oil Ministry,
told The Associated Press.
	   Other countries are suffering as well. Kuwait says its oil
revenues will slump by 45 percent this year.
	   One problem is compliance. A key offender is Venezuela, which
says it doesn't like OPEC's quota system.
	   Speaking to reporters late Tuesday, Venezuelan oil minister
Erwin Arrieta indicated OPEC needed to become more imaginative
about doing business by reaching out to new markets and alliances.
	   But falling prices Tuesday indicated markets are looking for
more than that.
	   Iraq has stayed away from past meetings because of the U.N
restrictions that keep it from selling its oil freely and is not
sending a minister to Vienna.
	   Along with Iraq, the OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A Spanish economist who sparked
nationwide alarm by telling his family that he and his daughter had
been kidnapped by supporters of former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet was only joking, officials said.
	   Government officials confirmed late Tuesday that Gonzalo de
Cordoba Lopez and his 23-year-old daughter Ana were both safe in La
Serena, a resort 500 kilometers (350 miles) north of the capital
Santiago.
	   The news of the kidnap broke when two other daughters of the
64-year-old Spanish economist said they received an e-mail message
from their father saying, ``We are being held until Wednesday, when
the ruling in London on Sen. Augusto Pinochet will be announced.''
	   Police quickly investigated the message, and two special units
were sent to investigate. But Tuesday night, Television Nacional
said the economist had called the station saying the reported
kidnapping was a joke.
	   An Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said de Cordoba had admitted sending the message to his
family as a hoax. Officials would not say whether he faced any
criminal charges, but Chile has laws against causing public alarm.
	   The reported kidnapping had caused panic in Chile, where
tensions have been high since Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest in London
on a Spanish warrant for genocide, torture and murder charges.
There have been several incidents of violence against Spaniards.
	   The British House of Lords will rule Wednesday, Pinochet's 83rd
birthday, whether state immunity must be recognized to him.
	   De Cordoba and his daughter had entered Chile last Friday as
tourists from neighboring Bolivia.

	   So who are the star quarterbacks of the 1998 National Football
League season?
	   Most of the above, plus old standbys John Elway and Steve Young.
	   Even if you can't figure out the algebra by which the
quarterback ratings are determined, this much is clear:
	   _The top eight quarterbacks in those ratings are 33 or older,
nine counting Brister, who has had a hand in six wins filling in
for Elway in Denver but hasn't thrown enough passes to officially
qualify.
	   _Six of the bottom seven are under 26, including Peyton Manning
and Ryan Leaf, the first two picks in last April's draft.
	   ``It's just harder and harder for a young quarterback to walk
right in and play,'' says Brian Billick, the Minnesota offensive
coordinator who has overseen Cunningham's revival. ``You have all
these bright defensive coaches who keep coming up with different
looks that guys fresh out of college just don't see.''
	   Cunningham is perhaps the best example, leading the league in
passing at age 36 after sitting out the 1996 season running a
marble and granite business in Las Vegas. He signed last year with
Minnesota and this year took over when Brad Johnson broke an ankle
in the second game, leading the Vikings to a 10-1 record.
	   That followed 11 turbulent seasons in Philadelphia in which
Cunningham made dozens of highlight reels but never got beyond the
second round of the playoffs. He was a run-first, throw-second
quarterback with a reputation for selfishness. He read defensive
linemen to look for running opportunities, even though all QBs are
taught to take their clues from the safeties.
	   After two serious injuries, he was let go by the Eagles after
the 1995 season, sat out, then re-emerged in Minnesota as a classic
pocket passer whose skills mesh perfectly with the trio of Cris
Carter, Jake Reed and rookie Randy Moss.
	   ``The game is different for me now,'' says Cunningham, who now
reads safeties like everyone else. ``Sitting out that year gave me
the perspective to see what I had to do to become successful.''
	   Each of the old quarterbacks has a different story, although
there's one common denominator _ all but Chandler began the year as
backups.
	   Flutie, whose magic at Boston College in 1984 won him the
Heisman Trophy, drifted through the USFL, to the Bears and
Patriots, and finally to Canadian Football League, where he was MVP
six times in eight seasons. He was signed for the minimum to back
up Rob Johnson in Buffalo, took over when Johnson was injured and
has led the Bills to six of their seven victories.
	   Chandler, 33, went through Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Arizona and
Houston as a marginal starter, a quarterback who could look good
for a while but was better off as a backup because he couldn't stay
healthy. But he's 13-4 as a starter with the Falcons, who may be
headed for their first NFC West title since 1980.
	   Brister, 36, started 71 games with no particular distinction for
the Steelers, Eagles and Jets. He spent 1996 without a job and
landed last season in Denver as Elway's backup. This year, he's
finished two games for the unbeaten Broncos and is 4-0 as a
starter, even running 38 yards for a TD two weeks ago in Kansas
City.
	   Testaverde, the first pick by Tampa Bay in the 1987 draft, set a
modern NFL record by throwing 35 interceptions in 1988, and was
up-and-down in Cleveland and Baltimore. He was released in the
offseason by the Ravens, signed by the Jets as a backup to Glenn
Foley and replaced Foley when he got hurt. He's 8-1 as a starter
and has 18 touchdowns to four interceptions, after entering the
season with a 175-183 TD-interception ratio.
	   Hollas, 31, is a career third stringer who threw for 645 yards
for the Bengals in 1991 and 1992 and none since. But he's 4-1 as
Jeff George's replacement in Oakland _ he's not pretty, but he
wins.
	   ``You learn a lot just watching tape and practicing,'' Billick
says. ``You hang around long enough and you're very aware.''
	   While the Broncos seek to become the NFL's first unbeaten team
since the 1972 Dolphins, they should remember that that Miami team
started 38-year-old Earl Morrall at quarterback in eight of 14
regular-season games because Bob Griese was injured.
	   And of the 32 Super Bowl winners, 18 have had quarterbacks 30
years or older.

Drugs effective in helping youths with obsessive-compulsive
</HEADLINE>
disorder &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Newly published research confirms that drugs are
effective in treating children with obsessive-compulsive disorder,
an illness that afflicts hundreds of thousands of youngsters across
America.
	   The newest medication shown safe and effective in compulsive
youngsters is sertraline, marketed as Zoloft, according to the
study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   ``There are lots of kids who are undiagnosed, or if they are
diagnosed are not being treated,'' said the study's lead author,
Dr. John S. March of Duke University Medical Center. He said drugs
work best when combined with psychotherapy.
	   The findings bring to three the number of similar drugs that
have worked well in large trials among compulsive children at
multiple medical centers, said Dr. Judith L. Rapoport of the Child
Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Health.
	   The Food and Drug Administration used the study, funded by
Zoloft maker Pfizer Inc., as evidence for approving the drug for
treating OCD in children. It already had been approved for the
disorder in adults.
	   The other OCD drugs approved for both age groups are
clomipramine, marketed as Anafranil, and fluvoxamine, marketed as
Luvox. In addition, the antidepressant fluoxetine, marketed as
Prozac, has been reported in small trials to work well in childhood
OCD, Rapoport said.
	   Like the other drugs, Prozac buoys brain levels of serotonin, a
chemical messenger between nerves that is key in mood, sleep and
appetite. Its role in OCD is unknown, but sufferers of OCD often
have overlapping problems with depression, anxiety or eating
disorders, previous studies show.
	   Hallmarks of OCD are senseless and repetitive thoughts and
behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination or
danger. An example would be excessive hand-washing.
	   Up to half of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder show the
first signs of it in childhood. And up to half of children
identified with OCD respond to drug treatment, Rapoport wrote in an
editorial accompanying the study.
	   Estimates of the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder
range from 0.5 percent to 1 percent of U.S. school-age children, or
about 250,000 to 500,000 youngsters.

Stocks, dollar lower in Tokyo morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell in morning trading
Wednesday following an overnight drop on Wall Street. The U.S.
dollar was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sled 169.02 points,
or 1.11 percent, to 14,995.62 at the end of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the index rose 384.70 points, or 2.60 percent, closing
above the psychologically-important 15,000-point level for the
first time since Aug. 25.
	   Share prices retreated Wednesday after the Dow Jones industrial
average lost 73.12 points overnight to finish Tuesday's session at
9,301.15. On Monday, the Dow rose 214.72 points, closing at a
record high of 9,374.27. Its previous record was 9,337.97 points,
set in July.
	   Traders said the Nikkei took a breather after gaining about 800
points in the past two trading days.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 6.69 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,148.92.
The TOPIX gained 24.87 points, or 2.20 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, profit-taking pushed the U.S. currency
lower against the yen. Selling of the German mark to buy yen also
indirectly affected trading in favor of the Japanese currency,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 120.78 yen at midday, down 0.84 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 121.18
yen overnight.
	   But trading in general remained thin and sluggish ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday in the United States on Thursday, with many
U.S. players on the sidelines, they said.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
0.910 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.920 percent, driving its
price up to 107.82 yen from 107.73 yen.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ For Ayman Hamada, a confectionery
and foods importer from the Gaza Strip, time is money, and for
years, both have been wasted.
	   Twelve-hour delays at dusty border-crossings, bumpy rides on
buses without air-conditioning across the Egyptian desert and
grueling bureaucratic procedures and inspections by three separate
forces were all part of an average business trip to buy quality
cookies.
	   But with the opening of the Gaza International Airport Tuesday,
Hamada's exhausting trek is coming to an end. After ten years,
Cairo will soon be only an hour away.
	   ``I look at the airport as a step forward for organizing and
improving the economy in the Gaza Strip,'' said Hamada, a
30-year-old father of five. ``I hope the peace agreement will ease
my life as a merchant.''
	   Israeli control over borders and trade with the Palestinian
autonomy has done little but strangle a fledgling Palestinian
economy barely off the ground.
	   Palestinian businessmen have needed to apply for Israeli
permission to travel abroad and be allowed back in. When permission
is granted, it's usually through land routes, rarely from Israel's
international airport near Tel Aviv. Crossing on foot from Gaza to
Egypt means going through Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian
checkpoints.
	   Although Gaza sits on the Mediterranean coast, the Palestinians
do not yet have a seaport of their own. So imported shipments go
directly to Israeli ports and customs inspections. Merchandise can
only be collected with Israeli permits. If Israel imposes a
security closure on Palestinian territories, it means perishables
sit and rot while other materials run up enormous port fees few
Palestinians can afford to pay.
	   For exporters, it's just the opposite. Palestinian farmers who
can't get their flowers and tomatoes onto Europe-bound flights from
Israel have nowhere to sell their crops.
	   The latest Mideast peace agreement signed last month in
Washington is changing all of this. A seaport for Gaza is in the
works. An unfettered highway linking Palestinian cities in the West
Bank with the Gaza Strip _ the two are on opposite sides of Israel
_ is to open soon.
	   And now the airport, all marking a significant loosening of the
Jewish state's security grip over the Palestinians and a forward
march toward statehood.
	   For Hamada, sending his cooking oil, tea and biscuits on air
freight from Egypt direct to Gaza would be easier but more
expensive. For the time being, he'll continue to have them shipped
to an Israeli port.
	   But a dlrs 95 return ticket on Palestine Airlines is a business
expense he can more easily afford. ``I used to spend 12 hours
driving from here to Cairo, in addition to many complicated
procedures,'' he lamented.
	   At work in his modest street-level office in downtown Gaza,
Hamada, a burly man with dark brown hair and a bushy moustache said
he was cautiously optimistic about peace.
	   The airport ``is a very good step,'' he said. ``This will ease
our situations.''

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A crippled Japanese
whaling ship which caught fire last week off the Australian coast
was making its way back to Japan under its own power, a salvage
operator said Wednesday.
	   The environmental group Greenpeace said on Monday that a salvage
tug from Port Moresby was expected to be sent to assist the Nisshin
Maru, which caught fire last Thursday about 600 nautical miles east
of Mackay, Queensland.
	   The tug had been on standby, but was no longer required, the
tug's operator said Wednesday.
	   United Salvage technical manager Trevor Cosh said from Sydney
that he believed the Nisshin Maru was now heading back to Japan
under its own power.
	   ``We've had the salvage tug on standby (in Port Moresby) since
last Friday afternoon to go to its assistance, but as of last night
we were advised that the vessel was making way under its own
devices and our services were not required,'' Cosh said.
	   Cosh said he did not know which port the Nisshin Maru was bound
for.
	   No injuries were reported from the fire.
	   The 7,575-ton Nisshin Maru, carrying a crew of 111, was on its
way to Antarctic seas for Japan's annual research whaling program.
That program has often been criticized because meat from the whales
killed for research is sold on the market in Japan, with proceeds
going to the whaling industry.
	   Though consumed less and less, whale meat has been a traditional
food in Japan.
	   Commercial whaling is banned throughout the world. Japan has
continued with research in an effort to gather evidence that would
persuade regulators to lift the ban.

Italian rider has agreed to ride Yamaha beginning next season

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Italian racer Max Biaggi began testing his new
500-cc bike on Wednesday for next year's World Motorcycle
Championship after reaching agreement with Yamaha Corp. to ride
with the Japanese manufacturer.
	   Yamaha spokesman Minoru Morimoto said Biaggi and Yamaha will
officially sign a contract when negotiations with sponsors are
concluded and other details of the contract are finalized.
	   Ordinarily, Morimoto said, testing follows the official signing,
but ``we are not following the usual procedure because (Biaggi)
wanted to test our new machine right away.''
	   In Rome, Italian television RAI reported that Biaggi's ``very
rich'' two year contract is estimated at dlrs 11 million.
	   Biaggi, a former world 250 cc champion, made his debut in the
500 cc class this year with Honda, finishing second to Australian
Michael Doohan in the championship standings.
	   Biaggi is expected to return home to Italy after his two-day
test ride in Japan.

AOC admits McGeoch resignation ``embarrassing''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic Committee president
John Coates admitted the resignation of high-profile Sydney
organizing committee board member Rod McGeoch was ``embarrassing''
for SOCOG and reflected badly on the 2000 games organizers.
	   McGeoch, dubbed ``Mr. Olympics'' by the press after heading the
successful bid team, stood down Tuesday after days of infighting
over claims he sought a fee to speak on the Olympics to a United
States business delegation.
	   Coates, also a SOCOG board member, tried to play down the
significance of McGeoch's departure Wednesday.
	   ``No doubt the issue's gone around the world but put it in
context, it's one board member of 14,'' Coates said at a news
conference.
	   But he admitted the latest in a line of significant departures
was ``slightly embarrassing,'' and there had been ``some damage to
SOCOG and the Olympics.''
	   International Olympic Committee director general Francois
Carrard said he was unconcerned about reports of disunity on
SOCOG's board.
	   ``The operations are in place and are running well and
smoothly,'' Carrard told Australian Associated Press in London.
Coates was the official who had briefed Carrard on the events and
said he would discuss it further with IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch at a meeting this weekend.
	   Fellow SOCOG board member John Valder used stronger language to
describe McGeoch's decision.
	   ``The resignation is enormously damaging to the board,'' Valder
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Wednesday.
	   ``Anybody who thinks the board is going to sort of close the
chapter on this today or tomorrow and open a new one I think has
got another thing coming. This is going to leave a very nasty
legacy behind it and I think it will take probably a long while for
it to go away.''
	   Coates said the resignation would reflect unfairly on SOCOG
president Michael Knight, who is also the New South Wales state
government's Olympics Minister.
	   Knight is considered a major source of the SOCOG infighting and
conservative-aligned McGeoch pointedly did not mention the Labor
Party member in his resignation statement.
	   Coates denied that McGeoch was a frontrunner to replace Knight
as SOCOG president if the Labor Party lost power in a state
election next year. Coates said he had told McGeoch that he would
not have the AOC support for the role of president or chief
executive of SOCOG in 1991, before the Olympics were awarded to
Sydney.
	   Coates admitted that with an election coming within the next six
months the Olympics would continue to be subjected to political
influence.
	   ``There's no doubt to me that the Olympics will be a political
football in the next 4-5 months,'' said Coates. ``I would think it
would be very tempting for the opposition (Liberal Party) to seize
on anything wrong in SOCOG.''
	   Knight said Wednesday that he was disappointed to see McGeoch, a
well-connected lawyer, lost to SOCOG.
	   ``Obviously nobody can be happy with the public slanging that's
gone on in the past few days,'' Knight said. ``I personally wish
Rod McGeoch had stayed on the board.''
	   McGeoch resigned after details were leaked from within SOCOG
that he had allegedly demanded a fee of Australian dlrs 8,000 (U.S.
dlrs 5,210) to speak to an American delegation on behalf of SOCOG.
	   McGeoch and his personal assistant released declarations Tuesday
stating that he had no knowledge of the fee request and that it did
not come from SOCOG.
	   ``Our international image in the Olympic community and elsewhere
must be suffering as a result of what's gone on in the last
fortnight and I'm doing my part to make it stop,'' McGeoch said.

Deposed in coup, prince returns to power as parliament president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With parliament ringed by security
forces, Prince Norodom Ranariddh was elected National Assembly
speaker Wednesday in a bid to share power with the arch-rival who
deposed him in a coup last year.
	   The prince was elected at the first meeting of the assembly
since legislative elections in July. After months of disputing the
victory by strongman Hun Sen's party and blocking formation of a
new government, Ranariddh struck a deal with his rival two weeks
ago.
	   Under the agreement, Hun Sen will be Cambodia's sole prime
minister and an upper chamber of Parliament, a Senate, will be
formed, somewhat diluting the assembly's powers.
	   The prince was formally named assembly president by a 105-7 vote
with support from Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party. One lawmaker
abstained, seven were absent and two votes were declared invalid.
	   The opening of the assembly marked a symbolic end to the
political limbo that Cambodia has suffered since Hun Sen deposed
the prince as co-prime minister in a violent coup in July 1997. But
it remains to be seen if the longtime rivals can bring much-needed
stability and development to the desperately poor country.
	   Speaking to reporters as he arrived, with the assembly
surrounded by armed police and other security forces, Ranariddh
expressed optimism that the pair have learned from their bloody
conflicts and would now work together.
	   ``I feel confident and hope for a brighter future of our
country, Cambodia,'' Ranariddh said. `We have learned the lessons
from the past.''
	   The opening session also marked the return of former finance
minister Sam Rainsy to parliament since he was expelled from
Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party and the legislature in 1995
after clashing with the prince and Hun Sen over government
corruption.
	   Sam Rainsy formed his own party and placed a distant third to
FUNCINPEC and the CPP in the election. After being excluded from
the coalition negotiations, the firebrand politician is now
opposition leader in parliament, controlling 15 of 122 seats.
	   ``It is a great day today,'' Sam Rainsy said at the gates of the
legislature. ``I remember very well the day when I was expelled
from this place, the National Assembly, three years ago. Now I am
happy to return, not only alone, but with 14 other MPs.''
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh formed an alliance against Hun Sen in
1997, but he criticized Ranariddh on Tuesday, saying the prince's
party had exchanged ``the people's blood for positions in
government.''
	   Ranariddh denied that on Wednesday, saying his party had agreed
to join the government in the interests of the people.
	   ``On the contrary, we have decided to join the coalition in
order to stop the bloodshed,'' the prince said.
	   With a new government in place, Cambodia is hoping for a
resumption of foreign aid and entry to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, suspended since last year's coup.

Beijing bids for 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese Olympic Committee saying it will study
the bid in grafs 4-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Beijing will bid to host the 2008 Summer
Olympics, the government announced Wednesday.
	   Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the application to Wu
Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, during a
ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Beijing lost to Sydney by two votes in the 1993 selection for
the host of the 2000 Games. China chose not to pursue the 2004
Olympics.
	   The Chinese Olympic Committee will now study Beijing's bid and
any applications from other Chinese cities at a meeting in January,
said He Huixian, a committee spokeswoman. If the committee approves
a bid, it will forward the application to the International Olympic
Committee, she said.
	   She said Beijing lost the 1993 vote for the 2000 Games because
of ``non-sports factors'' and that many people in the Chinese and
international sporting world have since urged the city to bid
again.
	   Criticism of China's human rights record was a factor in the
1993 vote.
	   Officially, competition to host the 2008 Games hasn't even
begun. The International Olympic Committee will open the bidding
process next year, and the selection of the host city will take
place in 2001.
	   Other countries that have already announced they will bid
include Canada, Japan, Turkey, Spain and Argentina.

Chinese student calls for lower telephone costs for Internet use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Saying that surfing the Internet is too expensive
for the average Chinese, a university student is organizing an
Internet strike to call for lower rates, a Hong Kong human rights
group reported Wednesday.
	   Huang Zhenqiang says the cost of 20 hours of Internet use in
China is about 250 to 350 yuan (dlrs 30 to dlrs), or about a fourth
of the average monthly salary.
	   In statements, he blamed unnecessarily high fees on China
Telecom, a government monopoly that has become ``a greedy
monster,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said in a statement.
	   Huang, an economics student at Nanjing University, urged Chinese
Internet users to stay off-line for one day from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1
and every Sunday afterward until the phone company lowers costs.
	   Huang said in his statements that an Internet strike had
succeeded in Germany earlier this month to protest Deutsche
Telekom's rates.
	   In Germany, Thomas von Treichel, who organized the strike, said
more than 6,000 Internet sites went blank for a day. It was not
known how many surfers participated.
	   The former state-owned German telephone monopoly said plans for
lower rates already had been presented to government regulators.
	   The Chinese government has tried to control what type of
information the growing numbers of mainland Chinese Internet users
can receive. The Ministry of Information Industry operates servers
that block sites the government considers salacious or subversive,
including some Western news organizations.
	   Yet the government's control is not complete. On-line democracy
magazines, for example, use roving addresses on the Worldwide Web
that are hard to block.

Terrorist scare heightens security for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Security efforts for the upcoming Asian
Games have come under increased scrutiny after a terrorism scare in
the Thai capital that forced the closure of the U.S. Embassy.
	   A special operations center to coordinate security for the 13th
Asian Games, which will run from Dec. 6 to Dec. 20, was set up this
week, said Maj. Gen. Chatchawan Suksomjit, chief spokesman for the
Thai National Police.
	   The center was established after the embassy reopened its doors
Monday after closing for three days in what embassy officials said
was a response to a Nov. 12 ``worldwide caution'' from the State
Department of possible terrorist actions against American targets.
	   Senior police officials indicated the decision to close the
embassy was just a precautionary measure to tighten up security
procedures.
	   But local press reports claiming that Iraqi terrorists had
entered the country underlined the need to guard against mayhem at
the upcoming games, Asia's premier sporting competition. The
reports suggested the games could be one target.
	   ``The incident has raised our awareness of the need to be firm
with security issue,'' said Chatchawan, who also commands the
police's legal affairs division. ``But from what we have gathered,
the recent closure of the American Embassy was a safety-first
measure.''
	   Besides extra security measures for the embassy personnel, other
agencies and the military are on an alert in case terrorist attacks
are attempted, he said.
	   Interpol, the border patrol police, the immigration bureau and
the Bangkok city police are some of the agencies that have been
brought into the special operation command set up to prevent
terrorism.
	   Five months ago, Bangkok's police formed a special 32-man
counter-terrorism unit for the games, which will bring 6,000
athletes from 41 countries to Bangkok.
	   The unit was commissioned after two months of special training
in the use of different weapons and tactics, including how to deal
with hostage situations.
	   In May, Thai soldiers and police staged their first
anti-terrorism exercise in 10 years, an eight-day exercise
involving 400 people.
	   A closed-circuit television network will link the special
operations center with some 15,000 police officers coordinating
Bangkok's horrendous traffic and performing general duties.
	   The Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee had the games'
housing authority carry out a disaster prevention drill at the
athletes' village in the main sports complex Tuesday.
	   Helicopters, fire trucks, medics and military personnel were
deployed to the Thammasat University complex to simulate an
emergency operation.
	   ``We did not made any compromises in spite of the fact that
economic crisis has taken its toll on the country,'' Chatchawan
said. ``It's a matter of national pride.''
	   Security at hotels and shopping centers that are likely to
attract large numbers of foreign visitors has been beefed up, while
controls at border crossing points have been tightened, he said.

Asian Games goods fakers face arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian Games haven't even started,
but already the country's amazing fakers are stamping out imitation
``Chai-yos'' _ the Games' elephant mascot _ and other official
souvenirs, a key organizer said Wednesday.
	   Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary general of the organizing
committee, said police have already arrested a few violators who
face fines of up to 200,000 baht (dlrs 5,500).
	   Thailand is known for its superb imitations of products ranging
from name brand shirts to fancy wrist watches. Most of this
activity is in violation of international copyright laws.
	   ``We have contacted the Office of Intellectual Property Rights
Protection to arrest the violators,'' said Santiparb.
	   He said inspections have been conducted in several garment
centers and souvenirs shops in Bangkok, where sales of non-licensed
Asian Games souvenirs were spotted.
	   Thailand expects to reap dlrs 5 million from sales of souvenirs
which have been copyrighted by the organizers of the Dec. 6-20
games, Santiparb said.

DiMaggio marks 84th birthday in hospital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Engleberg comments to WPIX &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American baseball Joe DiMaggio marks his 84th
birthday Wednesday in a Florida hospital where he reportedly is
battling lung cancer and had a heart attack last week.
	   DiMaggio's lawyer denied reports by two television stations that
the Hall of Famer had a heart attack or is gravely ill.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said Tuesday after
TV stations in New York and Miami reported that DiMaggio's
condition had worsened. ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this
information on the television and were very upset.''
	   Engleberg said Tuesday night that what some had thought was a
heart attack was an alarming drop in blood pressure. The lawyer
said he became so concerned that he summoned a priest to give last
rites.
	   Engleberg said DiMaggio was put on a ventilator to help him
breath but his condition improved to the point he was take off the
life-support system.
	   The lawyer made his comments to WPIX of New York, which
televised New York Yankees games for 48 years before losing the
broadcast contract after last season.
	   On Monday night, the station reported DiMaggio had lung cancer
and had suffered a heart attack, citing three sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The station added that DiMaggio had a tumor
removed from his lung last month.
	   On Tuesday, WTVJ-TV in Miami, also citing unidentified sources
close to DiMaggio, broadcast the same report. The NBC affiliate
said it confirmed that DiMaggio had a heart attack and lung cancer
and said he was on a ventilator.
	   Engelberg, a longtime friend who has communicated DiMaggio's
condition to the media since the baseball great was hospitalized on
Oct. 12, responded to the reports angrily.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack,'' Engelberg said in
statement transmitted to news media. ``This is totally false and he
is not in `grave condition.' ''
	   The statement went on to say that DiMaggio had advised Engelberg
to no longer discuss his health condition with anyone other than
his doctors and his immediate family.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio will be celebrating his 84th birthday at Memorial
Hospital with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, some of
the hospital staff, his brother, Dom, myself and a few close
friends,'' Engelberg said.
	   ``Again, Mr. DiMaggio never had a heart attack. We were all
shocked by this false rumor.''
	   Engelberg's statement did not address the issue of lung cancer
or any surgery to remove a tumor. When DiMaggio entered the
hospital in Hollywood, Florida, the attorney said his friend was
suffering from pneumonia and a lung infection.

Man accused of murdering teen-aged Canadian accuses friend,

instead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A young man facing capital charges in
the murder-rape of a Canadian teen-ager accused his friend of the
killing Tuesday, and shouted that a prosecution witness of lying.
	   ``Liar,'' Justis Smith, 19, yelled from the prisoner's dock at
Seon Smith, who is not related to the accused.
	   The outburst came on the second day of the murder trial at the
Supreme Court of Bermuda.
	   The witness had said that he did not see blood on the sleeve of
Kirk Mundy, whom he saw on the night 16-year-old Rebecca Middleton
was killed.
	   Middleton, of Belleville, Ontario, was killed in the early hours
of July 3, 1996, when she and a friend took a ride offered by three
men on motorcycles. The vacationing Middleton had been assaulted
and stabbed 16 times, then left at a roadside. Her friend, Jasmine
Meens, was returned home safely.
	   Mundy, who was arrested with Justis Smith and initially charged
with murder, pleaded guilty in 1996 to the lesser charge of being
an accessory after the fact. He is serving a five-year sentence.
	   At his trial, Mundy, a 21-year-old native of Jamaica, testified
he and Middleton had consensual sex in a park just before she was
killed.
	   He said he left her to wash in a stream, heard her screaming,
and turned to see what looked like Smith punching her in the face.
	   Smith has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder, which
carries a mandatory sentence of death by hanging in Bermuda, though
no convicts have been executed here in more than 20 years.
	   Smith's lawyer, Briton John Perry, alleged that Mundy was the
killer.
	   Seon Smith told the court that he and his cousin were on their
way home from a nightclub early July 3 when his car broke down.
Mundy, who was on a motorcycle, stopped to ask if he needed help.
	   Perry suggested Seon Smith was afraid of Mundy, who had a
reputation for violence.

Increase in asthma cases holds mysteries for scientists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A breath-robbing disease that can prove
fatal if untreated, asthma is on the rise in many countries,
especially among children, and scientists aren't sure why.
	   But experts on the disease, speaking this week at the Global
Conference on Lung Disease in Bangkok, have identified enough
suspects to suggest measures to lower the risk of becoming a
victim.
	   The conference, bringing together 1,500 experts from 90
countries, is the largest meeting of its kind held in Asia for a
decade. Doctors and scientists are sharing information on lung
ailments ranging from tuberculosis to the effects of smoking.
	   Most triggers for an asthma attack _ marked by wheezing,
difficulty in breathing and a tightness in the chest _ are well
known. They include allergic reactions to animal hair and dander,
plant pollens and certain foods and food additives. Attacks can
also be induced by exercise.
	   What is less clear is what makes people susceptible to asthma
and why their numbers _ and mortality rates _ have been increasing
in the past two decades, especially among children.
	   Asthma is most prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, Great
Britain and the United States. It is much lower is Asia, about 8
percent on average region-wide, compared with a global average of
14 percent, said Dr. C. Lai of Hong Kong's Prince of Wales
Hospital.
	   From country to country within Asia, and within each country,
the variations are significant. Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong have
a high rate of asthma; Indonesia and China low ones.
	   In China and Malaysia, the prevalence of disease tops out in the
capital cities.
	   The data for Asia, said Hong Kong's Lai, ``suggest that the
Western lifestyle, that of the English-speaking societies, may be
important in explaining why asthma is becoming more prevalent.''
	   While there is a consensus that the rise in asthma is linked to
``Westernization'' or ``urbanization,'' no one knows exactly why.
	   In Australia, asthma is actually more of a problem of rural
areas, said Ann Woolcock of the Institute of Respiratory Medicine
in Sydney.
	   And the world's highest rate of asthma is found in Tristan da
Cunha, a remote South Atlantic archipelago, which ``is certainly
not polluted, though maybe stressed,'' she said, referring to the
theory that stress can bring on asthma.
	   The disease is less prevalent among groups with poor hygiene
than among those where washing is frequent. There is a theory that
some infections give protection, but that remains unproven.
	   At least as baffling is why the younger siblings in families are
relatively protected from the disease compared to their older
brothers and sisters, a pattern that seems to hold true everywhere.
	   Scientists are fairly certain what contributes to asthma
susceptibility. Exposure to allergens is a major factor, with the
house dust mite a prime culprit. Secondhand tobacco smoke has also
been blamed.
	   Some studies show that lowered intake of fish may weaken asthma
resistance. Some evidence suggests that intake of omega-3, a fatty
acid found in fish oil, may be beneficial in keeping the disease
away.
	   Omega-3 has also been linked to healthy cardiovascular and
immune systems and the development and functioning of the brain and
eyes.
	   Based on such findings, Woolcock has come up with a
``non-pharmaceutical'' scheme for reversing the rising asthma
trend.
	   Top of her to-do list: allergic avoidance. Dust mites are the
most important to avoid, followed closely by cats and certain types
of mold. Dogs and maybe cockroaches figure less importantly, then
plant pollens. Zero environmental tobacco smoke is a must.
	   Breast feeding is ``certainly protective,'' Woolcock said, as is
a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, oily fish and low salt.

Indian voters cast ballots under watchful eye of police

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Voters in the world's largest democracy
cast ballots in state elections Wednesday, under the watchful gaze
of thousands of police guarding polling stations.
	   Elections frequently turn violent in India, and with more than
80 million eligible voters and 100,000 balloting sites, authorities
had a lot of ground to cover.
	   ``We have done everything we can, and we expect totally peaceful
elections,'' K.J. Rao of the Election Commission told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   Pre-election surveys predicted gains by the Congress Party over
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the
federal government, because of widespread discontent over the
soaring prices of vegetables.
	   In particular, voters have been outraged by a 700 percent rise
since September in the price of onions _ a staple food that has
figured prominently in the election campaigns.
	   Opposition candidates calculated their weight in onions, while
others drove around Delhi wearing garlands of the pungent
vegetable.
	   Voters will choose 626 state legislators from among 5,000
candidates Wednesday in four of India's 26 states: the northern
state of New Delhi; Rajasthan in India's western desert; the
central state of Madhya Pradesh; and the tiny northeastern state of
Mizoram.
	   Two of the four states are now ruled by the BJP and the other
two are governed by the Congress Party, which dominated national
politics until recent years.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said at a BJP rally Monday
the election will not affect his 19-party coalition, although most
analysts see the vote as the first test of popularity for his
government, which came to office in April.
	   If the BJP fares poorly, it could increase tension within the
coalition, where relations already are precarious.
	   An Uttar Pradesh state Cabinet minister was expelled from
Rajasthan on Tuesday where he had brought hundreds of armed
supporters, purportedly to support a local candidate. The minister,
Raja Bhaiya, is accused in a string of criminal cases and Election
Commission sources said it was feared he could incite violence.

Terrorist scare heightens security for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Security efforts for the upcoming Asian
Games have come under increased scrutiny after a terrorism scare in
the Thai capital that forced the closure of the U.S. Embassy.
	   A special operations center to coordinate security for the 13th
Asian Games, which will run from Dec. 6 to Dec. 20, was set up this
week, said Maj. Gen. Chatchawan Suksomjit, chief spokesman for the
Thai National Police.
	   The center was established after the embassy reopened its doors
Monday after closing for three days in what embassy officials said
was a response to a Nov. 12 ``worldwide caution'' from the State
Department of possible terrorist actions against American targets.
	   Senior police officials indicated the decision to close the
embassy was just a precautionary measure to tighten up security
procedures.
	   But local press reports claiming that Iraqi terrorists had
entered the country underlined the need to guard against mayhem at
the upcoming games, Asia's premier sporting competition. The
reports suggested the games could be one target.
	   ``The incident has raised our awareness of the need to be firm
with security issue,'' said Chatchawan, who also commands the
police's legal affairs division. ``But from what we have gathered,
the recent closure of the American Embassy was a safety-first
measure.''
	   Besides extra security measures for the embassy personnel, other
agencies and the military are on an alert in case terrorist attacks
are attempted, he said.
	   Interpol, the border patrol police, the immigration bureau and
the Bangkok city police are some of the agencies that have been
brought into the special operation command set up to prevent
terrorism.
	   Five months ago, Bangkok's police formed a special 32-man
counter-terrorism unit for the games, which will bring 6,000
athletes from 41 countries to Bangkok.
	   The unit was commissioned after two months of special training
in the use of different weapons and tactics, including how to deal
with hostage situations.
	   In May, Thai soldiers and police staged their first
anti-terrorism exercise in 10 years, an eight-day exercise
involving 400 people.
	   A closed-circuit television network will link the special
operations center with some 15,000 police officers coordinating
Bangkok's horrendous traffic and performing general duties.
	   The Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee had the games'
housing authority carry out a disaster prevention drill at the
athletes' village in the main sports complex Tuesday.
	   Helicopters, fire trucks, medics and military personnel were
deployed to the Thammasat University complex to simulate an
emergency operation.
	   ``We did not made any compromises in spite of the fact that
economic crisis has taken its toll on the country,'' Chatchawan
said. ``It's a matter of national pride.''
	   Security at hotels and shopping centers that are likely to
attract large numbers of foreign visitors has been beefed up, while
controls at border crossing points have been tightened, he said.

Camacho cited with traffic infractions

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Hector ``Macho'' Camacho's bouts outside
the ring continued Tuesday when state troopers charged the former
boxing champion with driving infractions after a motorcycle
accident.
	   Camacho, 36, fled after crashing his motorcycle, the Florida
Highway Patrol said.
	   Trooper Chris Neutzling went to his home nearby and gave Camacho
three tickets for reckless driving, driving on a suspended license
and operating a motorcycle without endorsement.
	   ``He dumped his motorbike and afterward went back to his house,
and they had to go and write him some tickets,'' said Lt. Chuck
Williams, an FHP spokesman.
	   The incident Tuesday was the latest for the flamboyant fighter
known as much for his flashy boxing as out-of-the-ring antics.
	   In March, he was charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol. That arrest violated a one-year probation he received in
February after pleading guilty in a marijuana-possession case.

Witness: Police used methods meant for communist rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Interrogation methods designed for
communist rebels were used on two people who said former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim had illegal sex, a witness testified
in his corruption trial Wednesday.
	   The prosecution in the case against Anwar is trying to prove
that he abused his power last year by forcing the police to arrest
those who had written to the authorities about his alleged sexual
misconduct.
	   Taking the stand on the 13th day of the closely watched trial,
Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police intelligence, said
Anwar had ordered him to force retractions out of Ummi Hafilda Ali
and Azizan Abu Bakar.
	   Ummi, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had accused Anwar
of having sex with her brother's wife. Azizan, the politician's
former chauffeur, claimed he was sodomized by his boss.
	   ``Anwar gave us the following orders. He wanted them to be
interviewed so they would be frightened into retracting their
allegations,'' Amir told the court.
	   Earlier witnesses had spoken about how the two were put through
a police procedure called ``neutralizing,'' a form of interrogation
to force people to change their views.
	   On Wednesday, Amir said that until the Anwar case, the method
had been used only against communist rebels and religious fanatics.
	   ``This is the first time we applied this kind of technique'' in
a case not involving communists or extremists, he said.
	   Anwar's lawyers have tried to counter the accusations of
corruption and sexual misconduct by suggesting that there was a
conspiracy to frame the former protege of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Anwar, 51, has repeatedly denied the 10 charges against him,
saying they were fabricated to eliminate his political challenge to
Mahathir.
	   Police arrested Anwar on Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired.
International concern grew after he appeared in court with a black
eye and bruises on his body, allegedly from a police beating while
in custody.
	   Anwar's case has sparked a political reform movement in the
Southeast Asian nation which has led to dozens of anti-government
demonstrations.
	   The trial was recessed during last week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Some of the leaders and ministers from the APEC members,
including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, expressed
support for the reform movement and met with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, during the trade summit.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio marks his
84th birthday Wednesday in a Florida hospital where he reportedly
is battling lung cancer and had a heart attack last week.
	   DiMaggio's lawyer denied reports by two television stations that
the Hall of Famer had a heart attack or is gravely ill.
	   ``This is totally false,'' Morris Engelberg said Tuesday after
TV stations in New York and Miami reported that DiMaggio's
condition had worsened. ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this
information on the television and were very upset.''
	   Engelberg said Tuesday night that what some had thought was a
heart attack was an alarming drop in blood pressure. The lawyer
said he became so concerned that he summoned a priest to give last
rites.
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio was put on a ventilator to help him
breath but his condition improved to the point he was take off the
life-support system.
