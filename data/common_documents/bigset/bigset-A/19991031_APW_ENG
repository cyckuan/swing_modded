<HEADLINE> Voters Decide on Coyotes' Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes, the last of  
Arizona's four major professional franchises to ask for public 
money to help finance a new arena, will find out Tuesday if voters 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Although owner Richard Burke hasn't said, the team's future in  
Arizona could be tied to the success of a developer's proposal to 
build an 18,000-seat arena in a refurbished Scottsdale mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes want to leave America West Arena in downtown  
Phoenix, where Burke claims to be losing up to $10 million a year 
because of reduced revenue streams and the relatively small 
capacity for hockey (16,210). 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of tax dollars helped build homes for the NBA's Phoenix  
Suns and baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks. Both projects were pushed 
through in the infancy of a taxpayer backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the electorate has caught up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Michigan playing hockey,'' said project opponent  
Alan Kaufman, who helped found Redevelopment Imposes Generally 
Higher Taxes. ``I'm not opposed to the Coyotes -- they're a fine 
organization. I'm not opposed to the Ellman Cos. -- they're fine 
developers. I'm opposed to squandering $352 million in tax dollars 
on corporate welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent poll showed voters favoring the project, though recent  
elections suggest winning approval could be a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Cardinals -- the only other team to face an arena  
vote -- came away empty May 18 when residents in Mesa rejected a 
$1.8 billion complex that included a domed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 7, Scottsdale residents rejected a $653 million plan to  
create a waterfront cultural complex along a city canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The canals project had no sports ties but the funding mechanism  
was the same tax rebate for developers proposed for the Coyotes 
arena at Los Arcos Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottsdale voters already have approved the creation of a  
stadium district with taxing authority for the Coyotes arena. Now 
they have to authorize the use of public funds.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 5 Hurt in Ball St. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) -- One person died and at least five other were  
injured when shooting erupted at a Ball State University fraternity 
party early Sunday.

	More than one person apparently walked into an off-campus  
fraternity house and started firing during a party, police Lt. 
Steven Stanley said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Charitable Donations Jump 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donors gave 16 percent more in contributions  
to the nation's most popular charities last year than in 1997, a 
survey of the top 400 charities shows. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest increase since The Chronicle of Philanthropy,  
the weekly ``Newspaper of the Nonprofit World,'' began compiling 
contribution statistics in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	For a seventh consecutive year, the Salvation Army was the  
favored organization as it raised $1.2 billion in cash and donated 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The YMCA of the USA and the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift  
Fund saw donations increase by more than 25 percent and took second 
and third on the list with $629.3 million and $571.9 million 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an increase in giving, there is also an  
increase in need'' as families move from welfare to work, often in 
low-paying jobs, Salvation Army spokeswoman Theresa Whitfield said. 
``We are grateful for the public's generosity. ... As long as the 
economy is doing well, people will have more to give.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Whitfield did, most organizations attributed the generosity  
boom to the booming economy, which made 1998 one of the best 
fund-raising years in a quarter-century for many groups. 
Grant-making foundations thriving with a strong stock market also 
helped fuel the largess. 
</P>
<P>
	Online donations, an increasingly popular approach to fund  
raising, also helped boost many organizations' take. The 
fifth-ranking American Red Cross, for instance, has a spot on its 
World Wide Web site to ``Donate Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chronicle gathers financial data on cash and in-kind  
donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. Only 
private donations are tallied, not money from governments or fees 
charged by organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the list were 139 colleges and universities, 37 international  
groups and 27 religious organizations. Educational institutions 
collectively fetched the most support, bringing in $11.6 billion, a 
21.9 percent increase from the year before.

<HEADLINE> President Trump Would Handle Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump said Sunday that as president, he  
personally would handle U.S. trade talks and would restore respect 
from countries doing business with America. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York developer, considering a run for president as the  
Reform Party nominee, attacked the trade policies of a number of 
U.S. allies: 
</P>
<P>
	--France is ``a terrible partner.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Japan is ``ripping us big league.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Germany ``wants to take over the world economically. They  
failed militarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Saudi Arabians ``have boats bigger than any boats you've ever  
seen. They have houses all over the world, including Palm Beach. 
... This is getting a little ridiculous. I mean, the money they 
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Trump also took aim at North Korea and  
China for ignoring U.S. overtures and building nuclear weapons. He 
branded Cuba's Fidel Castro as ``absolutely a killer and should be 
treated as such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He placed a large share of the blame on U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky -- ``Nobody ever heard of her'' -- 
and said he would hold that title in a Trump administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``My lawyers have checked, and the president has the  
authority,'' Trump said in a statement released by his presidential 
exploratory committee after his television appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our trading partners would have to negotiate across the table  
from Donald Trump, and I guarantee you, the rip-off of the United 
States would end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures announced two weeks ago showed the nation's trade  
deficit running at a record annual rate of $252 billion through 
August. The deficit with Japan, at a record in July, was slightly 
narrower at $6.4 billion in August but still was running 13 percent 
higher than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fox, Trump said clues to the Clinton administration's trade  
policy can be found in the president's personal business deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do a deal a minute, and the one deal he did was Whitewater.  
That turned out to be, you know, unfortunate,'' Trump said. Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invested in the failed 
Arkansas land development that led to a protracted independent 
investigation and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Clintons' latest deal, a $1.7 million house in New  
York's Westchester County, showed the president's lack of business 
acumen, Trump said. If Trump -- who described himself as ``by far 
the biggest developer in Manhattan'' -- had done the deal, he said, 
he could have saved the Clintons at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the house. My people know the house,'' Trump said.  
``They came up to me, they said, 'Why did he pay so much?' I said, 
'I don't know.' So why do we give everything away to Japan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Trump enters the 2000 Reform Party campaign, a decision he  
promised by the spring, a principal opponent will be Pat Buchanan. 
He quit the Republican Party and is to announce his candidacy 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' he was asked about  
Trump's idea to name himself trade representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think The Donald would be much better off at HUD, quite  
frankly: Housing and Urban Development,'' Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms stretched across the southern Plains  
and Mississippi Valley on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stormy weather followed the path of air circulating around a  
low pressure system centered over eastern Texas that was dragging 
moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	A curving band of storms stretched inland across Mississippi and  
southeastern Louisiana, then looped westward across Arkansas and 
Oklahoma and southward again into north-central Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest rainfall was in Arkansas, with more than 2 inches  
falling overnight in parts of the state and up to 4 inches reported 
south of Fort Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms were expected to move eastward and were likely to  
spread into parts of Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of the storm system, showers and some scattered  
thundershowers developed Sunday over southern Florida and a few 
showers also appeared along the Georgia-South Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	More rain is expected for Florida this week as the remnants of  
Tropical Storm Katrina are expected to move from Mexico's Yucatan 
Peninsula out into the Gulf of Mexico and gather strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The revived storm was likely to move ashore Wednesday on  
Florida's Gulf Coast north of Tampa, the National Weather Service 
said. No rainfall predictions had been issued yet but the first 
showers were expected Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, a weak cold front pushing across the Great Lakes  
produced a thin line of showers that stretched from the Ohio Valley 
into New England. Most of the scattered showers were light. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a cold front moving out of the Pacific Northwest  
produced clouds and scattered, light showers across parts of 
Washington, Idaho and western Montana. The showers turned to 
occasional snow showers at higher elevations of the Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
	The front also produced stiff wind, with gusts to more than 50  
mph reported in parts of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers also were possible in North Dakota and northern  
Minnesota during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 13 at Alamosa, Colo., to a midday reading of 85 at 
Fort Myers and St. Petersburg, Fla. The lowest wind chill was 3 at 
Stampede Pass, Wash., and the highest heat index by midday was 93 
at Miami.

	Body, Debris Found in EgyptAir Crash  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Searchers retrieved debris and one body from an  
EgyptAir jetliner that crashed off Nantucket Island early today. 
The plane, bound for Cairo with 217 people on board, plunged 33,000 
feet in two minutes, crashing into the ocean. Dozens of American 
tourists were among the passengers. ``We do not know at this point 
what caused the crash,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board. ``We are beginning what may be a long 
investigation.'' Authorities say there is little hope of finding 
survivors in the chilly Atlantic waters. 

</P>
<P>
	Crash Relatives Gather at NYC Hotel  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Families of those aboard EgyptAir Flight 990  
were brought to the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy Airport to pray 
and wait and grieve, an all-too-familiar scene at the hotel. The 
Ramada has been a center for grieving relatives before. Three years 
ago, in the days following the crash of TWA Flight 800, hundreds of 
family members converged here. The scene was repeated in 1998 after 
the crash of SwissAir Flight 111. Today, 20 to 30 relatives 
gathered, one family per table, consoled by workers from the Red 
Cross, Muslim clerics and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

	Second Election Likely in Macedonia

	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- A former communist and a candidate of  
the ruling center-right coalition were headed for a runoff election 
after Sunday's voting to choose a successor to President Kiro 
Gligorov. Macedonian voters chose from among six candidates -- four 
Slavs and two ethnic Albanians -- against a backdrop of rising 
ethnic tensions that have worsened since the fighting in 
neighboring Kosovo. Official results were not expected before 
Monday. However, the Social Democrats claimed late Sunday that 
their candidate, Tito Petkovski, had won 38 percent of the vote.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With concern rising over the lack of  
adequate shelter, the U.N. refugee agency flew tons of warm 
clothing into Kosovo on Sunday to help hundreds of thousands of 
people cope with the coming Balkan winter. An Antonov 124, the 
world's largest transport plane, landed at Pristina's airport with 
60 tons of clothing for women and children, according to Peter 
Kessler, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The 
clothing includes winter underwear for children and women, children 
coats, and 65,000 pairs of children's boots.

	Clinton Renews Call for Teachers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today criticized Congress  
for failing to support his education priorities. Clinton noted that 
many GOP lawmakers touted their role in supporting a program that 
would hire 100,000 new teachers nationwide. ``Now, suddenly, the 
Republican majority has changed its mind,'' he said. The president 
was referring to an education spending bill before Congress that 
does not carry forward the plan to hire new teachers. Clinton timed 
his remarks with the release of a study by the Council of Great 
City Schools that detailed benefits of low teacher-pupil ratios in 
schools.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Pilots and American Airlines agreed yesterday to  
end a dispute that led to a pilot sickout and the cancellation of 
hundreds of flights earlier this year. The deal comes nearly a year 
after American acquired a controlling stake in Reno Air. The 
dispute erupted over differences in how to absorb the lower-paid 
Reno Air pilots into the company. The dispute peaked in February 
with an 11-day pilot sickout that inconvenienced more than 600,000 
travelers and cost American $225 million. The union was ordered by 
a federal judge to reimburse American $45.5 million for ignoring a 
court order to return to work

four touchdown passes, two to Shawn Jefferson, as New England beat 
the Arizona Cardinals 27-3 today to improve to 6-2, the Patriots' 
best start since 1980. Bledsoe, who completed 14 of 22 for 276 
yards and was not intercepted, threw for three touchdowns in the 
first half as New England blew open a 20-0 lead. Dave Brown, 
starting at quarterback for the Cardinals (2-5) in place of injured 
Jake Plummer, completed 12 of 33 passes for 107 yards and was 
intercepted twice.

<HEADLINE> World All-Stars 10, US Women 9, OT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- It was Mia Hamm's turn to take a day off.  
Her teammates could have used her. 
</P>
<P>
	Patience Avre of Brazil scored on a rebound just 21 seconds into  
overtime Sunday to lead the world all-star team back from a 
four-goal deficit and to a 10-9 victory over the U.S. women's World 
Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisha Venturini scored three goals and Tiffany Milbrett added a  
goal and three assists to lead the U.S. team which was missing its 
most recognizable player as a roster of 19 for the 12-city tour 
allows each player to miss one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett conceded that Hamm remains the key to the future  
success of women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mia is a marketing magnet,'' Milbrett said. ``She put women's  
soccer on the map. She still has that. There are a lot of 
first-time fans who just watched the World Cup this summer and some 
who just watched the final. That's not the most enormous amount of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha of Brazil had four goals and Avre added three for the  
world stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss, the Americans took a lap around the arena's  
turf after the game to the enthusiastic cheers of 7,392 at the 
Allstate Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the best crowd so far,'' Venturini said.  
``It was an exciting game and they were really into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's next stop is Philadelphia on Nov. 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun, but I enjoy outdoor a little bit more,''  
Venturini said. ``It's good for a short period of time. It's more 
tiring. It's different and I don't think we really have the 
strategy down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett said the players are concerned about getting hurt on  
the artificial surfaces of the indoor venues. But she said the 
players also understand the importance of generating fan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the game of soccer. If you get hurt, you get hurt,''  
Milbrett said. ``What's good is that hopefully, sponsors and others 
who keep an eye on this are seeing the support we're getting and 
the numbers we're drawing. That will speak for itself.''

<HEADLINE> Examples of Organ Donation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Numerous efforts are under way to increase organ donation. Among  
them: 
</P>
<P>
	--The United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the nation's  
transplant system, is studying the people who are most likely to 
get ``yes'' answers from families considering donation. The network 
has sent questionnaires to dozens of transplant coordinators, 
seeking information about their personalities and education. The 
network plans to follow up with interviews about how they approach 
their jobs. The results may help organ banks with hiring or 
training. A report is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Department of Health and Human Services awarded nearly $5.3  
million in grants in September to 18 projects that will test new 
ways of increasing donation. The projects include reaching out to 
minorities and using the Internet to notify families of their loved 
one's wishes. The department plans to award $8 million more over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Society of Transplant Surgeons is encouraging  
public officials and other community leaders publicly to state 
their willingness to donate organs. Called the ``First Family 
Pledge,'' one goal is to get families talking about donation. 
</P>
<P>
	--HHS now is requiring hospitals that receive Medicare payments --  
essentially, all hospitals -- to notify local organ banks of every 
death. The idea is that organ banks may identify as potential 
donors some people missed by hospital personnel. HHS also hopes to 
get transplant specialists involved with cases earlier.

<HEADLINE> Orange Co. Fault Said To Be Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE,Calif. (AP) -- A newly discovered fault beneath the  
coastal section of Orange County could generate a bigger earthquake 
than previously believed, according to a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-mile blind thrust fault, which runs from Huntington Beach  
to Dana Point, was discovered in March. At that time, researchers 
estimated that it could generate a magnitude-7.0 earthquake every 
2,500 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers now believe the fault could cause a  
magnitude-7.3 earthquake, according to a study published in 
November's ``Geology'' magazine, which hit the news stands last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault appears to be similar to the blind thrust fault system  
that caused the 1994 Northridge quake, which struck with a 
magnitude-6.7, killing 72 people and causing an estimated $40 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind thrust faults produce quakes when one side pushes upward  
but does not break the surface. Others, like the San Andreas fault, 
are strike-slip systems that generate quakes when one side moves 
horizontally against the other.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 5 Hurt in Ball St. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) -- A group of men who were turned away from a  
college Halloween party early Sunday opened fire on the small 
house, killing one man and wounding five others. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people had packed into the home after a Ball State  
University fraternity party. About 4 a.m., a car pulled into an 
alley behind the house and began firing into the home, said Marlon 
Glass, 31, who was at the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, in a student neighborhood near campus, was riddled  
with bullet holes, and a trail of shell casings still led from the 
back door to the alley Sunday afternoon. The windows of some of the 
half-dozen cars parked behind the house had been shot out. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and witnesses said at least two people had fired as many  
as 40 rounds from outside, and investigators were looking in to 
whether shots were fired inside the house as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Brown, 28, a former Ball State student from Gary, Ind.,  
was found dead in the kitchen, Muncie police Chief Joe Winkle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were in fair condition Sunday at Ball Memorial  
Hospital and two were treated and released, a hospital spokesman 
said. One person was treated at the scene.

	``It was a private gathering. It wasn't a wild party or anything  
like that. It just got out of hand,'' said David Keels, an advisor 
for Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. A Kappa Alpha Psi member who lived

<HEADLINE> Packers Look Beyond Holmgren Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Antonio Freeman heard yet another  
variation of the only question people have been asking him this 
week: So, Antonio, what do you think about facing your former 
coach? 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman rolled his eyes.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about Mike with you guys,'' he said to two television  
reporters. ``You know, this is going to be a pretty good game on 
Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holmgren's ballyhooed return to Lambeau Field and the  
accompanying off-field issues have overshadowed Monday night's 
intriguing on-field matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the 
Seattle Seahawks, two 4-2 teams looking to hang on to the top spots 
in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers dismantled San Diego 31-3 last Sunday in their best  
performance of the year, while the Seahawks also looked sharp in 
beating Buffalo 26-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike and I don't put on the pads and go out there,'' Packers  
coach Ray Rhodes said. ``The only people who are going to decide 
this game are on the field. I don't know why everybody talks about 
Mike and myself as if we're going to decide things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay and Seattle run essentially the same offense, though  
Packers offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis is much more of a 
risk-taker than Holmgren was during his seven years in Green Bay. 
The Packers had the league's top-ranked offense earlier in the 
season, while Seattle is averaging nearly 50 yards per game less 
than Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's offensive troubles haven't been helped by a subpar  
season from Ricky Watters, who is averaging just 3.2 yards per 
carry this season. The Seahawks, who are looking to go 5-2 for the 
first time since 1987, still think they can run against the 
Packers' shaky defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been missing Santana Dotson out there, and of course,  
you can't replace Reggie White,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotson could play on Monday after missing four games with a  
stinger injury, while rookie defensive lineman Cletidus Hunt will 
miss another game with a high ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren failed to take the Packers past the wild-card round of  
the playoffs last season largely because of a terrible defensive 
secondary. GM Ron Wolf drafted three rookie defensive backs that 
have brought the unit back to respectability, but Holmgren said he 
intends to test Mike McKenzie, Antuan Edwards and Fred Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our young guys are tremendous, but there's a toughness you can  
only get from playing in big games,'' Rhodes said. ``They're going 
to be out there on the line on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another return that also should be entertaining. Derrick  
Mayes, the brash wide receiver the Packers dumped on Seattle for a 
low-round draft pick, returns to Lambeau, where he was last seen 
doing the Leap into the crowd during a preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of Joey Galloway, Mayes has become the Seahawks'  
best receiver, with 25 catches for 392 yards and four touchdowns, 
even though he came off the bench in two of the Seahawks' six 
games. His performance will be even more important if Mike 
Pritchard is unable to play because of his sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of skill there that some people here said he  
didn't have,'' Packers safety LeRoy Butler said. ``He always had 
the best hands on the team, and maybe in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes was well-liked by some Packers -- he is one of  
since-retired receiver Robert Brooks' closest friends -- and less 
liked by others, who privately seethed at his tendency toward 
boastful statements and frequent injuries. He wasn't particularly 
close to Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Derrick thinks he's a top receiver in this game,''  
Favre said shortly after the trade. ``I don't know if he is that.''

<HEADLINE> Last EgyptAir Crash Was In 1986 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- EgyptAir hasn't had a plane crash in more  
than 13 years, but the state-owned airline has faced heavy 
criticism over its management and there have been continuous calls 
for it to be privatized. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash on Sunday morning of EgyptAir Flight 990 likely will  
just lead to more urging for change from those critics, who have 
complained about everything from poor cabin service and bad food to 
frequent delays. The plane disappeared Sunday morning into the sea 
off Massachusetts with 199 passengers and 18 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent EgyptAir crash was in June 1986, when a plane  
belonging to EgyptAir subsidiary Air Sinai went down as it 
approached Cairo's airport in bad weather. Twenty-three people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most serious EgyptAir crashes was in 1976, when an  
EgyptAir plane crashed during approach to the airport in Bangkok, 
Thailand, killing 73 people on board and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Oct. 19, an Egyptian identified as Fathallah Khalaf  
managed to commandeer an EgyptAir flight between Istanbul and 
Cairo. He apparently poked a pen into the neck of a crew member and 
forced the plane to fly to Germany, where he was overpowered and 
detained. None of the 46 passengers on board were harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the hijacking was evidence of sloppy security.  
</P>
<P>
	While some newspapers and commentators have long called for  
EgyptAir to become private, EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan 
has ruled that out. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rayan, a former army general, has acknowledged mistakes  
in the way the 67-year-old airline is run and has promised better 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in the process of expanding the airline, which has a fleet  
of 38 planes that fly to some 85 airports abroad and 10 in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir was planning to send a plane to New York Tuesday  
carrying experts to help with the crash investigation, and 
relatives of passengers to help with the identification of victims.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Has No Shortage of Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- EgyptAir may have one of the best safety  
records in the aviation business, but the state-owned company has 
no shortage of critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country riding a tide of privatization, newspapers and  
commentators have clamored for selling the 67-year old company, one 
of the oldest in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir operates in a region where the threat of terrorism is  
never far. In Egypt itself, Islamic militants have been waging a 
bloody insurrection since 1992 to set up a theocratic state. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan said Sunday's crash of  
Flight MS990, which was carrying 199 passengers and 15 crew, is the 
first crash of it's kind for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Rayan insisted EgyptAir has never had a fatal  
incident, SkyNet Research, a Northern Ireland-based developer of 
aviation software, reports four fatal crashes and one fatal 
hijacking involving the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious previous crash was in 1976, when an EgyptAir  
plane crashed during approach to the Bangkok, Thailand airport, 
killing 72 passengers and crew members. In 1985, Egyptian troops 
stormed an EgyptAir plane being held by hijackers in Malta. Sixty 
passengers and crew were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, Egypt said it was increasing security at airports and  
on EgyptAir flights. The measures were not in response to any 
specific terrorist threat, officials said, but were to account for 
increased summer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that indicates that this was a terrorist act.  
... Contact with the plane was cut suddenly which indicates that 
something happened suddenly,'' Civil Aviation Minister Ibrahim 
el-Dimeiri told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed security guards routinely fly on EgyptAir flights.  
Passengers, after going through the normal security check at the 
airport, are again subjected to baggage search just before they 
board the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crash comes after the Oct. 19 hijack of an EgyptAir  
flight between Istanbul and Cairo. It was commandeered by a man 
identified as Khalaf Fadlallah, who apparently poked a pen at a 
flight crew member's neck and forced the plane to fly to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacking ended peacefully in Hamburg where the hijacker was  
overpowered on the tarmac. None of the 46 passengers on board was 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the hijack was evidence of sloppy security and  
blamed the company for not reinforcing the weak cockpit door, which 
Fadlallah kicked open. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other incidents involving EgyptAir have been reported  
in recent memory. In 1996, a plane skidded onto a road and hit a 
taxi while landing in Istanbul. Nineteen people on board the plane 
were injured. EgyptAir blamed Turkish airport authorities for 
asking the plane to land on a short, sloping runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, EgyptAir mechanics found a 16-ounce hammer left in  
the rudder of a new Boeing 777. The hammer caused small fractures 
in the rudder while bouncing around during flight. Boeing 
apologized for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan, the EgyptAir chairman, has acknowledged mistakes in the  
way the company has been operated, but has ruled out privatization 
of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	A former army general who runs the company with an iron fist,  
Rayan has promised better service, saying the $441-million company 
is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of routes to four African countries last year,  
EgyptAir now operates a fleet of 38 planes -- marked by white 
fuselage and blue tails with the red face of the pharaonic falcon 
god, Horus -- to some 85 airports abroad and 10 in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the carrier suffered $60 million in losses when  
tourists stayed away from Egypt after Muslim extremists killed 58 
foreigners in November 1997 at a tourist site in the southern town 
of Luxor.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger: IOC Embracing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Henry Kissinger is convinced the  
International Olympic Committee is embracing reforms that should 
restore its reputation and silence critics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Secretary of State played a significant role in the  
final meeting of the IOC 2000 reform panel, which endorsed nearly 
50 recommendations for reshaping the organization in the wake of 
the Olympic corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key proposals adopted Saturday: eight-year terms of  
office and re-election for IOC members, election of 15 athletes to 
the committee, new rules for financial disclosure and a possible 
ban on visits to bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard part will be getting the reforms passed by the full IOC  
general assembly and winning over skeptics in Congress. Kissinger, 
one of 38 outside delegates on the 82-member reform panel, said the 
IOC ought to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more has been achieved than many of those I consulted  
thought possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will consult with former Sen. George Mitchell, Ken  
Duberstein and other members of the USOC-appointed panel that made 
recommendations last March for overhauling the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Duberstein and Mitchell and I support (the IOC reforms),  
which would certainly be my inclination, I think the Congress will 
go along,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has come under fire at three separate hearings in  
Congress this year. Last month, House lawmakers expressed 
skepticism about the reform efforts and threatened to impose 
sanctions if significant changes aren't adopted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before a House  
panel on Dec. 15 to testify about the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl, who also served as  
an outside member of the IOC 2000 panel, said the reforms are 
significant and the IOC has gone further than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms will be put to an IOC vote in Lausanne on Dec.  
11-12. Measures requiring change in the Olympic Charter will need a 
two-thirds majority of the 100-plus members for passage; others 
will need a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting will come a year after the scandal broke over the  
gifts, cash and other inducements offered to IOC members during 
Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the IOC has purged 10 members implicated in the  
affair, set up an ethics commission, opened its sessions to the 
media, offered to be governed by an international anti-bribery 
treaty and drawn up a slate of sweeping reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one recommendation endorsed Saturday, prospective bid  
cities will be required to meet certain standards before being 
accepted as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crucial question of whether IOC members will be allowed  
to visit bid cities remains unresolved. A proposal for a blanket 
ban on visits failed to win approval of the reform panel, which was 
split on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger offered a compromise that would allow some visits.  
Members would travel as a group for a specified time at IOC 
expense, with no lavish hospitality or gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel agreed to submit two proposals to the December  
session, 
</P>
<P>
	The other issue that failed to generate a consensus was the  
proposed term limit for future IOC presidents. Members will be 
asked to decide whether the president should have a single 
eight-year term or also have the possibility of an additional 
four-year mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who will have served as president for 21 years when  
he steps down in 2001, said the scandal served as a catalyst for 
rebuilding the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make the best of this crisis -- to come out of the  
fire like a phoenix,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sign of the continuing strength, he listed 13 cities ready  
to bid for the 2008 Summer Games: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil; Toronto; Havana, Cuba; Cairo, Egypt; Cape Town, 
South Africa; Seville, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Paris; Istanbul, 
Turkey; Osaka, Japan; Beijing; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not bad,'' Samaranch said. ``I think the health of the  
Olympic Games is fine, very fine -- better than ever.''

<HEADLINE> Quakes Recorded at Japan Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Meteorological Agency urged caution Sunday  
after hundreds of earthquakes were recorded near an active volcano 
in the southern part of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said about 450 earthquakes were registered on the  
south side of Sakurajima, a populated volcanic island inside 
Kagoshima Bay, about 590 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The tremors, none strong enough to be felt by humans, were  
recorded between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,686-foot-high Sakurajima volcano has erupted 121 times so  
far this year, compared with 103 times in all of last year, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said activity at the volcano has increased slightly  
and urged caution as further volcanic activity was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, which sits atop four tectonic plates, is one of the  
world's most earthquake-prone nations.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Auction Brings in $1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dinosaur aficionados plunked down nearly a  
million dollars Sunday for hundreds of prehistoric fossils, 
including one bid of $46,000 for a baby Ichthyosaur, a sea reptile 
that lived 190 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items on the block at the Butterfield and Butterfield  
auction house's Los Angeles office were meteorites, dinosaur claws, 
dinosaur eggs, dinosaur foot and skin imprints, a 5-foot woolly 
mammoth tusk and a 2 1/2-foot fossilized snake. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the items brought in about $980,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bidding for many of these objects was fast and furious as 400  
lots were offered,'' said Levi Morgan, spokesman for the auction of 
natural history specimens. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, meanwhile, was an eclectic mix of curious kids,  
natural history enthusiasts, museum officials and private 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Top dollar was paid for the baby Ichthyosaur, which auctioneers  
had estimated would fetch only $25,000 to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had criticized the idea of selling such rare, ancient  
finds, but David Herskowitz, Butterfield and Butterfield's director 
of natural history, said nothing irreplaceable was put on the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not selling anything museums need and we don't sell  
anything that's new to science,'' Herskowitz said.

<HEADLINE> Moore Injured in Marlboro 500 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Moore was critically injured in a  
terrifying crash early in Sunday's Marlboro 500 at California 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART, said  
Moore sustained massive head injuries and was being airlifted to 
Loma Linda Medical Center ``for further resuscitative efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olvey also confirmed that the injuries were life-threatening.  
</P>
<P>
	On lap 10 of the 250-lap event, Moore appeared to lose control  
as his car coming off turn two. The Reynard-Mercedes skidded onto 
the infield grass, crashed hard into a retaining wall and broke 
into several pieces, with the driver's compartment spinning wildly 
before coming to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Canadian driver broke a finger and suffered a  
deep laceration to his right hand and bruised his right hip on 
Saturday in an off-track incident in which his scooter was struck 
by a car in the paddock area. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was cleared to drive after a six-lap test on the two-mile  
oval late Saturday, starting the 500-mile race last in the 27-car 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 72nd start in Moore's CART FedEx Series career. He  
has five victories, including the season-opening race in Homestead, 
Fla., this season, and was the runner-up in last year's Marlboro 
500.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Harass Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At first, the entrepreneur didn't allow  
the phone calls past his secretary. But the caller politely 
persisted and the businessman finally picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes he hadn't.  
</P>
<P>
	On the line was a guerrilla. He was calling via a stolen  
cellular phone from mountains just outside the capital. He wanted a 
``contribution'' to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Following that call two years ago, the entrepreneur became one  
of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of businessmen in Bogota who now 
discreetly make regular extortion payments to the country's largest 
leftist rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or 
FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hush-hush problem, of incalculable criminal  
proportions,'' says Juan Mesa, who runs Pais Libre, an independent 
citizen rights group that keeps track of extortions and 
kidnappings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite living in a country distinguished since the mid-1980s by  
the world's highest kidnapping rate, Bogota's business class had 
always lived relatively free from the rebel extortion that has long 
afflicted ranchers and oilmen in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed roughly two years ago. No longer a refuge, the  
capital became fertile ground for rebel ``tax collectors'' 
demanding payments known euphemistically as ``la vacuna,'' or 
vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessmen were suddenly confronted by a simple fact of an  
encroaching conflict: Wherever the guerrillas outmuscle the state, 
they demand their due. 
</P>
<P>
	Already masters in roughly half of rural Colombia -- and looking  
for new revenue sources beyond the taxing of illicit drug 
production and ransom kidnappings -- a handful of enterprising FARC 
commanders hatched the urban extortion scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks are minimal. The FARC simply hires criminal bands to  
do any dirty work -- surveillance, enforcement, abduction of 
targeted businessmen who refuse to pay. They never need step foot 
in the capital. Payments are made outside Bogota in rebel-held 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 48-year-old entrepreneur discovered -- after initially  
resisting payment and contacting law enforcement officials -- the 
police could not help him. Nor is he wealthy enough to buy a 
bulletproof car and hire round-the-clock protection for himself and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	So he decided to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the perfect scam,'' said the entrepreneur, who set strict  
conditions in talking to The Associated Press: ``You can't mention 
any particulars about me, about my business or my family or I'll be 
a dead man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This affable man at the height of his earning powers is all  
frayed nerves and paranoia. His wife is ill, consumed by fear. He 
worries constantly about his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You spend all your days, all your waking hours, thinking about  
it,'' he says. ``You try to figure out how to get out of it, but in 
the end you can't. You're trapped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has paid 40 million pesos -- about $30,000 -- divided  
into two annual payments. He says he personally knows 20 people who 
do the same, though the amounts vary. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels identify their victims -- factory owners,  
distributors, restaurant operators -- by consulting business 
magazines and newspaper society pages and by obtaining membership 
lists of Colombia's principal trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Rafael Pardo, national chief of the anti-kidnapping police,  
says 1,015 extortion cases were reported across Colombia in the 
first 8 1/2 months of this year, and authorities made 539 arrests in 
solving nearly half. But Pardo adds that most extortion victims 
never report the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa, of Pais Libre, says he personally knows of between 200 and  
300 companies that have been approached by rebel extortionists. 
Some have refused to pay, but executives of some of those companies 
were kidnapped by guerrillas as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	As the war intensifies in the countryside, there has also been a  
20 percent increase in kidnappings over 1998. Abductions in the 
capital are more brazen than ever, with at least five committed by 
men in traffic police uniforms, Mesa says. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have vowed to make Colombia's upper class feel the  
pain of a conflict whose main victims have long been the rural poor 
-- and the new rash of extortion in Bogota appears an outgrowth of 
that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The result of the extortion and kidnappings is a chill on an  
already moribund economy suffering its deepest recession since the 
1930s. 
</P>

	``What a lot of the top businessmen who've been extorted by the  
FARC do is get their families out and come visit once a week to 
check on their businesses,'' says Salamon Kalmanovitz, a director 
of Colombia's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with moving their families out of the country, often to  
Miami, many business people are removing their money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight businessmen who fled the country because of FARC extortion  
declined interview requests relayed through religious leaders and 
other contacts, largely because they hope to return someday. 
</P>
<P>
	The entrepreneur understands the fear. He says the rebels send  
spies to keep tabs on their prey, and call periodically to check 
up. They mention seeing a child at a discotheque. They know where 
the wife buys groceries. They ask about a recent trip.

<P>
	``Their tone is always very cordial,'' he says. ``What they do  
is demonstrate that they can come take you at any moment.''

<HEADLINE> Charitable Donations Jump 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donors gave 16 percent more in contributions  
to the nation's most popular charities last year than in 1997, a 
survey of the top 400 charities shows. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest increase since The Chronicle of Philanthropy,  
the weekly ``Newspaper of the Nonprofit World,'' began compiling 
contribution statistics in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	For a seventh consecutive year, the Salvation Army was the  
favored organization as it raised $1.2 billion in cash and donated 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The YMCA of the USA and the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift  
Fund saw donations increase by more than 25 percent and took second 
and third on the list with $629.3 million and $571.9 million 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an increase in giving, there is also an  
increase in need'' as families move from welfare to work, often in 
low-paying jobs, Salvation Army spokeswoman Theresa Whitfield said. 
``We are grateful for the public's generosity. ... As long as the 
economy is doing well, people will have more to give.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Whitfield did, most organizations attributed the generosity  
boom to the booming economy, which made 1998 one of the best 
fund-raising years in a quarter-century for many groups. 
Grant-making foundations thriving with a strong stock market also 
helped fuel the largess. 
</P>
<P>
	Online donations, an increasingly popular approach to fund  
raising, also helped boost many organizations' take. The 
fifth-ranking American Red Cross, for instance, has a spot on its 
World Wide Web site to ``Donate Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chronicle gathers financial data on cash and in-kind  
donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. Only 
private donations are tallied, not money from governments or fees 
charged by organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the list were 139 colleges and universities, 37 international  
groups and 27 religious organizations. Educational institutions 
collectively fetched the most support, bringing in $11.6 billion, a 
21.9 percent increase from the year before.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the second time, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard  
M. Larrabee has become a central figure in a high-profile air 
tragedy and the grim recovery effort that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee, commander of the Coast Guard's East Coast district  
since 1997, took the helm Sunday of a massive search effort for an 
EgyptAir plane that disappeared off Nantucket shortly after 2:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, he oversaw the rescue and recovery effort for John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister that included numerous boats, 
planes, and all-terrain vehicles combing Martha's Vineyard beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee oversees Coast Guard operations between Maine and New  
Jersey. He was awarded the agency's highest honor, the 
Distinguished Service Medal, in late July for his leadership in the 
Kennedy crash.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaime Moreno scored his third goal in playoffs  
and Ben Olsen scored his first Sunday as D.C. United beat the 
Columbus Crew 2-1 in the first game of their best-of-3 series for 
the Eastern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 is next Sunday in Columbus, Ohio, as Washington seeks its  
fourth straight conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	The United took the lead in the 15th minute when Moreno tapped  
home a close range shot after Eddie Pope had flicked on a header 
from Marco Etcheverry's corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew, now 0-12 in their history at RFK Stadium, only managed  
one shot on goal in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The United had a scoring chance in the 68th minute foiled when  
Crew goaltender Mark Dougherty stopped Moreno as he was sliding in 
for what seemed to be a sure goal from two yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	The second goal came in the 72nd minute when Ben Olsen fired in  
a low left-footer from 12 yards after receiving John Maessner's 
cross from the left flank. 
</P>
<P>
	After a late offensive surge, Columbus finally got on board in  
the 82nd minute. Brian McBride headed a pass from Stern John into 
the path of Jeff Cunningham who shot past Tom Presthus from 10 
yards out. It was Cunningham's second postseason goal. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third straight year United and the Crew have met in  
the conference finals. United swept the series in 1997 and beat the 
Crew in three games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty made six saves and Presthus had four.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers 2000 Vote Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is waging ``a very credible  
campaign'' for the Democratic nomination and George W. Bush better 
not write off Sen. John McCain's challenge for the GOP nod, says 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview for the Monday premier of CBS' ``Early Show,''  
Clinton said he would play ``no official'' role in either Vice 
President Al Gore's presidential campaign or Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's bid for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't resist a little political analysis.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked his opinion about Gore's struggles to get his campaign on  
track, Clinton lauded his deputy for moving his headquarters back 
to Tennessee and for his performance in last week's debate with 
Bradley in New Hampshire. He also said it was too early to worry 
about polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley is an intelligent, a compelling man with a good  
life story and a lot of friends built up in professional basketball 
and 18 years in the Senate and all the other things he's done,'' 
said the president. ``And he's running a very credible campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said people want to see Gore ``out there establishing  
his own identity with his own programs for the future.'' If the 
vice president does that ``I think he will be nominated,'' 
continued Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As for George W. Bush, the frontrunner in the Republican  
nominating race, Clinton warned that Bush shouldn't take the GOP 
nomination for granted. ``I don't think Sen. McCain is out of this 
yet. I think he's a very credible alternative,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the first lady, Clinton said he didn't mind that he  
wouldn't be the candidate in the family next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so funny because our roles are almost completely reversed  
now. All the things that she did for me over more than 20 years, 
all the encouragement, reminders, helpful suggestions, 
everything....'' he said. ``And I'm enjoying it. I'm trying to do a 
good job in my new role.''

<HEADLINE> 214 Feared Dead in EgyptAir Crash Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board  
disappeared early today on a flight from New York to Egypt, and 
debris and at least one body were found at sea off Nantucket, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, was headed to Cairo, Coast  
Guard Lt. Rob Halsey said. It originated in Los Angeles, according 
to EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers found one body and debris, Coast Guard Rear Adm.  
Richard M. Larrabee said at a news conference in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the  
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small 
parts that are not identifiable,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the debris was located about 60 miles south of  
Nantucket, and that the operation was still considered a search and 
rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The debris was found in the ``general vicinity of the last known  
point of contact'' with the plane, Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 199 passengers on the flight, including two infants,  
plus 15 crew members, an EgyptAir official said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were Americans on board, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim  
Rayan said at a news conference in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan said there were 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three Syrians  
and one Chilean. There was no record of the nationality of 131 
others, and Rayan said he believed some of those were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan and Larrabee said they had no knowledge of an SOS being  
sent by the plane's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared  
from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot 
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in 
Washington. Weather at Kennedy was good with 3 to 4 miles of 
visibility and light wind, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA officials in Washington, the twin-engine  
plane's takeoff from Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it 
arrived late from Los Angeles. The cause of the delay was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI source in Washington said agents were sent to Kennedy and  
Los Angeles International. They were checking manifests to see who 
was on board and talking to anyone who would have serviced the 
plane, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11, which crashed off 
Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. Planes 
on that route fly from Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before heading east across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	Imad Kassab trembled with hope when he discovered that his  
brother-in-law, Essam Bahjat, was not on the passenger list for the 
flight as he had feared. Kassab, owner of the Cairo branch of the 
U.S.-based restaurant Cheesecake Factory, quickly called friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the airline in  
September 1989. It had logged over 31,000 flight hours and 6,900 
take-offs and landings, said Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 as Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, a Boeing 767 crashed on May 26, 1991, near Suphan  
Buri Province, Thailand. The Lauda Air plane lost control and 
crashed after one of its engine thrust reversers accidentally 
deployed during a climb. The crashed killed all 10 crew and 213 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 crashed near Moroni,  
Comoros, on Nov. 23, 1996, while attempting to land after being 
hijacked. Ten of the 12 crew members and 117 of the 160 passengers 
were killed. The three hijackers apparently died. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry went through a fatality-free  
year in 1998, but this year there has been the crash of an American 
Airlines jet in Little Rock, Ark., the loss of John F. Kennedy's 
private plane off Martha's Vineyard this summer and last week's 
crash of a Learjet carrying golfer Payne Stewart.

<HEADLINE> 2 Bodies Found in Small Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Rough waters halted the search Sunday for  
wreckage of a small plane that crashed in the Gulf of Mexico 
shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were believed to be aboard the Cessna 310, which  
took off late Saturday, authorities said. Two bodies were spotted 
Sunday but only one was recovered because of the choppy sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were not likely to improve soon as the remnants of  
Tropical Storm Katrina were threatening to rebuild into a storm and 
hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio and radar contact with the plane was lost about 10 minutes  
after it took off en route to Fort Lauderdale. No distress call was 
reported, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris was found in water 20 to 25 feet deep about eight miles  
north of Key West, but the main wreckage had not been located 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Tony Wells said was Haim Israeli.  
Passengers were his wife, Toba Israeli, and Gabriele and Elfriede 
Shade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Call for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with a new study suggesting that his  
programs have helped reduce class size, President Clinton on Sunday 
criticized Congress for failing to support his education 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that many GOP lawmakers touted their role in  
supporting a program that would hire 100,000 new teachers 
nationwide. ``Now, suddenly, the Republican majority has changed 
its mind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was referring to an education spending bill before  
Congress that does not carry forward the plan to hire new teachers 
and makes, according to Clinton, ``mindless across the boards cuts 
in everything from education to health, to safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If that bill passes, I will veto it,'' he said. The bill is  
the appropriation measure for the departments of Education, Labor 
and Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton timed his remarks with the release of a study by the  
Council of Great City Schools that detailed benefits of low 
teacher-pupil ratios in schools. It also found that teachers hired 
under the first year as part of a class-size reduction program are 
working in the areas where they are most needed: literacy, 
mathematics and special education. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said under the program 3,558 teachers have been hired  
in 40 of the nation's largest urban school districts to reduce 
class sizes in early grades.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor Christopher Reeve may be paralyzed and in  
a wheelchair, but it doesn't stop him from getting under the skin 
of medical researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really quite a thorn in the side of scientists,'' Reeve  
says in an interview scheduled to air Monday on ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing well,'' Reeve, 47, says of the researchers.  
``They really are. But now we are down to the ugly part, 
unfortunately, which is patents, money. Who gets the credit? Who 
gets the Nobel Prize? ... That's contaminating the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them haven't seen somebody sitting in a wheelchair on  
a daily basis. They're in a lab and they see rats, and they see 
slides and test tubes, and they've got to be reminded that there 
are people waiting.''

	214 Feared Dead in EgyptAir Crash  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board crashed  
at sea off the island of Nantucket early today on a flight from New 
York to Egypt, and debris and at least one body were found in the 
water, officials said. EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, was 
headed to Cairo. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said the 
operation is still considered a search and rescue effort. In Cairo, 
EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim Rayan said there were 62 Egyptians,

	Relatives Seek News on Missing Plane  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Relatives, friends and colleagues gathered  
at Cairo airport today seeking news about EgyptAir Flight 990. 
Reports of the disappearance were broadcast on Egyptian television 
several hours before the plane had been due to arrive. Flight 990, 
which originated in Los Angeles, took off from New York City's 
Kennedy International Airport at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared from 
radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, the Federal Aviation 
Administration said. The plane's takeoff from Kennedy Airport in 
New York was delayed by two hours because it arrived late from Los

	EgyptAir Has No Shortage of Critics  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- EgyptAir may have one of the best safety  
records in the aviation business, but the state-owned company has 
no shortage of critics. In a country riding a tide of 
privatization, newspapers and commentators have clamored for 
selling the 67-year old company. Operating in a region where 
terrorism is always a threat, EgyptAir has emerged unscathed. It 
has never fallen victim to Islamic militants who have been waging a 
bloody insurrection since 1992 to set up a theocratic state in 
Egypt. EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan said today's crash is 
the airline's first fatal crash.

today's editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it 
says he has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the 
public. ``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the 
presidency, it is time the rest of the nation learned about the 
John McCain we know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says.

was urgent to create a system to quickly respond to various kinds 
of emergencies, referring to a suspected ballistic missile launch 
last year by North Korea and an incursion by suspected North Korean 
spy ships into Japanese waters earlier this year. Japanese have

<HEADLINE> Nantucket Sees Another Plane Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- As Coast Guard cutters searched Sunday  
off the island's south coast for wreckage of an EgyptAir jet, local 
officials braced for the grim possibility of debris and bodies 
washing up. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990 went down 60 miles off the remote island and  
authorities had to swing into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're doing is gearing up for any eventuality,'' said Bud  
Glidden, emergency management director for the island of 8,000 
year-round residents that swells to 40,000 people in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Glidden said a hangar at Nantucket Airport had been reserved for  
debris collection, although no debris had been recovered by Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Still vivid in the mind of Glidden was the July 16 plane crash  
that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister off the 
neighboring island of Martha's Vineyard. Plane parts, luggage and 
clothing washed up on Martha's Vineyard beaches for days after that 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers on Nantucket were dispatched to Low Beach late  
Sunday morning after reports of floating suitcases. But the objects 
turned out to be a group of seals, said police officer Brian 
Chadwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris from the plane was found not far from the spot where the  
cruise ship Andrea Doria sank July 25, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury liner was heading from Italy to New York when it  
collided with a Swedish ship, killing 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the massive search off the island's coast, most island  
activities went on as normal, including the town's planned 
Halloween children's parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Aure Hamel, 34, a lifelong island resident and mother of three,  
said that could be because the island had seen its share of ocean 
tragedies.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans gave the Salvation Army $1.2 billion  
in 1998, making it the No. 1 charity for the seventh straight year, 
a leading philanthropy journal reports in this week's issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Others of the nation's most popular charities also fared well  
last year, with munificence growing 16 percent over 1997. That's 
the highest increase since The Chronicle of Philanthropy began 
ranking charitable support in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful for the public's generosity. ... As long as  
the economy is doing well, people will have more to give,'' said 
Salvation Army spokeswoman Theresa Whitfield. ``While there is an 
increase in giving, there is also an increase in need,'' as more 
families move from welfare to work, often into low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The YMCA of the USA and the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift  
Fund saw donations increase more than 25 percent, placing them 
second and third on the list with $629.3 million and $571.9 
million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Salvation Army, most organizations attribute the  
generosity to the booming economy, which made 1998 one of the best 
fund-raising years for many groups in a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant-making foundations that are thriving with a strong stock  
market also helped fuel the largess. And online donations, an 
increasingly popular approach to fund raising, helped boost many 
organizations' take, including that of the fifth-ranked American 
Red Cross, which has a spot on its Web site to ``Donate Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle of Philanthropy gathers financial data on cash and  
in-kind donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. 
Only private donations are tallied, not money from the government 
or fees charged by organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the list were 139 colleges and universities, 37 international  
groups and 27 religious organizations. Educational institutions 
collectively fetched the most support, bringing in $11.6 billion, a 
21.9 percent increase from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Says Campaign Gaining Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said  
Sunday his Democratic presidential campaign is gaining steam 
because he refuses to attack rival Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, knocking on doors and mingling in back yards, said  
voters have grown weary of negative assaults, and are likely to 
punish candidates running that kind of campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's where the American people are today,'' said  
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	While the vice president has held a lead in national polling,  
Bradley has narrowed the gap in key states like Iowa and New 
Hampshire and has made the race competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has responded by becoming more aggressive in his criticism  
of Bradley, who made it clear he won't respond. He said he wants, 
instead ``to project a positive vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been working,'' insisted Bradley.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bradley went door-knocking in a tree-lined  
middle-class neighborhood, mingling with residents preparing for 
Halloween festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a good amount of (door-knocking) running for  
president,'' said Bradley. ``It's a way of paying respect. If you 
do it with some, you are doing it for all. If you never do it then 
you aren't paying that type of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the Democratic Party's establishment in Gore's  
camp, Bradley was seeking support among college liberals from 
nearby Iowa State University using issues like his call for 
expanded health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides were quick to point out that the 50 people who gathered in  
a back yard Sunday to hear him speak are not traditional party 
activists, but newcomers to the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some signs that Bradley insistence on avoiding verbal  
fighting with Gore was getting some support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much appreciate your efforts to keep the campaign  
civil,'' said Michael Mendelson, who answered one of the doors 
Bradley knocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to narrowing the gap in some of the polling, Bradley  
has made himself competitive with the vice president financially, 
raising enough money to keep the contest going deep into the 
primary calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider this a joyous journey,'' said Bradley.

<P>
	SUZUKA, Japan (AP) -- Mika Hakkinen won the season-ending  
Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday to retain the Formula One drivers' 
championship he won at the same race a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen overtook pole-sitter Michael Schumacher at the start  
and never trailed in a race that was contested the entire way by 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have won the championship in the last GP is  
nerve-cracking,'' Hakkinen said. ``It's an experience that I can't 
recommend to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen finished in 1 hour, 31 minutes, 18.785 seconds at the  
3.7-mile Suzuka Circuit. It was the fifth victory of the season for 
the McLaren driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Finn would have already been the champion had an  
appeals court not overruled race officials who disqualified the 1-2 
Ferrari finish by Eddie Irvine and Schumacher two weeks ago in the 
Malaysian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, a two-time world champion for Ferrari, was timed in  
1:31:23.800, 5.015 seconds behind Hakkinen. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, bidding for his fifth victory for the season and his  
first world championship, placed a distant third in 1:32:54.473. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari's hopes for its first driver's title in 20 years were  
shattered, but the 2-3 finish gave the Italian automaker its first 
constructor's title since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Crash: No Foul Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By KEVIN GALVIN    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday there was ``no  
evidence ... at this time'' of foul play in the EgyptAir jetliner 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no evidence of that at this time. And I think it's  
better if people draw no conclusions,'' Clinton said after 
attending church with Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said, ``Like all Americans, Hillary and I are very  
saddened by the crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was informed of the crash just hours before he was to  
travel to Norway for Middle East peace talks. Vice President Al 
Gore promised a thorough investigation to ``learn whatever we can 
to avert further tragedies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of our country and people all over the world will  
have the families of those who are evidently lost at sea in our 
prayers and in our thoughts,'' Gore said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States will cooperate with the government of  
Egypt ``in doing everything we possibly can to find the cause of 
this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will ensure ``that all of the families of the victims  
are dealt with in the most sensitive and compassionate way possible 
and learn whatever we can to avert further tragedies,'' Gore said 
in the interview at his residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was leaving Sunday for Oslo, Norway, where he has  
meetings scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Barak and Arafat are to discuss 
the next steps in moving the Middle East peace process forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key player in the process,  
is not expected in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the  
site where debris was found, according to an administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grapple, based at Little Creek, Va., is a search and rescue  
vessel that participated in the recovery efforts after John F. 
Kennedy Jr.'s plane crashed into the Atlantic off Martha's 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had a P-3 airplane in the air. The P-3 is a  
long-range reconnaissance plane that specializes in seeking out 
submarines along the ocean floor.

<HEADLINE> How New York Prepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the bottled water. Dump the cases of  
canned soup. Save the year's supply of batteries for Junior's 
Gameboy. When it comes to the Y2K computer glitch, New York's 
techno-types say the Big Apple bit first. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been working since 1995 to replace microchips,  
hardware and software, and rewrite computer coding that otherwise 
would have thrown New York into chaos when the clock struck a 
second past midnight Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Programmers reviewed 65 million lines of computer code written  
in 65 different programming languages. The city replaced more than 
10,000 computers and bought 50,000 new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, there were 677 ``high-priority'' systems to  
evaluate. Those were the ones left after Deputy Mayor Joseph J. 
Lhota deleted psuedo-important items some agency heads had listed 
as critical, like their scheduling software. (Get a calendar, Lhota 
told them.) 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a troublesome comptroller's audit which showed a number  
of city agencies behind schedule, those working on the bug say 
they've beat it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the best city in the country, actually I figure in the  
world, in terms of dealing with any sort of crisis,'' said Brian 
Cohen, executive director of the city's $315 million Y2K project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If having an extra $50 over the weekend makes you feel more  
comfortable, then you should do that,'' he said of New Year's Eve, 
1999. ``But your money is safer in the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city itself is printing an extra batch of paychecks. More  
police will be on duty, and emergency shelters will be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing it all will be a staff huddled in a new $13 million  
emergency crisis center. Built to withstand hurricane-force winds, 
bombs and power failures, it contains food and water for the 100 
people who are supposed to know how to fix anything that goes 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K could be their greatest test. The problem dates back to the  
early days of computing, when programmers squeezed every bit of 
memory from their machines by using the last two digits to stand 
for a year. So 1987 became ``87,'' and the Year 2000 was 
represented by ``00.'' The shorthand creates problems if a computer 
mistakes ``00'' for 1900 when adding or subtracting a date. 
</P>
<P>
	If left uncorrected in New York, the glitch could have meant:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 30,000 calls a day to the 911 emergency network transferred to  
the wrong local police or fire station. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Traffic lights stuck on their midnight cycles, creating  
massive gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A jam-packed Times Square plunged into darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Newer elevators shut down, mistakenly calculating that they  
hadn't been serviced in 100 years. (Older ones would be fine. They 
lack the microchips regulating more modern lifts.) 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's office, the utilities, the Federal Aviation  
Administration, all agree such problems won't happen. Their 
computer programmers say they have burrowed into every 
technological crack to fix the so-called Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from an office littered with Y2K paraphernalia --  
including a battery-powered hat with a digital clock ticking down 
to Jan. 1 -- Cohen has directed an army of city employees, 
consultants, electrical and communications workers in updating 
old-fashioned computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thing about Y2K is, no one will know for sure how bad it  
is until it gets here. And so the city is preparing for the 
equivalent of a three-day storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy New York Police Commissioner Richard Sheirer, the NYPD's  
Y2K guy, says the technical aspects of the problem are under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 911 emergency response system, to the robots that  
disarm bombs, to computer-controlled fingerprinting devices, the 
department has tested each computer-driven component it uses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the police department's effort is just beginning. The big  
job comes New Year's Eve, when the department has to oversee the 
party of the millennium. It doesn't want a blackout to match. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern over the possibilities have driven some New Yorkers to  
... do nothing unusual. While some Midwesterners are stocking up on 
ammunition and The Denver Post has published a Y2K recipe section 
advising how to make the most of canned beans, Manhattan stores 
haven't even ordered extra bottled water. And no one seems to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Yorkers are used to hiding things and ignoring things and  
turning away from things,'' says Patrick Shannon, a city resident 
who spends 10 hours a day collecting news for a Y2K Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does take a certain kind of blind spot to live in a city  
this big, with the diversity and adversity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is one prevalent worry: electricity.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the questions at a recent Y2K ``community conversation''  
in Manhattan were about power. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if there's no heat? City schools will open,  
heated by their old coal-fired furnaces or by back-up generators. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if a widespread blackout triggers rioting? Police  
have canceled many vacations around the first of the year. About 
35,000 cops will be on duty the last few days of 1999 and the first 
week of January 2000, roughly 3,000 more than ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' explains  
Sheirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hedlund, director of technology services for Consolidated  
Edison, said the 3 million households and businesses served by the 
utility in New York and suburban Westchester County should have no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed's 10 generating stations have been inspected and found  
Y2K ready. They don't even use dates in manufacturing power. 
Hundreds of employees have looked over power lines, transformers 
and substations. They have also checked an estimated 5 million 
lines of computer coding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really think that a New Year's Eve is going to be a  
nonevent as far as electricity goes,'' Hedlund said. 
</P>
<P>
	As in every Y2K conversation, however, there are doubting  
Thomases. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the city comptroller's office found the fire  
department and Department of Corrections unprepared for Y2K, 
although Cohen says follow-up inspections gave both better grades. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's physical preparation is only half the Y2K challenge.  
The rest is psychological. Despite New York's overall nonchalance, 
some people are worried. And worried people can become panicked if 
the power goes out or something else goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Square will likely be the site of the world's largest  
millennial celebration, attracting perhaps 1.5 million people. 
Known for the icy temperatures and hard-partying crowd that usually 
accompany the festivities, it's hard to imagine a worse place to be 
if the lights went out, traffic jammed, the trains stopped running 
and everybody flipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is relying heavily on advanced public relations. City  
officials are already popping up at neighborhood events, and a 
brochure assures readers that technicians have updated the 911 
emergency call system. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the vague wording leaves room for interpretation, group  
psychologists say the city is on to something. 
</P>
<P>
	Generalities like ``Hospitals have been working hard to address  
areas in the medical industry ... '' and ``utility companies ... 
have assured us that power, gas, steam and telephone service will 
continue'' may sound simplistic, but they can ease fear of a 
far-reaching computer problem people don't quite understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis C. Danes, of the Society for the Advancement of Social  
Psychology, said the brochure lets people know government has an 
eye on things and helps by telling where to go for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, plans won't be worth the paper they're printed on if a  
blackout in Times Square sends the crowd spiralling into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the people start to panic, the police have to react,''  
Danes said. ``The best thing to do would be to make sure that the 
lights don't go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The following steps are recommended to prepare for Jan. 1, 2000,  
the date a computer problem known as Y2K could cause various 
service interruptions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep a three-day supply of nonperishable food, baby-food,  
diapers, water, and batteries for a radio. Also make sure there is 
a non-electric can opener and a flashlight in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buy a first-aid kit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- If you wish to have extra cash on hand, don't wait until Dec.  
31 to take it out. Be discreet about the money you have. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep copies of all financial records for the last three months  
of 1999 and the first three months after the new year; ask your 
financial institutions about their Y2K compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Top off home heating fuel tanks before Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make sure you have extra blankets to keep warm in case the  
heat goes off. Allow faucets to run slightly to prevent pipes from 
freezing. Know where you can go for shelter, such as a nearby 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Develop a plan to keep in touch with family members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Do not use gas-fueled, wood-burning, or liquid-fueled heating  
devices or generators unless they are approved for indoor use. Read 
the manuals and operate only in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions.

<HEADLINE> Runoff Likely in San Francisco Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An 11th-hour write-in campaign and a crowd  
of challengers may force political powerhouse Willie Brown to 
defend his mayoralty in a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
	Pundits once gave Brown a good chance of winning the majority he  
needs in Tuesday's election to become the first incumbent returned 
to the San Francisco post in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the late entry of Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano  
is likely to siphon off enough of Brown's support to require a Dec. 
14 runoff between the top two finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 99 percent chance that Mayor Brown is going to have to  
face a runoff,'' said Richard DeLeon, chairman of the political 
science department at San Francisco State University. ``The odds 
are it will be against (former Mayor) Frank Jordan, but it could be 
Ammiano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, known for his elegant suits and imperious style, has been  
blasted by accusations of cronyism, with FBI investigating how 
contracts have been awarded -- some to friends of the mayor -- by 
several city departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Major issues include problems with the city's public transit  
system, which Brown rashly promised to solve in his first 100 days 
in office. That hasn't happened. And housing prices, especially the 
extremely tight rental market, are driving middle- and lower-income 
people out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammiano said he got into the race on Oct. 13 because he felt a  
sense of ``despair that was palpable'' among the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Potentially, (his entry) could be huge, in the sense that  
there seems to be an enthusiasm for somebody other than the three 
major candidates and he comes in as somebody who's not marred by 
criticism from the debates or TV ads,'' said Bruce Cain, director 
of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of 
California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-way campaign has been so bitter that audience members  
left one debate in disgust after an hour of chaos and shouting. In 
billboards and television ads, Brown and Clint Reilly, a political 
consultant-turned-candidate, have both run negative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's main competition was expected to come from Jordan, the  
former city police chief and mayor whom Brown defeated in 1995, and 
Reilly, a millionaire who has never held elected office and who was 
Jordan's campaign manager in that losing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammiano, who is gay, draws support from the city's large and  
politically active gay community, and also has many non-gay 
liberals on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll of 630 people last week for the San Francisco Examiner  
and Oakland TV station KTVU found 35 percent favored Brown, with 
Jordan, Ammiano and Reilly each getting around 11 to 12 percent. 
More than one in four San Franciscans were undecided. The poll had 
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brown and Ammiano do share supporters, DeLeon sees Brown  
as a traditional big-city liberal and Ammiano as more in the 
progressive mold, concerned with environmental issues, social 
justice and neighborhood preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does get in the runoff, I don't think there's any chance  
that he would actually win,'' DeLeon said of Ammiano. ``Still, it 
would be a significant accomplishment.''

<HEADLINE> 214 Feared Dead in EgyptAir Crash </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board crashed  
at sea off the island of Nantucket early Sunday on a flight from 
New York to Egypt, and at least one body was found in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, was headed to Cairo on a  
flight that originated in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers found one body and debris about 60 miles south of  
Nantucket, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said at a news 
conference in Boston. He said the operation was still considered a 
search and rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the  
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small 
parts that are not identifiable,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim  
Rayan was asked about reports that the Federal Aviation 
Administration had warned his airline about a terrorist threat. He 
said: ``We take all precautions and we have plenty of warnings from 
everybody, including the FAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that indicates that this was a terrorist  
act,'' Ibrahim el-Dimeiri, Egypt's minister of transport, 
communications and civil aviation, said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contact with the plane was cut suddenly which indicates that  
something happened suddenly,'' el-Dimeiri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan and Larrabee said they had no knowledge of any SOS from  
the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the airline's first fatal crash, Rayan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armed security guards routinely fly on EgyptAir flights. After  
the airline's passengers go through the normal airport security 
check, they are again subjected to baggage search just before they 
board the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 199 passengers on the flight, including two infants,  
plus 15 crew members, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan said the passengers included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese,  
three Syrians and one Chilean. There was no record of the 
nationality of 131 others, and Rayan said he believed some of those 
were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from New York's Kennedy International  
Airport at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared from radar at 2 a.m. while 
flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot Brenner, chief spokesman for the 
FAA in Washington. Weather at Nantucket was clear with 9 miles of 
visibility and wind of 9 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said the search conditions were excellent with 2- to  
3-foot seas, and a water temperature estimated at 59 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the site,  
according to an administration official in Washington. The Grapple, 
based at Little Creek, Va., is a search and rescue vessel that 
participated in the recovery of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane off 
Martha's Vineyard this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA officials, the twin-engine plane's takeoff from  
Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it arrived late from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay from Los Angeles was caused by the plane's late  
arrival Saturday on its flight from Cairo, said Nancy Suey Castles, 
a spokeswoman for Los Angeles International Airport. Airline 
officials said the plane had been diverted from its regular stop at 
Kennedy to Newark, N.J., because of fog early Saturday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not know if the flight changed crews in Los Angeles.  
There was routine servicing of the plane and refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11, which crashed off 
Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. Planes 
on that route fly from Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before heading east across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	Imad Kassab trembled with hope when he discovered that his  
brother-in-law, Essam Bahjat, was not on the passenger list for the 
flight as he had feared. Kassab, owner of the Cairo branch of the 
U.S.-based restaurant Cheesecake Factory, quickly called friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	And at Kennedy, two families had gathered at an airport hotel,  
said James Devine, a Catholic chaplain at the airport. One family 
was Egyptian and the other American. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really in shock,'' Devine said.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the airline in  
September 1989, said Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy in Seattle. 
Rayan said the plane had 33,334 flight hours and its condition was 
``good'' 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 as Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crash comes after the Oct. 19 hijack of an EgyptAir  
flight between Istanbul and Cairo. That hijacking ended peacefully 
in Germany where the hijacker was overpowered; none of the 46 
passengers on board was harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, a Boeing 767 crashed on May 26, 1991, in Thailand.  
The Lauda Air plane went down after one of its engine thrust 
reversers accidentally deployed during a climb, killing all 10 crew 
and 213 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 crashed near the Comoros  
Islands on Nov. 23, 1996, while attempting to land after being 
hijacked. Ten of the 12 crew members and 117 of the 160 passengers 
were killed. The three hijackers apparently died. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry went through a fatality-free  
year in 1998, but this year an American Airlines jet crashed at 
Little Rock, Ark., killing 11 people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Call for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with a new study suggesting that his  
programs have helped reduce class size, President Clinton on Sunday 
criticized Congress for failing to support his education 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that many GOP lawmakers touted their role in  
supporting a program that would hire 100,000 new teachers 
nationwide. ``Now, suddenly, the Republican majority has changed 
its mind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was referring to an education spending bill before  
Congress that does not carry forward the plan to hire new teachers 
and makes, according to Clinton, ``mindless across the boards cuts 
in everything from education to health, to safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If that bill passes, I will veto it,'' he said. The bill is  
the appropriation measure for the departments of Education, Labor 
and Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton timed his remarks with the release of a study by the  
Council of Great City Schools that detailed benefits of low 
teacher-pupil ratios in schools. It also found that teachers hired 
under the first year as part of a class-size reduction program are 
working in the areas where they are most needed: literacy, 
mathematics and special education. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said under the program 3,558 teachers have been hired  
in 40 of the nation's largest urban school districts to reduce 
class sizes in early grades.

<HEADLINE> Sketches of EgyptAir Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Retirees who envisioned a trip down the Nile. A  
Sudanese importer traveling home. Parents. Children. Husbands and 
wives. The names of Flight 990 victims emerged slowly Sunday as 
relatives shared their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board had not released the  
passenger list in the United States as of Sunday night as 
authorities worked to notify families. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are sketches of some of the passengers believed to be on  
board, as given by relatives: 
</P>
<P>
	--Arthur Simermeyer, 72, a retired deputy commissioner for Social  
Security, and his wife, Marie Simermeyer, 60, of Randallstown, Md., 
were believed to be aboard the flight, according to a statement 
issued by their family. The statement said the pair were ``loving 
and caring people,'' who were very involved with their church and 
tried to help people who were less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received official word from the airline but we are  
awaiting word before making further comment,'' the statement said. 
``Please keep Art and Marie in your prayers and please respect the 
family's request for privacy at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan Duckworth, 69, of Denver, worked as a clerk in the Colorado  
House of Representatives for 22 years. She was believed to be one 
of 54 seniors who boarded the plane as part of a tour booked 
through Grand Circle Corp. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was her first trip to Egypt,'' said Judith ``J.R.''  
Rodrigue, the chief clerk of the House. ``She had been talking 
about it since way last winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Abdel-Rahman Amin, in his 60s, and his wife, Alia Abdou, of  
Cairo, had been visiting their son, Dr. Talaat Abdalmoneim, a 
doctor in the intensive care unit at Long Island College Hospital 
in Brooklyn. Amin was the owner of a coffee-roasting factory and 
his wife was a housewife. They had hoped to make it back to Egypt 
in time for the birth of their 11th grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abdu and Fawqia Elzanaty, of Cairo, were visiting two of their  
sons in Searingtown, N.Y. ``It's so tragic that we cannot express 
the sorrow,'' said Hisham Elzanaty. ``Life will never be the same 
without my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdu Elzanaty worked in construction contracting with oil  
companies; his wife was a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
	--Claude Masson, deputy publisher the Montreal daily newspaper La  
Presse, and his wife, Jeannine Bourdages, were going to Egypt for 
vacation. They were both 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard expressed his condolences and paid  
tribute to Masson as an objective journalist with high standards 
who spent his life keeping citizens informed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Virginia Chaplin, 72, of Georgetown, Maine, was traveling to  
see the Nile River with her new husband, Richard Brokaw. The couple 
had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Oct. 23, 
according to Jim Chaplin, 50, her oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a wonderful woman who had many, many dear friends all  
over the world,'' Jim Chaplin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokaw was a combustion research scientist for NASA in  
Cleveland. He retired in 1973 and moved to Vermont in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gene and Barbara Billings and Henrietta Mead, of Norfolk,  
Conn., were taking part in a 15-day elderhostel tour of Egypt, said 
Mead's sister-in-law Louise Mead. The three were close friends, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Billings, 70, was a retired Travelers insurance executive.  
His 71-year-old wife, Barbara, a teacher, had retired from the 
Botelle Elementary School in Norfolk. Henrietta Mead, 61, recently 
widowed, also was a retired teacher who taught at the Salisbury 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mary Lou Sterner, 66, was born and raised in Duluth, Minn. and  
lived in the St. Paul suburb of Cottage Grove for about 15 years 
before moving to Brownsville, Texas, about 20 years ago, said her 
son, Mark Brouillette of Minnetonka. 
</P>
<P>
	Brouillette said his mother was going on the ``trip of a  
lifetime'' when Flight 990 went down after leaving New York for 
Cairo.

	Plane Disappears Off East Coast  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 passenger plane disappeared about 60  
miles south of Nantucket after taking off from JFK Airport in New 
York, the Coast Guard says. The FAA lost contact with the plane, 
which was headed to Cairo, Egypt, Coast Guard Lt. Rob Halsey said. 
He did not know what time the plane took off or when contact was 
lost. It wasn't immediately known how many people were on board. A 
Coast Guard jet and four vessels are searching the area. ``What we 
have right now is, we weren't able to establish contact,'' Halsey 
said. ``They had them on radar and then lost the radar picture.'' 
Coast Guard officials identified the plane as Egypt Air Flight 990.

	Y2K Extremist Threat Real, FBI Says  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI report prepared for the nation's law  
enforcement officials says the threat of violence by extremists to 
make the new millennium is ``very real,'' The Washington Post 
reported. The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it 
was preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share 
it with police chiefs at their upcoming convention. The agency said 
the document analyzes ``the potential for extremist criminal 
activity in the United States by individuals or domestic groups who 
attach special significance to the year 2000.''

	Bin Laden Sighted at Afghan Camp  
</P>
<P>
	JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) -- One day after accused terrorist  
Osama bin Laden offered to leave Afghanistan, residents of this 
rugged eastern city said that they saw him and his men yesterday at 
a training camp nearby. On the dusty, clogged streets of Jalalabad, 
a man who refused to give his name splayed his fingers, pointed 
them toward his eyes and said: ``with these two eyes I saw him'' in 
a community called Farmada, near Jalalabad. Bin Laden's request to 
leave Afghanistan comes as the United Nations has threatened to 
impose sanctions against the country if it doesn't turn over bin 
Laden by mid-November.

	Ariz. Paper Cites McCain for Temper  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in John McCain's home state  
is questioning whether the Republican senator has the temperament 
to be president. The Arizona Republic, in an editorial running in 
today's editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it 
says he has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the 
public. ``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the 
presidency, it is time the rest of the nation learned about the 
John McCain we know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says in the 
editorial, a copy of which was provided to The Associated Press 
yesterday.

	Hundreds Feared Dead in India Cyclone  
</P>
<P>
	BALESHWAR, India (AP) -- A cyclone battered a broad swath of  
eastern India for a second day yesterday, knocking out power and 
telephone lines and flattening thousands of homes. Hundreds may 
have died, said officials in Orissa state, which bore the brunt of 
the storm. While the storm was weakening as it moved inland, it 
wasn't possible to assess the death toll and property damage 
because the area was still inaccessible and cut off from 
communication. ``We are treating it as a national calamity,'' Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said.

	INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- At least 54 people, many of them  
teen-agers, were killed as a fire swept through a three-story 
building crowded with weekend diners and drinkers in this South 
Korean port city. Many victims from the fire last night were 
believed to have suffocated from toxic smoke. Most of the victims 
were high school students who were drinking in a second-floor bar 
illegally catering to teen-agers.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad is the only man in  
his country with which Israel can make peace, Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak said in comments to be published this week. 
Barak told Newsweek magazine in the issue expected on newsstands 
tomorrow that Israel and Syria have had many contacts in recent 
months through several intermediaries as part of their efforts to 
agree on the renewal of peace talks, which broke off in 1996.

scores as No. 25 Mississippi beat LSU 42-23 last night. McAllister, 
who has averaged 129 all-purpose yards per game this season, scored 
his second touchdown on a 6-yard run with 7:56 left in the game. 
Gunn scored his second on a 42-yard scamper with 1:47 left to cap 
the Rebels' scoring.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- It was Mia Hamm's turn to take a day off.  
Her teammates could have used her. 
</P>
<P>
	Patience Avre of Brazil scored on a rebound just 21 seconds into  
overtime Sunday to lead the world all-star team back from a 
four-goal deficit and to a 10-9 victory over the U.S. women's World 
Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisha Venturini scored three goals and Tiffany Milbrett added a  
goal and three assists to lead the U.S. team which was missing its 
most recognizable player as a roster of 19 for the 12-city tour 
allows each player to miss one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett conceded that Hamm remains the key to the future  
success of women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mia is a marketing magnet,'' Milbrett said. ``She put women's  
soccer on the map. She still has that. There are a lot of 
first-time fans who just watched the World Cup this summer and some 
who just watched the final. That's not the most enormous amount of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha of Brazil had four goals and Avre added three for the  
world stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss, the Americans took a lap around the arena's  
turf after the game to the enthusiastic cheers of 7,392 at the 
Allstate Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the best crowd so far,'' Venturini said.  
``It was an exciting game and they were really into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's next stop is Philadelphia on Nov. 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun, but I enjoy outdoor a little bit more,''  
Venturini said. ``It's good for a short period of time. It's more 
tiring. It's different and I don't think we really have the 
strategy down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett said the players are concerned about getting hurt on  
the artificial surfaces of the indoor venues. But she said the 
players also understand the importance of generating fan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the game of soccer. If you get hurt, you get hurt,''  
Milbrett said. ``What's good is that hopefully, sponsors and others 
who keep an eye on this are seeing the support we're getting and 
the numbers we're drawing. That will speak for itself.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Syracuse Football Players Stabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Three members of the Syracuse football  
team were stabbed early Sunday during a melee outside a bar on the 
city's south side that sent at least four people to area hospitals, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most seriously injured was senior defensive back David Byrd, who  
was listed Sunday night in stable condition in the intensive care 
unit at University Hospital with chest wounds near his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 21, of Schenectady, underwent two operations that lasted  
five hours, Syracuse Mayor Roy Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not doing very well at all,'' Bernardi said. ``We'll just  
wait and let the doctors do their work and hope and pray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were junior defensive end Duke Pettijohn, 22, of  
Mattapan, Mass., and sophomore offensive tackle Giovanni DeLoatch, 
20, of Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettijohn was treated at St. Joseph's Hospital for cuts to his  
body and head and released. DeLoatch was admitted to St. Joseph's 
with cuts to the body and head and was listed in stable condition. 
He was being held for observation but was expected to be released 
Sunday night, university spokesman Kevin Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth person, Miles Thomas, a friend of Byrd, was listed in  
critical condition Sunday night at University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred around 1 a.m. at Sadie's Place, according  
to police, who still don't know what caused the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, who said he hoped to shut down the bar, said the  
injuries occurred during a fight involving 60-75 people in the 
street outside Sadie's Place. Bernardi said several people had been 
arrested but he was unsure how many. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place was labeled off-limits to the football team from  
day one,'' Bernardi said. ``It was senseless violence. Some of the 
members of the group were people who have been in trouble with us 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernardi said the bar, described by neighbors as a trouble spot  
with frequent violence, is owned by an employee of the Onondaga 
County Sheriff's Department. The mayor declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse head coach Paul Pasqualoni, who spent the day at the  
hospital, said he was ``shocked and saddened that such an incident 
could occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial police investigation indicates that our players  
and the other individuals hospitalized were victims of a vicious 
attack,'' he said. ``Our program discourages student-athletes from 
going to a place like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pasqualoni said he planned to meet with the team to discuss the  
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts are with the victims of this horrible incident  
and their family members,'' athletic director Jake Crouthamel said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident came only hours after Syracuse's 24-23 loss to  
Boston College, a decided underdog, in the Carrier Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	The off-the-field incident is the second this season for the  
team. Linebacker Keith Bulluck, a co-captain, was arrested in 
February for driving drunk in Cortland, about 30 miles south of 
Syracuse. He served a one-game suspension in September.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Retirees who envisioned a trip down the Nile. A  
Sudanese importer traveling home. Parents. Children. Husbands and 
wives. The names of Flight 990 victims emerged slowly Sunday as 
relatives shared their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board had not released the  
passenger list in the United States as of Sunday night as 
authorities worked to notify families. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are sketches of some of the passengers believed to be on  
board, as given by relatives: 
</P>
<P>
	--Arthur Simermeyer, 72, a retired deputy commissioner for Social  
Security, and his wife, Marie Simermeyer, 60, of Randallstown, Md., 
were believed to be aboard the flight, according to a statement 
issued by their family. The statement said the pair were ``loving 
and caring people,'' who were very involved with their church and 
tried to help people who were less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received official word from the airline but we are  
awaiting word before making further comment,'' the statement said. 
``Please keep Art and Marie in your prayers and please respect the 
family's request for privacy at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan Duckworth, 69, of Denver, worked as a clerk in the Colorado  
House of Representatives for 22 years. She was believed to be one 
of 54 seniors who boarded the plane as part of a tour booked 
through Grand Circle Corp. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was her first trip to Egypt,'' said Judith ``J.R.''  
Rodrigue, the chief clerk of the House. ``She had been talking 
about it since way last winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Abdel-Rahman Amin, in his 60s, and his wife, Alia Abdou, of  
Cairo, had been visiting their son, Dr. Talaat Abdalmoneim, a 
doctor in the intensive care unit at Long Island College Hospital 
in Brooklyn. Amin was the owner of a coffee-roasting factory and 
his wife was a housewife. They had hoped to make it back to Egypt 
in time for the birth of their 11th grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abdu and Fawqia Elzanaty, of Cairo, were visiting two of their  
sons in Searingtown, N.Y. ``It's so tragic that we cannot express 
the sorrow,'' said Hisham Elzanaty. ``Life will never be the same 
without my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdu Elzanaty worked in construction contracting with oil  
companies; his wife was a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
	--Claude Masson, deputy publisher the Montreal daily newspaper La  
Presse, and his wife, Jeannine Bourdages, were going to Egypt for 
vacation. They were both 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard expressed his condolences and paid  
tribute to Masson as an objective journalist with high standards 
who spent his life keeping citizens informed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Virginia Chaplin, 72, of Georgetown, Maine, was traveling to  
see the Nile River with her new husband, Richard Brokaw. The couple 
had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Oct. 23, 
according to Jim Chaplin, 50, her oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a wonderful woman who had many, many dear friends all  
over the world,'' Jim Chaplin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokaw was a combustion research scientist for NASA in  
Cleveland. He retired in 1973 and moved to Vermont in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gene and Barbara Billings and Henrietta Mead, of Norfolk,  
Conn., were taking part in a 15-day elderhostel tour of Egypt, said 
Mead's sister-in-law Louise Mead. The three were close friends, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Billings, 70, was a retired Travelers insurance executive.  
His 71-year-old wife, Barbara, a teacher, had retired from the 
Botelle Elementary School in Norfolk. Henrietta Mead, 61, recently 
widowed, also was a retired teacher who taught at the Salisbury 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mary Lou Sterner, 66, was born and raised in Duluth, Minn. and  
lived in the St. Paul suburb of Cottage Grove for about 15 years 
before moving to Brownsville, Texas, about 20 years ago, said her 
son, Mark Brouillette of Minnetonka. 
</P>
<P>
	Brouillette said his mother was going on the ``trip of a  
lifetime'' when Flight 990 went down after leaving New York for 
Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Defensive End Thomas Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Colts defensive end Mark Thomas was removed  
from the field on a stretcher and taken to a hospital after being 
injured late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was injured when he was blocked in the Dallas backfield.  
He laid motionless on the turf of the RCA Dome for about 10 minutes 
while receiving medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned teammates and members of the Cowboys stood around with  
looks of dismay on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin, who has missed the last  
three games with a spine injury, was on his knees praying during 
the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Methodist Hospital were evaluating Thomas to  
determine the scope of his injuries, nursing supervisor Connie 
Nimereala said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're looking him over, but we don't know anything right  
now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tired Wisconsin Needs Recharging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Wisconsin doesn't get a bye week this  
season. The Badgers will finish their schedule against Iowa on Nov. 
13, while almost every other team has one more game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, No. 10 Wisconsin finally played like a team that  
could use a rest. After a month of outstanding performances on both 
offense and defense, the Badgers were merely above average in a 
35-19 victory over Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say we struggled, but we can play better,''  
quarterback Brooks Bollinger said. ``We've been playing well, but 
we've always said we could make improvements. We just need to 
recharge ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (7-2, 5-1 Big Ten) won its fifth straight game and  
moved back into the Top 10 for the first time since an inexplicable 
17-12 loss to Cincinnati in September. 
</P>
<P>
	During their streak, the Badgers steamrolled Ohio State by  
scoring on eight straight possessions, showed poise in an overtime 
win at Minnesota and then blew out Indiana and Michigan State by a 
combined score of 99-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin returned to normalcy against Northwestern, but there  
was nothing ordinary about Ron Dayne. The senior tailback rushed 
for 214 yards and two touchdowns, all behind an offensive line that 
didn't show its customary skill in opening holes for him. 
</P>
<P>
	With two games to go, Dayne is just 321 yards from breaking the  
major college career rushing record, and 41 yards from becoming the 
third player to get 6,000 yards in his career. The Badgers' final 
two opponents, Purdue and Iowa, both rank in the bottom half of the 
Big Ten in rushing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	With three consecutive outstanding games, Ricky Williams' record  
is well within Dayne's reach. But unlike last year, when the media 
followed Williams' every move on his way to breaking Tony Dorsett's 
record, Dayne is making his run under fairly calm circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	For college football fans, it's somewhat similar to the  
Sosa-McGwire home run chase of 1999. It's not quite the same when 
you saw it the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say we're caught up in that as a team at all,''  
cornerback Jamar Fletcher said. ``We know Ron will get the record 
if we play well, but we don't spend any time thinking about it. I 
couldn't even tell you how close he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because Dayne, despite all the accolades and  
attention raining down on him, still won't so much as speak when he 
isn't spoken to. He remains the respectful, reserved man who 
exploded onto the national scene in 1996 with a dazzling freshman 
year, and has only become more skilled and prominent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron has handled this like a pro,'' said offensive coordinator  
Brian White, who guaranteed last week that Dayne would break the 
record if he stayed healthy. ``He's not letting it affect us as a 
team, because he knows he'll eventually be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White was more concerned with the way Northwestern ended  
Saturday's game. The Wildcats were called for two personal fouls in 
the final minute, and White engaged in a shouting match with 
Northwestern assistants in the press box stairwell after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very frustrated. I would love to be able to comment  
more, but I just don't feel comfortable doing it,'' White said. 
``Coach (Barry) Alvarez is the spokesperson for the team, and I 
think he should address any questions that regard the way the game 
ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats (3-5, 1-4) had another disheartening afternoon,  
managing only a field goal before the game got out of hand. 
Northwestern added two late touchdowns to make the final score 
close.

<HEADLINE> Gas May Solve Israel Energy Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Natural gas discovered off Israel's shores may  
be enough to supply the country's short-term energy needs, the 
country's oil commissioner said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli drilling company Isramco Inc. on Sunday reported  
natural gas flow from an offshore test drill near the southern town 
of Ashkelon. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with another natural gas find in a June drill led by  
Avner Oil Exploration and Delek Drilling, Oil Commissioner 
Yehezkeel Drukman said the likelihood of the energy-strapped 
country producing commercial quantities of gas is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems there are commercial quantities of natural gas in  
both fields ... which of course must be studied further,'' Drukman 
told Israel radio. ``It looks like we have two fields, which 
according to initial calculations could supply all the consumption 
needs of the Israel Electric Corp. for the next five years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Israel Electric Corp. consumes most of the  
country's fuel imports. No commercial quantities of natural gas or 
oil have been found within Israeli territory to date. 
</P>
<P>
	Drukman warned that Sunday's findings required further study.  
</P>
<P>
	When news of the discovery reached the Tel Aviv stock exchange  
Sunday, Isramco shares jumped 18 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Stewart on Final Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The spirit of Payne Stewart was all over  
Champions Golf Club on Sunday in final round of the Tour 
Championship. So were his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the players who wore knickers in the final round as a  
tribute to Stewart, none looked as eerily similar to the U.S. Open 
champion as Stuart Appleby -- and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar build. Same waistline. Same shoe size.  
</P>
<P>
	Same clothes.  
</P>
<P>
	Appleby got permission from Tracey Stewart on Thursday night to  
wear her husband's clothes in the final round. He and Ian 
Baker-Finch toured the massive closet and picked out a traditional 
Scottish outfit, complete with a tartan of the Stewart clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like walking in his shoes for the one day,'' Appleby  
said. ``I felt like him for one day, even though my swing wasn't as 
fluent as his and I didn't putt as good. At times you try to 
imagine being him, and it feels weird. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be him, I can only look like him. That's as good as I  
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby did it better than anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	From 30 yards away, it looked like Stewart on the driving range  
when Appleby stood over the ball. And as he walked down a row of 
autograph-seekers at the end of his round, from behind the 
similarities were downright spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby wasn't the only one in knickers.  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman ordered the knee-length pants for everyone who felt  
comfortable wearing them. Justin Leonard needed a pin in the back 
to keep his on. Chris Perry's left pants leg came undone as he 
walked down the sixth fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was always the most recognizable player from two  
fairways away because of his clothes, and the Tour Championship 
looked like it had a bunch of Stewart lookalikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was against it at the beginning,'' Davis Love III said. ``I  
didn't think we should put pressure on guys to do something they 
didn't want to do. If half the guys did it and half the guys 
didn't, then they would feel bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I told Tom Lehman when we got out there, `This just feels  
right.' The fans are going to enjoy it. We will always remember 
this tournament. You can pick out this event on the highlights from 
now on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson said the idea allowed players to have some fun in  
what has been an emotionally charged week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I looked down and saw these socks, I thought of  
him,'' Mickelson said. ``I thought a lot about him this week. We 
all have, and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Appleby, picking out a color scheme was no small task.  
</P>
<P>
	He was at the Stewart's house Thursday night with about two  
dozen other people when he stepped into the closet and saw enough 
outfits to clothe the whole field for the entire week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one thing I wore on my body today that was mine,  
and you're not looking at it,'' Appleby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only piece of Stewart's outfit that didn't quite fit was the  
tam o'shanter cap, which Appleby said was a little snug. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got less hair than me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like every other player in the Tour Championship, Appleby was  
glad to get the week behind them. Wearing the knickers only drove 
home what kind of a hole his death in a plane crash on Monday left 
on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I miss Payne Stewart being different,'' Appleby said. ``I'm  
going to miss his passion for the game. From a personal side, his 
family will miss him greatly. They aren't going to make any more 
memories with him, but the memories he left are great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week was tough. It didn't feel like a prestigious week at  
all, and that's the way it should have been.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Climb in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices climbed early Monday,  
supported by gains late last week on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar 
fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 121.70 points,  
or 0.68 percent, to 18,063.78 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average climbed 528.37 points, or 3.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was quoted at 104.12 yen in early trading, down  
0.76 yen from its level of 104.88 yen late Friday in Tokyo and also 
below 104.16 yen late Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei rallied above 18,000 points for  
the first time since Oct. 13, led by gains in blue-chip stocks such 
as Sony, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Matsushita Electric 
Industrial. 
</P>
<P>
	But some other leading issues, such as Toyota, Honda and NEC  
were weaker due to concerns over the strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A robust yen can hurt Japanese exporters as it makes their  
products more expensive in overseas markets, thus potentially 
causing sales to slump. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped  
109.23 points to close at 10,731.76 on rises in high-technology 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the greenback was lower, but caution  
against possible dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan 
was likely to provide support to the U.S. currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 109.78 yen, down from  
110.76 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7950 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its price 
rose 0.04 point to 100.04.

<HEADLINE> Science Puts Freud to the Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sigmund Freud might concede that sometimes a  
cigar is just a cigar. But on the larger issue he was adamant -- a 
dream is never just a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Then what is a dream? The question has divided students of the  
mind for a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud argued that dreams are windows into an otherwise  
inaccessible mind, ``the royal road to the unconscious.'' But 
others have contended that they are mere static, the random firings 
of a dormant brain. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a  
lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sigmund Freud  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A century ago a dream was a will-o'-the-wisp, a tantalizing  
glimpse into a spirit world where truths were revealed and events 
foretold. But Freud changed all that with a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published on Nov. 4, 1899,  
re-created dreams as a powerful probe of the unconscious mind. 
Suddenly they were messages from a landscape entirely within us, 
and yet totally unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before Freud you would say that dreams were considered as  
spirits, as otherworldly things, messages from the other world. 
They were dealt with in religious and philosophical ways,'' says 
psychoanalyst Leon Hoffman. ``Through his study he came to the idea 
that the mind worked outside of our awareness and that dreams had 
meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A century later, science is putting Freud to the test. New  
brain-imaging technologies allow researchers to see which parts of 
the brain are active during a dream, and which are dead to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is helping in being able to test all of the ideas in a  
scientific way, in a reproducible scientific way,'' says Edward 
Nersessian, a psychoanalyst in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	``You are innocent when you dream.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Waits  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Freud argued that dreams are a person's most deeply held wishes,  
expressed in symbolic form. Their purpose? To keep the unconscious 
drives that constantly pop up within us from waking us in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the essence of Freud's theory, that dreams protect  
sleep,'' says Mark Solms, a neuroscientist at St. Bartholomew's and 
Royal London School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Few psychoanalysts believe that today. But Freud's more basic  
idea, that dreams are messages from a part of the mind beyond our 
conscious control, is stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used dreams to try to get at what unconscious processes  
were and how they work,'' Harvard University psychiatrist David 
Westen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars didn't always support that idea. In 1953, researchers  
discovered a stage of sleep called REM, for rapid eye movement. 
During REM sleep much of the brain becomes as active as it is 
during waking. The eyes dart around behind closed lids as if 
following an action-packed sporting event. Most intriguing, people 
awakened from REM sleep almost always say they have been dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	That led researchers to equate REM sleep with dreaming. When  
they looked for the part of the brain that controls REM, they found 
that its source is the pons, a primitive section of the brain stem 
that has more to do with reflexes like breathing than deeply held 
wishes, desires, hopes and fears. 
</P>
<P>
	So Freud must have been wrong, they concluded. Dreams are  
nothing more than random images conjured up by a senselessly 
whirring brain, and any meaning we associate with them is imposed 
by the conscious mind, not generated by the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent research has shown that REM and dreams are not the  
same. Solms has studied patients who have brain damage to the pons 
which renders them incapable of REM sleep. Yet those people still 
dream. Other people with damage to higher parts of the brain can't 
dream. But they do experience REM sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have also found that REM sleep is not the exclusive  
province of dreams. Although most dreams happen then, people also 
dream at other times during sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent discoveries have led researchers to the conclusion  
that REM is merely a trigger for dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``REM sleep is the best place for dreaming,'' says Ernest  
Hartmann, a professor of psychiatry at Tufts University in Boston. 
``It is not the only place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	``We are the stuff that dreams are made on.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Prospero, in Shakespeare's ``The Tempest''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, new imaging technologies have shown what  
parts of the brain are most active during dreaming. Allen Braun of 
the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication 
Disorders studies sleeping people with a technology called positron 
emission tomography, or PET, scanning. What he is finding can be 
used to test some of Freud's ideas about dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can see if the patterns are congruent with his ideas,''  
Braun says. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, during dreaming the parts of the brain involved in  
emotions and emotional memories are active. That explains why 
dreams can feel so intense and powerful. The areas involved in 
recognizing objects and processing images are also active -- which 
is consistent with the strong visual nature of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the areas that Braun calls the ``executive regions of  
the brain'' are deactivated. That might help explain why dreams are 
often illogical, irrational and out of sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those observations are roughly consistent with Freud's  
idea of dreams as messages from the unconscious mind. But contrary 
to what Freud might have predicted, the part of the brain involved 
in processing symbols is relatively quiet during dreaming. Freud 
believed that dreams were full of symbols that had to be decoded to 
reveal the innermost workings of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dreams may be meaningful, but they're not meaningful in the  
way Freud thought,'' Braun says. 
</P>
<P>
	He and several of his colleagues believe that the meaning of  
dreams is right on the surface. In other words, a cigar is always 
just a cigar. 
</P>

	``So I awoke, and behold it was a dream.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- John Bunyan, ``The Pilgrim's Progress''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hartmann, who actually met Freud during the 1930s, also thinks  
Freud got dreams mostly, but not completely, right. 
</P>
<P>
	. ``They tell me Freud patted me on the head,'' Hartmann says of  
his meeting with Freud. ``He was 80 and I was two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud might not react so warmly to Hartmann today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Freud was very smart,'' Hartmann says. ``But I do not  
believe every dream is the fulfillment of a wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartmann's own theory relies on the modern idea that the brain  
is an intricate web of connected nerve cells. During dreaming we 
explore that network in ways that are impossible while awake, 
making broader connections and associations than we otherwise 
would. 
</P>
<P>
	That may explain why artists often find inspiration in dreams,  
Hartmann argues. But both experience and research show that logical 
thought is almost completely absent from dreams. Even the most 
brilliant thinkers rarely find themselves doing arithmetic or 
solving complex problems in dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do less A, B, C, D,'' Hartmann says. ``We do more fanciful  
stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Socks Co. With $114M Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- An Alabama jury awarded $114.5 million  
to a former power company lineman in his suit against a bucket 
truck manufacturer, agreeing with his claims that a lack insulation 
a lift bucket led to his injuries in a 1995 accident. 
</P>
<P>
	John S. Aultman, 45, a former lineman for Black Warrior Electric  
Co. in Demopolis, and his wife, Shirley, sued Terex-Telelect Inc. 
after the accident, which caused Aultman to lose one arm and 
rendered the other useless. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hale County Circuit Court jury returned the verdict against  
the company Friday. As part of an agreement, company attorneys said 
they would not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Aultman was standing in an insulated lift bucket, with his hand  
on the control handle that operated the bucket, when he touched a 
power line, said his attorney, Jere Beasley. The resulting electric 
shock would not have happened had the metal handle been insulated, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the Watertown, S.D.-based company said Aultman  
had violated safety rules, including refusing to wear rubber 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have somehow decided that individuals are no longer  
responsible for what happens to them -- somebody else is,'' said 
lawyer Robert Turner of Marion. He said the verdict was ``hard to 
understand'' because Aultman ``deliberately put himself in the 
position to get shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said they had reached an agreement under which the  
company would pay no more than an agreed-upon figure. That figure 
and other terms of the agreement were confidential, the attorneys 
said.

	Crews Search for Crash Survivors  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Searchers have found debris and human remains  
scattered across the sea but no sign of survivors from today's 
crash of an EgyptAir jetliner off the Massachusetts coast. The 
flight, carrying 217 passengers and crew, was en route from New 
York to Cairo. State-owned EgyptAir said the 199 passengers 
included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three Syrians and one Chilean. 
Most of the others were believed to be Americans. Though the FBI 
and other intelligence agencies began checking on the possibility 
of sabotage, President Clinton and other officials said there was 
no immediate indication of foul play. 

</P>
<P>
	Two Doomed Boeing Planes Off Same Line  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The EgyptAir 767 that plummeted six miles today  
to crash off the coast of Nantucket Island came off Boeing Co.'s 
assembly line immediately before a Lauda Air 767 that crashed eight 
years ago in a Thailand jungle. Both planes were completed just 
days before Boeing's aircraft assemblers went on strike, 
complaining of being over tired because they were forced to work 
too much overtime. A Boeing spokesman said the company knew of 
nothing to indicate the two crashes were related, but added, 
``we're going to look at every possible scenario.''

	Charitable Donations Jump 16 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donors gave 16 percent more in contributions  
to the nation's most popular charities last year than in 1997, a 
survey of the top 400 charities shows. It was the largest increase 
since The Chronicle of Philanthropy, the weekly ``Newspaper of the 
Nonprofit World,'' began compiling contribution statistics in 1991. 
For a seventh consecutive year, the Salvation Army was the favored 
organization as it raised $1.2 billion in cash and donated goods. 
Educational institutions collectively fetched the most support, 
bringing in $11.6 billion, a 21.9 percent increase from the year 
before.

	Bradley Defends Health Care Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley today dismissed criticism from  
Vice President Al Gore that his proposal to help 45 million 
uninsured people get health coverage might actually drive up 
premiums and might bust the federal budget in future years. ``Any 
time you put out a big idea to deal with a big problem, it's 
vulnerable to scare tactics,'' Bradley said. Gore, appearing on 
ABC's ``This Week,'' repeated his charge that Bradley's proposals 
would spend virtually all of the projected budget surplus over the 
next decade, end Medicaid and do nothing to keep Medicare solvent.

	Churches End Salvation Dispute  
</P>
<P>
	AUGSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Putting aside five centuries of  
differences in theology, Roman Catholic and Lutheran church leaders 
today signed a declaration ending a dispute over salvation that 
sparked the Protestant Reformation and led to the Thirty Years War. 
Officials from the two bodies stated that both churches believe the 
salvation of individual Christians is ``justified'' by God's love 
alone, not by human efforts. From the Vatican, Pope John Paul II 
welcomed the signing as a ``milestone along a difficult path full 
of joy, union, and communion among Christians.''

Minister Vladimir Putin insisted that his forces were not targeting 
``peaceful residents.'' Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, 
mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks since 
September.

	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Moore was killed today in the  
season-ending Marlboro 500 CART race when he lost control of his 
car at 220 mph and crashed into a wall. The 24-year-old Canadian 
was airlifted to a hospital and declared dead of massive head 
injuries about an hour after the wreck at California Speedway. 
Moore was the second driver in the CART FedEx Series to die this 
year. Gonzalo Rodriguez was killed in a crash Sept. 11 during 
practice at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Tim Couch completed a desperation 56-yard  
touchdown to Kevin Johnson with no time on the clock today as the 
reborn Cleveland Browns got their first win, 21-16 over New 
Orleans. Couch, who completed 11 of 19 passes for 193 yards, drove 
the Browns 75 yards on three plays, hitting Johnson in the corner 
of the end zone despite a swarm of Saints defenders around him. The 
Saints' Ricky Williams had his second 100-yard day as a pro, 
rushing for 179 yards on 40 carries.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Arrives in Oslo Round of Middle East Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By BARRY SCHWEID 	
</P>
<P>
                        *AP Diplomatic Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Describing his mood as ``very hopeful,''  
President Clinton arrived in Oslo, Norway, on Monday for meetings 
with Middle East leaders that could begin a final push toward 
earning a place in history as an honored peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was greeted by Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bonvevik  
and a few dignitaries after his plane, Air Force One, landed at 
Oslo's airport shortly after midnight Monday. When asked his 
feelings about meeting with Middle East leaders, Clinton said, 
``Very hopeful, very hopeful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton waved to a crowd of onlookers, noting that he paid his  
first visit to Norway 30 years ago. The White House said Clinton is 
the first sitting U.S. president to visit Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has picked an agreement between Israel and the Arabs as  
his top foreign policy priority. It also could be his best chance 
for a shining legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was meeting with Middle East leaders later Monday at a  
ceremony honoring slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom 
Clinton called ``one of the great heroes of this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will honor him by not only remembering his life but by  
pursuing his vision of a peaceful Middle East,'' Clinton said. 
``There are tremendous challenges ahead. I will do everything I can 
to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians have given themselves until  
September to conclude an overall settlement. On Friday they decided 
to get started Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	That schedule coincides with the winding down of Clinton's  
second term. He has nearly 15 months left in office, time enough 
for the president to play the role of prodder or dealmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat are willing to try on their own. But if they 
get hung up on the tough issues, Clinton is just a telephone call 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be central to the peace process not only because the  
parties want us to be, but because it is a strategic interest of 
the United States,'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security 
adviser, said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak suggested Sunday he wished to carry out Rabin's  
peacemaking legacy. ``We feel more than anything that we are 
continuing along his way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, said he  
hoped the talks at Oslo, where the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
accords were signed, ``will give a great push'' to both sides to 
resolve the most difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is ready to help after the rigorous training exercise in  
last year's successful West Bank diplomacy in rural Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning, in 1993, Clinton focused on domestic issues  
such as the economy and health care, and was slow to get to foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought his legacy would be, Clinton said it would  
be remembered that he ``turned the economy around and prepared 
America for a new century.'' In an interview for broadcast Monday 
on the premier of CBS' ``Early Show,'' Clinton spoke about the 
Middle East, but didn't mention foreign affairs as part of his 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	When he did concentrate on the outside world, the most pressing  
matters were conflict in the Balkans, the search for illegal 
weapons in Iraq and the need to set a course for dealing with 
Russia and China. He also made some bold strokes to settle the 
Northern Ireland problem. An agreement he nurtured, while tenuous, 
essentially is holding. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, though, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal receding  
and peace prospects in the Middle East more promising than ever, 
Clinton has his sights on an overall settlement between Israel and 
the Arabs as a final act. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flying to Oslo on Sunday with limited expectations on  
what will be a brief fling at Middle East diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is short; Clinton departs Norway on Tuesday. He will  
spend part of the time in a ceremony marking the fourth anniversary 
of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister 
whose path to talks with the Palestinians was paved through quiet 
Norwegian diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has separate meetings set Monday with Barak and with  
Arafat. On Tuesday he sits down with them together. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference Thursday, Clinton said he did  
not want to raise expectations excessively for his talks in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	His aides said there was no chance, whatever Barak and Arafat  
tell him, that Clinton would get into the kind of marathon 
mediating he did on Maryland's eastern shore in October 1998 that 
helped produce a West Bank agreement between Arafat and 
then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues on the table are far tougher than the partial Israeli  
pullback negotiated in Maryland: Palestinian statehood aspirations, 
the future of Jerusalem, borders, the status of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very important occasion. ... I believe this meeting  
can help us resume momentum,'' Barak said in an interview reported 
in Sunday's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the Oslo accords in 1993 anticipated a step-by-step  
approach in peacemaking, not the high-energy drive for a final 
settlement approved by Barak and Arafat and endorsed by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's ambitious approach would go even further and aim for a  
quick peace treaty with Syria. That track is cold now, and without 
a Syrian presence in Oslo, Clinton is unlikely to make real headway 
on that track. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabin's view was that the Israeli people could not ``digest''  
simultaneous agreements with the Palestinians and with Syria, both 
of which would call for giving up land and probably uprooting 
Jewish settlers. Barak, however, is ready to gamble -- ``I believe 
there will be negotiations with Syria in the next few weeks or 
months,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton, Barak has an American president prepared to spend  
the time before packing up in January 2001 and to position himself 
for a place in history.

<HEADLINE> Auto Accessories Show Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Chrome wheels, running boards and spiced-up  
engines used to be the exclusive tools of garage Van Goghs who took 
vehicles from Detroit and transformed them into something unique. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, Detroit is paying more attention to the gizmos  
and gee-gaws customers stick on their vehicles -- and even getting 
into the game themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	That interest will be a big part of the annual mecca for the  
auto accessories industry, the Specialty Equipment Market 
Association's trade show in Las Vegas that begins today. General 
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler and other automakers 
all plan several events to show off their latest wares to some 
80,000 retailers and 6,000 vendors expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Van Cleve, the association's chairman, said much of the  
automakers' attentions can be traced to a growth spurt in the $21 
billion market for customizing products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Detroit has been looking at us like `My gosh, maybe there's  
something here we're missing,''' Van Cleve said. ``I think they're 
realizing the consumer wants his or her vehicle to be a little 
different than the guy or girl next door. And we can manufacture a 
part and change it so much faster than Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market has grown more than 9 percent a year for the past 12  
years, according to association figures. Industry consultant James 
Lang, president of Lang Marketing Resources in Wyckoff, N.J., said 
much of the growth has come due to the shift in consumer tastes 
from cars to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who purchase light trucks have an unending appetite to  
purchase accessories for those vehicles,'' Lang said. ``The least 
expensive vehicle you can buy new is usually a stripped-down truck, 
and they're often bought by younger people who buy these 
accessories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are historical precedents for Detroit's interest in  
popular add-ons. For instance, ``We invented the seat belt and 
rearview mirrors,'' noted Van Cleve. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days manufacturers keep adding on. In August, Ford  
announced the Harley-Davidson F-150 pickup -- a truck decked out 
with Harley-Davidson logos, bigger tires and chrome exhaust tips. 
While a suggested price has not been announced, Lang noted that 
such add-ons are usually high-profit items for automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just cosmetic products that do well. Squeezing more  
power out of engines has always been a big part of car customizers, 
and another area that automakers pay attention to. For the past few 
years, the best sellers have been hot-rod products for small 
Japanese cars, especially the Honda Civic, a favorite among young 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Cleve said the Civic and other Japanese models were often  
``Mom-and-Pop grocery getters'' that were handed down to children, 
who then spruced them up. Lang said today's hot-rodders tend to do 
less complicated engine work than their counterparts in the 1960s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emissions controls and computerization has served as a damper  
on some engine productions,'' Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other goods getting attention from automakers and suppliers  
are high-tech components that aren't quite ready for mass 
production. While a few automakers have proposed installing 
Internet-capable computers in cars, there's already one such device 
on the market -- the Clarion Auto PC, a voice-activated in-dash 
computer/CD player that sells for $1,300.

<HEADLINE> Gas May Solve Israel Energy Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Natural gas discovered off Israel's shores may  
be enough to supply the country's short-term energy needs, the 
country's oil commissioner said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli drilling company Isramco Inc. on Sunday reported  
natural gas flow from an offshore test drill near the southern town 
of Ashkelon. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with another natural gas find in a June drill led by  
Avner Oil Exploration and Delek Drilling, Oil Commissioner 
Yehezkeel Drukman said the likelihood of the energy-strapped 
country producing commercial quantities of gas is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems there are commercial quantities of natural gas in  
both fields ... which of course must be studied further,'' Drukman 
told Israel radio. ``It looks like we have two fields, which 
according to initial calculations could supply all the consumption 
needs of the Israel Electric Corp. for the next five years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Israel Electric Corp. consumes most of the  
country's fuel imports. No commercial quantities of natural gas or 
oil have been found within Israeli territory to date. 
</P>
<P>
	Drukman warned that Sunday's findings required further study.  
</P>
<P>
	When news of the discovery reached the Tel Aviv stock exchange  
Sunday, Isramco shares jumped 18 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush Asks for Puerto Rican Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Speaking in both Spanish and  
English, presidential candidate George W. Bush asked for the 
support of Puerto Ricans in a videotaped message to the island's 
small Republican Party on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As residents of a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Ricans cannot cast  
ballots in next year's presidential election, but they can vote in 
party primaries and conventions. They also raise funds for 
candidates and are seen as important judges of a candidate's appeal 
among Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think of Puerto Rico as Bush territory, but I am  
taking nothing for granted in this election,'' Bush said in the 
message to party members meeting for the island's local party 
convention in Guaynabo, a suburb of San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, slipping into Spanish, Bush said: ``I want your vote. With  
your support, together we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's message comes while some local Republicans worry that  
Puerto Rican protests against the U.S. Navy here may jeopardize 
their efforts to make the island the 51st U.S. state. The Puerto 
Rican government has demanded the Navy leave its training ground on 
the territory's island of Vieques following recent accidents there. 
</P>
<P>
	Training on Vieques was halted after a civilian guard on the  
range was killed in a bombing accident April 19. The Navy says it 
must resume training soon, however, to prepare the USS Eisenhower 
battle group before it begins a six-month deployment overseas in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech at the convention, former Gov. Luis A. Ferre urged  
fellow Republicans to make U.S. statehood the main issue during the 
campaign and to downplay the Vieques conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put aside all those other things and concentrate on  
everything that will carry us toward statehood,'' Ferre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not comment on the Vieques dispute or U.S. statehood in  
his message Sunday, and he gave few details of his platform. But he 
emphasized his desire to better divide the fruits of a booming U.S. 
economy, saying, ``The purpose of prosperity is to leave no one 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, the Republican Party is dominated by  
pro-statehooders, while the much larger Democratic Party is divided 
between pro-statehooders and people who favor the current 
commonwealth arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello, who favors statehood, is a member of the  
presidential campaign staff of Democratic candidate Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley,  
visited the island in August and sided with the pro-commonwealth 
faction.

<HEADLINE> Injuries in the NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The scariest NFL injury Sunday belonged to Indianapolis  
defensive end Mark Thomas. For sheer volume, nothing can compare to 
the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was diagnosed with a concussion after being removed from  
the field on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to a hospital. He 
was hit in the head late in Sunday's game against Dallas, which the 
Colts won 34-24. 
</P>
<P>
	But the injury is not considered life threatening, club  
president Bill Polian said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors weren't overly concerned,'' Polian said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was injured when he was blocked in the Dallas backfield.  
He lay motionless on the turf of the RCA Dome for about 10 minutes 
while receiving medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talking, he's awake,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``They  
don't think it's a neck or spine injury. There's no paralysis. 
Mainly, he just got knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We said a prayer in the locker room after the game,'' Colts  
quarterback Peyton Manning said. ``Hopefully, Mark will be all 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said doctors performed a CAT scan as a precaution at the  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, no fewer than seven Broncos limped, staggered or had  
to be assisted to the sideline with injuries in Sunday's 23-20 loss 
to the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Alfred Williams and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey  
were the most seriously wounded. Williams ruptured his right 
Achilles' tendon, a season- and possibly career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, who left the game in the first quarter after being  
hit in the head but returned in the second half, sprained his left 
knee in the fourth quarter. He was scheduled Monday for an MRI that 
a team official called precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Running backs Olandis Gary and Derek Loville, cornerbacks Ray  
Crockett and Dale Carter and linebacker Al Wilson also were 
sidelined for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Those injuries add to a lengthy casualty list that already  
includes Terrell Davis, last year's NFL MVP who is out for the 
season with a knee injury; linebacker John Mobley, out for the year 
with a similar injury; and tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is 
expected to miss about eight games before returning in December 
from a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter of the same game Thomas was injured,  
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman was hit in the head when he was 
sacked by Colts defensive back Jeff Burris. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman stayed on the turf for several seconds after the sack and  
missed a series before returning to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Garrett, whose only action this season has been to take a  
knee on two plays late in one game, took over for Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas quarterback was using smelling salts on the sideline  
and appeared to be walking around glassy-eyed, but his head cleared 
enough for him to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Akili Smith hurt the big toe on  
his right foot and didn't start the second half against 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith played the entire first half and had his toughest game so  
far, going 6-of-12 for 67 yards with two interceptions and four 
sacks. The Jaguars led 27-0 at halftime and went on to win 41-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith went for X-rays on the toe while Jeff Blake started the  
second half. No fracture was found, and the injury was diagnosed as 
a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same game, Jaguars offensive tackle Tony Boselli sprained  
his ankle and walked slowly off the field in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland punt returner David Dunn sustained a concussion when  
he was hit by New Orleans linebacker Vinson Smith in the first 
quarter, causing Dunn to fumble and leading to a Saints touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, who made his first  
start since Oct. 10, re-injured a bruised nerve in his neck trying 
to make a tackle after an interception and left the game, which the 
Browns won 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Joe Tolliver replaced Hobert and went 9-of-20 for 92  
yards.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Temper May Become an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- While rising in the GOP presidential polls, Sen.  
John McCain is facing questions about what some Arizona political 
leaders view as his quick temper -- and whether it might hinder him 
as president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a front page article and separate editorial Sunday, The  
Arizona Republic said it wanted the nation to know about the 
``volcanic'' temper McCain has unleashed on several top state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have been on the receiving end of a McCain uproar  
include Republican Gov. Jane Hull, former Republican Gov. Rose 
Mofford and former Democratic Mayor Paul Johnson of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, a supporter of GOP presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush, has acknowledged that her relationship with McCain has 
been cool and told an interviewer recently McCain ``has to keep 
control'' of his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hull spokesman, Francie Noyes, said Sunday the governor had no  
further comment on the matter of McCain's temperament and that 
``she wants to move on to other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Arizona Republic, which endorsed McCain for each of his  
five congressional races but has not yet made an endorsement in the 
presidential race, was direct. 
</P>
<P>
	It declared in an editorial:  
</P>
<P>
	``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it  
is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we 
know in Arizona. There is also reason to seriously question whether 
he has the temperament, and the political approach and skills, we 
want in the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said the criticism reflects McCain's  
emergence as a serious contender, resulting media scrutiny, and the 
fact that the former Vietnam POW ``is a fighter and has always been 
a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When a candidate moves up in the polls as quickly as John  
McCain has there's bound to be closer media scrutiny,'' Schnur 
said. ``Show me a politician who's never offended anyone and I'll 
show you a politician who's pretty useless to his constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, McCain blamed the Bush campaign for helping  
plant recent temper stories and said the ``hothead'' portrayal was 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like  
that? No, I don't,'' insisted McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson, executive editor of The Republic, said her paper's  
coverage decisions were made independently, not at the suggestion 
of anyone in the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the admirable qualities of Sen. McCain have been  
widely reported nationally. A lot of the temperament issues have 
not,'' said Johnson, who is in charge of the paper's editorial and 
news pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of McCain's supporters acknowledge a short fuse, but  
say that should not disqualify him to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think John McCain is as steady as they come. I've seen him  
get really passionate about issues, but I don't see it as losing 
control,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. He called McCain's 
passion refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	State Superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan, who also is a McCain  
supporter, said she has argued heatedly with McCain many times over 
the years but that his ``passion ... is positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking for someone who serves tea in white gloves.  
That's not attractive in a president,'' said Keegan, describing 
McCain as a calm, affable person, but one ready to jump into a 
fray. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the Wall Street Journal and New York Times  
also have published articles documenting McCain's often testy 
relationships in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull told the Times that McCain's temper ``is something  
that John has to keep control of.'' According to the Times, when 
Mrs. Hull was asked to describe McCain's temper she pretended to 
hold a telephone receiver several inches from her ear. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, McCain has kept his temper under control,  
publicly at least. He showed restraint during Senate floor debate 
on campaign finance reform -- one of his priority issues -- when Sen. 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tried to goad him into losing his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sabato, a political science professor the University of  
Virginia, said McCain's temper is a legitimate subject for 
questions, but noted a number of president have had fiery tempers. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were famous for  
having bad tempers. Since his election, current President Bill 
Clinton has become known for having one also. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disqualifying because so many presidents have had bad  
tempers, but it's important to know about,'' Sabato said. ``You 
want to know what the fundamental character of a candidate for 
president is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's temper could be presented in a good light or bad,  
Sabato said. Supporters can say McCain listens to the people not 
politicians, while critics may charge that he can't work with 
others, he said.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Eyes Thailand for New Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The world's biggest auto parts  
manufacturer, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., is holding 
preliminary discussions with the Thai Board of Investment on 
establishing a plant in Thailand, near new facilities set up by 
General Motors and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials representing Delphi and the Thai board last week  
confirmed, on condition of anonymity, reports in Thai newspapers 
that a few rounds of talks have been held, but no final decision 
has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers GM, Ford and BMW have or are in the process of  
setting up plants on Thailand's eastern seaboard, joining Japanese 
firms long established here. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors, which unveiled plans in 1996 to launch a plant  
producing 100,000 new vehicles a year, scaled back plans after the 
Asian economic crisis struck. GM now plans to start producing 
Zafira minivans by next May, with initial production of 40,000 
vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been producing Ranger pickup trucks in its  
joint-venture plant with Mazda since 1998 and plans to market 
locally produced Laser sedans next year to compete with popular 
Japanese models. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., was spun off by General Motors in  
May with an eye to allowing the company -- the 36th largest 
manufacturing firm in the United States -- more flexibility in 
reaching deals with other automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently announced third-quarter sales of $6.9 billion were up  
18 percent over a year ago. Sales to customers other than GM 
totaled $1.7 billion, a 16 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Science Puts Freud to the Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sigmund Freud might concede that sometimes a  
cigar is just a cigar. But on the larger issue he was adamant -- a 
dream is never just a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Then what is a dream? The question has divided students of the  
mind for a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud argued that dreams are windows into an otherwise  
inaccessible mind, ``the royal road to the unconscious.'' But 
others have contended that they are mere static, the random firings 
of a dormant brain. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a  
lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sigmund Freud  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A century ago a dream was a will-o'-the-wisp, a tantalizing  
glimpse into a spirit world where truths were revealed and events 
foretold. But Freud changed all that with a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published on Nov. 4, 1899,  
re-created dreams as a powerful probe of the unconscious mind. 
Suddenly they were messages from a landscape entirely within us, 
and yet totally unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before Freud you would say that dreams were considered as  
spirits, as otherworldly things, messages from the other world. 
They were dealt with in religious and philosophical ways,'' says 
psychoanalyst Leon Hoffman. ``Through his study he came to the idea 
that the mind worked outside of our awareness and that dreams had 
meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A century later, science is putting Freud to the test. New  
brain-imaging technologies allow researchers to see which parts of 
the brain are active during a dream, and which are dead to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is helping in being able to test all of the ideas in a  
scientific way, in a reproducible scientific way,'' says Edward 
Nersessian, a psychoanalyst in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	``You are innocent when you dream.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Waits  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Freud argued that dreams are a person's most deeply held wishes,  
expressed in symbolic form. Their purpose? To keep the unconscious 
drives that constantly pop up within us from waking us in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the essence of Freud's theory, that dreams protect  
sleep,'' says Mark Solms, a neuroscientist at St. Bartholomew's and 
Royal London School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Few psychoanalysts believe that today. But Freud's more basic  
idea, that dreams are messages from a part of the mind beyond our 
conscious control, is stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used dreams to try to get at what unconscious processes  
were and how they work,'' Harvard University psychiatrist David 
Westen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars didn't always support that idea. In 1953, researchers  
discovered a stage of sleep called REM, for rapid eye movement. 
During REM sleep much of the brain becomes as active as it is 
during waking. The eyes dart around behind closed lids as if 
following an action-packed sporting event. Most intriguing, people 
awakened from REM sleep almost always say they have been dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	That led researchers to equate REM sleep with dreaming. When  
they looked for the part of the brain that controls REM, they found 
that its source is the pons, a primitive section of the brain stem 
that has more to do with reflexes like breathing than deeply held 
wishes, desires, hopes and fears. 
</P>
<P>
	So Freud must have been wrong, they concluded. Dreams are  
nothing more than random images conjured up by a senselessly 
whirring brain, and any meaning we associate with them is imposed 
by the conscious mind, not generated by the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent research has shown that REM and dreams are not the  
same. Solms has studied patients who have brain damage to the pons 
which renders them incapable of REM sleep. Yet those people still 
dream. Other people with damage to higher parts of the brain can't 
dream. But they do experience REM sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have also found that REM sleep is not the exclusive  
province of dreams. Although most dreams happen then, people also 
dream at other times during sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent discoveries have led researchers to the conclusion  
that REM is merely a trigger for dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``REM sleep is the best place for dreaming,'' says Ernest  
Hartmann, a professor of psychiatry at Tufts University in Boston. 
``It is not the only place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	``We are the stuff that dreams are made on.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Prospero, in Shakespeare's ``The Tempest''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, new imaging technologies have shown what  
parts of the brain are most active during dreaming. Allen Braun of 
the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication 
Disorders studies sleeping people with a technology called positron 
emission tomography, or PET, scanning. What he is finding can be 
used to test some of Freud's ideas about dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can see if the patterns are congruent with his ideas,''  
Braun says. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, during dreaming the parts of the brain involved in  
emotions and emotional memories are active. That explains why 
dreams can feel so intense and powerful. The areas involved in 
recognizing objects and processing images are also active -- which 
is consistent with the strong visual nature of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the areas that Braun calls the ``executive regions of  
the brain'' are deactivated. That might help explain why dreams are 
often illogical, irrational and out of sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those observations are roughly consistent with Freud's  
idea of dreams as messages from the unconscious mind. But contrary 
to what Freud might have predicted, the part of the brain involved 
in processing symbols is relatively quiet during dreaming. Freud 
believed that dreams were full of symbols that had to be decoded to 
reveal the innermost workings of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dreams may be meaningful, but they're not meaningful in the  
way Freud thought,'' Braun says. 
</P>
<P>
	He and several of his colleagues believe that the meaning of  
dreams is right on the surface. In other words, a cigar is always 
just a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	``So I awoke, and behold it was a dream.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- John Bunyan, ``The Pilgrim's Progress''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hartmann, who actually met Freud during the 1930s, also thinks  
Freud got dreams mostly, but not completely, right. 
</P>
<P>
	. ``They tell me Freud patted me on the head,'' Hartmann says of  
his meeting with Freud. ``He was 80 and I was two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud might not react so warmly to Hartmann today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Freud was very smart,'' Hartmann says. ``But I do not  
believe every dream is the fulfillment of a wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartmann's own theory relies on the modern idea that the brain  
is an intricate web of connected nerve cells. During dreaming we 
explore that network in ways that are impossible while awake, 
making broader connections and associations than we otherwise 
would. 
</P>
<P>
	That may explain why artists often find inspiration in dreams,  
Hartmann argues. But both experience and research show that logical 
thought is almost completely absent from dreams. Even the most 
brilliant thinkers rarely find themselves doing arithmetic or 
solving complex problems in dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do less A, B, C, D,'' Hartmann says. ``We do more fanciful  
stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs 34, Chargers 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Before the game even started, the San  
Diego Chargers got penalized for delay of game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Safety Reggie Tongue's 7-yard fumble return for a touchdown  
helped stake Kansas City to a 20-0 halftime lead en route to a 34-0 
victory Sunday in a one-sided showdown for first place in the AFC 
West. It was the Chargers' first shutout loss in the regular season 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City had minus-9 yards and a fumble 7:10 into the first  
quarter, but the Chiefs (5-2) held a 10-0 lead thanks to Erik 
Kramer's fumble and eighth interception in six quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (4-3) had only one first down and 28 net yards in the  
first half, which started on an embarrassing note for the Chargers 
and ended on a near-disaster. They were assessed a delay-of-game 
penalty when they failed to get the kickoff away within 25 seconds 
of the referee's blowing his whistle signaling the game was ready 
to start. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final seconds of the second quarter, Michael Dumas  
blocked a Kansas City punt near the Chiefs goal line. But the ball 
squirted directly into the arms of Chiefs linebacker Greg Manusky, 
who lumbered 84 yards to the 7 before Chris Penn ran him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who came into the game with eight interceptions and no  
touchdowns in his three previous starts, threw the ball directly to 
Cris Dishman early in the first quarter, leading to Pete 
Stoyanovich's 43-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, Tongue caught Kramer on a blitz, knocked  
the ball out of his hands, scooped it up and dashed 7 yards into 
the end zone. Jim Harbaugh, for the second week in a row, then 
replaced Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Grbac, who threw four interceptions on Oct. 3 when the  
Chargers beat the Chiefs 21-14 in San Diego, was 11-for-15 for 194 
yards. He threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Joe Horn in the second 
quarter and connected with Derrick Alexander on an 81-yard 
touchdown play in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who had an 86-yard touchdown catch in the season  
opener at Chicago, was about 15 yards behind backup cornerback 
Jimmy Spencer when he caught the pass on the 45. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, James Hasty batted down Harbaugh's pass,  
and Derrick Thomas made the first interception of his 11-year 
career, returning the ball 20 yards and setting up a 7-yard 
touchdown run by Donnell Bennett that made it 34-0 with 2:58 left 
in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoyanovich hit a 39-yarder early in the second quarter for a  
13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, clobbered 31-3 by Green Bay last week, had six  
false start penalties. They were within inches of averting the 
shutout with a fourth-and-goal in the fourth, but Harbaugh fumbled 
the snap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs were without starting wide receiver and backup tight  
end Lonnie Johnson, who were made inactive following their arrests 
Friday night in separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison was arrested for disturbing the peace after a fight in a  
restaurant parking lot, and Johnson was arrested after police 
contended he grabbed the breast of an undercover officer working a 
prostitution decoy operation.

<HEADLINE> New Sonar Can Find Buried Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Finding lost objects on the ocean  
floor is becoming almost commonplace. Witness the discovery in 
recent years of the Titanic and the recovery of a Mercury space 
capsule and wreckage from plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Navy has developed a new kind of sonar to take the next  
step: finding objects buried beneath the sea bottom. Of primary 
interest are explosive mines hidden under sediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as synthetic aperture sonar, the experimental device also  
could be used to look under the ocean floor for bombs, artillery 
shells and other unexploded ordnance as well as pipelines, 
shipwrecks and artifacts of interest to archaeologists, or even 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in operation in this experimental mode now and we've gone  
out and demonstrated it in a number of exercises,'' said Kerry 
Commander, head of acoustical sensing research at the Navy's 
Coastal Systems Station near Panama City Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are some problems and further research is being  
conducted before the new sonar, designed to find objects in up to 3 
feet of sediment, will becomes operational. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonar, which stands for Sound Navigation and Ranging, sends out  
sound signals, or pings, and analyzes the echo that bounces back. 
Synthetic aperture sonar, or SAS, combines multiple signals while 
being towed through the water by a ship or, in the future, aboard a 
small robot submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through signal processing it knows exactly how far it's moved  
each time and it can basically take the information from each one 
of those pings and add it up,'' Commander said. The result is a 
single very high resolution, video-like image of the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing can be accomplished by having a large sonar array  
about 50 feet long. Signal processing, however, shrinks the length 
to a more practical 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinary sonar was sufficient to find wreckage from TWA Flight  
800 in 1996 and this year the small plane that carried John F. 
Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister to their death, but it cannot 
penetrate the sediment. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental SAS was dispatched last year to the scene of  
the Swissair crash in the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia. The 
water, however, was clear enough to successfully use another 
experimental Navy mine-hunting device, a laser camera, to find the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic aperture sonar and the laser camera also have been  
combined with other sonar, magnetic and chemical sensors in another 
system being developed at the Coastal Systems Station to find 
unexploded ordnance and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mobile Underwater Debris Survey System, or MUDSS, is  
designed to help clear bombing ranges and other underwater sites 
the military has abandoned or closed. 
</P>
<P>
	A future use for SAS may be in environmental studies to find  
animals, such as certain types of shrimp, that burrow into the 
sediment, said University of Texas research engineering associate 
Nicholas Chotiros. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more of those creatures there are around, the healthier  
the environment,'' Chotiros said. ``If they happen to disappear all 
of a sudden, you might have a pollution problem on your hands you 
hadn't noticed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chotiros is among more than 100 scientists, engineers and  
support personnel from Navy, university and commercial 
organizations across the nation working on an ocean sediment study 
intended to improve the performance of the new sonar. 
</P>
<P>
	While SAS provides a clear image of the ocean bottom, buried  
objects often appear too fuzzy to determine what they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand precisely what happens to the image when  
it gets into the sediment,'' Commander said. ``It distorts the 
signals coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get some answers, the Navy commissioned the five-year, $8  
million sediment study that will continue through 2002. Its first 
sea test began in early October and will continue through 
mid-November off the Florida Panhandle at Destin and Panama City 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Three research vessels have been operating out of the Coastal  
Systems Station, placing test equipment on the bottom of the Gulf 
of Mexico in about 60 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	A key issue is determining whether one of two theories about  
sound movement through sediment, or perhaps a combination of the 
two, is correct, said the study's chief scientist, Eric Thorsos of 
the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The older and simpler theory is that porous sandy sediment is  
just a fluid that is heavier than water. The newer theory is that 
ripples and other irregularities in the sediment surface change 
sound penetration. 
</P>
<P>
	That may explain why the SAS has detected objects in certain  
situations when, according to the old theory, it should not have, 
Commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the technology builders and the sensor builders, will  
benefit enormously from that information,'' Commander said. ``It 
will help us eventually to create better images and we'll become a 
lot smarter about how to go about imaging things that are in the 
sediment.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Socialist Leads Uruguay Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- A socialist dominated the  
presidential election in Uruguay on Sunday, but apparently failed 
to win enough votes to avoid a runoff, exit poll results show. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabare Vazquez of the leftist Broad Front captured 39 percent of  
the vote, said Factum, a respected independent polling group. It 
said Jorge Batlle of the ruling Colorado Party finished second with 
32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	If the prediction is supported by the vote count, the two  
candidates will face off in a Nov. 28 runoff election. A candidate 
must win at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the two advancing parties waved giant flags, beat  
drums and noisily paraded in car caravans through this capital 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Factum projected that Luis Lacalle, a former president and  
nominee of the center-right National Party, would place third with 
22 percent and be eliminated along with two other minor candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	No margin of error was given, but another independent exit poll  
gave nearly identical results. First official results weren't 
expected until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a night of joy,'' Vazquez declared on television. But  
he cautioned that another month of hard campaigning lay ahead. ``We 
have to win two times over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Vazquez would be yet another example of a leftist  
political renewal in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of disfavor following the end of the Cold War, Latin  
America's left appears to be gaining strength. Argentina's 
center-left opposition Alliance won the Oct. 24 presidential 
election. And in Chile, Ricardo Lagos is favored by the polls to 
become the country's first elected socialist in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In Uruguay, the campaign had been characterized by talk about  
whether the left has become more moderate since the Cold War-era. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Broad Front coalition and the ruling Colorados of  
outgoing President Julio Maria Sanguinetti celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanguinetti leaves office March 1 after a five-year term, his  
second since a stint starting in 1985 that capped 12 years of 
military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Batlle, 73, running for the fifth time, pledged to win the  
runoff as he took the podium for a celebration at Colorado Party 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take the necessary steps to find points of agreement  
with other political forces that will not take part in the second 
round,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections also were held Sunday for 30 senators and 99 deputies  
in the bicameral legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez has proposed an ``emergency'' plan to spend more than  
$200 million to create tens of thousands of jobs. He pledges to 
make the wealthier pay more income tax while exempting those who 
earn less than $1,200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to turn around a listless economy marked by a 10  
percent unemployment rate he blames on Sanguinetti's strict fiscal 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Batlle, an economist, charges that the Broad Front, a diverse  
coalition founded in 1971, includes fringe Marxist elements that 
could disrupt or even derail the free-market financial policies 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez dismisses characterizations that he is an unreformed  
Marxist, responding in an interview this past week by saying, ``No, 
I am eclectic.''

<HEADLINE> How New York Prepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the bottled water. Dump the cases of  
canned soup. Save the year's supply of batteries for Junior's 
Gameboy. When it comes to the Y2K computer glitch, New York's 
techno-types say the Big Apple bit first. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been working since 1995 to replace microchips,  
hardware and software, and rewrite computer coding that otherwise 
would have thrown New York into chaos when the clock struck a 
second past midnight Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Programmers reviewed 65 million lines of computer code written  
in 65 different programming languages. The city replaced more than 
10,000 computers and bought 50,000 new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, there were 677 ``high-priority'' systems to  
evaluate. Those were the ones left after Deputy Mayor Joseph J. 
Lhota deleted psuedo-important items some agency heads had listed 
as critical, like their scheduling software. (Get a calendar, Lhota 
told them.) 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a troublesome comptroller's audit which showed a number  
of city agencies behind schedule, those working on the bug say 
they've beat it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the best city in the country, actually I figure in the  
world, in terms of dealing with any sort of crisis,'' said Brian 
Cohen, executive director of the city's $315 million Y2K project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If having an extra $50 over the weekend makes you feel more  
comfortable, then you should do that,'' he said of New Year's Eve, 
1999. ``But your money is safer in the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city itself is printing an extra batch of paychecks. More  
police will be on duty, and emergency shelters will be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing it all will be a staff huddled in a new $13 million  
emergency crisis center. Built to withstand hurricane-force winds, 
bombs and power failures, it contains food and water for the 100 
people who are supposed to know how to fix anything that goes 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K could be their greatest test. The problem dates back to the  
early days of computing, when programmers squeezed every bit of 
memory from their machines by using the last two digits to stand 
for a year. So 1987 became ``87,'' and the Year 2000 was 
represented by ``00.'' The shorthand creates problems if a computer 
mistakes ``00'' for 1900 when adding or subtracting a date. 
</P>
<P>
	If left uncorrected in New York, the glitch could have meant:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 30,000 calls a day to the 911 emergency network transferred to  
the wrong local police or fire station. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Traffic lights stuck on their midnight cycles, creating  
massive gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A jam-packed Times Square plunged into darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Newer elevators shut down, mistakenly calculating that they  
hadn't been serviced in 100 years. (Older ones would be fine. They 
lack the microchips regulating more modern lifts.) 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's office, the utilities, the Federal Aviation  
Administration, all agree such problems won't happen. Their 
computer programmers say they have burrowed into every 
technological crack to fix the so-called Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from an office littered with Y2K paraphernalia --  
including a battery-powered hat with a digital clock ticking down 
to Jan. 1 -- Cohen has directed an army of city employees, 
consultants, electrical and communications workers in updating 
old-fashioned computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thing about Y2K is, no one will know for sure how bad it  
is until it gets here. And so the city is preparing for the 
equivalent of a three-day storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy New York Police Commissioner Richard Sheirer, the NYPD's  
Y2K guy, says the technical aspects of the problem are under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 911 emergency response system, to the robots that  
disarm bombs, to computer-controlled fingerprinting devices, the 
department has tested each computer-driven component it uses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the police department's effort is just beginning. The big  
job comes New Year's Eve, when the department has to oversee the 
party of the millennium. It doesn't want a blackout to match. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern over the possibilities have driven some New Yorkers to  
... do nothing unusual. While some Midwesterners are stocking up on 
ammunition and The Denver Post has published a Y2K recipe section 
advising how to make the most of canned beans, Manhattan stores 
haven't even ordered extra bottled water. And no one seems to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Yorkers are used to hiding things and ignoring things and  
turning away from things,'' says Patrick Shannon, a city resident 
who spends 10 hours a day collecting news for a Y2K Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does take a certain kind of blind spot to live in a city  
this big, with the diversity and adversity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is one prevalent worry: electricity.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the questions at a recent Y2K ``community conversation''  
in Manhattan were about power. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if there's no heat? City schools will open,  
heated by their old coal-fired furnaces or by back-up generators. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if a widespread blackout triggers rioting? Police  
have canceled many vacations around the first of the year. About 
35,000 cops will be on duty the last few days of 1999 and the first 
week of January 2000, roughly 3,000 more than ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' explains  
Sheirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hedlund, director of technology services for Consolidated  
Edison, said the 3 million households and businesses served by the 
utility in New York and suburban Westchester County should have no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed's 10 generating stations have been inspected and found  
Y2K ready. They don't even use dates in manufacturing power. 
Hundreds of employees have looked over power lines, transformers 
and substations. They have also checked an estimated 5 million 
lines of computer coding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really think that a New Year's Eve is going to be a  
nonevent as far as electricity goes,'' Hedlund said. 
</P>
<P>
	As in every Y2K conversation, however, there are doubting  
Thomases. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the city comptroller's office found the fire  
department and Department of Corrections unprepared for Y2K, 
although Cohen says follow-up inspections gave both better grades. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's physical preparation is only half the Y2K challenge.  
The rest is psychological. Despite New York's overall nonchalance, 
some people are worried. And worried people can become panicked if 
the power goes out or something else goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Square will likely be the site of the world's largest  
millennial celebration, attracting perhaps 1.5 million people. 
Known for the icy temperatures and hard-partying crowd that usually 
accompany the festivities, it's hard to imagine a worse place to be 
if the lights went out, traffic jammed, the trains stopped running 
and everybody flipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is relying heavily on advanced public relations. City  
officials are already popping up at neighborhood events, and a 
brochure assures readers that technicians have updated the 911 
emergency call system. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the vague wording leaves room for interpretation, group  
psychologists say the city is on to something. 
</P>
<P>
	Generalities like ``Hospitals have been working hard to address  
areas in the medical industry ... '' and ``utility companies ... 
have assured us that power, gas, steam and telephone service will 
continue'' may sound simplistic, but they can ease fear of a 
far-reaching computer problem people don't quite understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis C. Danes, of the Society for the Advancement of Social  
Psychology, said the brochure lets people know government has an 
eye on things and helps by telling where to go for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, plans won't be worth the paper they're printed on if a  
blackout in Times Square sends the crowd spiralling into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the people start to panic, the police have to react,''  
Danes said. ``The best thing to do would be to make sure that the 
lights don't go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The following steps are recommended to prepare for Jan. 1, 2000,  
the date a computer problem known as Y2K could cause various 
service interruptions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep a three-day supply of nonperishable food, baby-food,  
diapers, water, and batteries for a radio. Also make sure there is 
a non-electric can opener and a flashlight in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buy a first-aid kit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- If you wish to have extra cash on hand, don't wait until Dec.  
31 to take it out. Be discreet about the money you have. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep copies of all financial records for the last three months  
of 1999 and the first three months after the new year; ask your 
financial institutions about their Y2K compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Top off home heating fuel tanks before Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make sure you have extra blankets to keep warm in case the  
heat goes off. Allow faucets to run slightly to prevent pipes from 
freezing. Know where you can go for shelter, such as a nearby 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Develop a plan to keep in touch with family members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Do not use gas-fueled, wood-burning, or liquid-fueled heating  
devices or generators unless they are approved for indoor use. Read 
the manuals and operate only in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Counsels Victim Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Only one passenger got off EgyptAir Flight 990  
when it landed in New York, but in a strange twist, his services 
were needed by the airline almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed McLaughlin works for the Family Enterprise Institute, which  
helps airlines notify family members of air accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin even participated in a news conference eight hours  
after the plane went down, describing his work to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work with EgyptAir to try to help the families with the  
notification process,'' he said. ``At the moment we're struggling 
to get everything together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin never mentioned that he'd been on the doomed plane  
and was the only passenger who boarded in Los Angeles to get off in 
New York. The plane vanished off radar screens near Nantucket 
Island while en route to Cairo from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Robert Boyle, executive director of the Port  
Authority, which manages the airport, confirmed that McLaughlin was 
on the plane as a ``contract worker'' for EgyptAir. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have confirmed it was McLaughlin,'' Boyle said. ``And we  
think he's the only person who got off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle said McLaughlin was in Los Angeles conducting a seminar  
for EgyptAir and that he had been interviewed by authorities before 
going to work at the hotel where grieving family members were 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
	``His credentials check out, and he is currently working with  
EgyptAir with the families,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin, who lives in Manhattan, could not immediately be  
located for comment.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Has No Shortage of Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- EgyptAir may have one of the best safety  
records in the aviation business, but the state-owned company has 
no shortage of critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country riding a tide of privatization, newspapers and  
commentators have clamored for selling the 67-year old company, one 
of the oldest in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating in a region where terrorism is always a threat,  
EgyptAir has emerged unscathed. It has never fallen victim to 
Islamic militants who have been waging a bloody insurrection since 
1992 to set up a theocratic state in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan said Sunday's crash of  
Flight MS990, which was carrying 199 passengers and 15 crew, is the 
airline's first fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, Egypt said it was increasing security at airports and  
on EgyptAir flights. The measures were not in response to any 
specific terrorist threat, officials said, but were to account for 
increased summer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that indicates that this was a terrorist act.  
... Contact with the plane was cut suddenly which indicates that 
something happened suddenly,'' Civil Aviation Minister Ibrahim 
el-Dimeiri told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed security guards routinely fly on EgyptAir flights.  
Passengers, after going through the normal security check at the 
airport, are again subjected to baggage search just before they 
board the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crash comes after the Oct. 19 hijack of an EgyptAir  
flight between Istanbul and Cairo. It was commandeered by a man 
identified as Khalaf Fadlallah, who apparently poked a pen at a 
flight crew member's neck and forced the plane to fly to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacking ended peacefully in Hamburg where the hijacker was  
overpowered on the tarmac. None of the 46 passengers on board was 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the hijack was evidence of sloppy security and  
blamed the company for not reinforcing the weak cockpit door, which 
Fadlallah kicked open. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other incidents involving EgyptAir have been reported  
in recent memory. In 1996, a plane skidded onto a road and hit a 
taxi while landing in Istanbul. Nineteen people on board the plane 
were injured. EgyptAir blamed Turkish airport authorities for 
asking the plane to land on a short, sloping runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, EgyptAir mechanics found a 16-ounce hammer left in  
the rudder of a new Boeing 777. The hammer caused small fractures 
in the rudder while bouncing around during flight. Boeing 
apologized for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan, the EgyptAir chairman, has acknowledged mistakes in the  
way the company has been operated, but has ruled out privatization 
of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	A former army general who runs the company with an iron fist,  
Rayan has promised better service, saying the $441-million company 
is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of routes to four African countries last year,  
EgyptAir now operates a fleet of 38 planes -- marked by white 
fuselage and blue tails with the red face of the pharaonic falcon 
god, Horus -- to some 85 airports abroad and 10 in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the carrier suffered $60 million in losses when  
tourists stayed away from Egypt after Muslim extremists killed 58 
foreigners in November 1997 at a tourist site in the southern town 
of Luxor.

	Debris Found in Area That Jet Went Missing  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 plane carrying 214 people disappeared  
early today on a flight from New York to Egypt and debris has been 
found at sea off the island of Nantucket, officials said. EgyptAir 
Flight 990 was headed to Cairo, Coast Guard Lt. Rob Halsey said. It 
originated in Los Angeles, according to EgyptAir officials at Cairo 
International Airport. The debris field was discovered 45 miles 
southeast of Nantucket, the island off the coast of Massachusetts, 
said Coast Guard Lt. Edward Gaynor. He had no other details. There 
were 199 passengers on the flight, including two infants, plus 15 
crew members, an EgyptAir official said in Cairo.

	Cyclone Wreaks Havoc on India  
</P>
<P>
	BALESHWAR, India (AP) -- Hundreds may have died in a cyclone that  
battered a broad swath of eastern India for a second day yesterday, 
knocking out power and telephone lines and flattening thousands of 
homes. Hundreds may have died, said officials in Orissa state, 
which bore the brunt of the storm. While the storm was weakening as 
it moved inland, it wasn't possible to assess the death toll and 
property damage because the area was still inaccessible and cut off 
from communication. ``We are treating it as a national calamity,'' 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said.

	FBI: Threat of Y2K Extremists Real

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of violence by extremists to mark  
the new millennium is ``very real,'' an FBI report being prepared 
reports. The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it 
was preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share 
it with police chiefs at their upcoming convention, the Washington 
Post is reporting in today's editions. The agency said the document 
analyzes ``the potential for extremist criminal activity in the 
United States by individuals or domestic groups who attach special 
significance to the year 2000.''

	Ariz. Paper Cites McCain for Temper

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in John McCain's home state  
is questioning whether the Republican senator has the temperament 
to be president. The Arizona Republic, in an editorial running in 
today's editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it 
says he has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the 
public. ``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the 
presidency, it is time the rest of the nation learned about the 
John McCain we know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says in the 
editorial, a copy of which was provided to The Associated Press

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- With troops clustered forlornly at the  
rail, a gray Indonesian troop-transport ship set sail Sunday from 
the darkened, nearly deserted harbor of East Timor's capital, 
ending a 24-year military occupation of this former Portuguese 
colony that left tens of thousands of people dead. The Indonesians' 
departure marked the end of a long and fruitless struggle by the 
world's most populous Muslim nation to subdue a small, stubbornly 
separatist Roman Catholic province on its eastern fringe. It was an 
ignominious comedown for a military force that once numbered more 
than 40,000 and whose word was once law in a province now on the 
road to independence.

	Cubs Hire Baylor To Manage Team  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Baylor has been hired to manage the Chicago  
Cubs, taking over an injury-plagued team that went from the 
playoffs to last place. Baylor, the hitting coach of the Atlanta 
Braves last season after six years as manager of the Colorado

the Anaheim Angels and Milwaukee Brewers. While there was no 
announcement by the Cubs, his hiring was confirmed to The 
Associated Press by a senior major league team official who spoke 
on the condition he not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Claim Rebel Kills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Government troops fired artillery  
shells at Tamil rebel positions, killing 24 guerillas, the Defense 
Ministry said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were pounding rebel targets Saturday in Elephant  
Pass and Paranathan, about 175 miles north of the capital, Colombo, 
the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Intercepted rebel communications revealed that 14 men and 10  
women guerrillas were killed, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government troops also launched a foray into the northern Wanni  
jungle, backed by Kfir jets, helicopter gunships and artillery 
fire, the ministry said. The operation was still in progress 
Sunday. It said the troops were met with only sporadic rebel mortar 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	No rebel or military casualties were given.  
</P>
<P>
	The military had stepped up offensives in the Wanni jungle and  
dozens of rebels and soldiers have been killed in recent weeks. 
Wanni is about 135 miles north of the capital, Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no independent confirmation of the military statement.  
Journalists are rarely allowed near the war zone except on army-led 
tours, and communication with people living in the region is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for an  
independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of 
the country. More than 58,000 people have been killed since 
fighting began in 1983 in this small island nation off India's 
southern coast.

<HEADLINE> Gore Knocks Bradley on Soc. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley's remark that raising the age for  
Social Security eligibility is worth discussing shows the 
Democratic presidential challenger's lukewarm support for the 
retirement program, Vice President Al Gore's campaign charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Bradley, a former senator  
from New Jersey, was asked Sunday about a Senate vote in which he 
backed a nonbinding resolution expressing support for raising the 
eligibility age from 67 to 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position is that the discussion should continue,'' Bradley  
said. ``My position is that Social Security is the most important 
government program. It should be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure Social Security's future solvency, he added, the issue  
has to cease being ``a political football'' and instead become the 
focus of serious talks between Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Bradley's position on the  
eligibility age suggested a willingness to make fundamental changes 
that might undermine the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't make firm commitment to defending the current age for  
Social Security,'' Lehane said. ``We should keep that commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser responded that Bradley's  
``commitment to Social Security is firm,'' declining to discuss the 
eligibility age issue further. Gore aides, however, indicated the 
vice president may hammer Bradley on the issue in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' repeated his charge that  
Bradley's proposals to extend health insurance to all Americans 
would spend virtually all of the projected budget surpluses over 
the next decade, end the Medicaid program and do nothing to keep 
Medicare solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	``His health care proposal is definitely a throwback to an era  
where both Democrats and Republicans threw fiscal responsibility to 
the wind,'' Gore said. ``If a Republican candidate had proposed 
eliminating Medicaid and taking away everything that's needed to 
save Medicare, Democrats would be up in arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the disagreement over health insurance demonstrates  
how his approach to governing differs from that of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem. It deserves a big solution. I've offered  
that, and I think he's been much more incremental in nature. So I 
think that would lead to us being very different kinds of 
presidents,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also dismissed as ``scare tactics'' Gore's contention  
that his proposal to help 45 million uninsured people get health 
coverage might actually drive up premiums and bust the federal 
budget in future years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was asked about a Time magazine report on his  
campaign's hiring of feminist author Naomi Wolf as an adviser at a 
salary of $15,000 a month. The magazine said Wolf is involved in 
everything from choosing Gore's shirt-and-tie combinations to 
changing public perceptions of him as a permanent No. 2 man. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is the author of several best-sellers on female sexual  
power. In her latest, ``Promiscuities,'' she argues in part that 
schools should teach such things as masturbation because it is more 
realistic than abstinence and safer than sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Wolf's salary is ``a third'' of the reported amount --  
his campaign has drawn criticism for being top-heavy and overpaid -- 
and that she is mainly working with his daughter, Karenna Gore 
Schiff, on Internet efforts to appeal to younger voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a valued adviser and she'll remain one,'' Gore said.  
``We want to attract young women and young men to participate in 
this campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Oslo Trip for Legacy Rabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton hopes his quick trip to  
Oslo, Norway, could begin a final push toward earning a place in 
history as an honored peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has picked an agreement between Israel and the Arabs as  
his top foreign policy priority. It also could be his best chance 
for a shining legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The president departed Sunday for Oslo, Norway, where he planned  
to meet with Middle East leaders at a ceremony honoring slain 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom Clinton called ``one of 
the great heroes of this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will honor him by not only remembering his life but by  
pursuing his vision of a peaceful Middle East,'' Clinton said. 
``There are tremendous challenges ahead. I will do everything I can 
to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians have given themselves until  
September to conclude an overall settlement. On Friday they decided 
to get started Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	That schedule coincides with the winding down of Clinton's  
second term. He has nearly 15 months left in office, time enough 
for the president to play the role of prodder or dealmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat are willing to try on their own. But if they 
get hung up on the tough issues, Clinton is just a telephone call 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be central to the peace process not only because the  
parties want us to be, but because it is a strategic interest of 
the United States,'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security 
adviser, said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak suggested Sunday he wished to carry out Rabin's  
peacemaking legacy. ``We feel more than anything that we are 
continuing along his way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, said he  
hoped the talks at Oslo, where the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
accords were signed, ``will give a great push'' to both sides to 
resolve the most difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is ready to help after the rigorous training exercise in  
last year's successful West Bank diplomacy in rural Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning, in 1993, Clinton focused on domestic issues  
such as the economy and health care, and was slow to get to foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought his legacy would be, Clinton said it would  
be remembered that he ``turned the economy around and prepared 
America for a new century.'' In an interview for broadcast Monday 
on the premier of CBS' ``Early Show,'' Clinton spoke about the 
Middle East, but didn't mention foreign affairs as part of his 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	When he did concentrate on the outside world, the most pressing  
matters were conflict in the Balkans, the search for illegal 
weapons in Iraq and the need to set a course for dealing with 
Russia and China. He also made some bold strokes to settle the 
Northern Ireland problem. An agreement he nurtured, while tenuous, 
essentially is holding. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, though, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal receding  
and peace prospects in the Middle East more promising than ever, 
Clinton has his sights on an overall settlement between Israel and 
the Arabs as a final act. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flying to Oslo on Sunday with limited expectations on  
what will be a brief fling at Middle East diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is short; Clinton departs Norway on Tuesday. He will  
spend part of the time in a ceremony marking the fourth anniversary 
of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister 
whose path to talks with the Palestinians was paved through quiet 
Norwegian diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has separate meetings set Monday with Barak and with  
Arafat. On Tuesday he sits down with them together. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference Thursday, Clinton said he did  
not want to raise expectations excessively for his talks in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	His aides said there was no chance, whatever Barak and Arafat  
tell him, that Clinton would get into the kind of marathon 
mediating he did on Maryland's eastern shore in October 1998 that 
helped produce a West Bank agreement between Arafat and 
then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues on the table are far tougher than the partial Israeli  
pullback negotiated in Maryland: Palestinian statehood aspirations, 
the future of Jerusalem, borders, the status of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very important occasion. ... I believe this meeting  
can help us resume momentum,'' Barak said in an interview reported 
in Sunday's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the Oslo accords in 1993 anticipated a step-by-step  
approach in peacemaking, not the high-energy drive for a final 
settlement approved by Barak and Arafat and endorsed by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's ambitious approach would go even further and aim for a  
quick peace treaty with Syria. That track is cold now, and without 
a Syrian presence in Oslo, Clinton is unlikely to make real headway 
on that track. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabin's view was that the Israeli people could not ``digest''  
simultaneous agreements with the Palestinians and with Syria, both 
of which would call for giving up land and probably uprooting 
Jewish settlers. Barak, however, is ready to gamble -- ``I believe 
there will be negotiations with Syria in the next few weeks or 
months,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton, Barak has an American president prepared to spend  
the time before packing up in January 2001 and to position himself 
for a place in history.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Immigrants Die in Minefield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Five Kurdish immigrants from Iraq were  
killed Sunday and 16 were injured when they entered a minefield 
after illegally crossing over the border from Turkey, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 35 strayed into the minefield near the Kipi border  
post after crossing marshland and the Evros River -- known as the 
Meric River in Turkey -- which separates the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured, some listed in critical condition, were  
hospitalized in the nearby port city of Alexandroupolis. The others 
were held in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of immigrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds, enter  
Greece illegally from Turkey each year, sneaking over the Evros or 
sailing to Greek islands facing Turkey's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece has designated mine fields along its northeastern border  
with rival Turkey. The two neighbors have come close to war three 
times in the last 25 years over territorial disputes and the 
war-divided island of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Baseball's 'Clown Prince' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Max Patkin, the ``Clown Prince of Baseball''  
whose funny faces, pratfalls and one-liners entertained fans for 
more than 50 years, has died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkin, who had a history of heart problems, died of a heart  
aneurysm Saturday at Paoli Memorial Hospital, family members said. 
He had been hospitalized since rupturing an aorta one week before 
his death, his son-in-law Roger Tietsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	For five decades, Patkin was an integral part of the minor  
leagues as a slapstick-style entertainer who would do nearly 
anything for a laugh from fans and players. He mugged his way 
through more than 4,000 minor-league games, becoming so well-known 
that he played himself in ``Bull Durham,'' a 1988 movie staring 
Kevin Costner as an aging minor league player. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkin had aspirations of playing in the minor leagues, and  
played briefly for the Wisconsin Rapids. He became a clown to stay 
close to the sport he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole life was built around baseball,'' he said. ``I'd sit  
at dinner with my baseball hat on. I never took it off until I went 
to bed, then I'd put it under my pillow with my glove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a baggy uniform with a question mark on the back,  
Patkin would contort his face into rubbery shapes, flash signs, 
mimic the first baseman, and even ``coach'' for the home team. Then 
he would rush off to the next town, making every appearance a 
ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave my whole heart, my whole body and soul to baseball,''  
he said. ``I loved being Max Patkin, the Clown Prince of 
Baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patkin retired in 1996 and moved in with his daughter, Joy, and  
son-in-law in Exton. He is survived by his daughter and a sister, 
Ruth Cohen of Pompano Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services have not yet been finalized.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 plane with 197 passengers aboard  
disappeared over the ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket after 
taking off from New York's Kennedy International Airport, officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990 was headed to Cairo, Egypt, Coast Guard Lt.  
Rob Halsey said. It originated in Los Angeles, according to 
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 197 passengers on the flight, an EgyptAir official  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have right now is, we weren't able to establish  
contact,'' Halsey said. ``They had them on radar and then lost the 
radar picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared  
from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot 
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard sent every available cutter and aircraft in the  
Northeast to join the search, plus airplanes from far away as 
Elizabeth City, N.C., said spokesman Jim McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian television quoted EgyptAir officials as saying that  
after the flight left Los Angeles it made a landing at Edwards Air 
Force Base in California before continuing on to Kennedy. However, 
there was no immediate confirmation from Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA officials in Washington, the plane's takeoff  
from Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it arrived late from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	Imad Kassab trembled with hope when he discovered that his  
brother-in-law, Essam Bahjat, was not on the passenger list for the 
flight as he had feared. Kassab, owner of the Cairo branch of the 
U.S.-based restaurant Cheesecake Factory, quickly called friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir has a fleet of 38 planes and flies to some 85 airports  
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, widebody passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982, when the first one was 
delivered to United Airlines. As of April 1, Boeing had received 
865 orders for the 767 and delivered 746 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the planes crashed on May 26, 1991, when a Lauda Air  
767-300ER crashed near Suphan Buri Province, Thailand.

	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 plane with 197 passengers aboard  
disappeared over the ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket early 
Sunday after taking off from New York's Kennedy International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990 was headed to Cairo, Egypt, Coast Guard Lt.  
Rob Halsey said. It originated in Los Angeles, according to 
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 197 passengers on the flight, an EgyptAir official  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have right now is, we weren't able to establish  
contact,'' Halsey said. ``They had them on radar and then lost the 
radar picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared  
from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot 
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in 
Washington. Weather at Kennedy was good with 3 to 4 miles of 
visibility and light wind, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA officials in Washington, the plane's takeoff  
from Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it arrived late from 
Los Angeles. The cause of the delay was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard sent every available cutter and aircraft in the  
Northeast to join the search, plus airplanes from far away as 
Elizabeth City, N.C., said spokesman Jim McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was monitoring the  
situation but had not sent its ``go-team'' of investigators, said 
spokesman Keith Halloway. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI source said the agency was monitoring the situation as  
part of a ``normal routine response'' to an aircraft disappearance, 
and had sent agents to Kennedy airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11, which crashed off 
Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. Planes 
on that route fly from Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before heading east across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	Imad Kassab trembled with hope when he discovered that his  
brother-in-law, Essam Bahjat, was not on the passenger list for the 
flight as he had feared. Kassab, owner of the Cairo branch of the 
U.S.-based restaurant Cheesecake Factory, quickly called friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the airline in  
September 1989. It had logged over 31,000 flight hours and 6,900 
take-offs and landings, said Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 at Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982, when the first one was 
delivered to United Airlines. As of April 1, Boeing had received 
865 orders for the 767 and delivered 746 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the planes crashed on May 26, 1991, when a Lauda Air  
767-300ER crashed near Suphan Buri Province, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauda airplane lost control and crashed after one of its  
engine thrust reversers accidentally deployed during a climb. The 
jet lost 25 percent to 30 percent of its lift and plunged out of 
control into the ground, killing all 10 crew and 213 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an Ethiopian Airlines 767-200ER crashed near  
Moroni, Comoros, on Nov. 23, 1996, while attempting to land after 
being hijacked. The aircraft had been on a flight from Ethiopia to 
Kenya. Ten of the 12 crew members and 117 of the 160 passengers 
were killed. The three hijackers apparently died. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry went through a fatality-free  
year in 1998, but this year there has been the crash of an American 
Airlines jet in Little Rock, Ark., the loss of John F. Kennedy's 
private plane off Martha's Vineyard this summer and last week's 
crash of a Learjet carrying golfer Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Rock crash occurred June 1, as an MD-80 tried to land  
at night in stormy weather. Eleven people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash of Kennedy's plane on July 16 killed him, his wife,  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.

<HEADLINE> Plummet Is Focus in EgyptAir Crash Downed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By CALVIN WOODWARD 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials are reviewing radar tapes tracking a  
terrifying two-minute plunge by EgyptAir Flight 990 as they try to 
determine whether mechanical failure or a criminal act may have 
downed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	From 33,000 feet, the jetliner dropped nearly 14,000 feet in  
only 36 seconds early Sunday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet during that catastrophic plummet, the jetliner apparently  
possessed enough electrical power to broadcast its fast-diminishing 
altitude from its transponder, indicating to some aviation experts 
that it did not immediately break up even if its distress was 
instant. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, somehow, the plane's descent slowed and after about 90  
more seconds it crashed into the dark, cold waters of the Atlantic 
some 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board quickly assumed control  
of the investigation at the request of the Egyptian government, 
which normally would have taken the lead since the plane went down 
in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The only certainty was that the investigation would be neither  
simple nor short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the early hours of this investigation,'' said Jim  
Hall, the safety board chairman. ``We do not know at this point 
what caused the crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials said there was no  
immediate evidence of terrorism, although that was being 
investigated as a possibility. ``I think it's better if people draw 
no conclusions until we know something,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board dispatched a team of crash experts to Quonset  
Point, R.I., designated as command post for the investigation, as 
the FBI interviewed people who had access to the plane. Egyptian 
officials rushed to help their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar tapes indicated the plane plummeted to 19,100 feet from  
33,000 feet in the first 36 seconds. Then, at least part of it 
continued to remain visible on radar for nearly a minute and a 
half. The fall began just a few minutes after a routine voice 
communication from the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	In that first steep fall, the plane plunged at a descent rate of  
about 23,200 feet per minute, two to three times a standard 
emergency descent rate. The continuing radar images after that 
could indicate an in-flight breakup, with smaller pieces drifting 
down more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall wouldn't say whether the radar tapes showed an aircraft in  
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular'' obtained by The  
Associated Press, the Federal Aviation Administration said several 
U.S. agencies got letters in August warning ``a bomb or explosive 
device with `spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight 
departing from either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK 
airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert had been in effect until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 left Los Angeles on Saturday and stopped at John F.  
Kennedy International Airport in New York, bound for Cairo. The 
plane took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. EST Sunday and disappeared 
from radar screens 33 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information about any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the person who made the claim cited in the FAA memo was in prison 
and officials had no information the warning was related to the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, an aviation analyst and veteran airline captain,  
said that if controllers knew the plane's altitude during its drop, 
it would indicate the jet still had partial electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
	While radar locates a target in the sky, controllers do not know  
the identity of the blip or its altitude without information 
broadcast from the airplane's transponder. 
</P>
<P>
	That broadcast can only be made with the help of electricity  
supplied by the plane. A continuing electrical supply could help 
the investigation because it could mean the electric-powered flight 
data recorder and cockpit voice recorder kept operating during part 
of the descent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly what that means I don't know, but it is an entirely  
different situation from TWA (Flight 800) and Pan Am 103, which had 
breakups and an immediate loss of power,'' Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane blew up off Long Island, N.Y., in July 1996,  
killing all 230 aboard. Investigators believe the plane's nearly 
empty center fuel tank exploded. A bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people on 
board and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority, which  
manages Kennedy airport, said the FBI was interviewing the flight 
crew that got off in New York -- replaced by another crew for the 
second leg -- as well as everyone who worked on the plane during its 
layover at JFK of just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were also looking at the plane's production and  
maintenance history. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, tail number SU-GAP, was delivered to EgyptAir in  
September 1989, Hall said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Crash: No Foul Play </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preparing to attend Mideast peace talks in  
Europe, President Clinton said there was no early indication that 
foul play was involved in Sunday's EgyptAir crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no evidence of that at this time, and I think it's  
better if people draw no conclusions until we know something,'' the 
president said after attending church services with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all Americans, Hillary and I are very saddened by the  
crash of the Egypt Air flight off the coast of Massachusetts. We 
are working on the recovery efforts,'' he said. ``We know that 
there has been an extensive loss of life and we don't yet know what 
caused the accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was informed of the crash by his national security  
advisor, Sandy Berger, just hours before he was leaving for Oslo, 
Norway. He is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who are seeking a permanent peace 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was not  
attending the talks, to express his condolences and assure Mubarak 
that every effort was being made for a thorough search and recovery 
effort, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were not ruling out any possibilities  
until investigators could analyze radar data, the debris field, the 
flight recorders and information about people who had contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are any number of things that will provide us more  
factual information rather than guesses,'' said Jim Fallin, 
spokesman for the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the area where  
debris was found of the coast of Nantucket island, administration 
officials said. The Grapple, based at Little Creek, Va., is a 
search and rescue vessel that participated in the recovery efforts 
after TWA Flight 800 broke apart and fell into the Atlantic near 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had a P-3 airplane in the air. The P-3 is a  
long-range reconnaissance plane that specializes in seeking out 
submarines along the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said that the administration was ``doing  
everything in our power to help find the cause of today's crash and 
learn whatever we can to prevent any such tragedies from occurring 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said ``there is reason to believe that a  
large number of Americans citizens were on board.'' A senior 
administration official said the majority of passengers were likely 
American.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Defensive End Thomas Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis defensive end Mark Thomas was  
listed in fair condition and was being kept overnight for 
observation, a nursing supervisor at Methodist Hospital said Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Nimereala said she could release no other information.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was removed from the field on a stretcher and taken by  
ambulance to the hospital with 2:30 to play after getting hit in 
the head late in Sunday's game against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is not considered life threatening, club president  
Bill Polian said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're telling us concussion,'' Polian said. ``The doctors  
weren't overly concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was injured when he was blocked in the Dallas backfield.  
He lay motionless on the turf of the RCA Dome for about 10 minutes 
while receiving medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talking, he's awake,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``They  
don't think it's a neck or spine injury. There's no paralysis. 
Mainly, he just got knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin, who has missed the last  
three games with a spine injury, was on his knees praying during 
the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said a prayer in the locker room after the game,'' Colts  
quarterback Peyton Manning said. ``Hopefully, Mark will be all 
right.''

	Investigators Probe EgyptAir Crash  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators tried on Sunday to determine if  
a sudden mechanical failure or possibly terrorism caused an 
EgyptAir jetliner to plunge rapidly -- nearly 300 feet per second -- 
from six miles high and crash into the Atlantic Ocean. The National 
Transportation Safety Board and the FBI worked side-by-side with 
help from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Boeing Co., 
which made the 767 that crashed off Nantucket, Mass., with 217 
aboard. Radar tapes show that the plane plummeted from an altitude 
of 33,000 feet down to 19,100 feet in 36 seconds.

	Two Doomed Boeing Planes Off Same Line  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The EgyptAir 767 that plummeted six miles Sunday  
to crash off the coast of Nantucket Island came off Boeing Co.'s 
assembly line immediately before a Lauda Air 767 that crashed eight 
years ago in a Thailand jungle. Both planes were completed just 
days before Boeing's aircraft assemblers went on strike, 
complaining of being over tired because they were forced to work 
too much overtime. A Boeing spokesman said the company knew of 
nothing to indicate the two crashes were related.

<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- A socialist won the presidential  
election in Uruguay on Sunday, but failed to gain enough votes to 
avoid a runoff, official results showed. Tabare Vazquez of the 
leftist Broad Front captured 37.3 percent of the ballot to 31.7 
percent for Jorge Batlle of the ruling Colorado Party, authorities 
said. Former president Luis Lacalle, of the center-right National 
Party, placed third with 31.78 percent, the Interior Ministry said, 
with 2.08 million of the nearly 2.4 million votes counted. A 
candidate must win more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a 
runoff.

gunmen who burst into parliament. About 15,000 mourners filled the 
square outside the national opera, where the bodies of Sarkisian,

hired feminist author Naomi Wolf to help attract younger voters, 
especially women. Wolf's books espouse some controversial views. In 
her latest, ``Promiscuities,'' she argued that schools should teach 
such things as masturbation because it is more realistic than 
abstinence and safer than sexual intercourse. Gore was asked on 
ABC's ``This Week'' about a Time magazine report that Wolf is 
deeply involved in his campaign. ``She's a valued adviser, and 
she'll remain one,'' Gore said.

program that would hire 100,000 new teachers nationwide. ``Now, 
suddenly, the Republican majority has changed its mind,'' he said. 
The president was referring to an education spending bill before 
Congress that does not carry forward the plan to hire new teachers.

<HEADLINE> Animals Die in N.J. Aquarium Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- When the Ocean City Aquarium caught  
fire, firefighters feared its dozens of snakes, sharks and 
alligators were dead -- until an 18-foot python slithered up through 
the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then two large alligators appeared, and a few turtles.  
</P>
<P>
	And the firefighters' attention shifted to what creatures were  
still alive and lurking in the next puddle as they stomped through 
the aquarium's charred ruins in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be hard to explain how one of your men got bit by a  
caiman while he was fighting a fire,'' Fire Capt. Bill McDonnell 
said early Sunday as he helped direct cautious firefighters into 
the building after the flames had been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	The smoke and flames killed more than 60 reptiles and 100 fish  
and sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors: 20 turtles, 12 alligators and crocodiles,  
three boa constrictors, two pythons and a moray eel, aquarium owner 
Angelo Cuculino said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire early Saturday evening destroyed the 1 1/2-story pink  
stucco building that houses the 4-year-old aquarium and about 
40,000 visitors a year. A neighbor reported hearing two explosions, 
and by the time firefighters arrived, the aquarium was engulfed in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first on the scene spotted was an 18-foot African  
rock python. Cuculino grabbed it behind the head and stuff it into 
a Styrofoam box. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, June, carried a red-eared slider turtle to safety, and  
firefighter Ed Kooker rescued four caimans and stuffed them into 
wire cages. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the big alligators.  
</P>
<P>
	Kooker struggled out of the charred building with a 5-footer as  
his fellow firefighters rushed in with duct tape to fasten the 
animal snout shut. The only place to keep the four alligators was 
to leave them writhing in the back seat of Mrs. Cuculino's 1988 
Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the four are living in Cuculino's bathroom.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday morning, a 10-foot Burmese python turned up -- coiled in a  
corner window of the aquarium gift shop, still alive. A 4-foot 
anaconda found Cuculino, biting him on the thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bite, Cuculino and none of the firefighters was  
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was still under investigation, said Deputy  
Chief Mark McCulley. It happened on Mischief Night, the night 
before Halloween, when vandals and arsonists have been known to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuculino said the building was total loss, but he hoped to  
rebuild.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs 34, Chargers 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Before the game even started, the San  
Diego Chargers got penalized for delay of game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Safety Reggie Tongue's 7-yard fumble return for a touchdown  
helped stake Kansas City to a 20-0 halftime lead en route to a 34-0 
victory Sunday in a one-sided showdown for first place in the AFC 
West. It was the Chargers' first shutout loss in the regular season 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City had minus-9 yards and a fumble 7:10 into the first  
quarter, but the Chiefs (5-2) held a 10-0 lead thanks to Erik 
Kramer's fumble and eighth interception in six quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (4-3) had only one first down and 28 net yards in the  
first half, which started on an embarrassing note for the Chargers 
and ended on a near-disaster. They were assessed a delay-of-game 
penalty when they failed to get the kickoff away within 25 seconds 
of the referee's blowing his whistle signaling the game was ready 
to start. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final seconds of the second quarter, Michael Dumas  
blocked a Kansas City punt near the Chiefs goal line. But the ball 
squirted directly into the arms of Chiefs linebacker Greg Manusky, 
who lumbered 84 yards to the 7 before Chris Penn ran him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who came into the game with eight interceptions and no  
touchdowns in his three previous starts, threw the ball directly to 
Cris Dishman early in the first quarter, leading to Pete 
Stoyanovich's 43-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, Tongue caught Kramer on a blitz, knocked  
the ball out of his hands, scooped it up and dashed 7 yards into 
the end zone. Jim Harbaugh, for the second week in a row, then 
replaced Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Grbac, who threw four interceptions on Oct. 3 when the  
Chargers beat the Chiefs 21-14 in San Diego, was 11-for-15 for 194 
yards. He threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Joe Horn in the second 
quarter and connected with Derrick Alexander on an 81-yard 
touchdown play in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who had an 86-yard touchdown catch in the season  
opener at Chicago, was about 15 yards behind backup cornerback 
Jimmy Spencer when he caught the pass on the 45. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, James Hasty batted down Harbaugh's pass,  
and Derrick Thomas made the first interception of his 11-year 
career, returning the ball 20 yards and setting up a 7-yard 
touchdown run by Donnell Bennett that made it 34-0 with 2:58 left 
in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoyanovich hit a 39-yarder early in the second quarter for a  
13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, clobbered 31-3 by Green Bay last week, had six  
false start penalties. They were within inches of averting the 
shutout with a fourth-and-goal in the fourth, but Harbaugh fumbled 
the snap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs were without starting wide receiver and backup tight  
end Lonnie Johnson, who were made inactive following their arrests 
Friday night in separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison was arrested for disturbing the peace after a fight in a  
restaurant parking lot, and Johnson was arrested after police 
contended he grabbed the breast of an undercover officer working a 
prostitution decoy operation.

<HEADLINE> How New York Prepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the bottled water. Dump the cases of  
canned soup. Save the year's supply of batteries for Junior's 
Gameboy. When it comes to the Y2K computer glitch, New York's 
techno-types say the Big Apple bit first. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been working since 1995 to replace microchips,  
hardware and software, and rewrite computer coding that otherwise 
would have thrown New York into chaos when the clock struck a 
second past midnight Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Programmers reviewed 65 million lines of computer code written  
in 65 different programming languages. The city replaced more than 
10,000 computers and bought 50,000 new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, there were 677 ``high-priority'' systems to  
evaluate. Those were the ones left after Deputy Mayor Joseph J. 
Lhota deleted psuedo-important items some agency heads had listed 
as critical, like their scheduling software. (Get a calendar, Lhota 
told them.) 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a troublesome comptroller's audit which showed a number  
of city agencies behind schedule, those working on the bug say 
they've beat it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the best city in the country, actually I figure in the  
world, in terms of dealing with any sort of crisis,'' said Brian 
Cohen, executive director of the city's $315 million Y2K project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If having an extra $50 over the weekend makes you feel more  
comfortable, then you should do that,'' he said of New Year's Eve, 
1999. ``But your money is safer in the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city itself is printing an extra batch of paychecks. More  
police will be on duty, and emergency shelters will be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing it all will be a staff huddled in a new $13 million  
emergency crisis center. Built to withstand hurricane-force winds, 
bombs and power failures, it contains food and water for the 100 
people who are supposed to know how to fix anything that goes 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K could be their greatest test. The problem dates back to the  
early days of computing, when programmers squeezed every bit of 
memory from their machines by using the last two digits to stand 
for a year. So 1987 became ``87,'' and the Year 2000 was 
represented by ``00.'' The shorthand creates problems if a computer 
mistakes ``00'' for 1900 when adding or subtracting a date. 
</P>
<P>
	If left uncorrected in New York, the glitch could have meant:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 30,000 calls a day to the 911 emergency network transferred to  
the wrong local police or fire station. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Traffic lights stuck on their midnight cycles, creating  
massive gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A jam-packed Times Square plunged into darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Newer elevators shut down, mistakenly calculating that they  
hadn't been serviced in 100 years. (Older ones would be fine. They 
lack the microchips regulating more modern lifts.) 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's office, the utilities, the Federal Aviation  
Administration, all agree such problems won't happen. Their 
computer programmers say they have burrowed into every 
technological crack to fix the so-called Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from an office littered with Y2K paraphernalia --  
including a battery-powered hat with a digital clock ticking down 
to Jan. 1 -- Cohen has directed an army of city employees, 
consultants, electrical and communications workers in updating 
old-fashioned computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thing about Y2K is, no one will know for sure how bad it  
is until it gets here. And so the city is preparing for the 
equivalent of a three-day storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy New York Police Commissioner Richard Sheirer, the NYPD's  
Y2K guy, says the technical aspects of the problem are under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 911 emergency response system, to the robots that  
disarm bombs, to computer-controlled fingerprinting devices, the 
department has tested each computer-driven component it uses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the police department's effort is just beginning. The big  
job comes New Year's Eve, when the department has to oversee the 
party of the millennium. It doesn't want a blackout to match. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern over the possibilities have driven some New Yorkers to  
... do nothing unusual. While some Midwesterners are stocking up on 
ammunition and The Denver Post has published a Y2K recipe section 
advising how to make the most of canned beans, Manhattan stores 
haven't even ordered extra bottled water. And no one seems to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Yorkers are used to hiding things and ignoring things and  
turning away from things,'' says Patrick Shannon, a city resident 
who spends 10 hours a day collecting news for a Y2K Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does take a certain kind of blind spot to live in a city  
this big, with the diversity and adversity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is one prevalent worry: electricity.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the questions at a recent Y2K ``community conversation''  
in Manhattan were about power. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if there's no heat? City schools will open,  
heated by their old coal-fired furnaces or by back-up generators. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What happens if a widespread blackout triggers rioting? Police  
have canceled many vacations around the first of the year. About 
35,000 cops will be on duty the last few days of 1999 and the first 
week of January 2000, roughly 3,000 more than ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' explains  
Sheirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hedlund, director of technology services for Consolidated  
Edison, said the 3 million households and businesses served by the 
utility in New York and suburban Westchester County should have no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed's 10 generating stations have been inspected and found  
Y2K ready. They don't even use dates in manufacturing power. 
Hundreds of employees have looked over power lines, transformers 
and substations. They have also checked an estimated 5 million 
lines of computer coding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really think that a New Year's Eve is going to be a  
nonevent as far as electricity goes,'' Hedlund said. 
</P>
<P>
	As in every Y2K conversation, however, there are doubting  
Thomases. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the city comptroller's office found the fire  
department and Department of Corrections unprepared for Y2K, 
although Cohen says follow-up inspections gave both better grades. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's physical preparation is only half the Y2K challenge.  
The rest is psychological. Despite New York's overall nonchalance, 
some people are worried. And worried people can become panicked if 
the power goes out or something else goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Square will likely be the site of the world's largest  
millennial celebration, attracting perhaps 1.5 million people. 
Known for the icy temperatures and hard-partying crowd that usually 
accompany the festivities, it's hard to imagine a worse place to be 
if the lights went out, traffic jammed, the trains stopped running 
and everybody flipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is relying heavily on advanced public relations. City  
officials are already popping up at neighborhood events, and a 
brochure assures readers that technicians have updated the 911 
emergency call system. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the vague wording leaves room for interpretation, group  
psychologists say the city is on to something. 
</P>
<P>
	Generalities like ``Hospitals have been working hard to address  
areas in the medical industry ... '' and ``utility companies ... 
have assured us that power, gas, steam and telephone service will 
continue'' may sound simplistic, but they can ease fear of a 
far-reaching computer problem people don't quite understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis C. Danes, of the Society for the Advancement of Social  
Psychology, said the brochure lets people know government has an 
eye on things and helps by telling where to go for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, plans won't be worth the paper they're printed on if a  
blackout in Times Square sends the crowd spiralling into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the people start to panic, the police have to react,''  
Danes said. ``The best thing to do would be to make sure that the 
lights don't go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The following steps are recommended to prepare for Jan. 1, 2000,  
the date a computer problem known as Y2K could cause various 
service interruptions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep a three-day supply of nonperishable food, baby-food,  
diapers, water, and batteries for a radio. Also make sure there is 
a non-electric can opener and a flashlight in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buy a first-aid kit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- If you wish to have extra cash on hand, don't wait until Dec.  
31 to take it out. Be discreet about the money you have. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep copies of all financial records for the last three months  
of 1999 and the first three months after the new year; ask your 
financial institutions about their Y2K compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Top off home heating fuel tanks before Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make sure you have extra blankets to keep warm in case the  
heat goes off. Allow faucets to run slightly to prevent pipes from 
freezing. Know where you can go for shelter, such as a nearby 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Develop a plan to keep in touch with family members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Do not use gas-fueled, wood-burning, or liquid-fueled heating  
devices or generators unless they are approved for indoor use. Read 
the manuals and operate only in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions.

<HEADLINE> Southern Farm Players Eye Money List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- As rain pelted the tent above them, P.H.  
Horgan III and Sean Murphy studied the PGA Tour money list, 
scribbling down figures and trying to determine their futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many others at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic, the  
last official money event of the year aside from next week's World 
Golf Championships, Horgan and Murphy are on the bubble trying to 
retain their playing privileges on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disconcerting for me right now because I want an  
opportunity to try to improve my position, and it looks like I 
might not be able to,'' said Horgan, who is 139th on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	With the course already soaked by about two inches of rain, and  
more rain falling Sunday, the final round of the already shortened 
Southern Farm Bureau Classic was suspended and pushed to Monday. 
There was a chance for even more rain Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament started with 52 players ranked between 115 and  
180 on the money list. Only 33 of them remain, meaning there will 
be changes that will affect some players' status for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	By making the cut at Annandale Golf Club, Horgan is certain to  
make the top 150, by which he would advance directly to the final 
stage of PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament and retain limited playing 
privileges this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A solid showing at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic, however,  
could push him into the top 132 and make him fully exempt, based on 
a soft 125 that doesn't take into account non-PGA Tour members on 
the list. He had finished half of his third round before the 
suspension and was 1 over, 12 strokes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had visions of a top 10 finish this week and not having to  
go to tour school. I'm exempt into the finals for being in the to 
150, so there's some consolation there,'' Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to lose, I have everything to gain by playing  
nine more holes. I get hot and shot 5 or 6 under and I have a 
chance. I probably need a top 15 finish to get into the top 125.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 159 on the money list, Murphy is likely in the last spot to  
at least keep his limited privileges on the PGA Tour. During the 
rain delay, he determined that he can't finish any lower, but could 
go higher with a solid showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing to avoid is the second stage of qualifying at  
all costs,'' said Murphy, who was 2 under, nine strokes off the 
lead. . ``Looking at it, I'm in a no-lose situation. I want to 
play, all I can do is better myself. I didn't know that until the 
rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``A top three finish, and maybe I keep my tour card,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was headed for the first tee Sunday when play was  
suspended. He will be the first off that tee when play resumes 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Animal Rights Group Accuses Charles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A royal hunting trip over the weekend is raising  
the dander of a British animal rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	The League Against Cruel Sports is accusing Prince Charles of  
using his teen-age son and heir to the throne, Prince William, to 
``make a political statement'' against a possible ban on hunting by 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government. 
</P>
<P>
	William, 17, joined some 200 riders in pursuit of a fox Saturday  
at the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt, near Charles' country estate west 
of London. His brother, Prince Harry, 15, followed the proceedings 
as a passenger on a motorbike. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Charles) is clearly trying to intimidate members of  
Parliament into shelving a ban because he enjoys fox hunting,'' 
said league chairman John Hooper. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, some 20,000 people demonstrated in the southwest  
England city of Exeter against a hunting ban, and generally 
protesting economic problems in rural areas.

	197 Passengers Aboard Missing Jet  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 plane with 197 passengers aboard has  
disappeared over the ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket after 
taking off from New York's Kennedy International Airport, officials 
say today. EgyptAir Flight 990 was headed to Cairo, Egypt, Coast 
Guard Lt. Rob Halsey said. It originated in Los Angeles, according 
to EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport. There were 
197 passengers on the flight, an EgyptAir official said. ``What we 
have right now is, we weren't able to establish contact,'' Halsey 
said. ``They had them on radar and then lost the radar picture.'' 
Flight 990 took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared from 
radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot Brenner, 
chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in 
Washington.

	FBI: Threat of Y2K Extremists Real

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of violence by extremists to mark  
the new millennium is ``very real,'' an FBI report being prepared 
reports. The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it 
was preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share 
it with police chiefs at their upcoming convention, the Washington 
Post is reporting in today's editions. The agency said the document 
analyzes ``the potential for extremist criminal activity in the 
United States by individuals or domestic groups who attach special 
significance to the year 2000.''

	Hundreds Feared Dead in Indian Cyclone

	BALESHWAR, India (AP) -- A cyclone battered a broad swath of  
eastern India for a second day yesterday, knocking out power and 
telephone lines and flattening thousands of homes. Hundreds may 
have died, said officials in Orissa state, which bore the brunt of 
the storm. While the storm was weakening as it moved inland, it 
wasn't possible to assess the death toll and property damage 
because the area was still inaccessible and cut off from 
communication. ``We are treating it as a national calamity,'' Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in John McCain's home state  
is questioning whether the Republican senator has the temperament 
to be president. The Arizona Republic, in an editorial running in 
today's editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it 
says he has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the 
public. ``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the 
presidency, it is time the rest of the nation learned about the 
John McCain we know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says in the 
editorial, a copy of which was provided to The Associated Press 
yesterday.

building crowded with weekend diners and drinkers in this South

rail, a gray Indonesian troop-transport ship set sail Sunday from 
the darkened, nearly deserted harbor of East Timor's capital, 
ending a 24-year military occupation of this former Portuguese 
colony that left tens of thousands of people dead. The Indonesians' 
departure marked the end of a long and fruitless struggle by the 
world's most populous Muslim nation to subdue a small, stubbornly 
separatist Roman Catholic province on its eastern fringe. It was an 
ignominious comedown for a military force that once numbered more 
than 40,000 and whose word was once law in a province now on the 
road to independence.

Cubs, taking over an injury-plagued team that went from the 
playoffs to last place. Baylor, the hitting coach of the Atlanta 
Braves last season after six years as manager of the Colorado 
Rockies, had been courted by several major league teams, including 
the Anaheim Angels and Milwaukee Brewers. While there was no 
announcement by the Cubs, his hiring was confirmed to The

<HEADLINE> Charitable Donations Jump 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donors gave 16 percent more in contributions  
to the nation's most popular charities last year than in 1997, a 
survey of the top 400 charities shows. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest increase since The Chronicle of Philanthropy,  
the weekly ``Newspaper of the Nonprofit World,'' began compiling 
contribution statistics in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	For a seventh consecutive year, the Salvation Army was the  
favored organization as it raised $1.2 billion in cash and donated 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The YMCA of the USA and the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift  
Fund saw donations increase by more than 25 percent and took second 
and third on the list with $629.3 million and $571.9 million 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an increase in giving, there is also an  
increase in need'' as families move from welfare to work, often in 
low-paying jobs, Salvation Army spokeswoman Theresa Whitfield said. 
``We are grateful for the public's generosity. ... As long as the 
economy is doing well, people will have more to give.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Whitfield did, most organizations attributed the generosity  
boom to the booming economy, which made 1998 one of the best 
fund-raising years in a quarter-century for many groups. 
Grant-making foundations thriving with a strong stock market also 
helped fuel the largess. 
</P>
<P>
	Online donations, an increasingly popular approach to fund  
raising, also helped boost many organizations' take. The 
fifth-ranking American Red Cross, for instance, has a spot on its 
World Wide Web site to ``Donate Now.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Moore Killed in Marlboro 500 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Moore was killed Sunday in the  
season-ending CART race when he lost control of his car at 220 mph 
and crashed into a wall, spinning wildly and slamming into the 
ground several times. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Canadian, a young star in the open-wheel  
circuit, was airlifted to a hospital and declared dead of massive 
head injuries about an hour after the wreck at California Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost missed the race after he hurt his hand when a car hit  
him Saturday while he was riding a scooter to the paddock area. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was the second driver in the CART FedEx Series to die this  
year. Rookie Gonzalo Rodriguez of Uruguay, preparing for only his 
second race, was killed in a crash Sept. 11 during practice at 
Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Rodriguez was the first driver fatality in the  
CART series since Jeff Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a race 
in Toronto in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 10th lap of the Marlboro 500, Moore lost control of his  
car coming off turn two. The Reynard-Mercedes skidded onto the 
infield grass, crashed hard into a retaining wall and broke into 
pieces, with the open-cockpit driver's compartment spinning and 
hitting the ground several times before coming to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	He was declared dead at Loma Linda Medical Center, said Dr.  
Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART. 
</P>
<P>
	The race continued, but CART chief steward Wally Dallenbach  
canceled post-race celebrations and the flags at the speedway were 
lowered to half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Moore broke a finger, badly cut his right hand and  
bruised his right hip when his scooter was hit by a car in the 
paddock area. He was cleared to drive after a six-lap test on the 
two-mile oval late Saturday, starting the 250-lap race last in the 
27-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 72nd start in Moore's CART FedEx Series career. He  
had five victories, including the season-opening race in Homestead, 
Fla., this season, and was the runner-up in last year's Marlboro 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who drove for Player's Forsythe Racing for all four  
seasons in CART, was to move to Team Penske next year.

<HEADLINE> Injury Bug Keeps Biting Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a season gone sour, injuries continue to mount  
like numbers in the loss column for the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	No fewer than seven Broncos limped, staggered or had to be  
assisted to the sideline with injuries in Sunday's 23-20 loss to 
the Minnesota Vikings, which dropped Denver to 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Alfred Williams and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey  
were the most seriously wounded. Williams ruptured his right 
Achilles' tendon, a season- and possibly career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, who left the game in the first quarter after being  
hit in the head but returned in the second half, sprained his left 
knee in the fourth quarter. He was scheduled Monday for an MRI that 
a team official called precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Running backs Olandis Gary and Derek Loville, cornerbacks Ray  
Crockett and Dale Carter and linebacker Al Wilson also were 
sidelined for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Those injuries add to a lengthy casualty list that already  
includes Terrell Davis, last year's NFL MVP who is out for the 
season with a torn knee injury; linebacker John Mobley, out for the 
year with a similar injury, and tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is 
expected to miss about eight games before returning in December 
from a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the backups haven't been immune. Bubby Brister was supposed  
to replace Brian Griese at quarterback after the latter foundered 
in the first four games, but Brister promptly strained an oblique 
muscle and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Loville was slated to replace Davis but came down with a  
strained hamstring, the same injury he aggravated on a 36-yard 
touchdown run in the first quarter on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alfred tore his Achilles' tendon, and he'll be out for the  
rest of the season,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Eddie has 
a sore knee. We're hopeful that it's no worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start making plays, and we have to use the  
personnel that are available to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the rash of injuries and bad breaks is perhaps payback  
for the good fortune the team enjoyed in its two Super Bowl 
championship seasons, Shanahan said, ``I never believed that in the 
past, but I'm starting to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crockett, limping from a hip pointer in the locker room, said,  
``The injuries keep coming. I guess it's just one of those years. 
Usually, in a normal season you have only one guy go down for the 
year. This year, we've had three or four guys. With all the good 
things that have happened to us the last two or three years, these 
are things you don't hope for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray we can keep a group of guys healthy and keep  
going.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tycoon Faces Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- He was billed by the media as the richest man in  
China, busy building an empire of private investments and funding 
everything from soccer clubs to a North Pole expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his empire reportedly a pile of debts, Mou Qizhong is  
scheduled to stand trial Monday for fraud in a case that closes out 
a decade in which Mou's brash style and his mysterious rise and 
fall typified the frenetic changes of China's reform era. 
</P>
<P>
	For some in China, Mou's case is a cautionary tale about the  
difficulties private businesses face in a socialist system. Others 
say it illustrates how weak accounting rules make it possible for a 
person with grand schemes to pile up loans without making money. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the case against Mou and four former employees of  
his Land Group is a $75 million loan allegedly obtained by fraud 
from a state bank in 1995. A company lawyer, Yao Bin, refused to 
say how Mou would plead before the Intermediate People's Court in 
the central city of Wuhan. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of Mou's accountants insists no fraud was committed.  
</P>
<P>
	Unqualified for a business loan under Chinese rules because Land  
Group was a private company, Mou turned to a state firm, Hubei 
Light Industrial Import and Export, for a letter of credit, said 
the accountant, Zheng Pingchuan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubei Light turned $22 million of the loan over to Land Group,  
and Mou used the money to invest in a satellite deal that failed, 
leaving him unable to repay the loan, Zheng said. He said he did 
not know what became of the rest of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Zheng said, Land Group was beset by financial problems,  
and its debts now total $48 million. Police took Mou into custody 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Land Group was hardly alone in its problems getting a loan.  
China's legislature passed a bill last year aimed at easing some of 
the discrimination private Chinese businesses have faced. The 
measure declared that private industry is an important part of 
China's socialist economy. 
</P>
<P>
	That a loan could prove Mou's undoing underscores his risky  
style of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou burst into China's public consciousness with a widely  
publicized deal in 1989 to swap 500 freight cars of factory-surplus 
socks, shoes and other goods for four Tu-154 Soviet passenger 
planes, netting $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou played himself up as the richest man in China in order to  
get more loans, a former consultant to his company said. The 
Chinese media soon bought into the image. His Land Group became a 
vehicle for self-promotion, its English-language newsletter 
trumpeting his deal-making prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	One 1997 article -- ``A private entrepreneur's struggle in  
China'' -- claimed Mou used $36 borrowed from friends and relatives 
in 1980 to set up communist China's first private enterprise, alarm 
clock marketer Jiangbei Trade and Trust Service, in his home of 
Wanxian County. 
</P>
<P>
	The article praised Mou as a ``social activist'' who sponsored a  
soccer club, a music festival at a university and other civic 
events. He contributed $360,000 to support China's first research 
expedition to the North Pole, in 1995, and gave $120,000 in 1996 
for space exploration, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou also had big plans to develop a port in China's far north at  
Manzhouli to exploit the resources of neighboring Siberia. He also 
set his sights on buying overseas commercial banks, all for the 
sake of large-scale investment in China's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou has faced charges twice before. During the chaos of the  
1966-76 Cultural Revolution he was jailed for criticizing the 
radical leadership that had destroyed what was left by then of 
private business. He was sentenced to death, but regained his 
freedom in the late 1970s. Jailed again in 1983 for 
``speculating,'' Mou was released a year later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Sign of Plane Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By KEVIN GALVIN    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Departing for Mideast peace talks in Europe,  
President Clinton said there was no early indication of foul play 
in Sunday's EgyptAir crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know what caused this tragedy, but we will devote  
every necessary resource so that we can understand exactly what 
happened,'' the president said on the South Lawn of the White 
House. ``At this moment, the thoughts and prayers of all of our 
people should be with the families of the passengers and crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was informed of the crash by his national security  
adviser, Sandy Berger, just hours before he was leaving for Oslo, 
Norway. He is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who are seeking a permanent peace 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders were gathering in Oslo to remember slain Israeli  
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom Clinton called ``one of the 
great heroes of this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will honor him by not only remembering his life but by  
pursuing his vision of a peaceful Middle East,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reinforced earlier statements that there was no  
obvious signs of sabotage involved in the EgyptAir tragedy when he 
said he did not believe the crash would overshadow his mission in 
Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I now know,'' he said, ``I have no reason to  
believe that there is any element involved in this that would 
overshadow ... the work of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was not  
attending the talks, to express his condolences and assure Mubarak 
that every effort was being made for a thorough search and recovery 
effort, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were not ruling out any possibilities  
until investigators could analyze radar data, the debris field, the 
flight recorders and information about people who had contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are any number of things that will provide us more  
factual information rather than guesses,'' said Jim Fallin, 
spokesman for the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the area where  
debris was found of the coast of Nantucket island, administration 
officials said. The Grapple, based at Little Creek, Va., is a 
search and rescue vessel that participated in the recovery efforts 
after TWA Flight 800 broke apart and fell into the Atlantic near 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had a P-3 airplane in the air. The P-3 is a  
long-range reconnaissance plane that specializes in seeking out 
submarines along the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said that the administration was ``doing  
everything in our power to help find the cause of today's crash and 
learn whatever we can to prevent any such tragedies from occurring 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said ``there is reason to believe that a  
large number of Americans citizens were on board.'' A senior 
administration official said the majority of passengers were likely 
American.

<HEADLINE> President Trump Would Handle Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump says anybody who can compete in  
the New York real estate market as he does certainly can handle 
Japan and other countries that do business with America. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, Trump said Sunday, if he should win the presidency  
he would appoint himself U.S. Trade Representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``My lawyers have checked, and the president has the  
authority,'' the multimillionaire developer said in a statement 
released by his presidential exploratory committee. ``Our trading 
partners would have to negotiate across the table from Donald 
Trump, and I guarantee you, the rip-off of the United States would 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement followed an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday'' by  
Trump, who is considering a run for the Reform Party's presidential 
nomination, in which he attacked the trade policies of a number of 
U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his observations:  
</P>
<P>
	--France is ``a terrible partner, ... and I think they have to be  
taught respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Japan is ``ripping us big league'' by maintaining a huge trade  
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	--Germany ``wants to take over the world economically. They  
failed militarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Saudi Arabians ``take such advantage of us with the oil. ...  
They have boats bigger than any boats you've ever seen. They have 
houses all over the world. ... This is getting a little ridiculous. 
I mean, the money they make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump also took aim at North Korea and China for ignoring U.S.  
overtures and building nuclear weapons. He said Cuba's Fidel Castro 
was ``absolutely a killer and should be treated as such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He placed a large share of the blame on U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, deriding her as somebody 
``nobody ever heard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures announced two weeks ago showed the nation's trade  
deficit running at a record annual rate of $252 billion through 
August. The deficit with Japan, a record in July, narrowed slightly 
to $6.4 billion in August but still was running 13 percent higher 
than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said clues to the administration's trade policy can be  
found in President Clinton's personal business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do a deal a minute, and the one deal he did was Whitewater.  
That turned out to be, you know, unfortunate,'' Trump said. Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary, invested in the failed Arkansas land 
development that led to a protracted independent investigation and, 
ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Clintons' latest deal, a $1.7 million house in New  
York's Westchester County, showed the president's lack of business 
acumen, Trump said. If Trump -- who described himself as ``by far 
the biggest developer in Manhattan'' -- had done the deal, he said, 
he could have saved the Clintons at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the house. My people know the house,'' Trump said.  
``They came up to me, they said, 'Why did he pay so much?' I said, 
'I don't know.' So why do we give everything away to Japan?''

<HEADLINE> FAA Got Plane Bomb Alert Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A month ago, the Federal Aviation  
Administration issued an alert to airline and airport security 
personnel after agencies received an unconfirmed warning that a 
bomb would ``soon be used'' on a flight departing from Los Angeles 
or Kennedy airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they had no reason to believe the disappearance  
of an EgyptAir flight on Sunday was caused by sabotage. 
Investigators were attempting to determine the fate of Flight 990 
after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport. The flight 
originated Saturday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Many aviation warnings are investigated each month by federal  
agencies and the Sept. 24 alert said: ``At this time, FAA has no 
information to corroborate the statements in the letter and assess 
them as lacking credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the alert, David Leavy, spokesman for National  
Security Council, told The Associated Press, ``I don't want to 
speculate on this until we have information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official said at midmorning Sunday that  
agencies were pursuing the possibility of sabotage, but, ``There's 
nothing to immediately point toward that.'' Another official said 
there had been no recent threat that seemed relevant to the 
EgyptAir disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	A third official said there had been no immediate credit claims  
made to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said law enforcement agencies are reviewing past  
tips and phone traffic to see if there was a lead that was passed 
over before and might be relevant after the plane disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to sit around a week and then find out this was  
a crime and start investigating,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular,'' a copy of which was  
obtained by the AP, the FAA said several U.S. agencies received a 
warning by letter in August ``that a bomb or explosive device with 
`spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight departing from 
either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The circular said the informant ``identified himself as Luciano  
Porcari,'' and noted that ``an individual with this same name 
hijacked an Iberian Boeing 727 during a flight from Barcelona to 
Palma de Mallorca, Spain, on March 14, 1977,'' before being 
overpowered and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert said the writer said ``three of these devices were  
smuggled into the United States between 1992 and 1993, and that the 
devices cannot be detected on a metal detector because of the PVC 
(plastic) composition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert was in effect until Oct. 30. EgyptAir Flight 990  
departed Los Angeles on Saturday, Oct. 30, and stopped at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, bound for Cairo. The plane took off 
from JFK at 1:19 a.m. Sunday en route to Cairo and disappeared from 
radar screens about 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information of any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FAA offered no comment on its alert.  
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA often sends out information on threats to ensure that  
airlines can properly implement security measures,'' agency 
spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do want to assure the public that the FAA works with law  
enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States and 
other countries and we closely evaluate all threats and take 
appropriate security measures as warranted,'' Trexler added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA circular said a Luciano Porcari was sentenced to 10  
years in prison on Jan. 25, 1979, but later escaped. In August 
1981, he threatened to hijack another aircraft unless he was paid 
$250,000. He was subsequently arrested in Italy and sentenced to 
nine years in prison on Jan. 27, 1982. The circular said he was 
released on Aug. 12, 1982, and his whereabouts were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	In the warning received by letter ``to several U.S. government  
agencies,'' the informant ``claimed that between 1975 and 1983 
eight of the devices were manufactured, that only three remained 
and that one was in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had warned various U.S. authorities about the  
device before the July 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long 
Island and the September 1998 crash of Swissair Flight 111 off 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane had taken off from Kennedy airport en route to  
Paris, while the Swissair plane had taken off from Kennedy en route 
to Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	After an extensive investigation, authorities ruled out a  
criminal act in the TWA crash. They now believe there was an 
explosion for an undetermined reason in the plane's center fuel 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the pilots reported  
smoke in the cockpit. Authorities have not determined a cause but 
are focusing on the airplane's wiring and insulation material.

	The Packers dismantled San Diego 31-3 last Sunday in their best  
performance of the year, while the Seahawks also looked sharp in 
beating Buffalo 26-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike and I don't put on the pads and go out there,'' Packers  
coach Ray Rhodes said. ``The only people who are going to decide 
this game are on the field. I don't know why everybody talks about 
Mike and myself as if we're going to decide things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay and Seattle run essentially the same offense, though  
Packers offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis is much more of a 
risk-taker than Holmgren was during his seven years in Green Bay. 
The Packers had the league's top-ranked offense earlier in the 
season, while Seattle is averaging nearly 50 yards per game less 
than Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's offensive troubles haven't been helped by a subpar  
season from Ricky Watters, who is averaging just 3.2 yards per 
carry this season. The Seahawks, who are looking to go 5-2 for the 
first time since 1987, still think they can run against the 
Packers' shaky defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been missing Santana Dotson out there, and of course,  
you can't replace Reggie White,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotson could play on Monday after missing four games with a  
stinger injury, while rookie defensive lineman Cletidus Hunt will 
miss another game with a high ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren failed to take the Packers past the wild-card round of  
the playoffs last season largely because of a terrible defensive 
secondary. GM Ron Wolf drafted three rookie defensive backs that 
have brought the unit back to respectability, but Holmgren said he 
intends to test Mike McKenzie, Antuan Edwards and Fred Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our young guys are tremendous, but there's a toughness you can  
only get from playing in big games,'' Rhodes said. ``They're going 
to be out there on the line on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another return that also should be entertaining. Derrick  
Mayes, the brash wide receiver the Packers dumped on Seattle for a 
low-round draft pick, returns to Lambeau, where he was last seen 
doing the Leap into the crowd during a preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of Joey Galloway, Mayes has become the Seahawks'  
best receiver, with 25 catches for 392 yards and four touchdowns, 
even though he came off the bench in two of the Seahawks' six 
games. His performance will be even more important if Mike 
Pritchard is unable to play because of his sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of skill there that some people here said he  
didn't have,'' Packers safety LeRoy Butler said. ``He always had 
the best hands on the team, and maybe in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes was well-liked by some Packers -- he is one of  
since-retired receiver Robert Brooks' closest friends -- and less 
liked by others, who privately seethed at his tendency toward 
boastful statements and frequent injuries. He wasn't particularly 
close to Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Derrick thinks he's a top receiver in this game,''  
Favre said shortly after the trade. ``I don't know if he is that.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Got Plane Bomb Alert Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A month ago, the Federal Aviation  
Administration issued an alert to airline and airport security 
personnel after agencies received an unconfirmed warning that a 
bomb would ``soon be used'' on a flight departing from Los Angeles 
or Kennedy airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they had no reason to believe the disappearance  
of an EgyptAir flight on Sunday was caused by sabotage. 
Investigators were attempting to determine the fate of Flight 990 
after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport. The flight 
originated Saturday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Many aviation warnings are investigated each month by federal  
agencies and the Sept. 24 alert said: ``At this time, FAA has no 
information to corroborate the statements in the letter and assess 
them as lacking credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the alert, David Leavy, spokesman for National  
Security Council, told The Associated Press, ``I don't want to 
speculate on this until we have information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official said at midmorning Sunday that  
agencies were pursuing the possibility of sabotage, but, ``There's 
nothing to immediately point toward that.'' Another official said 
there had been no recent threat that seemed relevant to the 
EgyptAir disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	A third official said there had been no immediate credit claims  
made to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said law enforcement agencies are reviewing past  
tips and phone traffic to see if there was a lead that was passed 
over before and might be relevant after the plane disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to sit around a week and then find out this was  
a crime and start investigating,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular,'' a copy of which was  
obtained by the AP, the FAA said several U.S. agencies received a 
warning by letter in August ``that a bomb or explosive device with 
`spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight departing from 
either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The circular said the informant ``identified himself as Luciano  
Porcari,'' and noted that ``an individual with this same name 
hijacked an Iberian Boeing 727 during a flight from Barcelona to 
Palma de Mallorca, Spain, on March 14, 1977,'' before being 
overpowered and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert said the writer said ``three of these devices were  
smuggled into the United States between 1992 and 1993, and that the 
devices cannot be detected on a metal detector because of the PVC 
(plastic) composition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert was in effect until Oct. 30. EgyptAir Flight 990  
departed Los Angeles on Saturday, Oct. 30, and stopped at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, bound for Cairo. The plane took off 
from JFK at 1:19 a.m. Sunday en route to Cairo and disappeared from 
radar screens about 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information of any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FAA offered no comment on its alert.  
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA often sends out information on threats to ensure that  
airlines can properly implement security measures,'' agency 
spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do want to assure the public that the FAA works with law  
enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States and 
other countries and we closely evaluate all threats and take 
appropriate security measures as warranted,'' Trexler added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA circular said a Luciano Porcari was sentenced to 10  
years in prison on Jan. 25, 1979, but later escaped. In August 
1981, he threatened to hijack another aircraft unless he was paid 
$250,000. He was subsequently arrested in Italy and sentenced to 
nine years in prison on Jan. 27, 1982. The circular said he was 
released on Aug. 12, 1982, and his whereabouts were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	In the warning received by letter ``to several U.S. government  
agencies,'' the informant ``claimed that between 1975 and 1983 
eight of the devices were manufactured, that only three remained 
and that one was in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had warned various U.S. authorities about the  
device before the July 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long 
Island and the September 1998 crash of Swissair Flight 111 off 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane had taken off from Kennedy airport en route to  
Paris, while the Swissair plane had taken off from Kennedy en route 
to Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	After an extensive investigation, authorities ruled out a  
criminal act in the TWA crash. They now believe there was an 
explosion for an undetermined reason in the plane's center fuel 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the pilots reported  
smoke in the cockpit. Authorities have not determined a cause but 
are focusing on the airplane's wiring and insulation material.

<HEADLINE> GOP Takes Gamble on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are rolling the dice with their  
pledge not to spend Social Security's surpluses for other federal 
programs. The whole world will know if they win -- just days before 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a case of betting the ranch,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford,  
R-S.C., one of the party's most conservative members. ``We put the 
gun to our head, the president put the gun to his head, and we'll 
find out whether we pull the trigger next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Congress may send President Clinton the last of the  
13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2000. The massive measure 
financing education, health and labor programs will be vetoed, and 
the two sides then will resume budget bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever those talks produce, GOP leaders are crowing they  
already have scored a triumph by paying for the bills without 
touching Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	To claim that, they rely on accounting techniques like delaying  
billions of dollars in spending until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also ordered the Congressional Budget Office --  
Congress' official scorekeeper -- to count $18 billion in savings 
that the budget office did not believe were there. Without that 
change, CBO calculated that GOP spending bills are on course to 
spend $17 billion of this year's expected Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are gambling that CBO will be proved wrong. They are  
betting that, as it has for the last three years, the booming 
economy will ride to the rescue by bringing the government tons of 
revenue that budget analysts do not expect. 
</P>
<P>
	The more money that pours in, the bigger the actual federal  
surplus for fiscal 2000 will be, and the smaller the chance that 
federal spending will eat into the Social Security portion of that 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be several interim reports by CBO and the White  
House's budget office over the next few months indicating whether 
Social Security money is on course to be saved or spent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the day of reckoning will come when final official figures  
for the fiscal 2000 surplus are released in late October 2000 -- 
just days before the November elections for control of Congress and 
the White House. Fiscal 2000 ends next Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers show the Social Security surplus was protected,  
Republicans will celebrate and cast themselves as defenders of the 
program. But if the numbers do not cooperate, it is certain that 
Democrats will use the news against the GOP as part of their effort 
to capture congressional control. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Friday he  
believes Republicans have nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	He said CBO's current surplus estimate for 2000 is ``cautious  
and conservative,'' adding, ``I don't think we're anywhere near 
realizing the growth potential of this new, high-tech economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats disagree. They have been citing CBO's numbers to argue  
that Republicans are already breaking their own Social Security 
promise, as President Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, did 
Saturday in chastising Republican leaders for their budget work. 
Democrats say the government may not get in the coming year the 
roughly $20 billion in extra revenue that Republicans may need to 
be safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it,'' said White House budget director Jack Lew.  
``Can I say it's impossible? No. But I don't see any reason to 
expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some economic analysts also wonder how long the string of  
unexpectedly high revenue collections can continue. They cite 
recent actions by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy slightly 
by nudging interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're as likely to get those positive surprises  
as we have been,'' said Jim Glassman, economist for Chase 
Securities Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday that  
Republicans ``have an idea how we can make sure'' that no Social 
Security surpluses are spent. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not reveal it. But a GOP aide said Republicans are  
considering legislation that automatically would trigger spending 
cuts if the Social Security surplus seemed about to be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem unlikely, however, that Clinton would sign such a  
measure and help Republicans ensure that they would honor their 
Social Security pledge.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Just Do More Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Americans would just do more exercise, they  
wouldn't have to worry so much about how much weight they carry, a 
leading researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Being unfit and being fat bring independent risks of dying  
early, so a fat person can reduce some of the risk simply by 
exercising regularly, said Steven N. Blair of The Cooper Institute 
for Aerobics Research, Dallas. In this scenario, weight loss could 
be considered a separate benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a public health problem, data from this report indicate  
that low fitness is perhaps the most important for obese 
individuals,'' Blair said. ``The low-fit men were just as likely to 
die as men who'd had a heart attack, a stroke, or some other form 
of cardiovascular disease,'' Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and his colleagues looked at data on 25,174 men who were  
followed for an average of 10 years. All were given exercise tests 
to determine their fitness. Thirteen percent were obese, 46 percent 
were overweight, and 41 percent had normal weight. About 50 percent 
of the obese men had low fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in a recent issue of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men with low fitness had 2.3 times the risk of dying  
compared with obese men who were not unfit. In contrast, obese men 
who started the study with cardiovascular disease had 2.4 times the 
risk of dying, compared with similar men who started the study 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men who had high cholesterol had a 70 percent greater risk  
of dying than did similar men without high cholesterol. Obese men 
with diabetes or who were current smokers had 50 percent greater 
risks, and obese men with high blood pressure had a 10 percent 
greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I, with my biases, was a little surprised to see that low  
fitness was actually a stronger predictor of mortality than was 
diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or current 
smoking,'' said Blair, a longtime proponent of the health value of 
regular physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	And because low fitness is far more common than, for instance,  
diabetes, physical activity could have an even greater importance 
in saving lives, Blair said. Up to 44 percent of deaths among the 
obese could have been prevented by exercise, compared with 9 
percent of deaths if diabetes had been prevented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Blair, America's preoccupation with the bathroom mirror and  
scale is misplaced. ``For many of us, no amount of dieting or 
exercise will make us have the physique of models and movie 
stars,'' he said. ``It's an unattainable goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing weight can be a good thing, Blair said. But fat people  
can improve their health by exercising, even if they don't become 
thin -- and exercise is an attainable goal, he said. ``Thirty years 
ago, I was short, fat and bald,'' he said. ``Today, I am short, fat 
and bald. But I have run 100,000 kilometers (62,500 miles) in the 
last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's advice to doctors is to check their obese patients'  
exercise habits as scrupulously as they check for signs of high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The article on exercise appeared in a JAMA theme issue that  
focused on obesity. Also in the issue was a report by the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which found that obesity 
had risen from 12 percent of adults in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 
1998. CDC researchers characterized this as an obesity epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report, led by researchers at St Luke's-Roosevelt  
Hospital Center in New York City, estimated deaths attributable to 
obesity at around 280,000 or more a year. Obesity has been linked 
to conditions ranging from heart disease to diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Obesity and lack of exercise can be considered independent risk  
factors for an early death, said researcher David B. Allison of St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. So, although Blair is correct in 
pointing out that exercise is good, losing weight is also good -- 
and doing both may be best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most things in human life, including death, are  
multifactorial,'' Allison said. ``It's quite clear to me that 
obesity is a contributing factor. I also believe, from my reading 
of Steve's other papers, that fitness is a contributing factor. But 
I don't see these as exclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fat people should look for the risk-reduction method that works  
for them, said Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard Medical School, 
who is president of the North American Association for the Study of 
Obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behavior science teaches us that success is what we believe  
in,'' Blackburn said. If a person believes in the value of diet, 
then diet is the method to try -- a person who wants to rely on 
exercise should exercise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a combination of some vigorous exercise and some  
dieting may work best, Blackburn said. ``Just 200 less calories a 
day would be 20 pounds lighter over a year,'' he said. ``Half you 
could cut back (in eating) and the other half you could burn in 
exercise.''

 *Thondaman Saumyamoorthy    	
</P>
<P>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Thondaman Saumyamoorthy, one of Sri  
Lanka's best known moderate Tamil leaders and trade unionists, died 
Saturday of heart failure, a lawmaker of his political party said. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, as the head of the Ceylon Workers Congress, the most  
powerful labor union in Sri Lanka, Saumyamoorthy led 600,000 tea 
and rubber plantation workers on a nine-day strike for higher 
wages. The workers got their raise, and the strike caused export 
losses of $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hailing from a prominent south Indian family that had a tea  
estate in Sri Lanka, Saumyamoorthy was 11 years old when he went to 
study in Sri Lanka, which was then the British colony of Ceylon. 
</P>
<P>
	He left school after five years to devote his time to  
understanding the complex world of tea production, in the process 
growing close to tea workers on his father's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Saumyamoorthy was best known for his successful struggle to have  
Sri Lankan citizenship conferred on thousands of Tamils of Indian

	GRAND HAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- Robert D. Van Kampen, a millionaire  
who owned one of the world's largest private collections of 
biblical manuscripts, died Friday while awaiting a heart 
transplant. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen suffered from a viral condition that resulted in a  
``mummifying'' of his heart, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of Van Kampen mutual funds, he had in recent years  
turned his attention to writing about eschatology, the study of the 
end of the world, and to his collection of biblical manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded Van Kampen Merritt, an investment banking firm that  
he sold in 1984 for about $200 million. Today, Van Kampen Funds has 
more than $79 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen was also a partner in VMS Realty from 1980 to 1992  
and established the Van Kampen Asset Management Company. 
</P>
<P>
	He owned one of the world's largest private collections of  
ancient Bibles and manuscripts, attracting international scholars 
to Grand Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	He began acquiring rare biblical and ancient manuscripts about  
17 years ago, after taking possession of a 1537 English-language 
Bible stained with the blood of its martyred owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection is stored in Van Kampen's Scriptorium, Center for  
Christian Antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
	Its holdings also include papyrus and clay tablets, some of  
which date to 2000 B.C., a 4th Century Coptic Bible from Egypt, the 
book of Daniel from the Gutenberg Bible in 1455, Hebrew Torah 
scrolls and translations by 14th Century reformer John Wycliffe, 
said Bastiaan VanElderen, the Scriptorium's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen also wrote works about the last days before Jesus'  
return. His 1992 book, ``The Sign,'' has sold more than 100,000 
copies. He wrote another book called ``The Rapture Question 
Answered'' and a novel, ``The Fourth Reich.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers 2000 Vote Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is waging ``a very credible  
campaign'' for the Democratic nomination and George W. Bush better 
not write off Sen. John McCain's challenge for the GOP nod, says 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview for the Monday premier of CBS' ``Early Show,''  
Clinton said he would play ``no official'' role in either Vice 
President Al Gore's presidential campaign or Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's bid for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't resist a little political analysis.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked his opinion about Gore's struggles to get his campaign on  
track, Clinton lauded his deputy for moving his headquarters back 
to Tennessee and for his performance in last week's debate with 
Bradley in New Hampshire. He also said it was too early to worry 
about polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley is an intelligent, a compelling man with a good  
life story and a lot of friends built up in professional basketball 
and 18 years in the Senate and all the other things he's done,'' 
said the president. ``And he's running a very credible campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said people want to see Gore ``out there establishing  
his own identity with his own programs for the future.'' If the 
vice president does that ``I think he will be nominated,'' 
continued Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As for George W. Bush, the frontrunner in the Republican  
nominating race, Clinton warned that Bush shouldn't take the GOP 
nomination for granted. ``I don't think Sen. McCain is out of this 
yet. I think he's a very credible alternative,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the first lady, Clinton said he didn't mind that he  
wouldn't be the candidate in the family next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so funny because our roles are almost completely reversed  
now. All the things that she did for me over more than 20 years, 
all the encouragement, reminders, helpful suggestions, 
everything....'' he said. ``And I'm enjoying it. I'm trying to do a 
good job in my new role.''

<HEADLINE> Radar Shows EgyptAir Jet's Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Radar tapes continued to show contact with an  
EgyptAir plane for two minutes after it had begun a dramatic dive 
towards the Atlantic Ocean, the chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The information provided by Jim Hall indicated the plane  
plummeted from its cruise altitude of 33,000 feet down to 19,100 
feet in 36 seconds, and then at least some part of it remained 
visible on radar for a much longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir Boeing 767 with 217 people on board was en route  
from New York to Cairo when it crashed early Sunday about 60 miles 
southeast of Nantucket Island, off the Massachusetts coast. There 
were no immediate signs of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know at this point what caused the crash,'' Hall  
told reporters. ``We are beginning what may be a long 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After taking of from New York's Kennedy International Airport at  
1:19 a.m. EST, Hall said the airplane climbed to its cruising 
altitude. At 1:47 a.m., pilots made what he called a final, 
``routine'' radio communication with New York controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1:50 a.m., according to preliminary radar data, Hall said the  
flight made ``a very rapid descent'' of about 14,000 feet in just 
36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar then continued to pick ``reflections from the metal  
structure'' of the airplane for about 90 more seconds, until 1:52 
a.m. Hall refused to draw any conclusions from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will undoubtedly hear many reports of what might have  
caused the crash ... all of those reports will be speculative,'' 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Egypt has asked the U.S. government to take  
the lead in the crash investigation, Hall said. The NTSB, FBI, 
Federal Aviation Administration, Defense Department and Boeing Co. 
are among those taking part in the probe.

<HEADLINE> Relatives Seek News on Lost Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The woman rushed into the arms of her  
relative, sobbing, ``What's new? What's new?'' desperate to know 
whether her son was on the EgyptAir Boeing 767 that disappeared 
early Sunday en route from New York to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo airport, relatives, friends and colleagues gathered,  
seeking news about EgyptAir flight 990, which disappeared over the 
Atlantic around 60 miles off Nantucket with 199 passengers and 15 
crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of the disappearance were broadcast on Egyptian  
television several hours before the plane had been due to arrive. 
People soon began gathering at the airport, tense with worry as 
airline officials kept them at the foot of a staircase below the 
EgyptAir operations office. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, Aida, feared that her son, Essam Bahjat, an EgyptAir  
steward, was on Flight 990 returning home from vacation in the 
United States. He had promised to call his mother if he missed the 
flight -- and so far there was no word from him. 
</P>
<P>
	His hands trembling and his voice emotional, Bahjat's  
brother-in-law, Imad Kassab, told Aida that her son's name was not 
on the passenger list. Bahjat was not on the crew list, either. 
</P>
<P>
	But his parents were not convinced. His father, Bahjat Bahjat,  
pounded on the office window. ``He hasn't called. He hasn't 
called,'' he cried out. Kassab -- the owner of a Cairo branch of the 
U.S. restaurant Cheesecake Factory -- called relatives on his mobile 
phone with the latest news. 
</P>
<P>
	Around a dozen people gathered at the base of the stairs. One  
man started punching and shoving officials and had to be 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in a red scarf, whose husband was reportedly on board  
the flight, yelled from the bottom of the stairs, demanding to be 
let up to the office. ``We have relatives on this flight. Who else 
would try to come up?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Cairo travel agent, Ala Mansour, said he was planning to pick  
up a couple from Montreal due to arrive on the flight. ``This is 
very bad news,'' Mansour said. ``I was just going to the airport to 
meet my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the operations office, EgyptAir's head Mohammed Fahim Rayan  
and other officials huddled. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the office, red-eyed airline stewards waited for news  
about their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990, which originated in Los Angeles, took off from New  
York City's Kennedy International Airport at 1:19 a.m. and 
disappeared from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said 
Eliot Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation 
Administration in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard sent every available cutter and aircraft in the  
Northeast to join the search, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Giants 23, Eagles 17, OT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Michael Strahan scored on a 44-yard  
interception return in overtime as the New York Giants rallied to 
beat the Philadelphia Eagles 23-17 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Eagles had a field goal blocked and fumbled on their  
own 5 late in the fourth, the Giants' Christian Peter tipped Doug 
Pederson's pass on third-and-8 in OT. Strahan caught it and ran 
untouched to the end zone as the Giants (5-3) extended their 
winning streak to three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Graham was 26-of-42 for 240 yards, but had little to do  
with New York's comeback. The Eagles (2-6) deserve much of the 
credit for that. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Norm Johnson's 33-yard field goal attempt that would have  
put the game out of reach was blocked by Peter with 6 1/2 minutes left 
after a high snap. Then, Duce Staley was stripped by Keith Hamilton 
and fumbled at the Philadelphia 5, leading to Graham's 7-yard TD 
pass to Pete Mitchell to tie it at 17-all with 2 minutes left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, offensively inept most of the game, went three plays  
and out on the first series of OT. Pederson, who earlier threw the 
Eagles' longest pass in more than five years, could only lay on the 
turf while Strahan rumbled to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagles rookie Donovan McNabb made his earliest appearance of the  
season in the first quarter, but lasted only three plays. Pederson 
was 18-for-28 for 257 yards, a touchdown and an interception. 
Torrance Small had four catches for 119 yards, becoming the Eagles' 
first 100-yard receiver since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter. The injury-plagued Giants limp into a  
much-needed bye week on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles stopped the Giants on a crucial third-down play for  
the third consecutive drive with 3 1/2 minutes left in regulation. 
Allen Rossum signaled for a fair catch at the Eagles 18 and let it 
go. It bounced to the Eagles 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson was nearly tackled in the end zone for a safety. As it  
turned out, the Eagles would have preferred a safety. Staley's 
fumble at the 5 was recovered by Andre Weathers with 2:43 left, 
leading to the tying touchdown two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles got past midfield on their last possession of  
regulation, but confusion was rampant on their final play. Coach 
Andy Reid asked Pederson to call timeout, but the quarterback let 
about 10 more seconds run off the clock before doing so. David 
Akers' 59-yard attempt was no good, and Graham's pass to the end 
zone was batted down, sending it to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading 17-10 with less than 10 minutes left, the Eagles stopped  
New York on third-and-2 play when William Thomas sacked Graham. 
Rossum cut back a nifty 28-yard punt return, exposing the Giants' 
struggling kicking game, to put the Eagles at New York's 46 with 
8:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson, who missed a game-tying 42-yard attempt at Miami  
last week, had his 33-yard attempt blocked by Peter after a high 
snap. The Giants recovered at the 17, but stalled when Graham was 
sacked by Ike Reese on third down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles broke a streak of seven quarters without an offensive  
touchdown with two of them in the second to take a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiver Charles Johnson said during the week that he  
believed cornerback Jason Sehorn could be beaten deep, that's 
exactly what the Eagles did. On second-and-8 from the Eagles 16, 
Small faked short on Sehorn, then got behind him and raced toward 
midfield. He got tangled up with Sehorn, appearing on replays to 
push off before catching Pederson's pass at about the Giants' 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Small gathered in the ball, stumbled for about 10 yards and  
nearly fell, then showed some unexpected speed as he ran all the 
way for an 84-yard TD making it 17-3. Pass interference was called 
on Sehorn and declined. 
</P>
<P>
	This seemed to fire up the Giants, who put together their first  
effective drive just before halftime. But a facemask penalty on 
Roman Oben forced New York out of field-goal range. Graham tried to 
duplicate last week's ``Hail Mary'' TD to Joe Jurevicius on the 
last play of the first half, but threw the ball out of the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham hit Amani Toomer for 25 yards on 3-and-12, giving New  
York the ball at the Philadelphia 15 with the clock winding down in 
the third. LeShon Johnson ran it in from the 2 1:57 into the 
fourth, cutting it to 17-10.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir 990 Had Been Uneventful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 was late getting to Los Angeles. The reason was  
routine -- bad weather on the East Coast. Then a tire needed to be 
changed, food and fuel loaded, castoff pillows and blankets cleared 
from the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing suspicious. Just an  
annoying four-hour wait for 33 passengers en route Saturday to New 
York, and then traveling nonstop to Cairo on EgyptAir Flight 990. 
</P>
<P>
	The first five-hour leg was uneventful. So, too, was its 12:48  
a.m. landing Sunday at Kennedy International Airport. Then another 
167 passengers got on, as did an 18-person crew. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing to indicate that in less than two hours,  
Flight 990 would no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for what destroyed the plane would be slow,  
meticulous and heartbreaking. There were no immediate clues, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only passenger to get off in New York was grief counselor  
and EgyptAir consultant Ed McLaughlin. His services were needed in 
less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As an employee of the Family Enterprise Institute, he is hired  
by airline companies to do one of their worst jobs -- notify and 
console the families of crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin had already participated in a post-crash news  
conference before reporters learned he'd been on the flight's Los 
Angeles segment. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kennedy, 66 minutes passed before the twin-engine aircraft  
taxied from the gate, a normal interval for such overseas flights. 
``There were no delays, no disruptions. No events that were 
untoward in any way,'' said Port Authority aviation director Robert 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard Time moved clocks back an hour and 2:03 a.m. became  
1:03 a.m. Sixteen minutes later, the jet wheels of Flight 990 left 
the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane headed over the Atlantic on a common overseas route  
that passes over Nantucket Island. From there, it would turn north, 
flying along the U.S. coastline toward Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland, then follow a Great Circle route over the North 
Atlantic toward Europe and its final destination in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Air traffic controllers cleared the plane to 33,000 feet, a  
typical altitude for long-distance flights. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no distress call. The last communication from  
EgyptAir's pilot came at 1:43 a.m. and was perfectly normal, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 a.m., the jetliner slammed into the Atlantic Ocean 65  
miles southeast of Nantucket. All 217 people on board are believed 
dead. At least 60 were American tourists, some of whom planned to 
sail down the Nile or cross into Israel. They hailed from New York, 
Vermont, California, the Southwest and points between. 
</P>
<P>
	They sat with natives of Egypt, Sudan, Syria and Chile. The  
plane was scheduled to land in Cairo Sunday afternoon, local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they became the newest entry on a recent list of  
aircraft and lives swallowed by the Atlantic. They follow Swissair 
Flight 111, which charted a similar route and crashed last year off 
the coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 aboard after the cockpit 
filled with smoke; the private plane flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., 
carrying his wife and sister-in-law, which plummeted three months 
ago into the waters off Martha's Vineyard; the crash of 1996's TWA 
Flight 800, which took the life of every passenger and crew member 
-- 230 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the Atlantic, where the scheduled arrival  
of Flight 990 never happened, relatives fainted and keened, their 
grief carved in every facial contortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to EgyptAir employees in America, who instantly  
established an 800 number for the family and friends of passengers, 
airline workers in Cairo appeared nearly as shocked and overwhelmed 
as the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting at tables holding copies of the flight's passenger list,  
airline workers struggled to calm emotional relatives. Some 
employees even offered hope, based on no evidence, that there were 
survivors. It did little to ease the outcries of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	In a corner of Cairo's airport, a mother moaned her son's name:  
``Wahid, Wahid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the airport, hired drivers held up signs bearing the  
names of customers would never come. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Rabbi Moses Birnbaum journeyed to the Ramada Plaza  
Hotel near Kennedy airport where some 30 family members were 
sequestered behind closed doors, far from the reporters, TV crews 
and photographers who waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The people inside, Birnbaum said, ``are shellshocked, and some  
of them are angry.'' But most were quiet, the rabbi said, ``and the 
pain is written on their faces.''

<HEADLINE> Visiting Egyptian Canceled Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An Egyptian man visiting a new grandchild in New  
York canceled plans at the last minute for a flight home on 
EgyptAir 990, his daughter said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Abaza, 55, of Alexandria, Egypt, was eager to get home  
after spending five weeks in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, but 
his daughter, Iman Mohammed, prevailed on him to postpone the trip 
for another week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mohammed said her father, after learning of the plane's  
disappearance over the Atlantic early Sunday morning, expressed 
thanks to God and added, ``It is not a day for dying. If it was, I 
would be going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wasn't sure she had a premonition of the plane's  
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want him to go,'' she said. ``What I feel -- I don't  
know why. It just occurred to me that he should stay another 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her father, a widower who does not speak English, was  
on his first trip to the United States. He has two daughters in New 
York and other family in Alexandria, where he makes leather bags.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Official Says WTO Bid Fading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan probably won't meet its goal of  
joining the World Trade Organization this year, a newspaper on 
Sunday quoted a Taiwanese official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning from meetings in the United States and Europe,  
Lin Yi-fu, vice minister of economic affairs, said Saturday that 
the WTO told him completing Taiwan's membership would be ``very 
difficult'' this year, the China Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan was expected to enter the WTO late this year after China  
joined the 134-nation group. But Beijing's talks with the United 
States and the European Union haven't yielded much progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO, which began operations in 1995, sets rules for  
international trade and encourages trade liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Slur Draws Little Notice in Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- In this speck of a riverside town, so small  
a sign on the town hall points people next door to Trenton Hardware 
for help, the white ex-mayor who was forced to quit over a racist 
remark is running against the black woman who succeeded him -- and 
no one seems to care. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawns and store windows are void of campaign signs, and  
there isn't a bumper sticker in sight touting either Mayor Silvia 
Willis, 59, or ex-Mayor Joffree Leggett, 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Few of the about 250 residents want to talk about Tuesday's  
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles went public in February when Leggett, mayor for 16  
year, told a newspaper reporter: If three blacks worked together in 
a store ``within a few years, they'd be stealing from each other 
and they'd be out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made the comment while discussing a lawsuit to force the town  
to annex three primarily black neighborhoods, and later clarified 
it by saying he was talking about people like the man who filed the 
lawsuit -- Mrs. Willis' husband, Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a racist comment. You can't dress it up,'' said Leslie  
Dewey Strayhorn, 67, a black Trenton resident and former county 
commissioner. ``Ordinarily, he's a nice man. I don't know what got 
into him. ... I don't think people want the kind of image the 
former mayor gave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett resigned in March, and Mrs. Willis, a retired post  
office manager and substitute teacher, was appointed mayor by the 
town commission. 
</P>
<P>
	While many residents like Strayhorn said no racial problems  
linger in Trenton, Daniel Willis and others say the town is divided 
by race. 
</P>
<P>
	Vestiges of the old South can still be found in Trenton. A faded  
sign on an old restroom door at the fairgrounds still reads 
``Colored Ladies,'' a town law banning blacks from owning land was 
on the books until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis has sued Trenton at least three times over racial issues,  
and the Jones County schools have been accused of discriminating 
against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	That could pose a problem for Mrs. Willis. If elected Tuesday,  
she could find herself defending the town against her husband in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think this town wants to see a change so we can get  
out of the spotlight,'' Mrs. Willis said. ``Change, sometimes 
before we can accept it, we have to be hit in the head with a 
thunderbolt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wants to help the town attract industry and recover from the  
effects of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett refuses to talk to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Town Attorney Chris Henderson, elections are  
typically pretty quiet in Trenton, about 100 miles southeast of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you had an agenda,'' he said, ``there's not much you  
could do with the budget.''

<HEADLINE> Angels Select Expos Exec As GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels said Sunday they have  
selected Montreal Expos executive Bill Stoneman as their new 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels spokesman Tim Mead said a news conference was scheduled  
for Monday to introduce Stoneman. He gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bavasi resigned as Angels general manager on Oct. 1, after  
nearly six years in the position. Two days later, the team finished 
a disappointing 70-92 season and in last place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels anticipated having a general manager in place before  
the World Series. Baseball mandates that no major announcements be 
made during the World Series so as not to detract from the sport's 
biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, most recently Montreal's vice president of baseball  
operations, has worked primarily as the franchise's chief financial 
officer since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman pitched in the major leagues for eight years with a  
54-85 record and 4.08 ERA. A right-hander, he was a member of the 
Chicago Cubs for two years and the Expos for five before completing 
his career with the Angels in 1974. He pitched two no-hitters with 
the Expos.

<HEADLINE> France Advances to Rugby Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TWICKENHAM, England (AP) -- In the biggest upset in the history  
of the Rugby World Cup, France beat New Zealand 43-31 Sunday to 
advance to the final against Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The French were led by Christophe Lamaison's 28 points and  
rallied from a 24-10 deficit. They will play for the championship 
Saturday in Cardiff, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the worst defeat for the All Blacks, the 1995  
runner-up. Defending champion South Africa was ousted in its 
semifinal Saturday by Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamaison was playing because Thomas Castaignede was sidelined  
with a thigh injury. He scored all of France's points in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my destiny and I got a lot of pleasure out of it,'' he  
said. ``The All Blacks mountain wasn't that huge after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France and New Zealand hadn't met in a World Cup since the  
inaugural tournament in 1987 when the All Blacks won 29-9 in 
Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The All Blacks win often but from time to time they lose,''  
France coach Jean-Claude Skrela said. ``Or maybe the French knew 
how to win today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All but dismissed before the semifinals, Europe's sole survivor  
in the competition salvaged much respect with its comeback. No team 
from the northern hemisphere has won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand coach John Hart said his team was completely  
outplayed for 30 minutes in the second half. His team faces South 
Africa for third place Thursday, with the winner automatically 
qualifying for the 2003 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made mistakes, the French capitalized and capitalized  
well,'' Hart said. ``We put ourselves under enormous pressure and, 
under pressure, we didn't respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Bernat-Salles of France said he and his teammates plan  
to celebrate before preparing for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we drink beer,'' he said. ``Tomorrow we think about  
Australia.''

<HEADLINE> Wild Oats Markets Buys 13 Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Wild Oats Markets is buying 13 stores from  
competitors, making it the nation's largest natural food 
supermarket company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the purchase Friday, giving it 105 stores.  
Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Texas, owns 100 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was included in Wild Oats' third-quarter  
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild Oats is acquiring the 13 stores in two separate  
transactions totaling $34 million in cash and stock. One of its 
purchases, Sun Harvest Farms Inc., is made up of nine stores in 
Texas. The rest are from Wild Harvest in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Wild Oats has added 37 stores to the company this year.  
It also operates Alfalfas natural foods supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly two-thirds of Wild Oats' stores have been gained through  
mergers or buyouts, chief executive officer and co-founder Mike 
Gilliland said. He's confident the pending purchases will increase 
the company's overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing this for years, so we think we have a system  
that works pretty well,'' Gilliland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst firm Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, based in Boston, agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wild Oats continues to enhance its growth rate through  
acquisitions and internal initiatives, strengthening its position 
in the natural foods sector,'' the investment firm said in a 
September report. ``Management has proven its ability to integrate 
a number of acquisitions while delivering solid operating 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wild Oats has 23 other stores in the works, six of which are  
relocations of existing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for the third quarter, which ended Oct. 2, increased 12  
percent to $4.4 million. Wild Oats' profits for the nine-month 
period were up 33 percent to $15.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up 47 percent to $172.8 million in the third quarter  
and up 37 percent to $478.2 million for the nine-month period.

<HEADLINE> Payton's Condition Said Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Walter Payton was awaiting a liver transplant  
Sunday and his condition has not changed, said a close friend who 
wanted to dispel reports about the NFL great's health. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one radio station in New York and one in Philadelphia  
announced that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's career rushing leader said in February he has  
primary sclerosing cholangitis, a rare liver disease that can be 
treated only with a transplant. He was placed on the transplant 
list a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no news,'' Mark Alberts, one of Payton's business  
partners, said Sunday. ``This is ridiculous. If there's any news, 
we would contact the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Payton's health has deteriorated have been rampant  
in recent days, fueled by son Jarrett's sudden departure from the 
University of Miami. Coach Butch Davis said Thursday the younger 
Payton, a freshman running back and kick returner, had gone home, 
and he didn't know when Payton would return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett Payton missed Miami's game Saturday against West  
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's serious,'' said Don Soldinger, Miami's running  
backs coach. ``But I don't know how serious. I think Jarrett's 
place is there, not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS SportsLine Web site, citing two unidentified sources  
close to Payton, said the 45-year-old former Chicago Bears star 
experienced ``serious complications'' that could prevent him from 
getting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan said the team spoke with  
Payton's family and was assured he is fine. Payton isn't even far 
enough up on the transplant list to be given a beeper that would 
notify him immediately if a new liver became available, his office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And nothing should be read into Jarrett Payton's return home,  
Alberts said. He's come home several other times since school 
began.

<HEADLINE> Body Retrieved From EgyptAir Crash Cairo-Bound Plane Are Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By DAVID CRARY 	
</P>
<P>
                         *AP National Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir jetliner bound for Cairo with 217  
people on board plunged 33,000 feet in two minutes, crashing into 
the ocean off Nantucket Island early Sunday. Dozens of American 
tourists were among the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	By nightfall, searchers had retrieved debris and one body, but  
held out little hope of finding survivors in the chilly Atlantic 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the pilots made no distress call before the  
Boeing 767 crashed about a half hour after leaving New York. Though 
the FBI and other intelligence agencies began checking on the 
possibility of sabotage, President Clinton and other officials said 
there was no immediate indication of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life will never be the same without my parents,'' said Hisham  
Elzanaty of Searingtown, N.Y., whose parents were on the plane. 
``We spent last night together until one in the morning. They 
prayed for us and we wished them a safe flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers found two partially inflated life rafts, life jackets,  
passports, seat cushions and other small debris, none with any burn 
marks, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee. A finding of 
such marks on debris could suggest the possibility of a fire or 
explosion aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know at this point what caused the crash,'' said Jim  
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ``We 
are beginning what may be a long investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, about to depart for Europe for Middle East peace talks,  
said there was ``no evidence ... at this time'' of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we  
know something,'' said Clinton, who called Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak to offer condolences and U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The air search was suspended after dark, but ships continued  
scouring the area. The Coast Guard said chances of anyone surviving 
more than 12 hours in the 58-degree water were slim. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy salvage ship, the USS Grapple, and Navy divers left  
Norfolk, Va., Sunday night and were expected to join the search by 
late Monday, with orders to take debris and remains to a Navy base 
in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials indicated a majority of the 199 passengers on  
Flight 990 were Americans, including a group of 54 people bound for 
a 14-day trip to Egypt and the Nile. Alan Lewis, chief executive of 
the Boston-based travel agency Grand Circle Corp., said most of the 
group members were from Colorado, Arizona and the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Jan Duckworth, 69, of Denver, who worked as a  
clerk in the Colorado House of Representatives for 22 years. ``It 
was her first trip to Egypt. She had been talking about it since 
way last winter,'' said Judith ``J.R.'' Rodrigue, chief clerk of 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane started its flight in Los Angeles and stopped at New  
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. It took off again at 
1:19 a.m. EST and went down at 1:52 a.m., roughly 60 miles south of 
Nantucket. The Coast Guard deployed ships, reconnaissance planes 
and helicopters to search an area of about 36 square miles, in 
waters about 270 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	State-owned EgyptAir, confronted with the worst crash in its  
history, said non-American passengers included 62 Egyptians, two 
Sudanese, three Syrians and one Chilean. There were 18 crew 
members, EgyptAir said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in three years that a major search  
operation was launched in the region for a plane lost at sea. The 
series of crashes began with TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in July 
1996, followed by Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia in September 
1998 and the single-engine plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his 
wife and her sister off Martha's Vineyard in July. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan was asked about reports  
that the Federal Aviation Administration had warned EgyptAir of a 
terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take all precautions and we have plenty of warnings from  
everybody, including the FAA,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed security guards routinely fly on EgyptAir flights.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Cairo airport, sobs echoed though a restaurant where  
officials set up an information center for passengers' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	A man in his 60s found a familiar name on a passenger list and  
collapsed into a chair, crying out, ``My son, my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar wrenching scenes unfolded at the Ramada Plaza Hotel near  
Kennedy airport, where more than 20 relatives were consoled by Red 
Cross workers, Muslim clerics and even New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible in there. Everybody's crying, everybody is in  
mourning,'' Mahmoud Hamza, who lost two friends on the flight, said 
as he fought back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian newspaper, La Presse in Montreal, said one of its  
executives and his wife were aboard. Deputy publisher Claude Masson 
and his wife, Jeannine Bourdages, both 58, were headed on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 began its precipitous descent at 1:50 a.m. while  
flying at 33,000 feet. Hall said the plane dropped about 14,000 
feet over the next 36 seconds, and the last radar signal was at 
1:52 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	That rate of descent would ``indicate the plane was almost out  
of control,'' said Michael Barr, head of the aviation safety 
program at the University of Southern California. The slower 
descent rate after 19,100 feet could indicate an in-flight breakup, 
investigators suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather at Nantucket was clear with 9 miles of visibility and  
wind of 9 mph, the National Weather Service said. The Coast Guard 
reported gentle seas. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111. Planes on that route fly from Kennedy to 
Nantucket, then turn north to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before 
heading east across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane, named Thutmosis II after a pharaoh who ruled  
Egypt around 1450 B.C., was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the 
airline in September 1989. The FAA said the plane had 33,354 flight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 as Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. Critics have 
called for the privatization of the company, one of the oldest in 
Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad management and bad 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has never had as deadly a crash. In 1976, an  
EgyptAir Boeing 707 jetliner crashed during an approach to the 
Bangkok, Thailand, airport. All 55 persons aboard were killed as 
well as factory workers on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crash comes after the Oct. 19 hijack of an EgyptAir  
flight between Istanbul and Cairo. That hijacking ended peacefully 
in Germany where the hijacker was overpowered; none of the 46 
passengers on board was harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, a Boeing 767 crashed in May 1991, in Thailand. The  
Lauda Air plane went down after one of its engine thrust reversers 
accidentally deployed during a climb, killing all 10 crew and 213 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry had a fatality-free year in  
1998, but this year an American Airlines jet crashed at Little 
Rock, Ark., killing 11 people.

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Among those aboard EgyptAir Flight 990 when it  
plunged into the ocean off Massachusetts Sunday was Claude Masson, 
the deputy publisher of the Montreal daily newspaper La Presse, 
officials and colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
	Masson and his wife, Jeannine Bourdages, were going to Egypt for  
vacation when the plane crashed. They were both 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Lucien Bouchard issued a statement expressing his  
condolences and paying tribute to Masson as an objective journalist 
with high standards who spent his life keeping citizens informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Masson had worked for most of his career at La Presse. He  
started his career in 1961, writing for Quebec weeklies. He then 
joined La Presse in 1965 as a reporter. He left in 1974 to join 
Quebec Le Soleil, then spent four years as publisher of 
Trois-Rivieres Le Nouvelliste before returning to La Presse in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very hurt,'' said La Presse Publisher Roger D.  
Landry. ``He was an endearing man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he told us he was going to use his vacation to visit  
Egypt, go down the Nile River, climb the pyramids, one of our 
vice-presidents warned him it's not a very safe region to visit,'' 
Landry said.

<HEADLINE> Visiting Egyptian Canceled Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An Egyptian man visiting a new grandchild in New  
York canceled plans at the last minute for a flight home on 
EgyptAir 990, his daughter said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Abaza, 55, of Alexandria, Egypt, was eager to get home  
after spending five weeks in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, but 
his daughter, Iman Mohammed, prevailed on him to postpone the trip 
for another week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mohammed said her father, after learning of the plane's  
disappearance over the Atlantic early Sunday morning, expressed 
thanks to God and added, ``It is not a day for dying. If it was, I 
would be going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wasn't sure she had a premonition of the plane's  
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want him to go,'' she said. ``What I feel -- I don't  
know why. It just occurred to me that he should stay another 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her father, a widower who does not speak English, was  
on his first trip to the United States. He has two daughters in New 
York and other family in Alexandria, where he makes leather bags.

<HEADLINE> Way To Boost Organ Donation Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When it comes to talking to families about  
organ donation, nurses are better than doctors, timing is critical 
and health care workers' attitude makes a huge difference, new 
research finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions are drawn from the largest and most  
comprehensive look at the sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, 
husbands and wives who must decide, in a moment of utter grief, 
whether they will donate their loved one's organs to patients 
awaiting transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of families say yes, and half say no. Researchers in  
Cleveland and in Pittsburgh set out to find what makes the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the same psychology of sales. If someone is negative  
and they say, `You don't really want to do it, do you?' they're 
probably going to look at you and say, `Absolutely not,''' said 
Laura A. Siminoff of Case Western Reserve University's medical 
school. She conducted the study with Dr. Robert Arnold of the 
University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Siminoff and Arnold were presenting their results Monday to  
about 55 transplant coordinators, doctors, nurses, bioethists, 
donor families and other experts from around the country. 
Organizers hope the group will develop a model for approaching 
families that can be tested in a scientifically rigorous national 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there is answer out there and we have to keep  
searching to find what works,'' said Debbie May-Johnson, executive 
director of LifeBanc, the organ bank in Cleveland, who is attending 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, organ donation increased for the first time in years,  
edging up to about 5,500 donors. Still, 4,300 people died while 
awaiting a transplant, and more than 66,000 patients now are 
waiting for a donor organ. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's conference is one of several efforts to boost  
donation amid a bitter fight in Washington over how to allocate 
donated organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services wants more organs  
for the sickest patients, no matter where they live, while many 
transplant surgeons defend the current system, which is based 
largely on geography. 
</P>
<P>
	But both sides want to increase donation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody agrees that increasing the supply of organs is the  
way you can save more lives,'' HHS spokesman Campbell Gardett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, HHS awarded $5.3 million to groups experimenting  
with new approaches to increasing donation. Also, the national 
transplant network is studying the personalities and techniques of 
the most successful transplant coordinators -- the people who 
approach families -- to see if there are traits that can be used in 
hiring or training. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, researchers hope to push the debate forward.  
</P>
<P>
	The new study found that doctors were the most likely to  
approach families about donation, but the least successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Siminoff speculated that this may be because doctors are too  
busy to talk patiently and carefully about donation. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical doctor might rattle off a series of complicated  
points, Siminoff explained: ``There's no blood flow to the brain. 
The person's brain dead. Think about organ donation. Bye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a transplant specialist would, for instance, take  
time to make sure the family understood what brain death is and to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Families who said yes were more likely to have been approached  
by a nurse or social worker first, followed up by long 
conversations with a transplant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year study examined all 11,555 deaths at five large  
trauma hospitals in Cleveland and four in Pittsburgh in 1994-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6.4 percent of the people who died were medically suitable  
for donation. That is much higher than most hospitals because the 
study involved trauma hospitals that treat many accident victims, 
who are most likely to become donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the families were asked about donation, but only 46  
percent said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Siminoff and her colleagues interviewed the health care workers  
and families involved in every case. They concluded that hospital 
workers were treating families who were initially unsure about 
donation as if they had said no, rather than giving them more 
information that might help them change their mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that the attitude of the hospital  
workers who first approached the families made a significant 
difference. For instance, doctors and nurses who told families that 
the law required them to ask about donation had significantly worse 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The study challenges an orthodoxy in some transplant programs  
that argues it is best to wait until a patient officially is 
declared dead before raising the issue of donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concludes that it is best when nurses or social  
workers mention of organ donation early and that families with 
enough time to think about it are more likely to say yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is key, Siminoff said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you push people to tell me yes or tell me no, a lot of  
people are going to tell me no.''

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Crash Prompts Twin Probes Into Atlantic Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By GLEN JOHNSON 	
</P>
<P>
            *Associated Press Writer Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators tried Sunday to determine if a  
sudden mechanical failure or possibly terrorism caused an EgyptAir 
jetliner to plunge rapidly -- nearly 300 feet per second -- from six 
miles high and crash into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI worked  
side-by-side with help from the Federal Aviation Administration and 
the Boeing Co., which made the 767 that crashed off Nantucket, 
Mass., with 217 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	All were trying to digest an array of evidence that included  
radar tapes showing that the plane plummeted from an altitude of 
33,000 feet down to 19,100 feet in 36 seconds, before at least some 
part of it continued to remain visible for nearly another minute 
and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put the initial descent rate at about 23,200 feet per  
minute, about two to three times a standard emergency descent rate. 
The continuing images and slower descent rate after 19,100 feet 
could indicate an in-flight breakup, with smaller pieces drifting 
down at a slower rate, investigators suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that air traffic controllers were able to monitor the  
transponder signal for part of the descent indicated the plane 
continued to have electrical power at least during the first part 
of the rapid descent, aviation experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials said there was no  
immediate evidence of terrorism, but that was being investigated as 
a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB chairman, Jim Hall, refused to say if the radar tapes  
showed an aircraft in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know at this point what caused the crash,'' Hall  
told reporters. ``We are beginning what may be a long 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the mix was a recent travel alert from the FAA saying  
someone had warned a bomb would be placed on a flight originating 
from Los Angeles or New York, and word that a passenger got off the 
EgyptAir flight when it landed at New York's John F. Kennedy 
airport en route from Los Angeles to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the passenger, Ed McLaughlin, works for a company  
that helps airlines notify family members of air accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole question is what does the radar tape show,'' said  
Michael Barr, director of the aviation safety program at the 
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a whole blip and it doesn't show any break-up at  
33,000 feet, it could be an incident with a loss of 
pressurization,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, a pilot might push to nose down and  
race to get below 12,000 feet, where the air is safe to breathe. 
But such a precipitous drop would risk breaking the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are multiple hits coming down from 33,000 feet, that  
would indicate an in-flight breakup and another range of 
possibilities,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular'' obtained by The  
Associated Press, the FAA said several U.S. agencies received 
letters in August warning ``that a bomb or explosive device with 
`spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight departing from 
either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert had been in effect until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990 departed Los Angeles on Saturday and stopped  
at Kennedy International, bound for Cairo. The plane took off from 
JFK at 1:19 a.m. Sunday en route to Cairo and disappeared from 
radar screens about 40 minutes later, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information of any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the person who made the claim cited in the FAA memo was in prison 
and they had no information that the warning was related. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said that the EgyptAir flight was cruising at 33,000 feet  
when it began to descend about 1:50 a.m. Sunday. About 36 seconds 
later, it was at 19,100 feet. He said ``reflections'' were seen on 
radar screens until 1:52 a.m., almost 90 seconds more. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, an aviation analyst and veteran airline captain,  
said that if controllers knew the plane's altitude as it went down, 
it would indicate the jet still had partial electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
	While radar locates a target in the sky, controllers do not know  
the identity of the blip or its altitude without information 
broadcast from the airplane's transponder. 
</P>
<P>
	That broadcast can only be made with the help of electricity  
supplied by the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of electricity might also help the investigation,  
because it would likely mean that the electric-powered flight data 
recorder and cockpit voice recorder continued operating after the 
initial plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly what that means I don't know, but it is an entirely  
different situation from TWA (Flight 800) and Pan Am 103, which had 
breakups and an immediate loss of power,'' Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane blew up off Long Island in July 1996, killing all  
230 aboard. Investigators believe the plane's nearly empty center 
fuel tank exploded. Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December 1988, killing all 270 board. Investigators 
concluded that the plane was brought down by a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	One other source for the investigation is the plane's production  
and maintenance history. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a French Internet site that tracks Boeing's  
production line, the EpyptAir 767 came off the assembly line 
immediately before a Lauda Air 767 that crashed over Thailand in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane, tail number SU-GAP, made its first flight on  
Sept. 15, 1989, and was delivered on Sept. 26, 1989, said the site, 
decollage.org. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauda Air plane made its first flight Sept. 26, 1989 and was  
delivered Oct. 16, 1989. It crashed in May 1991 after one of its 
engine thrust reversers accidentally deployed during a climb, 
killing all 10 crew and 213 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokewoman Barbara Murphy refused to comment on the  
plane's production history, citing the pending crash investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A crash uniting the FBI and the NTSB was reminiscent of the TWA  
explosion, when the two worked side-by-side. The FBI eventually 
ruled that the crash did not involve a criminal act, but not before 
both sides reported a strain in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, they have pledged better cooperation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see another parallel investigation for  
a while,'' said Barr, the USC teacher. ``The FBI will stay involved 
until they can be fairly certain that it wasn't a criminal event.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- George McGovern, the ex-senator, presidential  
candidate and U.S. ambassador, retraced his World War II 
experiences through southern Italy on Sunday as he and his wife 
celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	McGovern, who was appointed U.S. ambassador to the Rome-based  
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in March, served 
as a B-24 bomber pilot flying out of the air base in Cerignola, 
Italy, for about eight months in 1944-1945. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was based there, his wife, Eleanor, was expecting their  
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	The air base at Cerignola is long deserted, but the McGoverns  
toured some of the old buildings Sunday and the remains of the 
runway from which McGovern flew 35 combat missions. They celebrated 
the anniversary at a luncheon with the city's mayor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Crash: No Foul Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday there was ``no  
evidence ... at this time'' of foul play in the EgyptAir jetliner 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no evidence of that at this time, and I think it's  
better if people draw no conclusions until we know something,'' 
Clinton said hours before he was to travel to Norway for Middle 
East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the cause of the accident is we'll keep  
working until we find out,'' the president said after attending 
church with Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made a five-minute call later to Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak to express his condolences and the ``two 
leaders pledged cooperation on the ongoing search and recovery 
phase,'' a senior administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak, a key player in Mideast peace, was not attending the  
meeting in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all Americans, Hillary and I are very saddened by the  
crash of the EgyptAir flight off the coast of Massachusetts. We are 
working on the recovery efforts. We know that there has been an 
extensive loss of life and we don't yet know what caused the 
accident,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said ``there is reason to believe that a  
large number of Americans citizens were on board.'' The senior 
administration official said the majority of passengers were likely 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore promised a thorough investigation to  
``learn whatever we can to avert further tragedies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of our country and people all over the world will  
have the families of those who are evidently lost at sea in our 
prayers and in our thoughts,'' Gore said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States will cooperate with the government of  
Egypt ``in doing everything we possibly can to find the cause of 
this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will ensure ``that all of the families of the victims  
are dealt with in the most sensitive and compassionate way possible 
and learn whatever we can to avert further tragedies,'' Gore said 
in the interview at his residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was leaving Sunday for Oslo, Norway, where he has  
meetings scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Barak and Arafat are to discuss 
the next steps in moving the Middle East peace process forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the  
site where debris was found, according to an administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grapple, based at Little Creek, Va., is a search and rescue  
vessel that participated in the recovery efforts after John F. 
Kennedy Jr.'s plane crashed into the Atlantic off Martha's 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had a P-3 airplane in the air. The P-3 is a  
long-range reconnaissance plane that specializes in seeking out 
submarines along the ocean floor.

<HEADLINE> Gore Knocks Bradley on Soc. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that  
``discussion should continue'' on whether to raise the Social 
Security eligibility age. Vice President Al Gore's campaign seized 
upon the remark as an indication of half-hearted support for the 
retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, meanwhile, dismissed criticism from Gore that his  
proposal to help 45 million uninsured people get health coverage 
might actually drive up premiums and might bust the federal budget 
in future years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you put out a big idea to deal with a big problem,  
it's vulnerable to scare tactics,'' Bradley said. ``That is 
precisely what's going on here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' the former New Jersey  
senator was asked about a Senate vote in which he backed a 
nonbinding resolution expressing support for raising the Social 
Security eligibility age from 67 to 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position is that the discussion should continue,'' Bradley  
said. ``My position is that Social Security is the most important 
government program. It should be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley added that to ensure Social Security's future solvency,  
the issue had to cease being ``a political football'' and become 
the focus of serious talks between Republicans and Democrats. But 
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Bradley's position on the 
eligibility age suggested a willingness to make fundamental changes 
that might undermine the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't make firm commitment to defending the current age for  
Social Security,'' Lehane said. ``We should keep that commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser responded that Bradley's  
``commitment to Social Security is firm.'' He declined to discuss 
the eligibility age issue further. Gore aides, however, indicated 
the vice president may hammer Bradley on the issue in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' repeated his charge that  
Bradley's proposals to extend health insurance to all Americans 
would spend virtually all of the projected surplus over the next 
decade, end a cherished Democratic program in Medicaid and do 
nothing to keep Medicare solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	``His health care proposal is definitely a throwback to an era  
where both Democrats and Republicans threw fiscal responsibility to 
the wind,'' Gore said. ``If a Republican candidate had proposed 
eliminating Medicaid and taking away everything that's needed to 
save Medicare, Democrats would be up in arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the disagreement over health insurance demonstrates  
how his approach to governing contrasts with that of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem. It deserves a big solution. I've offered  
that, and I think he's been much more incremental in nature. So I 
think that would lead to us being very different kinds of 
presidents,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was asked about a Time magazine report on his  
campaign's hiring of feminist author Naomi Wolf as an adviser at a 
salary of $15,000 a month. The magazine said Wolf is involved in 
everything from choosing shirt-and-tie combinations to changing 
public perceptions of Gore as a permanent No. 2 man. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is the author of several best-sellers on female sexual  
power. In her latest, ``Promiscuities,'' she argues in part that 
schools should teach such things as masturbation because it is more 
realistic than abstinence and safer than sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Wolf's salary is ``a third'' of the reported amount --  
his campaign has drawn criticism for being top-heavy and overpaid -- 
and that she is mainly working with his daughter, Karenna Gore 
Schiff, on Internet efforts to appeal to younger voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a valued adviser and she'll remain one,'' Gore said.  
``We want to attract young women and young men to participate in 
this campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Expert: Just Do More Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Americans would just do more exercise, they  
wouldn't have to worry so much about how much weight they carry, a 
leading researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Being unfit and being fat bring independent risks of dying  
early, so a fat person can reduce some of the risk simply by 
exercising regularly, said Steven N. Blair of The Cooper Institute 
for Aerobics Research, Dallas. In this scenario, weight loss could 
be considered a separate benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a public health problem, data from this report indicate  
that low fitness is perhaps the most important for obese 
individuals,'' Blair said. ``The low-fit men were just as likely to 
die as men who'd had a heart attack, a stroke, or some other form 
of cardiovascular disease,'' Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and his colleagues looked at data on 25,174 men who were  
followed for an average of 10 years. All were given exercise tests 
to determine their fitness. Thirteen percent were obese, 46 percent 
were overweight, and 41 percent had normal weight. About 50 percent 
of the obese men had low fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in a recent issue of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men with low fitness had 2.3 times the risk of dying  
compared with obese men who were not unfit. In contrast, obese men 
who started the study with cardiovascular disease had 2.4 times the 
risk of dying, compared with similar men who started the study 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men who had high cholesterol had a 70 percent greater risk  
of dying than did similar men without high cholesterol. Obese men 
with diabetes or who were current smokers had 50 percent greater 
risks, and obese men with high blood pressure had a 10 percent 
greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I, with my biases, was a little surprised to see that low  
fitness was actually a stronger predictor of mortality than was 
diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or current 
smoking,'' said Blair, a longtime proponent of the health value of 
regular physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	And because low fitness is far more common than, for instance,  
diabetes, physical activity could have an even greater importance 
in saving lives, Blair said. Up to 44 percent of deaths among the 
obese could have been prevented by exercise, compared with 9 
percent of deaths if diabetes had been prevented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Blair, America's preoccupation with the bathroom mirror and  
scale is misplaced. ``For many of us, no amount of dieting or 
exercise will make us have the physique of models and movie 
stars,'' he said. ``It's an unattainable goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing weight can be a good thing, Blair said. But fat people  
can improve their health by exercising, even if they don't become 
thin -- and exercise is an attainable goal, he said. ``Thirty years 
ago, I was short, fat and bald,'' he said. ``Today, I am short, fat 
and bald. But I have run 100,000 kilometers (62,500 miles) in the 
last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's advice to doctors is to check their obese patients'  
exercise habits as scrupulously as they check for signs of high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The article on exercise appeared in a JAMA theme issue that  
focused on obesity. Also in the issue was a report by the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which found that obesity 
had risen from 12 percent of adults in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 
1998. CDC researchers characterized this as an obesity epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report, led by researchers at St Luke's-Roosevelt  
Hospital Center in New York City, estimated deaths attributable to 
obesity at around 280,000 or more a year. Obesity has been linked 
to conditions ranging from heart disease to diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Obesity and lack of exercise can be considered independent risk  
factors for an early death, said researcher David B. Allison of St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. So, although Blair is correct in 
pointing out that exercise is good, losing weight is also good -- 
and doing both may be best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most things in human life, including death, are  
multifactorial,'' Allison said. ``It's quite clear to me that 
obesity is a contributing factor. I also believe, from my reading 
of Steve's other papers, that fitness is a contributing factor. But 
I don't see these as exclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fat people should look for the risk-reduction method that works  
for them, said Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard Medical School, 
who is president of the North American Association for the Study of 
Obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behavior science teaches us that success is what we believe  
in,'' Blackburn said. If a person believes in the value of diet, 
then diet is the method to try -- a person who wants to rely on 
exercise should exercise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a combination of some vigorous exercise and some  
dieting may work best, Blackburn said. ``Just 200 less calories a 
day would be 20 pounds lighter over a year,'' he said. ``Half you 
could cut back (in eating) and the other half you could burn in 
exercise.''

<HEADLINE> Angels Select Expos Exec As GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels said Sunday they have  
selected Montreal Expos executive Bill Stoneman as their new 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels spokesman Tim Mead said a news conference was scheduled  
for Monday to introduce Stoneman. He gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bavasi resigned as Angels general manager on Oct. 1, after  
nearly six years in the position. Two days later, the team finished 
a disappointing 70-92 season and in last place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels anticipated having a general manager in place before  
the World Series. Baseball mandates that no major announcements be 
made during the World Series so as not to detract from the sport's 
biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, most recently Montreal's vice president of baseball  
operations, has worked primarily as the franchise's chief financial 
officer since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman pitched in the major leagues for eight years with a  
54-85 record and 4.08 ERA. A right-hander, he was a member of the 
Chicago Cubs for two years and the Expos for five before completing 
his career with the Angels in 1974. He pitched two no-hitters with 
the Expos.

<HEADLINE> Crash Relatives Gather at NYC Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy Airport was  
decorated Sunday for a children's beauty pageant and a Halloween 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the festivities and dressed-up kids with big grins flowed a  
steady stream of sorrow as families of those aboard Flight 990 were 
brought in to pray and wait and grieve, an all-too-familiar scene 
at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute, 5-year-old Ashley Marrero walked out of the hotel in  
a frilly dress with a blue ribbon. She'd just won the title 
``Little Miss Sweetheart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next minute, a woman walking into the hotel collapsed,  
wailing, onto the pavement. Two men rushed to help her up. Behind 
her walked a woman in traditional Muslim garb -- an ankle-length 
black dress, her head covered in a scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad, what happened with the flight,'' said Ashley's  
mother, Marisol Amelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, 20 to 30 relatives gathered, one family per table,  
consoled by workers from the Red Cross, Muslim clerics and Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible in there. Everybody's crying, everybody is in  
mourning,'' Mahmoud Hamza, who lost two friends on the flight, said 
as he fought back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of women crying,'' said Lateef Sadiq, a  
Muslim cleric from the Masjid Khalipha mosque in Brooklyn. ``One 
lady lost her mother and father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Wingate of the Red Cross said: ``We have people who are  
still holding out hope for their loved ones. Then there are those 
who know immediately what this means,'' said 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramada has been a center for grieving relatives before,  
earning it the nickname ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' Three years ago, in 
the days following the crash of TWA Flight 800, hundreds of family 
members converged here. The scene was repeated in 1998 after the 
crash of SwissAir Flight 111. 
</P>
<P>
	While an undisclosed number of families of Flight 990 victims  
were spending Sunday night at the Ramada, Giuliani said they would 
likely be relocated to Providence, R.I., closer to the recovery 
effort, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Angeles International Airport, where Flight 990  
originated, religious leaders and others were available to take 
phone calls from relatives and console one family that arrived, 
weeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a Los Angeles mosque mourned two of the pilots, both  
frequent visitors at the Islamic Center of Southern California 
during their stopovers in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pilots was Hatem Rushdy, said mosque member Aboubakr  
El-Tawansy. He said he has know Rushdy for about five years, since 
the pilot helped his daughter on a flight from Los Angeles to 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He upgraded her seats because she wasn't breathing well in a  
smoking area and was very generous with her,'' El-Tawansy said. 
``Since she heard the news she's been crying and crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Ramada Inn in New York, Ghazi Khankan, a Muslim cleric  
from the Islamic Center of Westbury, said many family members took 
comfort in their deep religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ordered to be patient as much as possible from the  
moment we are born,'' Khankan said. ``God knows when we are going 
to die. It is not a punishment, it is fate.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning 2, Stars 1 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Vincent Lecavalier and Fredrik Modin scored  
first-period goals and Tampa Bay made them hold up for the 
Lightning's first road win this season, a 2-1 victory Saturday 
night over the slumping Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, which savored its first lead after one period this  
season, beat Dallas for the first time since Feb. 19, 1996. It was 
only the second time the Lightning have won in Reunion Arena, the 
other coming in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who were playing with Joe Nieuwendyk and Richard  
Matvichuk for the first time in two weeks, managed only a 
power-play goal by Brett Hull in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull almost scored again with 1:14 left when a soft shot bounced  
under the outstretched leg of Tampa Bay goaltender Dan Cloutier -- 
but it hit the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloutier had five more legitimate saves earlier in the period  
during a Dallas power play that was its most aggressive two minutes 
of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars went with six skaters for most of the last 1:14, but  
didn't get a shot on goal to lose its second straight. They've 
scored just nine goals in their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The sluggish performance was exactly what Dallas didn't want in  
its final game before Wednesday night's Stanley Cup finals rematch 
with Buffalo. The Stars were coming off four days rest since a 4-0 
loss in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning were coming off losses Wednesday in Buffalo and  
Thursday in Boston. In those games, and another road loss earlier 
in New Jersey, Tampa Bay had been outshot 39-13 and outscored 6-1 
in the opening 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this time was that the Lightning outshot the  
Stars 13-8 and scored both its goals in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecavalier got it started 2:54 into the game when he picked off  
a lazy pass from Dallas forward Mike Keane at the Stars blue line 
and beat goaltender Ed Belfour one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas tied the game when Hull, using a stick with orange grip  
tape that had a jack-o-lantern drawn on it in honor of Halloween, 
drilled a slap shot past Cloutier. It was his fourth goal of the 
season, all on power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay regained the lead with 14.9 seconds left in the period  
when Chris Gratton won a faceoff and directed the puck to Modin, 
who one-timed it past Belfour from just outside the left circle. It 
was the first time this season the Lightning have led after one 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour made 29 saves.

	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- After 11 months alone at sea, Jesse  
Martin was given a hero's welcome Sunday when he returned to his 
home port in Australia to become the youngest person to sail 
non-stop around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 18, was greeted by thousands of cheering spectators who

<P>
	Appearing a little shaky on his feet, Martin was given a

</P>
<P>
	Martin left Melbourne in December last year to sail 30,000 miles

	214 Feared Dead in EgyptAir Crash  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- All 214 people aboard are feared dead after an  
EgyptAir plane crashed at sea off the island of Nantucket on a 
flight from New York to Egypt early today. The Coast Guard says it 
has found one body and some aircraft debris. An official familiar 
with air traffic control said controllers in the Boston Center in 
Nashua, N.H., who were observing the flight, saw the plane at 
33,000 feet. Twelve seconds later, the plane had dropped to 26,600 
feet, and in a third sweep 12 seconds later, the plane was at 
19,100 feet. EgyptAir's head says there were 62 Egyptians, two 
Sudanese, three Syrians and one Chilean on board. There is no 
record of the nationality of 131 others, but some are believed to 
be Americans. 

</P>
<P>
	Gore Promises Thorough Jet Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was informed today of the  
crash of the EgyptAir jetliner just hours before he was to travel 
to Norway for Middle East peace talks and Vice President Al Gore 
promised a thorough investigation to ``learn whatever we can to 
avert further tragedies.'' Clinton is leaving today for Oslo, 
Norway, where he has meetings scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak, a key player in the process, is not expected in 
Oslo.

	FBI: Threat of Y2K Extremists Real

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of violence by extremists to mark  
the new millennium is ``very real,'' an FBI report being prepared 
reports. The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it 
was preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share 
it with police chiefs at their upcoming convention, the Washington 
Post is reporting in today's editions. The agency said the document 
analyzes ``the potential for extremist criminal activity in the 
United States by individuals or domestic groups who attach special 
significance to the year 2000.''

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Russia and North Korea next week will  
overhaul a decades-old treaty that calls for Russian military 
backing for communist North Korea in the event of a war, a South 
Korean official said today. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is 
expected to visit North Korea Nov. 8-11 to sign a new cooperation 
treaty that emphasizes trade but excludes a military alliance. For 
several years, Russia has sought to rewrite the treaty, which was 
signed shortly after the Korean War. Relations between Moscow and 
North Korea have chilled since the former Soviet Union established 
diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1990.

vital break of serve for a 6-5 lead in the final set with the help 
of a dubious call that ruled his passing shot down the line to be 
good. Krajicek questioned the call for a long time and spent the 
changeover arguing with the chair umpire.

<HEADLINE> 2 Doomed Boeing Planes Off Same Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The EgyptAir 767 that plummeted six miles Sunday  
to crash off the coast of Nantucket Island came off Boeing Co.'s 
assembly line immediately before a Lauda Air 767 that crashed eight 
years ago in a Thailand jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planes were completed just days before Boeing's aircraft  
assemblers went on strike, complaining of being over tired because 
they were forced to work too much overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing spokesman said the company knew of nothing to indicate  
the two crashes were related, but added, ``we're going to look at 
every possible scenario.'' The 1991 Lauda crash was caused when a 
mechanism designed to brake the plane on the ground deployed in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir model 767-300ER, for extended range, was assembled  
at Boeing's Everett plane factory in September 1989, the 282nd 767 
to be built. The 767-300ER for Austria's Lauda Air left the factory 
about two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Doug Webb said the  
company has no reason to think anything was wrong with aircraft 
assembled at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the planes were built during one of the most turbulent  
times in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Machinists at Boeing went on strike on Oct. 4, 1989, as  
the aircraft builder was struggling to meet delivery schedules 
during a period of record aircraft orders. In addition to money, a 
major issue in the 48-day strike was the heavy amount of overtime 
required of production workers, many of whom complained of being 
too tired to do their jobs properly. 
</P>
<P>
	During the crush of work in the late 1980s, some of Boeing's  
largest customers complained about poor quality. Those carriers 
later praised the company for fixing the problems, however, and 
backed up the sentiment by ordering hundreds of more jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggles of the late 1980s led to a compete revamp of  
Boeing's manufacturing, design and engineering processes, as well 
as the way the company worked with customers, employees and 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both company and union officials have adamantly denied that  
aircraft could be sabotaged in the plant, saying there are too many 
safeguards and that any perpetrator would be easy to trace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767, a twin-engine widebody, went into passenger use in  
September 1982 and is a workhorse on transatlantic routes. It has 
not had an unusually high accident rate, with only three fatal 
crashes -- the third occurring when an Ethiopian Airlines jet 
ditched in the Comoros Islands in 1996 after being hijacked and 
running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Sunday's crash, the EgyptAir plane had completed more  
than 30,000 flight hours over the course of more than 6,900 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had no immediate indication of what caused the jet  
to suddenly dive from 33,000 feet into the Atlantic approximately 
40 minutes after taking off on a flight from New York to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane apparently had just reached cruising altitude. All 214  
on board were believed killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauda 767, which crashed on May 26, 1991, was climbing after  
taking off from Bangkok about 45 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It had just passed 10,000 feet when the pilot and copilot  
received a warning light signifying a problem with the engine 
thrust reverser, a device that uses the power of the aircraft's two 
engines to brake the plane after it lands. On a 767, the reversers 
-- one per engine -- are engineered to activate only when the plane 
is on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, as they were discussing what action to take, an  
engine reverser activated, sending the plane into an uncontrollable 
plunge. The 233 passengers and crew were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident stunned Boeing and the aviation industry because  
experts believed existing safeguards should have prevented it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was never any official explanation for the  
malfunction in the thrust reverser, investigators strongly 
suspected a flaw in the mechanism that controls it. Boeing 
redesigned the mechanism on subsequent 767 and 757 models. The 
company and the Federal Aviation Administration recommended 
airlines flying the jets make similar modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Webb said he believed that all the affected aircraft  
had gone through the retrofit, but the company was trying to 
confirm that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the EgyptAir and Lauda planes were equipped with Pratt &AMP;  
Whitney 4080 engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said it was far too early to speculate on what might have  
caused the EgyptAir accident. But he said any similarities between 
Sunday's disaster and the Thai crash would be explored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we would do is look at the service record and  
maintenance record of the airplane, and obviously we're going to 
look at every possible scenario,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing does not want to speculate on the cause of the EgyptAir  
crash, Webb said. Rather, ``We want to look at the data and let 
that lead the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was sending a team of experts to Nantucket to assist the  
National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> President Trump Would Handle Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump said Sunday that as president, he  
personally would handle U.S. trade talks and would restore respect 
from countries doing business with America. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York developer, considering a run for president as the  
Reform Party nominee, attacked the trade policies of a number of 
U.S. allies: 
</P>
<P>
	--France is ``a terrible partner.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Japan is ``ripping us big league.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Germany ``wants to take over the world economically. They  
failed militarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Saudi Arabians ``have boats bigger than any boats you've ever  
seen. They have houses all over the world, including Palm Beach. 
... This is getting a little ridiculous. I mean, the money they 
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Trump also took aim at North Korea and  
China for ignoring U.S. overtures and building nuclear weapons. He 
branded Cuba's Fidel Castro as ``absolutely a killer and should be 
treated as such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He placed a large share of the blame on U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky -- ``Nobody ever heard of her'' -- 
and said he would hold that title in a Trump administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``My lawyers have checked, and the president has the  
authority,'' Trump said in a statement released by his presidential 
exploratory committee after his television appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our trading partners would have to negotiate across the table  
from Donald Trump, and I guarantee you, the rip-off of the United 
States would end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures announced two weeks ago showed the nation's trade  
deficit running at a record annual rate of $252 billion through 
August. The deficit with Japan, at a record in July, was slightly 
narrower at $6.4 billion in August but still was running 13 percent 
higher than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fox, Trump said clues to the Clinton administration's trade  
policy can be found in the president's personal business deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do a deal a minute, and the one deal he did was Whitewater.  
That turned out to be, you know, unfortunate,'' Trump said. Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invested in the failed 
Arkansas land development that led to a protracted independent 
investigation and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Clintons' latest deal, a $1.7 million house in New  
York's Westchester County, showed the president's lack of business 
acumen, Trump said. If Trump -- who described himself as ``by far 
the biggest developer in Manhattan'' -- had done the deal, he said, 
he could have saved the Clintons at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the house. My people know the house,'' Trump said.  
``They came up to me, they said, 'Why did he pay so much?' I said, 
'I don't know.' So why do we give everything away to Japan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Trump enters the 2000 Reform Party campaign, a decision he  
promised by the spring, a principal opponent will be Pat Buchanan. 
He quit the Republican Party and is to announce his candidacy 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' he was asked about  
Trump's idea to name himself trade representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think The Donald would be much better off at HUD, quite  
frankly: Housing and Urban Development,'' Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Campaign Gaining Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Claiming new campaign momentum by sticking to  
the high road, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley insists 
``my outrage'' will remain focused on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Staking out contrasts with Vice President Al Gore, Bradley  
warned that voters are certain to punish candidates who engage in 
verbal fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's where the American people are today,'' the  
former New Jersey senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore leads in national polling, Bradley has narrowed the  
gap in such key states as Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first 
nominating caucuses and primary will be held next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has responded by becoming more aggressive in his criticism  
of Bradley, who made it clear he won't respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to make sure my strength is used to project a  
positive vision and my outrage is held for things like people who 
don't have health insurance ... not my strength and ingenuity used 
in negative attacks,'' Bradley said. ``It's been working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was seeking to underscore the contrasts with Gore on  
every front Sunday. He went door to door in a middle-class 
neighborhood with a Democratic legislative candidate, mingling with 
residents preparing for Halloween festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that this tactic is symbolic of his campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a good amount of that running for president,''  
Bradley said. ``It's a way of paying respect. If you do it with 
some, you are doing it for all. If you never do it then you aren't 
paying that type of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the Democratic Party establishment in Gore's camp,  
Bradley sought support among academic liberals from nearby Iowa 
State University using issues such as his call for expanded health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his effort to keep the campaign civil has brought him a  
clear surge of support. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have thought for so many years that what a politician  
does is manipulate the voter,'' Bradley said. ``I'm going to run 
this campaign in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that difference will include campaign finances, where he  
has turned to such innovations as focusing on the Internet to raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to raise money in a different way,'' Bradley said.  
``We've raised more money on the Internet than any other 
candidate.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- A Boeing 767 passenger plane disappeared about 60  
miles south of Nantucket after taking off from JFK International 
Airport in New York, the Coast Guard said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known how many people were on board  
EgyptAir Flight 990, which was headed to Cairo, Egypt, Coast Guard 
Lt. Rob Halsey said.

lost. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard jet and four vessels were searching the area.

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board  
disappeared early today on a flight from New York to Egypt, and 
debris and at least one body were found at sea off Nantucket, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, was headed to Cairo, Coast  
Guard Lt. Rob Halsey said. It originated in Los Angeles, according 
to EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers found one body and debris, Coast Guard Rear Adm.  
Richard M. Larrabee said at a news conference in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the  
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small 
parts that are not identifiable,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the debris was located about 60 miles south of  
Nantucket, and that the operation was still considered a search and 
rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 199 passengers on the flight, including two infants,  
plus 15 crew members, an EgyptAir official said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were Americans on board, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim  
Rayan said at a news conference in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan said there were 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three Syrians  
and one Chilean. There was no record of the nationality of 131 
others, and Rayan said he believed some of those were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan and Larrabee said they had no knowledge of an SOS being  
sent by the plane's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from Kennedy at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared  
from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot 
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in 
Washington. Weather at Kennedy was good with 3 to 4 miles of 
visibility and light wind, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FAA officials in Washington, the twin-engine  
plane's takeoff from Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it 
arrived late from Los Angeles. The cause of the delay was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI source in Washington said agents were sent to Kennedy and  
Los Angeles International. They were checking manifests to see who 
was on board and talking to anyone who would have serviced the 
plane, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11, which crashed off

on that route fly from Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to

	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	Imad Kassab trembled with hope when he discovered that his  
brother-in-law, Essam Bahjat, was not on the passenger list for the 
flight as he had feared. Kassab, owner of the Cairo branch of the 
U.S.-based restaurant Cheesecake Factory, quickly called friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the airline in  
September 1989. It had logged over 31,000 flight hours and 6,900 
take-offs and landings, said Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy in 
Seattle.

	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 as Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, a Boeing 767 crashed on May 26, 1991, near Suphan  
Buri Province, Thailand. The Lauda Air plane lost control and 
crashed after one of its engine thrust reversers accidentally 
deployed during a climb. The crashed killed all 10 crew and 213 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 crashed near Moroni,  
Comoros, on Nov. 23, 1996, while attempting to land after being 
hijacked. Ten of the 12 crew members and 117 of the 160 passengers 
were killed. The three hijackers apparently died. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry went through a fatality-free  
year in 1998, but this year there has been the crash of an American 
Airlines jet in Little Rock, Ark., the loss of John F. Kennedy's 
private plane off Martha's Vineyard this summer and last week's 
crash of a Learjet carrying golfer Payne Stewart.

<HEADLINE> Director Didn't Want Jolie for Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The director and producer of the serial-killer  
thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit 
Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her  
Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was 
attending film school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce  
tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov. 5 edition. 
</P>
<P>
	It took some heated arguments -- with Noyce and producer Martin  
Bregman both fighting for Jolie -- and a serious slash to the film's 
budget to get Universal to agree, adds Bregman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown  
Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says. ``Angie's enormously  
gifted, and I usually get what I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and  
the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' 
who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Coaches Pick Cincinnati As Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Cincinnati won the first four Conference  
USA regular season titles, and the league's coaches say the 
Bearcats should win a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati returns four starters from last year's 27-6 team,  
including preseason All-Conference USA selections center Kenyon 
Martin and forward Pete Mickeal. The Bearcats also added highly 
touted freshmen guards DerMarr Johnson and Kenny Satterfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more talented than we were the last two years, but we're  
young too,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said. ``In the backcourt 
right now we're lining up kids against men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In voting results announced Sunday, DePaul was picked to finish  
second in the American Division behind Cincinnati, followed by 
Louisville, UNC-Charlotte, Saint Louis and Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
	In the National Division, the coaches selected South Florida as  
the favorite, followed by UAB, Memphis, Houston, Southern 
Mississippi and Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches named 6-6 DePaul sophomore Quentin Richardson to  
repeat as Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, Martin and Mickeal are joined on the preseason  
All-Conference USA team by Houston guard Gee Gervin, Louisville 
forward Nate Johnson and South Florida forward B.B. Waldon.

	How the airborne laser is supposed to work:  
</P>
<P>
	--A beam of light 15 inches in diameter goes through a telescope  
that looks like an enormous contact lens on the nose of a modified 
Boeing 747 jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
	--The target is an enemy missile climbing through the lower  
atmosphere, perhaps 60 miles from the airborne laser. 
</P>
<P>
	--The beam is not aimed at the warhead atop the missile but  
rather on the missile body. 
</P>
<P>
	--The goal is to create a burn mark the size of a basketball. The  
resulting heat and pressure inside the missile tears it apart.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Temper May Become an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- While rising in the GOP presidential polls, Sen.  
John McCain is facing questions about what some Arizona political 
leaders view as his quick temper -- and whether it might hinder him 
as president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a front page article and separate editorial Sunday, The  
Arizona Republic said it wanted the nation to know about the 
``volcanic'' temper McCain has unleashed on several top state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have been on the receiving end of a McCain uproar  
include Republican Gov. Jane Hull, former Republican Gov. Rose 
Mofford and former Democratic Mayor Paul Johnson of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, a supporter of GOP presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush, has acknowledged that her relationship with McCain has 
been cool and told an interviewer recently McCain ``has to keep 
control'' of his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hull spokesman, Francie Noyes, said Sunday the governor had no  
further comment on the matter of McCain's temperament and that 
``she wants to move on to other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Arizona Republic, which endorsed McCain for each of his  
five congressional races but has not yet made an endorsement in the 
presidential race, was direct. 
</P>
<P>
	It declared in an editorial:  
</P>
<P>
	``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it  
is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we 
know in Arizona. There is also reason to seriously question whether 
he has the temperament, and the political approach and skills, we 
want in the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said the criticism reflects McCain's  
emergence as a serious contender, resulting media scrutiny, and the 
fact that the former Vietnam POW ``is a fighter and has always been 
a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When a candidate moves up in the polls as quickly as John  
McCain has there's bound to be closer media scrutiny,'' Schnur 
said. ``Show me a politician who's never offended anyone and I'll 
show you a politician who's pretty useless to his constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, McCain blamed the Bush campaign for helping  
plant recent temper stories and said the ``hothead'' portrayal was 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like  
that? No, I don't,'' insisted McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson, executive editor of The Republic, said her paper's  
coverage decisions were made independently, not at the suggestion 
of anyone in the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the admirable qualities of Sen. McCain have been  
widely reported nationally. A lot of the temperament issues have 
not,'' said Johnson, who is in charge of the paper's editorial and 
news pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of McCain's supporters acknowledge a short fuse, but  
say that should not disqualify him to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think John McCain is as steady as they come. I've seen him  
get really passionate about issues, but I don't see it as losing 
control,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. He called McCain's 
passion refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	State Superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan, who also is a McCain  
supporter, said she has argued heatedly with McCain many times over 
the years but that his ``passion ... is positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking for someone who serves tea in white gloves.  
That's not attractive in a president,'' said Keegan, describing 
McCain as a calm, affable person, but one ready to jump into a 
fray. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the Wall Street Journal and New York Times  
also have published articles documenting McCain's often testy 
relationships in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull told the Times that McCain's temper ``is something  
that John has to keep control of.'' According to the Times, when 
Mrs. Hull was asked to describe McCain's temper she pretended to 
hold a telephone receiver several inches from her ear. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, McCain has kept his temper under control,  
publicly at least. He showed restraint during Senate floor debate 
on campaign finance reform -- one of his priority issues -- when Sen. 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tried to goad him into losing his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sabato, a political science professor the University of  
Virginia, said McCain's temper is a legitimate subject for 
questions, but noted a number of president have had fiery tempers. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were famous for  
having bad tempers. Since his election, current President Bill 
Clinton has become known for having one also. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disqualifying because so many presidents have had bad  
tempers, but it's important to know about,'' Sabato said. ``You 
want to know what the fundamental character of a candidate for 
president is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's temper could be presented in a good light or bad,  
Sabato said. Supporters can say McCain listens to the people not 
politicians, while critics may charge that he can't work with 
others, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thais To Use Microchips To Tag Dogs </HEADLINE>

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Municipal authorities are offering to  
implant microchips in pet dogs in a bid to control the estimated 
100,000 strays in the Thai capital, newspapers reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a campaign launched Saturday to better manage nearly  
550,000 dogs in Bangkok, owners are encouraged to register their 
pets, the Bangkok Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	For $2.50 the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will implant a  
microchip under the dog's skin, containing details of the dog's 
name, home address and vaccination records. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are planning to round up strays, in a bid to get rid  
of canines carrying rabies within five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy stray dogs will be neutered. The BMA plans to then offer  
them to pet lovers for free.

<HEADLINE> Russia, N. Korea To Revise Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Russia and North Korea next week will  
overhaul a decades-old treaty that calls for Russian military 
backing for communist North Korea in the event of a war, a South 
Korean official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is expected to visit North  
Korea Nov. 8-11 to sign a new cooperation treaty that emphasizes 
trade but excludes a military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, Russia has sought to rewrite the treaty,  
which was signed shortly after the Korean War. The 1950-53 conflict 
pitted Soviet- and Chinese-backed North Korea against South Korea 
and U.N. troops, most of them Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between Moscow and North Korea have chilled since the  
former Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with South 
Korea in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold War tension persists on the Korean peninsula, which is  
divided by a heavily fortified border since the two Koreas have 
still not formally signed a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's visit to North Korea would be the first by a Russian  
foreign minister since Eduard Shevardnadze's 1990 trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov and his North Korean counterpart, Paik Nam Sun, are  
expected to discuss Washington's plan to build an anti-missile 
defense system in Northeast Asia, said a South Korean foreign 
ministry official who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called U.S. theater missile defense system is intended to  
protect ships and troops from regional threats, mostly from short- 
and medium-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rattled the region by firing a multistage missile  
over Japan and into the Pacific last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It reportedly has developed a more powerful missile which some  
U.S. experts say could reach Hawaii and Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Crash Prompts Huge Search Off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The vast sea and air recovery effort launched  
Sunday after the crash of an EgyptAir passenger plane was the 
fourth for an air disaster in the region in just three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a coincidence, exacerbated by the fact there's a  
lot of traffic here,'' said retired Coast Guard Rear Adm. John 
Linnon, who coordinated the recovery operation after the crash of 
TWA Flight 800 off New York's Long Island. ``I don't think this is 
the Bermuda Triangle of aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though major air crashes are rare, this is one of the busiest  
sections of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the heaviest traveled routes in the country,'' said  
Randy Schwitz, a veteran air traffic controller and executive vice 
president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association in 
Washington. ``The more flights you run ... the more opportunity 
there is for something to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990, bound for Cairo, took off from New York's  
Kennedy International Airport early Sunday and went down in the 
ocean roughly 60 miles south of the Massachusetts island of 
Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	It was following a route that would have taken it toward Nova  
Scotia and Newfoundland before heading east across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111 was following a similar  
path bound for Europe when it crashed off Nova Scotia, killing all 
229 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Another plane that had taken off from Kennedy, Paris-bound TWA  
Flight 800, exploded over the ocean off the south shore of Long 
Island in July 1996, killing all 230 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	And on July 16, John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister  
were killed when the single-engine plane Kennedy was piloting from 
New Jersey plummeted into the ocean about 7 miles off Martha's 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	As it had for Kennedy, the federal government on Sunday  
dispatched planes, helicopters, divers and numerous Coast Guard 
cutters for the recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy salvage ships also were mobilized. For JFK, it was the USS  
Grasp. For the crashes of EgyptAir, Swissair and TWA Flight 800, it 
was the USS Grapple.

<HEADLINE> Maier Wins First Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIGNES, France (AP) -- Hermann Maier of Austria, seeking to  
regain the overall World Cup title, won the season-opening giant 
slalom Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus, the defending World Cup champion from Norway,  
skidded off the course in the first run, after losing his grip on 
the rapidly deteriorating surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the 1998 World Cup winner, raced down the sun-soaked  
Tignes glacier in a combined time of 2 minutes, 22.33 seconds. It 
was his 19th World Cup title and sixth in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was such a good start to the season for me,'' said Maier,  
a double Olympic and world champion. ``The first race is always 
important because you get to see where you stand with the other 
skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to see if the others are in good shape or not,'' added  
Maier, one of four Austrians in the top six. ``I see we Austrians 
are not so bad at this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, the defending World Cup  
giant slalom champion, survived a second-run scare to finish second 
at 2:23.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Second after the opening run, Von Gruenigen appeared ready to  
produce another good time in the second run. Then his right pole 
was ripped out of his hand as he struck a gate midway down the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen continued to negotiate the remaining gates along  
the choppy course. He finished with the fifth-fastest run and 
retained second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hermann made a super performance today and I don't think I  
could have beaten him even without losing my pole,'' Von Gruenigen 
said. ``But I might have had a better time with two poles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up in the overall World Cup standings last season, Kjetil  
Andre Aamodt of Norway was timed in 2:24.23, tying for third with 
Austria's Stephan Eberharter, second in the World Cup giant slalom 
and super-G standings last year and fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, who has not won a race since 1997, is anxious for a  
victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year I started on the podium so maybe I can win a race,''  
said Aamodt, the 1994 World Cup overall champion. ``I haven't won 
in so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I need to take more risks even at the danger of going  
out. It's better than always being second, third or fourth.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Deal on China Disney Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The Hong Kong government has reached agreement  
with Walt Disney Co. on a massive theme park development in Hong 
Kong, and has committed to a total investment amounting to about 
$2.6 billion, according to several Chinese-language newspapers 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oriental Daily News quoted government sources as saying the  
government will begin construction in April next year and will 
transfer the construction site in phases from 2002 to Walt Disney 
Co. The project is expected to be finished in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong Economic Times reported Monday that the government  
will spend $2.6 billion for infrastructure and land. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the government will take a 55 percent stake in the  
joint venture, while the Sing Tao Daily said the stake would be 50 
percent. The government is expected to make detailed announcements 
Tuesday after preparing documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oriental Daily News also said that Commissioner for Tourism  
Mike Rowse will make a preliminary announcement on the deal later 
Monday. Tourism officials couldn't immediately be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been in negotiations for months with Disney,  
based in Burbank, Calif., hoping a Disney park here would boost the 
economy, which had been badly bruised by Asia's financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Oslo Trip for Legacy Rabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By BARRY SCHWEID 	
</P>
<P>
                        *AP Diplomatic Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton hopes his quick trip to  
Oslo, Norway, could begin a final push toward earning a place in 
history as an honored peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has picked an agreement between Israel and the Arabs as  
his top foreign policy priority. It also could be his best chance 
for a shining legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The president departed Sunday for Oslo, Norway, where he planned  
to meet with Middle East leaders at a ceremony honoring slain 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom Clinton called ``one of 
the great heroes of this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will honor him by not only remembering his life but by  
pursuing his vision of a peaceful Middle East,'' Clinton said. 
``There are tremendous challenges ahead. I will do everything I can 
to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians have given themselves until  
September to conclude an overall settlement. On Friday they decided 
to get started Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	That schedule coincides with the winding down of Clinton's  
second term. He has nearly 15 months left in office, time enough 
for the president to play the role of prodder or dealmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat are willing to try on their own. But if they 
get hung up on the tough issues, Clinton is just a telephone call 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be central to the peace process not only because the  
parties want us to be, but because it is a strategic interest of 
the United States,'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security 
adviser, said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak suggested Sunday he wished to carry out Rabin's  
peacemaking legacy. ``We feel more than anything that we are 
continuing along his way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, said he  
hoped the talks at Oslo, where the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
accords were signed, ``will give a great push'' to both sides to 
resolve the most difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is ready to help after the rigorous training exercise in  
last year's successful West Bank diplomacy in rural Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning, in 1993, Clinton focused on domestic issues  
such as the economy and health care, and was slow to get to foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought his legacy would be, Clinton said it would  
be remembered that he ``turned the economy around and prepared 
America for a new century.'' In an interview for broadcast Monday 
on the premier of CBS' ``Early Show,'' Clinton spoke about the 
Middle East, but didn't mention foreign affairs as part of his 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	When he did concentrate on the outside world, the most pressing  
matters were conflict in the Balkans, the search for illegal 
weapons in Iraq and the need to set a course for dealing with 
Russia and China. He also made some bold strokes to settle the 
Northern Ireland problem. An agreement he nurtured, while tenuous, 
essentially is holding. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, though, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal receding  
and peace prospects in the Middle East more promising than ever, 
Clinton has his sights on an overall settlement between Israel and 
the Arabs as a final act. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flying to Oslo on Sunday with limited expectations on  
what will be a brief fling at Middle East diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is short; Clinton departs Norway on Tuesday. He will  
spend part of the time in a ceremony marking the fourth anniversary 
of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister 
whose path to talks with the Palestinians was paved through quiet 
Norwegian diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has separate meetings set Monday with Barak and with  
Arafat. On Tuesday he sits down with them together. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference Thursday, Clinton said he did  
not want to raise expectations excessively for his talks in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	His aides said there was no chance, whatever Barak and Arafat  
tell him, that Clinton would get into the kind of marathon 
mediating he did on Maryland's eastern shore in October 1998 that 
helped produce a West Bank agreement between Arafat and 
then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues on the table are far tougher than the partial Israeli  
pullback negotiated in Maryland: Palestinian statehood aspirations, 
the future of Jerusalem, borders, the status of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very important occasion. ... I believe this meeting  
can help us resume momentum,'' Barak said in an interview reported 
in Sunday's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the Oslo accords in 1993 anticipated a step-by-step  
approach in peacemaking, not the high-energy drive for a final 
settlement approved by Barak and Arafat and endorsed by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's ambitious approach would go even further and aim for a  
quick peace treaty with Syria. That track is cold now, and without 
a Syrian presence in Oslo, Clinton is unlikely to make real headway 
on that track. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabin's view was that the Israeli people could not ``digest''  
simultaneous agreements with the Palestinians and with Syria, both 
of which would call for giving up land and probably uprooting 
Jewish settlers. Barak, however, is ready to gamble -- ``I believe 
there will be negotiations with Syria in the next few weeks or 
months,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton, Barak has an American president prepared to spend  
the time before packing up in January 2001 and to position himself 
for a place in history.

<HEADLINE> Home Life at Lincoln's White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president's son, traveling with his mother  
on a shopping excursion to New York City, needed a report on the 
health and welfare of the goats he had left behind at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Tad the goats and father are very well -- especially the  
goats,'' Abraham Lincoln replied by return mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange of letters between the president and his wife, Mary  
Todd Lincoln, is included in a slim volume, ``Lincoln at Home,'' 
published by the White House Historical Association and Thornwillow 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a collection of Lincoln family letters and an essay  
on the family's life in the White House by Civil War scholar David 
Herbert Donald, whose one-volume ``Lincoln'' appeared in 1995 and 
who has twice won the Pulitzer Prize for biography. 
</P>
<P>
	The essay and the letters focus on the antics of the goats,  
family concerns and only secondarily on the events of war. 
</P>
<P>
	The goats were named Nanko and Nannie, and Donald says they  
occasionally used the White House garden as a target of opportunity 
and a source of forage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the public at large, they had the run of the White  
House,'' Donald reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one occasion Tad harnessed Nanko up to a chair which served  
as a sled, and drove triumphantly through the East Room, where a 
reception was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``As dignified matrons held up their hoop skirts, Nanko pulled  
the yelling boy around the room and out through the door again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in August 1863 the president had sad news to report.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tell dear Tad poor ``Nanny Goat'' is lost,'' he wrote, giving  
this account of the circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
	``The day you left Nanny was found resting herself, and chewing  
her little cud, on the middle of Tad's bed. But now she's gone! 
</P>
<P>
	``The gardener kept complaining that she destroyed the flowers,  
till it was concluded to bring her down to the White House. This 
was done and the second day she had disappeared, and has not been 
heard of since. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last we know of poor Nanny.''  
</P>
<P>
	The essay also records Mary Lincoln's obsessive and ruinous  
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald writes that before the death of son Willie Lincoln, the  
first lady shopped primarily to refurbish the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	She purchased chairs, sofas and hassocks, costly fabrics,  
wallpaper imported from France and a full set of custom-made 
Haviland china with the American eagle in the center of each plate. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Red Room she ordered 117 yards of crimson Wilton carpet  
and for the East Room ``an imported Brussels velvet carpet, pale 
green in color, ingeniously woven as a single piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the bills came in. And the president, speaking in private,  
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	It would, he said, ``stink in the nostrils of the American  
people to have it said that the President of the United States had 
approved a bill overrunning an appropriation of $20,000 for flub 
dubs for this damned old house when the soldiers cannot have 
blankets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willie's death in the White House prostrated both parents with  
grief, but it was devastating for Mary Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long period of mourning she began to shop again, this  
time for clothing and adornments for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was said that she purchased no fewer than 400 pairs of  
gloves in a three-month period,'' Donald writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln tried to relax as much as the Civil War would permit,  
playing with his children, reading them stories. But it ``seemed 
never to hit the tired spot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the letters are notes from the Lincoln's oldest son,  
Robert, who sounds decidedly ambivalent about his father's 
political success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ain't you beginning to get a little tired of this constant  
uproar?'' he asks his parents shortly after the 1860 election. 
</P>
<P>
	But day by day, the uproar continued until finally, on April 2,  
1865, Lincoln, with the army at City Point, Va., sent this news to 
his wife: 
</P>
<P>
	``At 4:30 p.m. today General (Ulysses) Grant telegraphs that he  
has Petersburg (Va.) completely enveloped from river below to river 
above, and has captured, since he started last Wednesday, about 
12,000 prisoners and 50 guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then it was Friday, April 14, 1865, the war finally over.  
Relaxation could be accomplished with a clear conscience, including 
an evening at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary put on a pretty bonnet and a small patterned blue dress  
and he got ready by brushing his hair with his hand and picking up 
his silk hat,'' Donald writes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arm in arm they went out the door of the White House for the  
last time together.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Victims Mourned in Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- Wails for the dead filled a Muslim  
gathering place Sunday evening as relatives of those feared killed 
in the crash of an EgyptAir plane shared their grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so tragic that we cannot express the sorrow,'' said  
Hisham Elzanaty of Searingtown, whose parents, Abdu and Fawqia 
Elzanaty, were on Flight 990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life will never be the same without my parents,'' Elzanaty  
said. ``We spent last night together until one in the morning. They 
prayed for us and we wished them a safe flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elzanaty was joined by his brother, Tarec, at the prayer service  
at the Islamic Center of Long Island. They said their parents, a 
contractor and a housewife from Cairo, had been visiting them for 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The imam of the modern, green-domed mosque, Sheik Ahmed  
Deweidar, read from the Koran and recited a prayer for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadida Farid, the sister of Flight 990 pilot Ahmed el-Habashy,  
sat draped in black, holding a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have family pictures,'' she said, tears streaming down her  
face. ``That is all I have left. This is so horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jetliner plunged into the ocean off Nantucket Island early  
Sunday carrying 217 people bound from Los Angeles and New York to 
Cairo. Searchers held out little hope of finding survivors in the 
chilly Atlantic waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Talaat Abdalmoneim, an intensive care doctor at Long Island  
College in Brooklyn, also apparently lost his parents in the crash. 
He cried uncontrollably through most of the prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdalmoneim's wife, Gihan, said the couple had driven her  
husband's parents, Abdel-Rahman Amin, the owner of a 
coffee-roasting factory, and his wife, Alia Abdou, to the airport 
at about 9 p.m., only to find out the flight was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	They then drove the older couple home for coffee and tea, then  
back to the airport just in time to catch the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assumed they wouldn't make it on the flight and would go  
another day, but they said 'no,''' Mrs. Abdalmoneim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The older couple had hoped to reach Cairo in time for the birth  
of their 11th grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Mayoral Candidates Step Up Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The two men hoping to be Philadelphia's next  
mayor are stepping up efforts to reach as many voters as possible 
in the final days before the too-close-to-call contest goes to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The paths of Sam Katz and John F. Street crossed briefly on  
Sunday morning outside the Bright Hope Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was attending a service with fellow Democrat, Detroit  
Mayor Dennis Archer. Archer urged voters in Philadelphia, where 
Democrats outnumber Republicans 4-to-1, to stick with their party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are more sensitive to people's needs,'' Archer said,  
adding that the notion of the Republican Party as ``compassionate 
and conservative doesn't hold any water whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have Katz and Street running neck-and-neck.  
</P>
<P>
	Street, trying to become Philadelphia's first GOP mayor in more  
than 50 years, made appearances at five churches Sunday. He was 
joined later by Washington, D.C., Mayor Anthony Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Street said he felt confident of a victory Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was Ed Rendell's partner in saving this city from the brink  
of financial disaster, reducing taxes, improving city services,'' 
Street said. ``I have the track record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The popular Rendell is barred from seeking a third consecutive  
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz also expressed confidence, saying he was ``poised for a  
great victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people in the city have decided, as we have encouraged  
them to, to look beyond partisan politics,'' Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message for improving public schools, improving quality of  
life in the neighborhoods, increasing safety, lowering tax and 
regulations in order to create jobs, is a message that resonates.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidate Trails Baltimore Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- David Tufaro has an uphill climb his campaign  
to become this city's mayor -- he is a Republican candidate in an 
overwhelmingly Democratic city, and polls show him trailing his 
rival by double-digit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tufaro spent Sunday campaigning outside a shopping center,  
trying to whittle away at the support for Democrat Martin O'Malley 
by attacking O'Malley's main campaign theme -- zero tolerance for 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opponent has introduced the term into the campaign; he  
backed away from it, and now he says it doesn't matter what you 
call it,'' Tufaro said. ``I think the voters are tired of 
politicians who feed you lines and do differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zero tolerance has been the winning formula for O'Malley, who  
for years as a city councilman has championed its success in New 
York and other cities at reducing crime and advocated its 
implementation in crime-ridden Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley, who is white, took 53 percent of the vote in the  
Democratic primary, beating two black opponents. A poll released 
last week showed he was supported by 87 percent of those surveyed 
in the predominantly black city where Democrats outnumber 
Republicans 9-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very busy trying to talk to as many voters as we can.  
We're excited, and we can't wait until Tuesday so we can get in 
there and start doing the job,'' O'Malley said before addressing 
the congregation at Southern Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the zero-tolerance issue has proved a thorny one for  
O'Malley. Critics say zero-tolerance policing, in which all crimes 
no matter how small are aggressively enforced, will encourage 
police brutality against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tufaro advocates community policing with a focus on violent  
offenders. A lawyer and real estate developer, he has campaigned on 
community policing and developing neighborhoods outside the city's 
popular Inner Harbor tourist area. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Tufaro campaign stop, several voters said they were  
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbie Davis, a lifelong Democrat who is black, said jobs were  
more important than crime for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jobs first, then crime. It's irrelevant right now,'' Davis  
said of the discussion over zero-tolerance policing.

                        *By THOMAS J. SHEERAN    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Four white ninth-graders accused of making  
plans for a racially motivated rampage at their predominantly black 
high school pleaded innocent on Sunday and were sent back to a 
juvenile lockup. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, one 14 and the rest 15, were accompanied by their  
parents and arraigned separately before Cuyahoga County Juvenile 
Court Magistrate Dick Walsh in closed hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	They allegedly planned to set off bombs and open fire on  
classmates at noon last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings were in a room on the ground floor of the Cuyahoga  
County Detention Center. The four will continue to be held there. 
</P>
<P>
	They were kept out of sight from the public. Reporters were  
allowed to see the hearing room, but were ushered outside the 
building before the arraignments began. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Zukerman, an attorney representing one boy, emerged from  
the arraignments upset that the names and photos of the boys have 
appeared in print and on television. Juvenile court proceedings, by 
law, are confidential in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The identities of the juveniles are supposed to remain  
confidential,'' Zukerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bailey said after the arraignment for his stepson, Adam  
Gruber, that the boy is well-behaved, respectful and would never 
get involved in violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's dealing with it the way any 14-year-old boy would,'' he  
said. ``He's fairly high-spirited and his feelings are hurt not 
being at home. This is his family. He's got a lot of brothers and 
sisters that love him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adam was charged because his name was on a school map, with  
shooting locations marked, that was seized from another suspect, 
Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son was not caught with a map. He was not caught with a  
firearm. He was not caught with bomb-making materials,'' Bailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a school map marked with shooting locations and  
comments reported by classmates convinced them that the threat was 
real. Two weapons were found at one boy's home during a series of 
police searches on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was never carried out at South High School, which was  
closed Friday as a precaution. Classes will resume Monday under

	The boys felt alienated and at least part of their motive was  
race, said Mayor Michael R. White. South High is 70 percent black.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Just Do More Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Americans would just do more exercise, they  
wouldn't have to worry so much about how much weight they carry, a 
leading researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Being unfit and being fat bring independent risks of dying  
early, so a fat person can reduce some of the risk simply by 
exercising regularly, said Steven N. Blair of The Cooper Institute 
for Aerobics Research, Dallas. In this scenario, weight loss could 
be considered a separate benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a public health problem, data from this report indicate  
that low fitness is perhaps the most important for obese 
individuals,'' Blair said. ``The low-fit men were just as likely to 
die as men who'd had a heart attack, a stroke, or some other form 
of cardiovascular disease,'' Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and his colleagues looked at data on 25,174 men who were  
followed for an average of 10 years. All were given exercise tests 
to determine their fitness. Thirteen percent were obese, 46 percent 
were overweight, and 41 percent had normal weight. About 50 percent 
of the obese men had low fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in a recent issue of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men with low fitness had 2.3 times the risk of dying  
compared with obese men who were not unfit. In contrast, obese men 
who started the study with cardiovascular disease had 2.4 times the 
risk of dying, compared with similar men who started the study 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men who had high cholesterol had a 70 percent greater risk  
of dying than did similar men without high cholesterol. Obese men 
with diabetes or who were current smokers had 50 percent greater 
risks, and obese men with high blood pressure had a 10 percent 
greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I, with my biases, was a little surprised to see that low  
fitness was actually a stronger predictor of mortality than was 
diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or current 
smoking,'' said Blair, a longtime proponent of the health value of 
regular physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	And because low fitness is far more common than, for instance,  
diabetes, physical activity could have an even greater importance 
in saving lives, Blair said. Up to 44 percent of deaths among the 
obese could have been prevented by exercise, compared with 9 
percent of deaths if diabetes had been prevented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Blair, America's preoccupation with the bathroom mirror and  
scale is misplaced. ``For many of us, no amount of dieting or 
exercise will make us have the physique of models and movie 
stars,'' he said. ``It's an unattainable goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing weight can be a good thing, Blair said. But fat people  
can improve their health by exercising, even if they don't become 
thin -- and exercise is an attainable goal, he said. ``Thirty years 
ago, I was short, fat and bald,'' he said. ``Today, I am short, fat 
and bald. But I have run 100,000 kilometers (62,500 miles) in the 
last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's advice to doctors is to check their obese patients'  
exercise habits as scrupulously as they check for signs of high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The article on exercise appeared in a JAMA theme issue that  
focused on obesity. Also in the issue was a report by the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which found that obesity 
had risen from 12 percent of adults in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 
1998. CDC researchers characterized this as an obesity epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report, led by researchers at St Luke's-Roosevelt  
Hospital Center in New York City, estimated deaths attributable to 
obesity at around 280,000 or more a year. Obesity has been linked 
to conditions ranging from heart disease to diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Obesity and lack of exercise can be considered independent risk  
factors for an early death, said researcher David B. Allison of St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. So, although Blair is correct in 
pointing out that exercise is good, losing weight is also good -- 
and doing both may be best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most things in human life, including death, are  
multifactorial,'' Allison said. ``It's quite clear to me that 
obesity is a contributing factor. I also believe, from my reading 
of Steve's other papers, that fitness is a contributing factor. But 
I don't see these as exclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fat people should look for the risk-reduction method that works  
for them, said Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard Medical School, 
who is president of the North American Association for the Study of 
Obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behavior science teaches us that success is what we believe  
in,'' Blackburn said. If a person believes in the value of diet, 
then diet is the method to try -- a person who wants to rely on 
exercise should exercise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a combination of some vigorous exercise and some  
dieting may work best, Blackburn said. ``Just 200 less calories a 
day would be 20 pounds lighter over a year,'' he said. ``Half you 
could cut back (in eating) and the other half you could burn in 
exercise.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Asks for Puerto Rican Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Speaking in both Spanish and  
English, presidential candidate George W. Bush asked for the 
support of Puerto Ricans in a videotaped message to the island's 
small Republican Party on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As residents of a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Ricans cannot cast  
ballots in next year's presidential election, but they can vote in 
party primaries and conventions. They also raise funds for 
candidates and are seen as important judges of a candidate's appeal 
among Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think of Puerto Rico as Bush territory, but I am  
taking nothing for granted in this election,'' Bush said in the 
message to party members meeting for the island's local party 
convention in Guaynabo, a suburb of San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, slipping into Spanish, Bush said: ``I want your vote. With  
your support, together we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's message comes while some local Republicans worry that  
Puerto Rican protests against the U.S. Navy here may jeopardize 
their efforts to make the island the 51st U.S. state. The Puerto 
Rican government has demanded the Navy leave its training ground on 
the territory's island of Vieques following recent accidents there. 
</P>
<P>
	Training on Vieques was halted after a civilian guard on the  
range was killed in a bombing accident April 19. The Navy says it 
must resume training soon, however, to prepare the USS Eisenhower 
battle group before it begins a six-month deployment overseas in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech at the convention, former Gov. Luis A. Ferre urged  
fellow Republicans to make U.S. statehood the main issue during the 
campaign and to downplay the Vieques conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put aside all those other things and concentrate on  
everything that will carry us toward statehood,'' Ferre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not comment on the Vieques dispute or U.S. statehood in  
his message Sunday, and he gave few details of his platform. But he 
emphasized his desire to better divide the fruits of a booming U.S. 
economy, saying, ``The purpose of prosperity is to leave no one 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, the Republican Party is dominated by  
pro-statehooders, while the much larger Democratic Party is divided 
between pro-statehooders and people who favor the current 
commonwealth arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello, who favors statehood, is a member of the  
presidential campaign staff of Democratic candidate Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley,  
visited the island in August and sided with the pro-commonwealth 
faction.

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir plane with 214 people on board crashed  
at sea off the island of Nantucket early Sunday on a flight from 
New York to Egypt, and bodies and wreckage were found in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, plummeted from radar screens  
while heading to Cairo on a flight that originated in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris was found about 60 miles south of Nantucket, Coast Guard  
Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said at a midmorning news conference 
in Boston. He said the operation was still considered a search and 
rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the  
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small 
parts that are not identifiable,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one body had been found by late morning, said Robert  
Kelly, aviation director for Port Authority, which runs New York's 
Kennedy airport, at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim  
Rayan was asked about reports that the Federal Aviation 
Administration had warned his airline about a terrorist threat. He 
said: ``We take all precautions and we have plenty of warnings from 
everybody, including the FAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official said at midmorning Sunday that  
agencies were pursuing the possibility of sabotage, but ``There's 
nothing to immediately point toward that.'' Another official said 
there had been no recent threat that seemed relevant to the 
EgyptAir disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan and Larrabee said they had no knowledge of any SOS from  
the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contact with the plane was cut suddenly which indicates that  
something happened suddenly,'' Ibrahim el-Dimeiri, Egypt's minister 
of transport, communications and civil aviation, said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the airline's first fatal crash, Rayan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armed security guards routinely fly on EgyptAir flights. After  
the airline's passengers go through the normal airport security 
check, they are again subjected to baggage search just before they 
board the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 199 passengers on the flight, including two infants,  
plus 15 crew members, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayan said the passengers included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese,  
three Syrians and one Chilean. There was no record of the 
nationality of 131 others, and Rayan said he believed some of those 
were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from New York's Kennedy International  
Airport at 1:19 a.m. EST and disappeared from radar at 2 a.m. while 
flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot Brenner, chief spokesman for the 
FAA in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	An official familiar with air traffic control, who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, said controllers in the Boston Center in 
Nashua, N.H., who were observing the flight but not directly 
controlling it, saw the plane when it was at 33,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The controllers said that during a second radar sweep 12 seconds  
later, the plane had dropped to 26,600 feet, and in a third sweep 
12 seconds later, the plane was at 19,100 feet -- a drop of 13,900 
feet in 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the disappearance, the plane was being controlled  
by the New York Center in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather at Nantucket was clear with 9 miles of visibility and  
wind of 9 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said the search conditions were excellent with 2- to  
3-foot seas, and a water temperature estimated at 59 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy was preparing to send the USS Grapple to the site,  
according to an administration official in Washington. The Grapple, 
based at Little Creek, Va., is a search and rescue vessel that 
participated in the recovery of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane off 
Martha's Vineyard this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11, which crashed off 
Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. Planes 
on that route fly from Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before heading east across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cairo Airport, relatives and friends gathered to await news.  
</P>
<P>
	A Cairo travel agent, Ala Mansour, said he was planning to pick  
up a couple from Montreal due to arrive on the flight. ``This is 
very bad news,'' Mansour said. ``I was just going to the airport to 
meet my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at Kennedy, two families had gathered at an airport hotel,  
said James Devine, a Catholic chaplain at the airport. One family 
was Egyptian and the other American. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really in shock,'' Devine said.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the airline in  
September 1989, said Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy in Seattle. 
Rayan said the plane had 33,334 flight hours and its condition was 
``good'' 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir, founded in 1932 as Misr Airwork, has a fleet of 38  
planes and flies to some 85 airports around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the privatization of the company, one of  
the oldest in Africa and the Middle East, amid reports of bad 
management and bad service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crash comes after the Oct. 19 hijack of an EgyptAir  
flight between Istanbul and Cairo. That hijacking ended peacefully 
in Germany where the hijacker was overpowered; none of the 46 
passengers on board was harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body passenger jet that  
went into passenger use in September 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, a Boeing 767 crashed on May 26, 1991, in Thailand.  
The Lauda Air plane went down after one of its engine thrust 
reversers accidentally deployed during a climb, killing all 10 crew 
and 213 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 crashed near the Comoros  
Islands on Nov. 23, 1996, while attempting to land after being 
hijacked. Ten of the 12 crew members and 117 of the 160 passengers 
were killed. The three hijackers apparently died. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States airline industry had a fatality-free year in  
1998, but this year an American Airlines jet crashed at Little 
Rock, Ark., killing 11 people.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir jetliner with 214 people on board,  
including dozens of U.S. tourists, plunged into the ocean off 
Nantucket Island on Sunday en route from New York to Cairo. 
Searchers found debris and human remains scattered across the sea 
but no sign of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there was no distress call from the pilots  
before the Boeing 767 plummeted from 33,000 feet. Though the FBI 
and other intelligence agencies began checking on the possibility 
of sabotage, President Clinton and other officials said there was 
no immediate indication of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	Two partially inflated life rafts, seat cushions, passports,  
clothing and other small debris consistent with an aircraft crash 
were found by the crew of the Kings Pointer, a vessel operated by 
the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Lewis, chief executive of the Boston-based travel agency  
Grand Circle Corp., said the plane was carrying a group of 54 
people -- all over 50 -- bound for a 14-day drip to Egypt and the 
Nile. He said most of the travelers were from Colorado, Arizona and 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, which started its flight in Los Angeles and stopped  
at Kennedy International Airport in New York, went down about 2 
a.m. EST roughly 60 miles south of Nantucket. The Coast Guard 
deployed ships, reconnaissance planes and helicopters to search an 
area of about 49 square nautical miles, in waters about 270 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
	State-owned EgyptAir, confronted with the worst crash in its  
history, said the passengers included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, 
three Syrians and one Chilean. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in three years that a major search  
operation was launched in the region for a plane lost at sea. The 
series of crashes began with TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in July 
1986, followed by Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia in September 
1998 and the single-engine plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his 
wife and her sister off Martha's Vineyard in July. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan was asked about reports  
that the Federal Aviation Administration had warned EgyptAir of a 
terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take all precautions and we have plenty of warnings from

the airline's passengers go through the normal airport security 
check, they are again subjected to baggage search just before they 
board the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, commenting on the crash after attending church, said  
there was ``no evidence ... at this time'' of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we  
know something,'' said Clinton, who called Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak to offer condolences and U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cairo airport, sobs echoed though a restaurant where  
officials set up an information center for passengers' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	A man in his 60s found a familiar name on the list and collapsed  
into a chair, crying out, ``My son, my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990 took off from New York at 1:19 a.m. and disappeared  
from radar at 2 a.m. while flying at 33,000 feet, said Eliot 
Brenner, chief spokesman for the FAA in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers said the plane then dropped about 14,000 feet over  
the next 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That rate of descent would ``indicate the plane was almost out  
of control,'' said Michael Barr, head of the aviation safety 
program at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather at Nantucket was clear with 9 miles of visibility and  
wind of 9 mph, the National Weather Service said. The Coast Guard 
reported gentle seas and a water temperature of about 59 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane was on a route similar to the one taken by  
Swissair Flight 111, a McDonnell Douglas MD11 which crashed off 
Nova Scotia with 229 people aboard. Planes on that route fly from 
Kennedy to Nantucket, then turn north to Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland before heading east across the Atlantic. 
</P>

	The EgyptAir plane, named Thutmosis II after a pharaoh who ruled  
Egypt around 1450 B.C., was a Boeing 767-300ER delivered to the 
airline in September 1989. The FAA said the plane had 33,354 flight

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ezra Hendrickson scored with 40 seconds  
left as the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the Dallas Burn 2-1 Sunday 
to take a 1-0 lead in their best-of-3 Major League Soccer Western 
Conference final series. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Elliott, inserted with 17 minutes to play, sent a pass to  
Hendrickson, who drove toward the goal on the right wing. His shot 
deflected off Dallas midfielder Brian Haynes and trickled past 
goalkeeper Matt Jordan into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauricio Cienfuegos gave Los Angeles a 1-0 lead in the 39th  
minute when he put a free kick just inside the left goalpost, over 
the head of 5-foot-8 midfielder Oscar Pareja and out of Jordan's 
reach. The Galaxy was awarded the free kick after Jason Kreis 
fouled Roy Myers just to the left of the penalty area, 10 yards 
from the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas tied the score with 15 minutes to play when Ariel  
Graziani moved past two Galaxy defenders to take Paul Broome's 
pass, then put a shot past goalkeeper Kevin Hartman from 10 yards 
out. The goal was Graziani's third in four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles outshot Dallas 16-12, including 6-5 in shots on  
goal. Hartman and Jordan both made four saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 of the series will be played next Sunday in Dallas. A  
third game, if necessary, would be played Nov. 11 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face the winner of the D.C. United-Columbus Crew  
Eastern Conference final in MLS Cup '99 on Nov. 21 at Foxboro, 
Mass.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Boeing 767-300ER </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boeing 767-300ER that crashed Sunday with 217 people aboard  
is one of the company's longest-range aircraft and the type most 
commonly used for trans-Atlantic flights, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767 is a two-aisle, twin-engine aircraft. In the 300ER  
configuration, it can carry up to 218 passengers in a three-class 
cabin and has a range of up to 7,080 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767 is estimated to have carried 813 million passengers on  
more than 3 million flights since it first entered service on Sept. 
8, 1982, according to Boeing. As of April 30, Boeing had delivered 
746 of the airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767-300 program got under way in September 1983. This model  
is longer than earlier versions by over 21 feet and has 20 percent 
more seating capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic 767, at a maximum gross weight of 300,000 pounds, can  
take off on only 5,700 feet of runway.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND HAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- The founder of the Van Kampen mutual  
fund family, the owner one of the world's largest private 
collections of biblical manuscripts, died Friday while awaiting a 
heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert D. Van Kampen of Grand Haven was 60. He had suffered from  
a viral condition that affected his heart, family spokesman Dean 
Tisch told The Grand Rapids Press and The Muskegon Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen died at Loyola University Medical Center in suburban  
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded Van Kampen Merritt, an investment banking firm that  
he sold in 1984 for about $200 million. Today, Van Kampen 
Investments Inc., a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has 
about $190 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen was also a partner in VMS Realty from 1980 to 1992  
and established the Van Kampen Asset Management Company, with 
offices in Grand Haven and Wheaton, Ill. The company oversees a 
number of businesses related to the Van Kampen family. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to southwest Michigan in 1993, building $3.3 million  
mansion on the Lake Michigan dunes in Grand Haven Township and 
founding a church. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, he had turned his attention to writing about  
eschatology, the study of the end of the world, and to his 
collection of biblical manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a godly, gracious man of integrity,'' said Tisch. ``You  
wouldn't think of him as a multimillionaire. He was just a very 
kind, nice man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had begun acquiring rare biblical and ancient manuscripts  
about 17 years ago, after taking possession of a 1537 
English-language Bible stained with the blood of its martyred 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection is stored in Van Kampen's Scriptorium, Center for  
Christian Antiquities, in Grand Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdings also include papyrus and clay tablets, some of which  
date to 2000 B.C., a 4th-century Coptic Bible from Egypt, the book 
of Daniel from the 1455 Gutenberg Bible, Hebrew Torah scrolls and 
translations by 14th-century reformer John Wycliffe, said Bastiaan 
VanElderen, the Scriptorium's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions already have been made for the Scriptorium to remain  
open, Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen also wrote works about the last days before Jesus'  
return. His 1992 book, ``The Sign,'' has sold more than 100,000 
copies. He wrote another book called ``The Rapture Question 
Answered'' and a novel, ``The Fourth Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Judith; daughters Kimberly Van  
Kampen, Kristen Wisen and Karla Van Kampen-Pierre; 11 
grandchildren; a brother, Dr. Warren Van Kampen, and a sister, 
Evelyn Horness. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was scheduled for 2 p.m. Tuesday at The Grace  
Church of West Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Browns 21, Saints 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The new Cleveland Browns' first victory was a  
memorable one, and another shocking loss for the New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, who already had a pair of scoring passes, completed a  
desperation 56-yard touchdown to Kevin Johnson with no time on the 
clock Sunday for a 21-16 victory -- the first for the reborn 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Cleveland team raced on the field to celebrate the  
unlikely win, with Couch pumping both fists and slapping hands with 
fans. The dejected Saints could only walk off the field after 
losing a fourth-quarter lead for the fifth time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns (1-7) got a chance after New Orleans mismanaged the  
clock, calling a timeout with 29 seconds left rather than letting 
time run down. Doug Brien's 46-yard field goal with 21 seconds left 
put the Saints (1-6) up 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
	But Couch, who completed 11 of 19 passes for 193 yards, drove  
the Browns 75 yards on three plays, hitting Johnson in the corner 
of the end zone despite a swarm of Saints defenders around him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second week in a row a desperation pass worked  
against New Orleans. The New York Giants completed a 53-yarder 
against the Saints as the half ran out last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who have led at halftime in three games and carried  
leads into the fourth quarter against Jacksonville and Cincinnati, 
were up 14-13 going into the fourth quarter against New Orleans. An 
opportunity to stretch the lead failed as Phil Dawson's 46-yard 
field-goal attempts fell short early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints coach Mike Ditka took over the play-calling for New  
Orleans against the Browns, unhappy with game plans that he felt 
strayed from his desire to pound the football with Ricky Williams, 
the Heisman Trophy winner he gave up eight draft picks to get. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme was quickly apparent. Williams -- who had his second  
100-yard day as a pro, rushing for 179 yards on 40 carries -- 
carried the football for 11 of the Saints 17 first-quarter plays, 
and 22 of 47 in the first half. He also fumbled the ball away twice 
to keep the Browns in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' special teams provided the game's first break. David  
Dunn caught a punt on the Browns 15, only to have Saints linebacker 
Vinson Smith immediately level him, knocking the football loose. 
Rob Kelly grabbed the fumble, and four plays later Billy Joe Hobert 
hit Keith Poole for a 5-yard touchdown and a 7-0 first-quarter 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit sidelined Dunn for the rest of the game with a mild  
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, Cleveland tied the game after defensive  
end Roy Barker intercepted a pass from Hobert and returned it to 
the New Orleans 22. Fullback Marc Edwards outjumped Saints 
cornerback Alex Molden to catch a 27-yard touchdown pass, making it 
7-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert, who made his first start since Oct. 10, re-injured a  
bruised nerve in his neck trying to make a tackle after the 
interception and left the game. Billy Joe Tolliver replaced him, 
completing 9 of 20 passes for 92 yards. Tolliver and Hobert were 
each intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
	Brien, who missed a 47-yard field goal attempt in the second  
quarter, kicked a 49-yarder on third-and-3 with 13 seconds left in 
the half to give New Orleans a 10-7 lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland went up 14-10 in the third quarter as Couch hit  
Johnson for a 24-yard score. Brien's 22-yarder in the fourth 
quarter cut Cleveland's lead to 14-13.

<HEADLINE> Relatives Wait, Worry in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In one corner of the makeshift information  
center, a man collapsed into a chair, wailing, ``My son, my son.'' 
One woman was already planning a funeral for her sister. One man 
stood at the airport window, staring at the planes and crying his 
son's name: ``Ahmed, Ahmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was replayed over and over Sunday at Cairo  
International Airport, where friends and loved ones of the 217 
people who disappeared that morning into the Atlantic waited for 
word. Some were too terrified to even check the manifest of 
EgyptAir Flight 990. Others demanded information that didn't yet 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, I want to know if he's dead or still alive,'' begged  
Sobhi Mohammed, whose brother-in-law was on the plane. ``If he's 
dead, then I know that it is the end of his life. But the officials 
tell me they don't know if he's dead or alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and nurses milled about at Terminal One, treating those  
who had fainted upon hearing the news that the plane had vanished 
off the coast of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir officials set up a table in a terminal restaurant with  
passenger and crew manifests and told waiting families that there 
could still be survivors from the crash, but many refused to 
entertain hope. Some collapsed. One man was given an injection. 
Others demanded proof. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's not him, maybe it's someone with a similar name,''  
cried Samiha Ismail, who came to ask about her brother-in-law. When 
she heard that his name was on the list, she collapsed, wailing. 
``My dear brother, my dear sister. I can't believe this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 199 passengers included 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three  
Syrians and one Chilean. EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan 
said he believed many of the remaining passengers were American, 
although definite nationalities were unconfirmed. Among those 
aboard were two infants. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, Rayan increased the number aboard from 214 to 217.  
An aide to Rayan said that included three crew members not 
previously counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's Middle East News Agency carried a statement from  
President Hosni Mubarak in which he expressed his ``deepest sadness 
and greatest condolences to all the families of the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walid Basil said his cousin could have been on the plane, but he  
didn't want to check the list because he didn't want to know. He 
was waiting to see if his cousin was on an incoming SwissAir flight 
before checking the list. 
</P>
<P>
	One man, who was told that his cousin's name was on the  
passenger manifest, started yelling profanities in Arabic about 
EgyptAir. ``I want to see it with my own eyes,'' he shouted, 
referring to the passenger manifest. 
</P>
<P>
	The man staring out the window had collapsed upon finding a  
familiar name on the list. ``My son, my son,'' he cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Suhair Hathout was subdued amid the shouting and wailing. She  
was expecting her sister and brother-in-law, who live in Ohio. ``I 
just came here to collect them. Now it looks like I'm going to 
arrange for a funeral,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red-eyed airline stewards waited for news about their  
colleagues. Many were grasping at any sign of hope, including an 
early rumor started by the airport office of EgyptAir that the 
plane had made an unscheduled landing in London.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Teens Plead Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Four teen-age boys pleaded innocent Sunday to  
charges of plotting to set off bombs and open fire on their high 
school classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys -- a white 14-year-old and three white 15-year-olds --  
were arrested Friday in what was described as a racially motivated 
plan to carry out an attack at predominantly black South High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they recovered two guns from a student's house.  
</P>
<P>
	The youths were charged with two counts of inciting violence and  
one count each of false alarm, aggravated menacing-ethnic 
intimidation and inducing panic. Each charge is punishable by 
juvenile detention until age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile Court Magistrate Dick Walsh ordered the four held at  
the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge is 
assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Detention Center Administrator Len Munks said a judge likely  
would be assigned within several days, and then a preliminary 
hearing will be scheduled. The judge will then revisit the question 
of releasing the boys before trial, Munks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South High School students were accompanied by their parents  
and were represented by counsel during the closed-door hearings, 
Munks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents and lawyers declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White closed the school on Friday after the  
parents of a student tipped off authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	South High is to open Monday with police officers in the school  
and hand-held detectors scanning students. The building will be 
searched before students arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Jedd, 15, a friend of the boys, said they laughed about  
how Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher 
before killing themselves last spring at Columbine High School in 
Colorado.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines, Pilots Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Pilots and American Airlines have  
agreed to end a dispute that led to a pilot sickout and the 
cancellation of hundreds of flights earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reached Saturday between the airline and the Allied  
Pilots Association comes nearly a year after American acquired a 
controlling stake in Reno Air and two months after integrating the 
smaller airline's operations into its own. 
</P>
<P>
	American spokesman Mark Slitt said on Sunday the agreement is  
``very similar'' to a compromise proposed by a mediator in July. 
The pilot's union modified the proposal and the airline rejected 
the union's changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the two parties had been at a stalemate  
until last week's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute erupted over differences in how to absorb the  
lower-paid Reno Air pilots into the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, American will increase the number of pilots  
who cannot be furloughed by 300 -- matching the number of Reno Air 
pilots who joined American -- and give the Reno Air pilots a 
45-percent pay raise, retroactive to March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute peaked in February with an 11-day pilot sickout that  
inconvenienced more than 600,000 travelers and cost American $225 
million. The union was ordered by a federal judge to reimburse 
American $45.5 million for ignoring a court order to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots President Rich LaVoy said Saturday that all but  
one of the issues related to the Reno Air pilots' integration had 
been resolved. That issue -- determining the date on which American 
gained control of Reno Air for labor relations purposes -- will be 
decided after hearings Nov. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also agreed to begin negotiations on a two-year  
contract extension for the Fort Worth-based carrier's nearly 10,000 
pilots. The current contract expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased,'' American spokeswoman Andrea Rader said.  
``We see this as a positive step forward in fixing the relations 
between American and its pilots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides refused to comment on whether a deal was struck on  
the $45.5 million fine. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Thursday 
quote unnamed sources familiar with the discussions as saying the 
agreement could lead to American erasing the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Slitt said strained relations with the pilots was just one of  
several problems that have plagued American this year and hurt 
customers' perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having harmony and a good relationship with the pilots is  
going to be an important element'' to rebuilding the airline's 
image, Slitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 1, an American jetliner crashed while landing during a  
storm in Little Rock, Ark., killing 11 people. Fatigue is suspected 
of being a factor. The co-pilot had been on duty more than 13 hours 
the day of the crash, within the 14-hour duty period in American's 
pilot contract. 
</P>
<P>
	American also has been sued by the Justice Department, which  
accuses the airline of predatory pricing to drive competitors out 
of routes in the Midwest. Since April, at least eight class-action 
lawsuits have been filed against American charging monopoly 
practices.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Hear Frisking Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- William Wardlow spotted the unmarked police car  
and took off running -- down a passageway and half a block more 
before pursuing officers caught him. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Timothy Nolan frisked the convicted felon, found a  
.38-caliber handgun he was carrying and slapped on the cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, the case against Wardlow, 45, is before the  
U.S. Supreme Court, the center of a debate over individual rights 
and police power. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is to hear arguments Tuesday on whether officers were  
right to frisk Wardlow merely because he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in Illinois and nine other states have said fleeing at  
the sight of an officer does not create enough suspicion to warrant 
such a stop. Judges in seven other states have said that it does. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardlow was arrested Sept. 9, 1995, after fleeing an elite  
police unit sent into his tough neighborhood to break up criminal 
activity. While the police car was unmarked, no one disputes that 
Wardlow knew he was fleeing police. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction for illegal possession of a weapon by a felon was  
thrown out in 1997 by the Illinois Appellate Court, which said that 
fleeing police did not always create the telltale sign of criminal 
activity justifying a pat-down search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court upheld that decision last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court will settle the  
issue once and for all has focused national attention on the 
Wardlow case. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Chiefs of Police and the  
National Sheriff's Association have filed friend-of-the-court 
briefs supporting Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine, who 
will argue before the Supreme Court that Wardlow's conviction 
should be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our view that when there's unprovoked flight from a  
clearly identifiable police officer,'' Devine says, ``police should 
be able to make a reasonable stop and inquire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say frisking an individual merely because he  
ran from the police would erode the freedom of movement guaranteed 
by the Fourth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense  
and Educational Fund have joined Wardlow attorney James Koch in 
arguing that Illinois appeals judges rightly threw out the 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of reasons why people, whatever their reasons,  
don't want to wait around and talk to police,'' Koch says. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardlow was arrested in Chicago's violent Harrison police  
district. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the area west of downtown, unemployed men stare  
blankly from cracked and peeling porches, cocaine dealers peer 
furtively from alleys. In August alone, the district had nine 
killings, four arsons, 117 robberies, 273 assaults and 79 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardlow at times went by his brother's name of Sam Wardlow, and  
was already convicted of burglary when he was found carrying the 
gun. He was released from a state prison in April after serving 18 
months of a three-year drug sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch declined to arrange an interview, saying his client is  
``getting his life together.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Freeh Praised Starr in Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A few days after Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr left his post, FBI Director Louis Freeh sent him a letter 
praising his work and his personal integrity, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have always respected the truth and have never engaged in  
any misleading or evasive conduct or practice,'' Freeh wrote, 
Newsweek magazine reports in its Nov. 8. ``Your objective has 
always been the promotion of justice and the safeguarding of the 
judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh's letter never mentioned President Clinton. Starr stepped  
down on Oct. 18 and was replaced by one of his assistants, Robert

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Detroit 4, OT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Chris Pronger scored with 34.4 seconds left in  
regulation and set up Pavol Demitra's game-winner 56 seconds into 
overtime in St. Louis' 5-4 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues led 3-2 entering the final period, but Steve Yzerman  
and Nicklas Lidstrom scored 2:19 apart late in the third to give 
Detroit a 4-3 lead. With under a minute to go, Pronger, who had 
four points in the game, rushed the net and tipped home a pass from 
Pierre Turgeon to send the game to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first shift of the extra session, Pronger slid a pass  
between Lidstrom and Larry Murphy to send Demitra in alone on 
Detroit goalie Ken Wregget. Demitra made a move and put a 
backhander under Wregget for his fifth goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Lapointe and Steve Duchesne had the other goals for  
Detroit. After losing just once in its first nine games, Detroit 
has dropped two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis has won five in a row at Kiel Center, but Yzerman  
threatened that streak when he intercepted Turgeon's clearing pass 
in the left faceoff circle and beat Blues goalie Roman Turek with a 
wrist shot to tie the game at 13:37 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over two minutes later, Lapointe kept the puck in the  
Blues' zone and found Lidstrom open at the left point. Lidstrom's 
slap shot eluded Turek to give Detroit its first lead.

	Tyson Nash scored his first NHL goal, and Mike Eastwood and  
Turgeon also scored for the Blues. Pronger assisted on the goals by 
Eastwood and Turgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues took a 1-0 lead 3:17 into the game when Nash took a  
pass in stride from Terry Yake and blasted a slap shot at Wregget 
from the top of the left circle. Wregget got a piece of it with his 
glove, but it trickled over the blue line.

	After Lapointe beat Turek with a backhander at 8:58 to tie the  
game, St. Louis took the lead again with four minutes left in the 
first on Eastwood's second goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon scored a power-play goal off a rebound to give the Blues  
a two-goal lead at 5:33 of the second. But Duchesne got the Red 
Wings back in the game 3:41 later when he put a shot from the top 
of the right circle between Turek's pads to make it 3-2.

<HEADLINE> Public Purse Wins Burke Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- In his U.S. debut, Public Purse, with  
Alex Solis aboard, followed the leaders until the stretch to win 
the $150,000 Carleton F. Burke Handicap by 1 1/2 lengths on turf 
Sunday at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old was shipped from France one week ago after  
winning 5 of 10 European starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know what to expect with him just coming off the  
plane,'' Solis said. ``He's got such a nice, long stride. You're 
going to see a lot more of him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's stablemate, Star Performance, with Corey Nakatani,  
finished second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of Achilles and David Flores, 
in a field of eight 3-year-olds and up. Blue Sky and Rate Cut were 
late scratches. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Purse, the 7-5 favorite, paid $4.80, $3.40 and $2.60,  
taking home a $90,000 purse. The son of Private Account has 
earnings totaling $324,276 and six wins in 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Performance returned $4.80 and $3.20 and Achilles paid  
$2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Purse, carrying high weight of 119 pounds, covered 1 1/2  
miles over a firm course in 2:25 4-5. He saved ground in third 
place and came out a bit on the backstretch, going three deep out 
on the final turn before pulling clear with urging by Solis.

<HEADLINE> Irish Pull Out Last-Second Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Maybe the Irish had Tennessee on their  
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they figured with a winning streak against Navy that dated  
back to 1963, win No. 36 was just a matter of going through the 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, Notre Dame (5-3) had to pull out yet  
another last-minute win Saturday, beating Navy 28-24 on Jarious 
Jackson's 16-yard touchdown pass to Jay Johnson with 36 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got no excuses. We just didn't play well,'' coach Bob  
Davie said Sunday. ``We got discombobulated in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, that's what you call it when you are flagged 13  
times for 130 yards, the most by a Notre Dame team in 38 years. In 
addition to a plethora of holding calls, the Irish also were 
penalized for two personal fouls in the space of three plays during 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some personal foul penalties that were a sign of  
frustration, but that game is behind us and I don't think we should 
put any more concern into what happened,'' Davie said. ``I don't 
think that game Saturday will have a whole lot of bearing on what 
will happen next Saturday (against Tennessee).'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed like the Irish were doing everything they could to  
give Navy (2-6) its first win against Notre Dame since Roger 
Staubach was the Midshipmen's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Oliver recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown to tie the  
game at 14 and Davede Alexander returned a Jackson interception 20 
yards to give Navy a 21-14 lead in the third quarter -- half of 
Navy's points coming off Irish mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the game,'' Johnson said. ``I guess that's all that  
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win put the Irish back into the Top 25 for this week. Notre  
Dame is ranked 24th in the weekly poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Last-minute comebacks are becoming the norm for the Irish. The  
four-game winning streak they take to Tennessee next week includes 
coming back from 16 points down to beat Oklahoma and overcoming a 
21-point deficit to win against Southern California. It's the fifth 
time this season Notre Dame has had a game decided on a last-minute 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' said Jackson, who was 15-of-33 for  
200 yards with two touchdown throws and two interceptions. ``We do 
come out and play to the level of who we compete against. I even 
noticed that today. We have to learn we have to come out and set a 
tempo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish finally looked like themselves on their final drive  
after Tim Shubzda kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Navy a 24-21 
lead with 5:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame converted two straight third-down situations to begin  
the drive, and Bobby Brown came up with one of the biggest catches 
of his year on fourth-and-10 with 1:20 left. He hauled in a pass 
from Jackson short of the first down and fought his way to the 
marker at the 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was about six inches short of the sticks,'' Navy  
coach Charlie Weatherbie said. ``I thought there was no way he made 
it. We'd get the ball back and take a knee because they were out of 
timeouts. I felt like the game was over at that time. It's a game 
of inches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown just made it, and after yet another third down  
conversion and two dropped passes in the flat, Jackson threw a 
floater to Johnson -- on third down, no less -- to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players, 'I don't want you take the approach we  
were lucky to win or we didn't deserve to win, kind of hanging you 
head and embarrassed,''' said Davie, who's team outgained Navy 
524-317. ``We just won a football game. Never take that for 
granted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- A Delta Air Lines Boeing 767 heading  
for New York was forced to return to Brussels International Airport 
Sunday after developing engine trouble. The plane landed safely 
with no injuries, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was a similar model to the EgyptAir Boeing 767 which  
disappeared earlier Sunday shortly after leaving New York for 
Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Brussels Airport officials said Delta Flight 141 to New York  
returned to Brussels around 12:15 p.m., about 45 minutes after 
taking off for New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. There were 170 
passengers on board, said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flight landed safely,'' said Jean-Pierre Huybrechts, a  
Delta official at Brussels airport. ``There was a problem with one 
of engines and the plane came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to give more details.  
</P>

	Airport emergency services were put on alert, but were not  
needed.

<HEADLINE> Tribute to Stewart on Final Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The spirit of Payne Stewart was all over  
Champions Golf Club on Sunday in final round of the Tour 
Championship. So were his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the players who wore knickers in the final round as a  
tribute to Stewart, none looked as eerily similar to the U.S. Open 
champion as Stuart Appleby -- and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar build. Same waistline. Same shoe size.  
</P>
<P>
	Same clothes.  
</P>
<P>
	Appleby got permission from Tracey Stewart on Thursday night to  
wear her husband's clothes in the final round. He and Ian 
Baker-Finch toured the massive closet and picked out a traditional 
Scottish outfit, complete with a tartan of the Stewart clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like walking in his shoes for the one day,'' Appleby  
said. ``I felt like him for one day, even though my swing wasn't as 
fluent as his and I didn't putt as good. At times you try to 
imagine being him, and it feels weird. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be him, I can only look like him. That's as good as I  
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby did it better than anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	From 30 yards away, it looked like Stewart on the driving range  
when Appleby stood over the ball. And as he walked down a row of 
autograph-seekers at the end of his round, from behind the 
similarities were downright spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby wasn't the only one in knickers.  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman ordered the knee-length pants for everyone who felt  
comfortable wearing them. Justin Leonard needed a pin in the back 
to keep his on. Chris Perry's left pants leg came undone as he 
walked down the sixth fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was always the most recognizable player from two  
fairways away because of his clothes, and the Tour Championship 
looked like it had a bunch of Stewart lookalikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was against it at the beginning,'' Davis Love III said. ``I  
didn't think we should put pressure on guys to do something they 
didn't want to do. If half the guys did it and half the guys 
didn't, then they would feel bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I told Tom Lehman when we got out there, `This just feels  
right.' The fans are going to enjoy it. We will always remember 
this tournament. You can pick out this event on the highlights from 
now on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson said the idea allowed players to have some fun in  
what has been an emotionally charged week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I looked down and saw these socks, I thought of  
him,'' Mickelson said. ``I thought a lot about him this week. We 
all have, and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Appleby, picking out a color scheme was no small task.  
</P>
<P>
	He was at the Stewart's house Thursday night with about two  
dozen other people when he stepped into the closet and saw enough 
outfits to clothe the whole field for the entire week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one thing I wore on my body today that was mine,  
and you're not looking at it,'' Appleby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only piece of Stewart's outfit that didn't quite fit was the  
tam o'shanter cap, which Appleby said was a little snug. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got less hair than me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like every other player in the Tour Championship, Appleby was  
glad to get the week behind them. Wearing the knickers only drove 
home what kind of a hole his death in a plane crash on Monday left 
on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I miss Payne Stewart being different,'' Appleby said. ``I'm  
going to miss his passion for the game. From a personal side, his 
family will miss him greatly. They aren't going to make any more 
memories with him, but the memories he left are great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week was tough. It didn't feel like a prestigious week at  
all, and that's the way it should have been.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tour Group Was on EgyptAir Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nearly a quarter of the 217 people on the EgyptAir  
jetliner that crashed were part of a group set to tour Egypt and 
the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Circle Corp., headquartered in Boston, said 54 people --  
all over the age of 50 -- had signed on for the 14-day trip and 
``all indications'' were they were on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Most came from Colorado, Arizona and the Pacific Northwest.  
</P>
<P>
	The company specializes in travel for senior citizens, leading  
more than 50,000 older Americans on trips each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 990, en route from New York to Cairo, went down off the  
Nantucket coast early Sunday morning. There were no signs of 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Circle did not release a list of its passengers in the  
hours after the plane disappeared. It was unclear if any company 
tour guides were on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of  
all of these passengers,'' company chairman Alan Lewis said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Circle offers at least 18 trips around the world, from the  
Yangtze River in China to the Danube River in Eastern Europe. 
Promotional material describes the tours as ``unique experiences 
for seasoned travelers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just dream of where you'd like to travel, and explore the  
possibilities with us,'' the company writes on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egypt package includes five nights in Cairo, plus a  
seven-night round-trip cruise of the Nile, from Luxor to Aswan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invite you to explore 7,000 years of continuous  
civilization on an exclusive odyssey,'' the Web site says. ``You'll 
behold the Pyramids, stand inside massive temples, gaze upon 
timeless landscapes and touch the very waters Cleopatra once 
sailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the company was calling relatives of passengers and  
offering free transportation and hotel accommodations in New York, 
where the tour group had a team of people to provide support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sole mission at this time is on assisting them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. 9-0, but Far From Perfect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Despite its perfect record, Penn State is  
far from flawless. 
</P>
<P>
	Each week, there seems to be a new struggle for the  
second-ranked Nittany Lions (9-0, 5-0 Big Ten). Sometimes it's the 
opponents. Sometimes it's the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it's just them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we're not in synch. I just think we're making  
some really dumb mistakes we shouldn't be,'' fullback Mike Cerimele 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Saturday's 27-7 victory over Illinois (4-4, 1-4 Big Ten).  
The offense muddled through the first 2 1/2 quarters as Kevin Thompson 
threw three interceptions and Penn State got to the Illinois 36 or 
better four times without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	On another trip inside the Illinois 30, the Nittany Lions had to  
settle for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is, but we can't get things rolling right  
away,'' tight end Tony Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense started sluggish, too, allowing only its second  
touchdown in the first quarter this season on Rockey Harvey's 
34-yard run. By the end of the first quarter, Harvey had 75 yards 
rushing -- 10 more than the Nittany Lions had given up in their 
three previous games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions also lost 65 yards on seven penalties, seven more than  
coach Joe Paterno finds tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that if we could just keep this going, that we  
could pull it out,'' said cornerback Tony Francis, who had two 
interceptions. ``But during the second half, every time we would 
get momentum, Penn State would take it right back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the thing about the Lions: They always manage to come out  
on top. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense started the turnaround. After allowing 113 yards in  
the first quarter, they allowed just five in the second. Yes, 
that's right, five. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say this is the most dominating performance of the  
season,'' defensive end Justin Kurpeikis said of the last three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Illini quarterback Kurt Kittner seemed to get hit just about  
every time he got the ball, with defensive end Courtney Brown 
leading the sack parade. Brown had four sacks, tying a Penn State 
record. His 32 career sacks top the previous record of 30 set by 
Larry Kubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions finished with a total of seven sacks and numerous  
hurries. They also intercepted backup Kirk Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penn State is as good a defensive team as we have ever seen,''  
Illinois coach Ron Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the defense holding strong, the offense found its footing  
when Paterno replaced Thompson with Rashard Casey. Coming in with 
about four minutes left in the third quarter, Casey moved the Lions 
to the Illinois 16 with a 27-yard pass to tight end John Gilmore. 
On the next play, he got Illinois linebacker Danny Clark on a pump 
fake and then lobbed a touchdown pass to Stewart for the 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini went three-and-out on their next possession, thanks  
to a 9-yard sack from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went over and told the defense, `You've got to hold them one  
more time so we can get the ball with the wind,''' Paterno said. 
``That's exactly what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the ball at the Illinois 34, Casey made a run that will be  
showing up on highlight reels the rest of his career. After taking 
the hand off and seeing there wasn't anything open, he spun 360 
degrees not once, but twice, and then took off. 
</P>
<P>
	He zigged and zagged upfield, eluding at least five Illinois  
defenders along the way. He even pushed one of his own teammates 
out of the way before crossing the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``My teammates just started laughing and said, `How do you do  
that?''' Casey said of the reaction when he got back to the 
sidelines. ``I don't know. I've got to wait and see the film myself 
to see what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How it happened doesn't really matter. All that matters is that  
it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if we win by 51 or 1,'' linebacker Brandon Short  
said. ``A win is a good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good. Just not perfect.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Says Campaign Gaining Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said  
Sunday his Democratic presidential campaign is gaining steam 
because he refuses to attack rival Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, knocking on doors and mingling in back yards, said  
voters have grown weary of negative assaults, and are likely to 
punish candidates running that kind of campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's where the American people are today,'' said  
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	While the vice president has held a lead in national polling,  
Bradley has narrowed the gap in key states like Iowa and New 
Hampshire and has made the race competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has responded by becoming more aggressive in his criticism  
of Bradley, who made it clear he won't respond. He said he wants, 
instead ``to project a positive vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been working,'' insisted Bradley.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bradley went door-knocking in a tree-lined  
middle-class neighborhood, mingling with residents preparing for 
Halloween festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a good amount of (door-knocking) running for  
president,'' said Bradley. ``It's a way of paying respect. If you 
do it with some, you are doing it for all. If you never do it then 
you aren't paying that type of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the Democratic Party's establishment in Gore's  
camp, Bradley was seeking support among college liberals from 
nearby Iowa State University using issues like his call for 
expanded health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides were quick to point out that the 50 people who gathered in  
a back yard Sunday to hear him speak are not traditional party 
activists, but newcomers to the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some signs that Bradley insistence on avoiding verbal  
fighting with Gore was getting some support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much appreciate your efforts to keep the campaign  
civil,'' said Michael Mendelson, who answered one of the doors 
Bradley knocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to narrowing the gap in some of the polling, Bradley  
has made himself competitive with the vice president financially, 
raising enough money to keep the contest going deep into the 
primary calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider this a joyous journey,'' said Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Moore Killed in Marlboro 500 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By MIKE HARRIS    	
</P>
<P>
                       *AP Motorsports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Moore was killed Sunday in the  
season-ending CART race when he lost control of his car at 220 mph 
and crashed into a wall, spinning wildly and slamming into the 
ground several times. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Canadian, a budding star in the open-wheel  
circuit, was airlifted to a hospital and declared dead of massive 
head injuries about an hour after the wreck at California Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost missed the race after he hurt his hand when a car hit  
him Saturday while he was riding a scooter in the paddock area. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was the second driver in the CART FedEx Series to die this  
year. Rookie Gonzalo Rodriguez of Uruguay, preparing for only his 
second race, was killed instantly in a crash Sept. 11 during 
practice at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Rodriguez was the first driver fatality in the  
CART series since Jeff Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a race 
in Toronto in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Hearn crashed coming off turn two on lap four of Sunday's  
Marlboro 500, bringing out the first caution flag. He was not 
injured and the green flag was waved again for the start of lap 10 
in the 250-lap event. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore lost control of his car coming off turn two on that lap in  
virtually the same spot. Television replays showed the 
Reynard-Mercedes skidded onto the infield grass, became airborne 
and crashed hard into a retaining wall, with Moore apparently 
striking his head on the concrete. The car then broke into pieces, 
with the open-cockpit driver's compartment spinning and hitting the 
ground several times before coming to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was declared dead at Loma Linda Medical Center after  
resuscitation efforts failed, said Dr. Steve Olvey, director of 
medical affairs for CART. 
</P>
<P>
	The race continued, but CART chief steward Wally Dallenbach  
canceled post-race celebrations and the flags at the speedway were 
immediately lowered to half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Fernandez went on to win the race but broke into tears  
when told of Moore's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hard. Greg was such a good friend of ours,'' Fernandez  
said. ``We've been racing for a while and shared so many good 
moments on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy for all of us. the win doesn't matter  
anything. My heart goes out to his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, president and CEO of CART, said the sanctioning  
body and its major sponsors initially decided to cancel the awards 
banquet scheduled Monday night in Los Angeles, but decided to go 
ahead with it after Moore's family asked them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I am going to make some major changes in the  
program,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's father, stepmother and girlfriend were at the track when  
the wreck occurred. They were at the hospital when he was declared 
dead and departed immediately for their homes in Maple Ridge, 
British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was extremely popular in home country and province.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tragic death of Greg Moore has left a hole for all of  
those who knew him and the millions more who watched this hometown 
hero as he brought racing to a whole new generation of motorsports 
fans,'' said Stuart Ballantyne, the Vancouver Molson Indy general 
manager and a close friend Moore's family. ``In every way , Greg 
was a winner both on and off the track, contributing countless 
hours to local charities and other worthwhile causes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Moore broke a finger, badly cut his right hand and  
bruised his right hip when his scooter was hit by a car in the 
paddock area. He was cleared to drive after a six-lap test on the 
two-mile oval late Saturday, starting the race last in the 27-car 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Olvey said Moore's injured hand was examined again Sunday  
morning and that it was unlikely it had anything to do with the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 72nd start in Moore's CART FedEx Series career. He  
had five victories, including the season-opening race in Homestead, 
Fla., this season, and was the runner-up in last year's Marlboro 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who drove for Player's Forsythe Racing for all four  
seasons in CART, was to move to Team Penske next year.

<HEADLINE> Churches End Salvation Dispute Protestant Reformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *By KATHARINE A. SCHMIDT 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	AUGSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Putting aside five centuries of  
differences in theology, Roman Catholic and Lutheran church leaders 
embraced at a service Sunday where they signed a declaration ending 
a dispute over salvation that sparked the Protestant Reformation 
and led to the Thirty Years War. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700 guests at Augsburg's Lutheran Church of St. Anna's and  
more than 2,000 observers in a tent nearby watched, applauded and 
hugged each other as officials from the two bodies stated that both 
churches believe the salvation of individual Christians is 
``justified'' by God's love alone, not by human efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican, Pope John Paul II welcomed the signing as a  
``milestone along a difficult path full of joy, union, and 
communion among Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Augsburg service, Bishop Christian Krause, president  
of the Lutheran World Federation, also spoke of the agreement's 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in centuries we are walking on common  
ground together,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Luther set in motion the Protestant Reformation on the  
same date 482 years ago, when he nailed his 95 theses to the door 
of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, protesting the practice of 
selling indulgences to help believers gain forgiveness for their 
sins. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centered on the question of how to get to heaven.  
Catholics believe that people's actions can make a difference, 
while Lutherans believe salvation is based on faith alone. After 30 
years of consultation among theologians, the two sides announced in 
June that they would sign the agreement to unite their beliefs on 
justification. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement doesn't mean any immediate institutional change  
for the two churches. And as participants noted Sunday, there are 
still fundamental areas where the two sides disagree, such as over 
the Eucharist and the interpretation of the bread and wine used in 
Holy Communion. 
</P>
<P>
	But leaders hailed the progress that had been made as a sign of  
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer service and signing ceremony Sunday included  
representatives of two dozen countries. There were cardinals with 
purple-sashed black robes, Lutheran pastors with ruffled collars 
and women in the traditional clothing of their homes in Nigeria, 
Norway and India. 
</P>
<P>
	After prayers and songs of repentance at Augsburg's Baroque  
Roman Catholic cathedral, participants in the service sang hymns 
during a half mile procession to St. Anna's. Along the way they 
passed near the spot where Protestant theologians in 1530 read 
aloud the document that serves as the basis of their church. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents and others who could not get into the church  
sang and joined in prayers from a tent set up in front of City 
Hall, watching the ceremony on a large video screen. The service 
was held in English and German, with prayers also offered in 
Finnish, Portuguese, Italian and French, and a Bible reading in 
Hausa, a language spoken in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the church and in the tent, observers broke into applause  
as the Rev. Ishmael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World 
Federation, and Bishop Walter Kasper, secretary of the Vatican's 
Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, hugged each other 
tightly after signing the declaration. The clapping intensified as 
a half-dozen other religious leaders added their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``That moment, when they hugged, I was close to tears,'' said  
Gisela Rambach, 44, a housewife who watched the proceedings from 
the tent with her husband and two children. Rambach, a Catholic, is 
married to a Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joseph Donnella, chaplain at Gettysburg College in  
Pennsylvania, also was among those watching the service from the 
tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really incredible, the joy in everyone around us,'' he  
said. ``To hear us saying our Baptismal vows together, and then to 
see the last signature -- it's done.''

<HEADLINE> Ind. Vote Focuses on Fluoridation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONNERSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Conspiracy theories are flying, teeth  
are decaying and a part-time magician is gulping down toothpaste to 
make a point. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to make an outsider think there's something in the  
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the issue gripping this eastern Indiana city on the  
eve of Tuesday's election is what's not in the water: fluoride. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentists desire it, a group of safe water activists fear it and  
City Council candidates in Tuesday's election wish the subject 
would just disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Connersville, population 15,550, is the largest city in Indiana  
without fluoridated water, and studies show it has a 20 percent 
higher rate of cavities than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do they have more cavities, but it advances at such a  
fast rate, it's a real problem,'' says John Roberts, a local 
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, two previous fluoridation campaigns have been drilled  
to defeat. And as elections near, dentists and concerned citizens 
insist reluctant candidates take a stand on fluoridation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a smoke-filled barber shop, outgoing Councilman Virgle Carey  
sits amid a group of men shouting their ``expert'' opinions on 
fluoridation. Carey just shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the No. 1 issue around here,'' he says, chuckling. ``I'm  
sure glad I won't have to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Hendershott and the opposition group Citizens for Safe  
Water say the introduction of fluoride into public water systems is 
a government conspiracy, a public relations ploy that has duped 
Americans into believing it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The group claimes corporations and the U.S. government are  
disposing of toxic waste by slowly diluting it into drinking water 
and calling it fluoride, and the more than 200 million Americans 
who drink fluoridated water are losing brain cells and developing 
brittle bones with each gulp. 
</P>
<P>
	During a public meeting on the issue, Rusty Ammerman -- a  
fluoride supporter and traveling magician -- consumed an entire tube 
of fluoride toothpaste just to prove it wouldn't kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-fluoride faction claimed the magician used some sleight  
of hand to switch to a tube of non-fluoridated paste. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my travels I see all different kinds, and you realize  
that each town has its issue,'' Ammerman says. ``But it's so 
embarrassing to think that places like Nimrod, Minn., have fluoride 
and we don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fluoridating water systems began in 1945, when the city of Grand  
Rapids, Mich., agreed to be a test site. An 11-year study found the 
cavity rate among Grand Rapids children dropped by more than 60 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
described fluoridation as one of the century's most significant 
advances in public health. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hendershott isn't convinced. She claims national  
organizations supporting fluoridation receive corporate kickbacks. 
Nothing has been proven. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more they talk, the better we sound,'' Roberts says of the  
anti-fluoride front. ``I don't know anything that's been researched 
more thoroughly than fluoridation. And it's never been found to 
cause any of the problems they claim.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. St., Penn. St. Lead AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When 20 of the top 25 teams win, with two idle, there's not much  
chance of change in The Associated Press' Top 25 college football 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	For the seventh consecutive week, Florida State and Penn State  
were 1-2 in the AP poll Sunday, with Virginia Tech a solid No. 3

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Favored in Big 10 Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michigan State is the preseason favorite to win a  
third straight Big Ten men's basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But the selection might need an asterisk since most of the votes  
were cast before All-American guard Mateen Cleaves had a stress 
fracture in his right foot. Cleaves had surgery last Monday and 
will miss eight to 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility Cleaves could play before Christmas, but  
he likely won't return until the start of the Big Ten season. The 
Spartans open the Big Ten season Jan. 5 against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State went 33-5 last season, including 15-1 in the Big  
Ten. It won both the Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles, 
and advanced to the Final Four for the first time in 20 years. The 
Spartans lost to Duke in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, the Big Ten's second Final Four team last season,  
was picked to finish second in the conference by both the coaches 
and the media. The Buckeyes produced one of the biggest turnarounds 
in college basketball last season, going 27-9 after finishing with 
a 8-22 record the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois was third in both polls. Purdue and Indiana were chosen  
to finish fourth and fifth by the coaches. The media only picked 
the top three teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves and Ohio State point guard Scoonie Penn led the  
preseason all-conference teams, with Penn the coaches' choice for 
player of the year and Cleaves getting the media vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn and teammate Michael Redd were unanimous selections on the  
coaches' preseason all-conference team. Joining them were Cleaves, 
Michigan State's Morris Peterson and Indiana's A.J. Guyton. On the 
media team, it was Cleaves, Penn, Redd, Peterson and Illinois' Cory 
Bradford.

<HEADLINE> Orange Co. Fault Said To Be Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE,Calif. (AP) -- A newly discovered fault beneath the  
coastal section of Orange County could generate a bigger earthquake 
than previously believed, according to a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-mile blind thrust fault, which runs from Huntington Beach  
to Dana Point, was discovered in March. At that time, researchers 
estimated that it could generate a magnitude-7.0 earthquake every 
2,500 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers now believe the fault could cause a  
magnitude-7.3 earthquake, according to a study published in 
November's ``Geology'' magazine, which hit the news stands last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault appears to be similar to the blind thrust fault system  
that caused the 1994 Northridge quake, which struck with a 
magnitude-6.7, killing 72 people and causing an estimated $40 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind thrust faults produce quakes when one side pushes upward  
but does not break the surface. Others, like the San Andreas fault, 
are strike-slip systems that generate quakes when one side moves 
horizontally against the other.

<HEADLINE> Will E-Commerce Be Able To Deliver? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- If you buy it, will it come?  
</P>
<P>
	Amid an expected explosion of online shopping this holiday  
season, thousands of companies have readied themselves to take our 
money for everything from books and records to clothes and cars, 
but will they be able to deliver the goods? 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say many companies are not doing much more than keeping  
their fingers crossed. And even those who have invested millions in 
order ``fulfillment'' systems could be stymied by simple human 
error, a recent experience with ordering online found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delivering the goods is going to be a huge problem for some  
companies,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan, media e-commerce analyst at 
International Data Corp. ``I don't know what to predict, but it 
seems pretty clear some commerce sites will not be prepared for the 
crush of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Internet shopping sites went to work right after the  
Christmas season ended last year to prepare for this year's 
holidays, when research firm Jupiter Communications predicts online 
sales will top $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, online companies learned it's easy to offer an item,  
but quite a bit harder to keep it in stock, locate it, label it 
correctly and track it from warehouse to doorstep within a given 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest, who are expected to process 60,000 transactions  
daily, invested millions in building distribution centers around 
the country to shorten the time it takes for a package to get to a 
particular destination. Others are turning to new services being 
offered by FDX Corp.'s FedEx and United Parcel Service of America 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx and UPS have taken over the unglamorous but all-important  
back-end processing and shipping for many smaller companies and are 
incorporating sophisticated tracking information on clients' Web 
sites that keep customers updated on the progress of their 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also have opened up millions of square feet of  
warehouse space around the country to assemble and store goods for 
larger clients such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer in a bid 
to ensure speedy delivery. FedEx and UPS already have high-tech 
tracking systems in place, allowing them to easily expand into 
partnerships with other companies to move goods more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, UPS' mission was delivering goods for our  
customers. Now it's become something more, although it's the same 
fulfillment idea that we've been about all along,'' said UPS 
spokesman Steven Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the U.S. Postal Service hopes to become more of a player in  
the online shipping game. In addition to a joint advertising 
campaign with Internet bookseller Amazon.com, the agency is 
spending millions of dollars to advertise its Priority Mail two- 
and three-day delivery service, betting that few people are willing 
to pay more simply to get an item overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high for companies trying to choose the right  
delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey last week by market research firm NPD Group found that  
two-thirds of all Internet users plan to buy at least one item 
online this shopping season. But nearly three-quarters of online 
shoppers say they won't shop the same merchant again if there is a 
problem, according to a recent study by Bizrate.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online, if you screw up with a customer once, you've probably  
lost them,'' Maclachlan noted. ``Location, location, location 
doesn't matter anymore because the next guy around the corner is 
just one click away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even with millions of investments in high-tech systems, the  
very low-tech problem of human error could play a pivotal role this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the holiday buying crush kicked off, orders for  
items from two popular Web sites -- Yahoo! and Priceline.com -- 
brought decidedly mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	An offer for a cross-country round-trip ticket from Priceline,  
the Internet travel company that allows consumers to name their 
price, was accepted, resulting in a savings of several hundred 
dollars. The credit card was debited and the ticket delivered by 
FedEx from Stamford, Conn., within the time promised. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Sony minidisc player/recorder ordered from a New York  
company called AAAPrice.com through Yahoo!'s shopping service was 
misdelivered by UPS despite having the correct mailing label. (Note 
to consumers: experience has found deliveries often are delayed if 
an item has no suite or apartment number.) 
</P>
<P>
	Only after repeated phone calls, several of which provided  
incorrect information about tracking down the package, was the item 
delivered three days later than promised. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS did not offer to refund the delivery charge and only issued  
an e-mail apology after the customer sent them a complaining 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	To AAAPrice.com's credit, however, the vendor offered to send an  
immediate replacement and phoned UPS and the customer several times 
to make sure the package finally had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commerce sites must now focus on ... preparing crisis plans  
for addressing issues that their company might face during an 
outage or product delivery problem,'' said David Schatsky, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications. The company warned recently 
that many sites will be unprepared for demand that is expected to 
increase elevenfold in the next four years.

<HEADLINE> Spurrier At Ease After Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida couldn't muster a single  
passing yard in the second half. Normally, that's a time for Steve 
Spurrier's visor to start flying and his backup quarterback to 
enter the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Spurrier was oddly at ease.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a defense that wouldn't bend, the complete lack of a  
passing game was nothing more than a statistical oddity Saturday. 
Spurrier left the field on his players' shoulders following one of 
the most significant victories of his coaching career, a 30-14 
triumph over No. 14 Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first coach this century to win 100 games in his  
first 10 years at a school. More importantly, the victory put the 
No. 5 Gators (7-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) in command of the 
SEC East. 
</P>
<P>
	Wins over Vanderbilt and South Carolina in the next two weeks  
will send Florida back to the SEC title game for the first time 
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not big on individual things,'' said Spurrier, who  
improved to 9-1 against the Bulldogs as Florida's coach. ``It puts 
us in a position to get to the SEC game. We have a chance for 
another championship. That's the important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike previous years in Florida's decade of SEC dominance, the  
Gators seemed more adept at playing championship-style defense than 
the Fun 'N Gun offense that staked them to so many successes. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rain falling and the offenses stalling at ``The World's  
Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,'' defensive lineman Alex Brown had 
2 1/2 sacks to go with a forced fumble and interception that sealed 
the victory for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Brown's heroics, Keith Kelsey forced a Georgia fumble  
deep in Florida territory with the Bulldogs trailing 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second half, it was like, `The rings are on the  
table,''' Brown said. ``It was just up to us. We knew if they 
didn't score, they couldn't win. And they couldn't score. We were 
on our heals and the game is all about making big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the defense was coming up big, the offense was struggling  
for every yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Johnson was held to just two completions in the second  
half, one for 10 yards, the other for minus-10. All week, Spurrier 
said he would have no compunction benching Johnson for backup Jesse 
Palmer. But with a wet ball, a soaked field and a Georgia defense 
that seemed as unwilling to budge as Florida's, Spurrier knew it 
was not his quarterback's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug played very well in the first half,'' Spurrier said.  
``The second half, it was not only him. He threw one or two bad 
balls, but at no point were we thinking we needed to make a 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Often argumentative with his coach, Johnson seemed to learn a  
lesson or two from Spurrier's threats. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, he was as oddly at peace with himself as his  
coach was. It seemed as though the lessons of two difficult seasons 
without a title were finally starting to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Spurrier just wanted to make me realize that he's the  
coach and he knows more than anybody,'' Johnson said. ``He's right. 
That's what I did tonight. We had a lot better communication. 
There's a reason he's won 100 games in 10 years.''

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Hayride Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ODENVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl was killed and another  
youth injured when an actor on a Halloween hayride, who was 
supposed to fire a pistol loaded with blanks, instead fired a shot 
at riders, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tawyna Key of Ashville died of a gunshot wound to the head about  
two hours after the Friday night shooting on the Horror Woods 
hayride in rural St. Clair County. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Urbahns, 8, was listed in critical condition at a  
Birmingham hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett Allmon, 22, of Springville, was charged with reckless  
murder Saturday in connection with the shooting. Police said he 
likely didn't mean to hurt anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He realizes he made bad judgment,'' said St. Clair County  
Sheriff Terry Surles. ``We've never had a problem (with him).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allmon was playing the role of a gravedigger on the hayride  
route. The scenario included his turning toward the roughly 10 
riders and firing a pistol into the air, said Surles. The sheriff 
didn't know why live ammunition was in the clip. 
</P>
<P>
	Odenville is about 25 miles northeast of Birmingham.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Crash Prompts Twin Probes Into Atlantic Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By GLEN JOHNSON 	
</P>
<P>
            *Associated Press Writer Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators tried Sunday to determine if a  
sudden mechanical failure or possibly terrorism caused an EgyptAir 
jetliner to plunge rapidly -- nearly 300 feet per second -- from six 
miles high and crash into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI worked  
side-by-side with help from the Federal Aviation Administration and 
the Boeing Co., which made the 767 that crashed off Nantucket, 
Mass., with 217 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	All were trying to digest an array of evidence that included  
radar tapes showing that the plane plummeted from an altitude of 
33,000 feet down to 19,100 feet in 36 seconds, before at least some 
part of it continued to remain visible for nearly another minute 
and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put the initial descent rate at about 23,200 feet per  
minute, about two to three times a standard emergency descent rate. 
The continuing images and slower descent rate after 19,100 feet 
could indicate an in-flight breakup, with smaller pieces drifting 
down at a slower rate, investigators suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that air traffic controllers were able to monitor the  
transponder signal for part of the descent indicated the plane 
continued to have electrical power at least during the first part 
of the rapid descent, aviation experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials said there was no  
immediate evidence of terrorism, but that was being investigated as 
a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB chairman, Jim Hall, refused to say if the radar tapes  
showed an aircraft in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know at this point what caused the crash,'' Hall  
told reporters. ``We are beginning what may be a long 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the mix was a recent travel alert from the FAA saying  
someone had warned a bomb would be placed on a flight originating 
from Los Angeles or New York, and word that a passenger got off the 
EgyptAir flight when it landed at New York's John F. Kennedy 
airport en route from Los Angeles to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the passenger, Ed McLaughlin, works for a company  
that helps airlines notify family members of air accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole question is what does the radar tape show,'' said  
Michael Barr, director of the aviation safety program at the 
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a whole blip and it doesn't show any break-up at  
33,000 feet, it could be an incident with a loss of 
pressurization,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, a pilot might push to nose down and  
race to get below 12,000 feet, where the air is safe to breathe. 
But such a precipitous drop would risk breaking the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are multiple hits coming down from 33,000 feet, that  
would indicate an in-flight breakup and another range of 
possibilities,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sept. 24 ``information circular'' obtained by The  
Associated Press, the FAA said several U.S. agencies received 
letters in August warning ``that a bomb or explosive device with 
`spiral expansion' would soon be used on a flight departing from 
either Los Angeles airport or New York's JFK airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alert had been in effect until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	EgyptAir Flight 990 departed Los Angeles on Saturday and stopped  
at Kennedy International, bound for Cairo. The plane took off from 
JFK at 1:19 a.m. Sunday en route to Cairo and disappeared from 
radar screens about 40 minutes later, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Cairo, the head of EgyptAir, Mohammed  
Fahim Rayan, said he had no information of any direct threat 
against his airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the person who made the claim cited in the FAA memo was in prison 
and they had no information that the warning was related. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said that the EgyptAir flight was cruising at 33,000 feet  
when it began to descend about 1:50 a.m. Sunday. About 36 seconds 
later, it was at 19,100 feet. He said ``reflections'' were seen on 
radar screens until 1:52 a.m., almost 90 seconds more. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, an aviation analyst and veteran airline captain,  
said that if controllers knew the plane's altitude as it went down, 
it would indicate the jet still had partial electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
	While radar locates a target in the sky, controllers do not know  
the identity of the blip or its altitude without information 
broadcast from the airplane's transponder. 
</P>
<P>
	That broadcast can only be made with the help of electricity  
supplied by the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of electricity might also help the investigation,  
because it would likely mean that the electric-powered flight data 
recorder and cockpit voice recorder continued operating after the 
initial plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly what that means I don't know, but it is an entirely  
different situation from TWA (Flight 800) and Pan Am 103, which had 
breakups and an immediate loss of power,'' Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TWA plane blew up off Long Island in July 1996, killing all  
230 aboard. Investigators believe the plane's nearly empty center 
fuel tank exploded. Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December 1988, killing all 270 board. Investigators 
concluded that the plane was brought down by a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	One other source for the investigation is the plane's production  
and maintenance history. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a French Internet site that tracks Boeing's  
production line, the EpyptAir 767 came off the assembly line 
immediately before a Lauda Air 767 that crashed over Thailand in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The EgyptAir plane, tail number SU-GAP, made its first flight on  
Sept. 15, 1989, and was delivered on Sept. 26, 1989, said the site, 
decollage.org. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauda Air plane made its first flight Sept. 26, 1989 and was  
delivered Oct. 16, 1989. It crashed in May 1991 after one of its 
engine thrust reversers accidentally deployed during a climb, 
killing all 10 crew and 213 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokewoman Barbara Murphy refused to comment on the  
plane's production history, citing the pending crash investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A crash uniting the FBI and the NTSB was reminiscent of the TWA  
explosion, when the two worked side-by-side. The FBI eventually 
ruled that the crash did not involve a criminal act, but not before 
both sides reported a strain in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, they have pledged better cooperation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see another parallel investigation for  
a while,'' said Barr, the USC teacher. ``The FBI will stay involved 
until they can be fairly certain that it wasn't a criminal event.''

<HEADLINE> Vols Send S.C. Down the Chute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- South Carolina coach Lou Holtz quickly  
ran through his comments about the game, then turned to what 
probably was the high point of his day at Neyland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could go on, but I think I've covered everything but the  
parachutists,'' he said after No. 4 Tennessee (6-1, 4-1 
Southeastern Conference) beat the Gamecocks 30-7 Saturday, 
extending the nation's longest losing streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight U.S. Army parachutists dropped to midfield before the  
game, and the suspense dropped off considerably not long afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played like the game was against an 0-8 team sandwiched  
between Alabama and Notre Dame,'' Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer 
said, referring to Tennessee's previous and next opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play with the intensity we need, but you can't be  
disappointed in winning a game by 23 points. So I'm pleased, but 
not satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols did most of their damage with big plays on offense and  
a defense that smothered the Gamecocks (0-9, 0-7 SEC). 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a frustrating game,'' Vols quarterback Tee Martin said.  
``We'd have a two-play drive for a touchdown, then go 
three-and-out. We couldn't get our rhythm going, but we made some 
big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamal Lewis gained 146 yards, including a 70-yard touchdown.  
Onterrio Smith and Donte' Stallworth turned short screen passes 
into long gains, leading the Vols offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They throw a 2-yard pass and can be explosive,'' Holtz said.  
``We gave up more big plays than I've seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols drove 63 yards for a touchdown with the opening  
possession and were never seriously threatened thereafter. South 
Carolina's only points came on a 24-yard touchdown pass from Mikal 
Goodman to Ben Fleming with 36 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great people make big plays. That's what they did today,''  
Holtz said. ``I thought we did a good job of containing Tee Martin, 
but it was disappointing to give up the big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin finished 11-for-23 attempts for 216 yards and a touchdown  
with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedrick Wilson, his favorite receiver, was hurt on the Vols'  
second series and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallworth had four catches for 130 yards. He was stopped inside  
the 1 on the 71-yard screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to dive at the end but fell flat on my face,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee lost two fumbles, threw an interception and was  
penalized nine times. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' 70-yard TD run early in the second quarter made the score  
14-0. It was the longest run of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most push I've seen all year from the offensive  
line,'' Lewis said. ``The fullback got the linebacker and I just 
saw daylight and ran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two field goals by Alex Walls put the Vols ahead 20-0 at the  
half and another field goal in the third quarter made it 23-0. 
Tennessee closed its scoring with Phillip Crosby's short run after 
the long pass to Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, which came into the game with the least  
productive offense among the 114 Division I-A teams at 223 yards a 
game, gained 225. All but 67 yards came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did rush for 144 yards, but gave up 41 yards in sacks'' and  
lost-yardage plays, Holtz said. ``I thought we would control the 
line of scrimmage a little better on offense.''

<P>
	On a day of close calls, No. 1 Florida State and No. 2 Penn  
State started slowly but finished strong enough to keep perfect 
seasons going. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, though, winning by any means is all that matters  
if the Seminoles and Nittany Lions want to play for a national 
championship in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Seminoles sputtered in the first half at Virginia  
on Saturday night, then broke open the game with a four-touchdown 
second half -- one on Chris Weinke's 50-yard scoring pass to Peter 
Warrick -- for a 35-10 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scares me, but as long as they end up like they ended up, I  
can survive, I guess,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said after 
the Seminoles moved to 9-0 and 7-0 in the ACC. ``It's funny. You 
look at the score and you say, `Yeah, boy, they're number one.' But 
gosh, you look at the first half and you say `Gee, I don't know 
whether they are number one or not.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At Champaign, Ill., the Nittany Lions (9-0, 5-0 Big Ten) led  
pesky Illinois by three points late in the third period, but 
Rashard Casey replaced Kevin Thompson and within 69 seconds he had 
a TD pass and a TD run and Penn State won going away, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'W' is all that matters. I don't care if we win by 51 or  
1,'' Lions linebacker Brandon Short, who had 13 tackles, said. ``A 
win is a good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for the Seminoles and Nittany Lions, who also are 1-2  
in the Bowl Championship Series standings, which decides who plays 
in New Orleans for a national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (7-0, 3-0 Big East), third in the polls and BCS  
standings, didn't have it all that easy either in beating 
Pittsburgh 30-17. The Hokies' top-ranked defense sacked David 
Priestley eight times, but he also threw for 407 yards as Pitt 
outscored Tech in the second half, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we did give him kind of a beating,'' Tech coach Frank  
Beamer said. ``But he gave us a beating, too. We feel like there is 
a lot for us to look at and learn from and improve on the rest of 
the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some other Top 25 teams were just plain lucky in victory.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bobby Newcombe returned a punt 86 yards for a TD and then  
caught a 49-yard scoring pass from Eric Crouch with 3:24 left to 
give No. 9 Nebraska (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) a 24-17 come-from-behind road 
win over Kansas (3-6, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kris Stockton's 18-yard field goal as time expired lifted No.  
11 Texas (7-2, 4-1 Big 12) to a 44-41 victory against upstart Iowa 
State (4-4, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hayden Epstein kicked a 20-yard field goal with 18 seconds  
left to give No. 16 Michigan (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) a 34-31 win over 
Indiana (4-5, 3-3) at Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
	The 24th-ranked Fighting Irish (5-3) extended their NCAA-record  
winning streak over Navy (2-6) to 36 in a row, but needed Jarious 
Jackson's 16-yard TD pass to Jay Johnson with 36 seconds left to 
eke out a 28-24 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three Top 25 teams lost Saturday. Two, Georgia and Southern  
Mississippi were beaten by other ranked teams -- No. 5 Florida 
defeated the 14th-ranked Bulldogs 30-14, No. 12 Alabama beat the 
25th-ranked Golden Eagles 35-14; and Colorado beat former No. 24 
Oklahoma 38-24. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was: No. 4 Tennessee 30, South  
Carolina 7; No. 6 Kansas State 48, Baylor 7; No. 7 Georgia Tech 48, 
North Carolina State 21; No. 10 Wisconsin 35, Northwestern 19; No. 
13 Marshall 41, Northern Illinois 9; No. 15 BYU 27, Air Force 20; 
No. 17 Purdue 33, Minnesota 28; No. 18 East Carolina 19, Houston 3; 
No. 20 Ohio State 41, Iowa 11; No. 21 Texas A&AMP;M 21, Oklahoma State 
3; No. 22 Miami 28, West Virginia 20; and No. 23 Mississippi 42, 
LSU 23. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 8 Mississippi State and No. 19 Michigan State did not play  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 1 Florida State 28, Virginia 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Charlottesville, Va., Chris Weinke shook off three  
interceptions and threw for 297 yards and three TD passes as the 
Seminoles rebounded for the second week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, FSU trailed Clemson 14-3 before winning 17-14. The  
Cavs, who got 164 yards and a TD from Thomas Jones, led 10-7 at the 
half before being shut out in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 2 Penn State 27, Illinois 7    	
</P>
<P>
	The Illini, coming off a huge win over Michigan last week, kept  
it close until Casey threw a 16-yard TD pass to Tony Stewart and 
then danced 24 yards for another score as the Nittany Lions pulled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Brown matched a Penn State record with four sacks.  
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 4 Tennessee 30, South Carolina 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Knoxville, Tenn., Jamal Lewis ran 70 yards for a TD and  
finished with 146 yards as the Vols (6-1, 4-1 SEC) handed the 
Gamecocks (0-9, 0-7) their 19th consecutive loss -- the nation's 
longest major college losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 5 Florida 30, No. 14 Georgia 14    	
</P>
<P>
	At Jacksonville, Fla. Bo Carroll ran 30 yards for a second-half  
TD to give the Gators (7-1, 5-1 SEC) breathing room and the defense 
held the Bulldogs (6-2, 4-2) scoreless over the final 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, coach Steve Spurrier's 100th at Florida, means the  
Gators need wins over Vanderbilt and South Carolina to win the East 
Division and a spot in the league's title game on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
                     *No. 6 Kansas St. 48, Baylor 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Manhattan, Kan., David Allen ran for two TDs and caught a  
scoring pass and the Wildcats (8-0, 5-0 Big 12) held the Bears to 
seven first downs and 119 yards. 
</P>
<P>
               *No. 7 Georgia Tech 48, North Carolina St. 21    	
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, Joe Hamilton threw for 212 yards and three TDs and  
ran for 83 yards as the Yellow Jackets (6-1, 4-1 ACC) won their 
fifth straight.

<HEADLINE> Auto Accessories Show Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Chrome wheels, running boards and spiced-up  
engines used to be the exclusive tools of garage Van Goghs who took 
vehicles from Detroit and transformed them into something unique. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, Detroit is paying more attention to the gizmos  
and gee-gaws customers stick on their vehicles -- and even getting 
into the game themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	That interest will be a big part of the annual mecca for the  
auto accessories industry, the Specialty Equipment Market 
Association's trade show in Las Vegas that begins today. General 
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler and other automakers 
all plan several events to show off their latest wares to some 
80,000 retailers and 6,000 vendors expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Van Cleve, the association's chairman, said much of the  
automakers' attentions can be traced to a growth spurt in the $21 
billion market for customizing products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Detroit has been looking at us like `My gosh, maybe there's  
something here we're missing,''' Van Cleve said. ``I think they're 
realizing the consumer wants his or her vehicle to be a little 
different than the guy or girl next door. And we can manufacture a 
part and change it so much faster than Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market has grown more than 9 percent a year for the past 12  
years, according to association figures. Industry consultant James 
Lang, president of Lang Marketing Resources in Wyckoff, N.J., said 
much of the growth has come due to the shift in consumer tastes 
from cars to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who purchase light trucks have an unending appetite to  
purchase accessories for those vehicles,'' Lang said. ``The least 
expensive vehicle you can buy new is usually a stripped-down truck, 
and they're often bought by younger people who buy these 
accessories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are historical precedents for Detroit's interest in  
popular add-ons. For instance, ``We invented the seat belt and 
rearview mirrors,'' noted Van Cleve. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days manufacturers keep adding on. In August, Ford  
announced the Harley-Davidson F-150 pickup -- a truck decked out 
with Harley-Davidson logos, bigger tires and chrome exhaust tips. 
While a suggested price has not been announced, Lang noted that 
such add-ons are usually high-profit items for automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just cosmetic products that do well. Squeezing more  
power out of engines has always been a big part of car customizers, 
and another area that automakers pay attention to. For the past few 
years, the best sellers have been hot-rod products for small 
Japanese cars, especially the Honda Civic, a favorite among young 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Cleve said the Civic and other Japanese models were often  
``Mom-and-Pop grocery getters'' that were handed down to children, 
who then spruced them up. Lang said today's hot-rodders tend to do 
less complicated engine work than their counterparts in the 1960s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emissions controls and computerization has served as a damper  
on some engine productions,'' Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other goods getting attention from automakers and suppliers  
are high-tech components that aren't quite ready for mass 
production. While a few automakers have proposed installing 
Internet-capable computers in cars, there's already one such device 
on the market -- the Clarion Auto PC, a voice-activated in-dash 
computer/CD player that sells for $1,300.

<HEADLINE> Injury Bug Keeps Biting Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a season gone sour, injuries continue to mount  
like numbers in the loss column for the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	No fewer than seven Broncos limped, staggered or had to be  
assisted to the sideline with injuries in Sunday's 23-20 loss to 
the Minnesota Vikings, which dropped Denver to 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Alfred Williams and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey  
were the most seriously wounded. Williams ruptured his right 
Achilles' tendon, a season- and possibly career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, who left the game in the first quarter after being  
hit in the head but returned in the second half, sprained his left 
knee in the fourth quarter. He was scheduled Monday for an MRI that 
a team official called precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Running backs Olandis Gary and Derek Loville, cornerbacks Ray  
Crockett and Dale Carter and linebacker Al Wilson also were 
sidelined for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Those injuries add to a lengthy casualty list that already  
includes Terrell Davis, last year's NFL MVP who is out for the 
season with a torn knee injury; linebacker John Mobley, out for the 
year with a similar injury, and tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is 
expected to miss about eight games before returning in December 
from a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the backups haven't been immune. Bubby Brister was supposed  
to replace Brian Griese at quarterback after the latter foundered 
in the first four games, but Brister promptly strained an oblique 
muscle and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Loville was slated to replace Davis but came down with a  
strained hamstring, the same injury he aggravated on a 36-yard 
touchdown run in the first quarter on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alfred tore his Achilles' tendon, and he'll be out for the  
rest of the season,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Eddie has 
a sore knee. We're hopeful that it's no worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start making plays, and we have to use the  
personnel that are available to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the rash of injuries and bad breaks is perhaps payback  
for the good fortune the team enjoyed in its two Super Bowl 
championship seasons, Shanahan said, ``I never believed that in the 
past, but I'm starting to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crockett, limping from a hip pointer in the locker room, said,  
``The injuries keep coming. I guess it's just one of those years. 
Usually, in a normal season you have only one guy go down for the 
year. This year, we've had three or four guys. With all the good 
things that have happened to us the last two or three years, these 
are things you don't hope for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray we can keep a group of guys healthy and keep  
going.''

<HEADLINE> Settlers May Have Crossed Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- In a radical new view of pre-history, two  
prominent archeologists say North America's first inhabitants may 
have crossed the icy Atlantic Ocean some 18,000 years ago from 
Europe's Iberian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory, presented at a weekend conference, is at odds with  
the long-held notion that the continent's first settlers came 
across a land bridge from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventional view is the stuff of college entrance exams and  
Far Side cartoons -- wandering cavemen wrapped in animal hides and 
lugging enormous spears, crossing the land bridge from Asia to hunt 
woolly mammoths. 
</P>
<P>
	Archeologists say some nomads almost certainly made their way  
into Alaska and found an ice-free highway down into the continent 
some 13,500 years ago. Their culture has been named Clovis for 
their distinctive weapons that have been found in digs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the new theory, the continent's first  
inhabitants may have crossed the Atlantic more than 18,000 years 
ago from Europe's Iberian Peninsula -- the area that is now Spain, 
Portugal and southwestern France. 
</P>
<P>
	Belonging to a group known as the Solutreans, these pre-modern  
explorers are believed to have originally settled the Eastern 
Seaboard, according to the researchers. Over the next six 
millennia, their hunting and gathering culture may have spread as 
far as the American deserts and Canadian tundra, and perhaps into 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, Dennis Stanford and Bruce Bradley, concede the  
Solutreans may not have been the only paleo-explorers to reach the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	But judging by their distinctive style of projectile points and  
other clues in the archeological record, they may have been the 
first settlers who brought to North America what, until now, has 
been considered the Clovis culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little in Clovis - in fact, nothing - that is  
not found in Solutrea,'' said Stanford, who is anthropology curator 
at the Smithsonian Institution. ``Their blades are virtually 
indistinguishable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and Bradley, an independent researcher from Cortez,  
Colo., offered their stunning reinterpretation of the standard 
settlement theory at an archeology conference in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was devoted to re-examining Clovis research seven  
decades after it was accepted as historical bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists say the Solutrean alternative is such a radical  
departure that it might take years to adequately evaluate. Stanford 
and Bradley's new explanation, they noted, is based primarily on 
comparisons of projectile points and other artifacts already 
discovered on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	No unequivocal Solutrean settlement remains have been found in  
North America, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who believe Clovis and the Bering Sea land-bridge  
theory is outdated point to sites at Monte Verde, Chile as well as 
Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina as being settled in 
12,500 B.C. to 16,000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clovis defenders say many artifacts from those digs are so  
crude that they may be rocks that have broken naturally rather than 
actual stone tools fashioned by prehistoric hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, observers said, the older Solutrean projectile points  
from Europe and the more recent Clovis points from the Americas 
closely resemble each other. That's what makes the new ``Out of 
Iberia'' theory so tantalizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question about it,'' Kent State University  
archeologist Kenneth Tankersley said. ``There are only two places 
in the world and two times that this technology appears - Solutrean 
and Clovis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How seafaring Solutreans could have arrived in North America is  
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on his knowledge of modern native cultures above the  
Arctic Circle, Stanford said it is not farfetched to imagine 
Solutreans sailing to the New World in skin boats. With a strong 
current and favorable weather, the trip might have taken as little 
as three weeks, he calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	By this time in pre-history, he said, South Pacific islanders  
had been sailing open waters for at least 20,000 years.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Speedskating Record Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- A Chinese 3,000-meter relay team set a world  
record at the Short Track Speed Skating World Cup competition on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Yang Yang, Yang Yang, Wang Chunlu and Sun Dandan  
shaved five seconds off the old record of 4:16.260, set by a Korean 
team during the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Canada took 
second and Bulgaria third. 
</P>
<P>
	Korea won the men's 5,000-meter relay in 7:06.355, with Japan  
second at 7:07.890 and Canada third at 7:29.602. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans responded well to a small crowd of flag-waving  
countrymen from Salt Lake City and nearby Brigham Young University, 
winning five of six events contested. 
</P>
<P>
	Dong-Sung Kim, the Olympic gold medalist who is ranked No. 1  
after two World Cup events this year, got things started when he 
put on a late charge to win the 1,000-meter race in 1 minute, 
35.436 seconds. Japan's Satoru Terao was second in 1:35.583 and 
Apolo Ohno of the United States third in 1:36.527. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Jiajun Li, who entered the competition ranked No. 2, was  
disqualified and received a yellow card after he bumped both Ohno 
and Dong-Sung. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Goskowitz, a competitor's steward, said judges issued the  
yellow card because Li was skating recklessly and showed disregard 
for his fellow skaters. The first yellow card serves as a warning. 
A second in any of the four remaining World Cup events would earn 
Li a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Evgenia Radanova of Bulgaria broke the Asian's stranglehold on  
first place in Sunday's events when she won the women's 1,000 
meters in 1:35.038. Min-Kyung Choi of Korea was second in 1:35.389 
with compatriot Hye-Won Park third in 1:35.554. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had two Chinese and two Koreans in my race so I had to try  
something different,'' Radanova said. ``I tried to keep my mind 
(focused) and don't be nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choi and Wang went out quickly, but Radanova and the pack caught  
them by the fifth of nine laps. Radanova then pulled ahead and 
eased to the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Min-Kyung Choi of Korea won the women's 3,000 in 5:17.741, just  
edging Canada's Tania Vicent, whose time was 5:17.971. Radanova was 
third in 5:18.785. 
</P>
<P>
	Dong-Sung stayed back in the pack during most of the men's  
3,000. He staged a late surge to win in 4:54.748, with Terao second 
at 4:55.870 and Li third at 4:56.110. Ohno finished fifth after 
leading the early stages of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was basically the rabbit,'' Ohno said. ``I had to do all the  
work because I needed to protect my standing (fourth in the event). 
That's what burned me out at the end.''

<HEADLINE> Will E-Commerce Be Able To Deliver? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- If you buy it, will it come?  
</P>
<P>
	Amid an expected explosion of online shopping this holiday  
season, thousands of companies have readied themselves to take our 
money for everything from books and records to clothes and cars, 
but will they be able to deliver the goods? 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say many companies are not doing much more than keeping  
their fingers crossed. And even those who have invested millions in 
order ``fulfillment'' systems could be stymied by simple human 
error, a recent experience with ordering online found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delivering the goods is going to be a huge problem for some  
companies,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan, media e-commerce analyst at 
International Data Corp. ``I don't know what to predict, but it 
seems pretty clear some commerce sites will not be prepared for the 
crush of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Internet shopping sites went to work right after the  
Christmas season ended last year to prepare for this year's 
holidays, when research firm Jupiter Communications predicts online 
sales will top $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, online companies learned it's easy to offer an item,  
but quite a bit harder to keep it in stock, locate it, label it 
correctly and track it from warehouse to doorstep within a given 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest, who are expected to process 60,000 transactions  
daily, invested millions in building distribution centers around 
the country to shorten the time it takes for a package to get to a 
particular destination. Others are turning to new services being 
offered by FDX Corp.'s FedEx and United Parcel Service of America 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx and UPS have taken over the unglamorous but all-important  
back-end processing and shipping for many smaller companies and are 
incorporating sophisticated tracking information on clients' Web 
sites that keep customers updated on the progress of their 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also have opened up millions of square feet of  
warehouse space around the country to assemble and store goods for 
larger clients such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer in a bid 
to ensure speedy delivery. FedEx and UPS already have high-tech 
tracking systems in place, allowing them to easily expand into 
partnerships with other companies to move goods more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, UPS' mission was delivering goods for our  
customers. Now it's become something more, although it's the same 
fulfillment idea that we've been about all along,'' said UPS 
spokesman Steven Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the U.S. Postal Service hopes to become more of a player in  
the online shipping game. In addition to a joint advertising 
campaign with Internet bookseller Amazon.com, the agency is 
spending millions of dollars to advertise its Priority Mail two- 
and three-day delivery service, betting that few people are willing 
to pay more simply to get an item overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high for companies trying to choose the right  
delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey last week by market research firm NPD Group found that  
two-thirds of all Internet users plan to buy at least one item 
online this shopping season. But nearly three-quarters of online 
shoppers say they won't shop the same merchant again if there is a 
problem, according to a recent study by Bizrate.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online, if you screw up with a customer once, you've probably  
lost them,'' Maclachlan noted. ``Location, location, location 
doesn't matter anymore because the next guy around the corner is 
just one click away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even with millions of investments in high-tech systems, the  
very low-tech problem of human error could play a pivotal role this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the holiday buying crush kicked off, orders for  
items from two popular Web sites -- Yahoo! and Priceline.com -- 
brought decidedly mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	An offer for a cross-country round-trip ticket from Priceline,  
the Internet travel company that allows consumers to name their 
price, was accepted, resulting in a savings of several hundred 
dollars. The credit card was debited and the ticket delivered by 
FedEx from Stamford, Conn., within the time promised. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Sony minidisc player/recorder ordered from a New York  
company called AAAPrice.com through Yahoo!'s shopping service was 
misdelivered by UPS despite having the correct mailing label. (Note 
to consumers: experience has found deliveries often are delayed if 
an item has no suite or apartment number.) 
</P>
<P>
	Only after repeated phone calls, several of which provided  
incorrect information about tracking down the package, was the item 
delivered three days later than promised. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS did not offer to refund the delivery charge and only issued  
an e-mail apology after the customer sent them a complaining 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	To AAAPrice.com's credit, however, the vendor offered to send an  
immediate replacement and phoned UPS and the customer several times 
to make sure the package finally had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commerce sites must now focus on ... preparing crisis plans  
for addressing issues that their company might face during an 
outage or product delivery problem,'' said David Schatsky, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications. The company warned recently 
that many sites will be unprepared for demand that is expected to 
increase elevenfold in the next four years.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Said To Need $1M for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) -- Moldova needs at least $1 million to  
buy new computers to face potential Y2K-related disruptions, which 
may provoke a major social crisis, an official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The electricity network, the railway and the system for paying  
bills and pensions could be seriously affected by the changeover to 
the year 2000, said Vasile Botezatu, a manager of the government 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Botezatu said Y2K  
problems might also delay pension payments by four to five months 
and throw the country into a social crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	This former Soviet republic has already been shaken over the  
last year by numerous street protests due to budget cuts, unpaid 
salaries and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the year approaching, the government only last  
week alerted major institutions to draw up plans for coping with 
the Y2K phenomenon but warned that the state's resources are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the U.S. State Department authorized the voluntary  
departure of eligible family members and nonessential employees

<HEADLINE> Shepard Trial Tests Defense Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The theory that Aaron McKinney pummeled  
Matthew Shepard because he made a sexual advance goes on trial this 
week as lawyers try to prove McKinney suffered from a diminished 
capacity at the time of the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is on trial for robbery, kidnapping and murder in the  
death of the gay college student. His lawyers are seeking 
conviction on a lesser offense like manslaughter to avoid a 
possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	They have two approaches, both of which are aimed at proving  
that McKinney suffered from a mental disease or defect that 
prevented him from knowingly or purposefully committing murder -- 
the ``diminished capacity'' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	When McKinney's defense gets into full swing Monday, the lawyers  
plan to offer testimony that his mental capacity was diminished by 
drugs and alcohol, an approach that is allowed under Wyoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have combined that approach with the theory that a  
person with latent homosexual tendencies will have an 
uncontrollable, violent reaction when propositioned by a 
homosexual. Some have called this the ``gay panic'' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyers have contended he lost control during a  
drunken, drug-induced rage because a sexual advance by Shepard 
triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the `excuse defense,' and it has never been allowed under  
Wyoming law,'' said Carbon County Attorney Tom Campbell, who is not 
involved in the prosecution of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	No state legislature has recognized the gay panic defense  
because there is no scientific evidence to support it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barton Voigt is expected to rule Monday on whether  
McKinney's lawyers will be allowed to present evidence supporting 
the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney and Russell Henderson, both 22-year-old roofers, are  
accused of luring Shepard out of a Laramie bar and taking him to a 
remote area near town, where they robbed him of $20, lashed him to 
a wooden fence and pistol-whipped him into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, died five days later.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson is serving two life sentences after pleading guilty to  
murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	During testimony last week, prosecutors offered jurors a  
timeline of the events the night Shepard was beaten, ending with 
McKinney's jailhouse confession. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's then-girlfriend, Kristen Price, testified that he  
went on drug-and-alcohol binges that sometimes lasted for days. But 
she said she did not see McKinney use drugs or drink the day of 
Shepard's beating. 
</P>
<P>
	In his taped confession, McKinney said Shepard reached down and  
grabbed his leg while he was driving. He said he became angry and 
struck Shepard with his hands and a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Diminished capacity defenses have taken unusual forms, none more  
notorious that the ``Twinkie'' defense used to help Dan White avoid 
a murder conviction for shooting San Francisco Mayor George Moscone 
and city supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	White, a former police officer and firefighter, contended his  
mental capacity was diminished from eating too much junk food. 
</P>
<P>
	In the furor that erupted over the verdict, the California  
Legislature abolished the diminished capacity defense. In 1985, 
White committed suicide months after he was released on parole.

<HEADLINE> Senators Give Yashin Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- The Ottawa Senators have given Alexei Yashin an  
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa Sun reported Sunday that Senators general manager  
Marshall Johnston faxed a letter to the star holdout last week 
informing Yashin that if he doesn't start to honor the final year 
of his contract by Nov. 8, he'll be suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators originally had set a Dec. 4 deadline for Yashin,  
who is working out in Switzerland waiting for a new contract or 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed the Senators also informed Yashin that if he  
doesn't return before the deadline, he'll owe the team another year 
on his contract and won't become a Group II restricted free agent 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin's New Jersey-based agent Mark Gandler wouldn't confirm  
the Nov. 8 date when contacted Saturday, but the Senators 
apparently were acting with the backing of NHL commissioner Gary 
Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gandler, Yashin will continue to work out with the  
Kloten Flyers of the Swiss Elite League and isn't making any plans 
to come back to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax apparently indicated if he honored the contract, the  
club would be willing to hold talks in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has made it clear he wants a contract done before  
returning to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll wait as long as it takes to get what I want,'' Yashin  
told the newspaper from Switzerland. ``They can set a deadline if 
they want, I don't care about any deadline.''
