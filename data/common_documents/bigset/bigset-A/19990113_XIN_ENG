<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Sanctions Against Russian Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States imposed
economic sanctions Tuesday against a Moscow university and two
other Russian institutions, accusing them of leaking nuclear and
missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were against Mendeleyev Chemical Technical
University in Moscow, the Scientific Research and Design Institute
of Power and Technology and the Moscow Aviation Institute.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's national security adviser Sandy Berger
announced the sanctions in a speech at the annual Carnegie
International Non-proliferation Conference.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it very clear the administration has authority to
act against entities that violate international nonproliferation
standards and we will use that authority to protect our security,"
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed similar sanctions against seven other
Russian institutions in July.
</P>
<P>
"Weapons scientists and institutions face increased financial
pressure to sell their wares to whomever is in the market,
including rogue states," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Berger did not give details of the sanctions, acknowledging
that nonproliferation of Russian nuclear and missile technology
would not be stopped by U.S. penalties but requires a tighter
Russian export control system.
</P>
<P>
"Only Russia can police its own borders, factories and
technology industry," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Berger also pledged an all-out effort to gain
Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Berger said it was critical to efforts to get India and
Pakistan to back away from nuclear testing. The treaty, signed by
151 nations, would ban all nuclear test explosions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a terrible tragedy if the Senate failed to ratify
the CTBT this year," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 17 countries have
agreed to attend an Arab consultation meeting of foreign
ministers, reaching the quorum for the session, the Arab League
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Algeria and the United Arab Emirates separately informed the
league in the day of their decisions to take part in the meeting,
bringing the number to 17 of the countries agreeing to be present,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have verbally agreed to participate in
the meeting slated for January 24, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the 22 member states of the pan-Arab organization, Iraq,
Libya and Morocco have not made it clear whether they will be
represented.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries initially decided to hold the foreign ministers
meeting on December 30 to discuss the situation in Iraq following
a U.S.-British attack and a Yemeni call for an Arab summit on
restoring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
countries, the meeting was put off to January 24 for better
preparations and consultations.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched a four-day missile
attack on Iraq in mid-December in what the U.S. said a retaliation
for Iraq's defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Defense Ministers Call for Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense Ministers from Italy and
the southern Balkan countries Tuesday called for a peaceful
solution to the problem in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo through
negotiations between the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministers of Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Slovenia, the Chief
of Staff of Romania and ambassadors for the U.S. and Turkey are
now gathering in Athens to discuss the final details of the Balkan
multinational peacekeeping force, which was agreed last September
in Skopje, FYROM.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that the
international community should now exert pressure upon the parties
concerned in Kosovo, aiming at finding a political solution which
allows granting autonomy to the ethnic Albanians within the
framework of the present borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Defense Minister Georgi Ananiev expressed the hope
that the Kosovo crisis would soon be resolved so that the force
would not have to be used.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said that the Kosovo
problem was "a problem of the entire Balkan region," since if it
spreads, it would inevitably affect all the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for any political solution to be based on
respect for the principles of self-determination and the
inviolability of present borders.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said that his
country had taken the decision to participate in both the
southeast Europe force and the NATO multinational force in FYROM
which will provide assistance to the observers of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo if the
need arises.

<HEADLINE> Russia, France Share View Over Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and his visiting French counterpart Hubert Vedrine Tuesday
shared the same view that the role of the Contact Group in
settling the Kosovo problem should be increased, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said during a news conference after their talks that
"the Contact Group's role must be intensified."
</P>
<P>
He said the current pause in the settlement process is being
manipulated by forces that would like to further increase tensio
ns in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the recent seizure of eight Yugoslav officers by
Kosovo Albanians, he said if active political efforts are not
made such incidents will repeat themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The contact Group must send a strong signal to all sides
involved in the Kosovo conflict. They must sit at a negotiating
table and start discussing settlement problems," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Ivanov, Vedrine said the United States' shuttle
diplomacy is not bringing results.
</P>
<P>
"We think the Contact Group must recapture the initiative and
assume responsibility for what has to do with the two conflicting
parties in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq problem, Ivanov said he supports working out "new
approaches" -- a reliable system -- to prevent Iraq from
producing weapons of mass destruction and to ensure conditions
for abolishing the oil embargo and thus alleviating the problems
of Iraq's people.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said as far as Iraq is concerned Russia and France
have very close positions, similar purposes and
mutually-supplementing approaches.
</P>
<P>
It is time the U.N. Security Council changed methods and forms
of its monitoring work in Iraq, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that at least the composition of the U.N. weapons
commission should be changed.

According to the survey, consumer confidence maintained its
improving trend both in the EU and euro zone. The main reason for
this improvement lies in the sustained optimistic evaluation of
the present general economic situation and consumers showing a
positive attitude towards major purchases.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, industry managers expressed a more
optimistic view in their production expectations compared to that
of November. In the 15 EU countries, all assessments concerning
the level of order books stabilized, though the prevailing view
on their export books was more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the EU industrial confidence indicator improved in

<HEADLINE> 10 Arrested in Iran Related to Political Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ten Iranian Intelligence agents
have been arrested so far in connection with the murders of five
liberals in the country.
</P>
<P>
A special committee in charge of investigating the murder cases
said in a report that a group of others are currently under
surveillance, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is more concrete information on the serial killings
"which cannot be divulged, because such disclosure would hurt the
still pending investigations," the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed under the order of President Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate cleric, after the deaths of a prominent
opposition leader and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Dariush Foruhar and his wife were stabbed to death at home, and
the other three were dissident writers who were found murdered in
the suburbs of the capital city late last year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Intelligence Ministry, under the control of the
conservatives, admitted that some of its agents were involved in
the killings.
</P>
<P>
This was a big blow to the conservatives, who have been engaged
in a bitter power struggle with the moderates, led by the
president.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of the Iranian leadership, including the
paramount leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, pointed finger at foreign
enemies. The conservatives also hit back, accusing Khatami's
supporters of committing the crimes.
</P>
<P>
With most of the organs of the state power under their sway,
the conservatives lashed out at their rivals for trying to take
over the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The moderate factions have called for the resignation of
Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi and an open trial
on the case.
</P>
<P>
The special investigation committee warned against factional
fighting over the killings and called on them to refrain from
creating tensions surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
Disruptions and ballyhoo by any party indicate that it does not
favor disclosure of the truth about the murders, and it will lose
through such revelations, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The committee assured the public that it would continue the
investigations to the conclusion regardless of any tensions
intentionally created by some parties.
</P>
<P>
The investigations have identified "the architects and
executors of the operational phase," it said, and further
investigation to identify "the outside links and the principal
figures behind the murders" are underway.

<HEADLINE> Official: U.S.-DPRK Talks Go Ahead Despite Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the United
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will
go forward this week despite Pyongyang's accusation of U.S.
failure to faithfully implement a 1994 agreement on nuclear
reactors, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will go forward. We are confident of that," the
official said. He was referring to the U.S.-DPRK talks in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, accused the United States in
an editorial on Tuesday of failing to keep its commitment of the
1994 Agreed Framework, under which Pyongyang abandoned its own
nuclear program in exchange for free fuel and commercial nuclear
power reactors.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has not faithfully implemented any of its
commitments... This compels the DPRK to expect nothing any longer
from the Agreed Framework," said the editorial, carried by the
Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of observing the Geneva agreement because
the United States refuses to abandon its attempts to use it as a
lever to stifle the DPRK," the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official declined to comment on the editorial but said
the bilateral talks offered benefits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The official said U.S. and DPRK officials will meet this
weekend. Next Tuesday, officials from China, the United States,
DPRK and South Korea will hold another round of four-party talks
on the future of the Korean Peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said on Tuesday that the U.S. dollar should remain the
world's reference money.
</P>
<P>
Jospin made the statement during a New Year good wish meeting
with the press.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the dollar would not remain the world's reference
money with the arrival of the euro, Jospin said, "It would not be
desirable that that change."
</P>
<P>
As for the proposal by Japan that the yen become another
international money beside the dollar and the euro, Jospin said t
hat it is still a question of whether the Japanese authorities
would make the yen an international money.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to proclaim," he said, in reference to the
statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi during his
visit to France last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said on Tuesday that the euro does not intend to
replace the dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said it is natural for the euro to stay side-by-side with
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some European economists have complained that the rate of the
euro could be too high for the economic growth of Europe.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Still See Trade Surplus With Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone had a trade
surplus with the rest of the world of 5.2 billion euros in
September 1998, the European Union (EU) statistical office, the
Eurostat, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This figure gave the euro zone a total surplus of 63.9 billion
euros for the first nine months of 1998, up 0.8 billion euros
compared to the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the euro conversion rate with original European Currency
Unit, or ECU, is one to one, the two terms can be used
interchangeably for practical purpose, according to the Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 of the 15 EU member states are in the euro zone.
They are Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland.
Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece are still outside the euro
zone.
</P>
<P>
However, extra-EU trade was one billion euros in deficit in
September 1998. And there was a surplus of only 14.3 billion
euros in the first nine months in 1998 compared to 32.5 billion
euros for the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, extra- and intra-trade growth in September was weak
or falling for both the euro zone and the EU. But EU trade with
the United States was well up in the first nine months last year,
with exports and imports increasing 15 percent and 13 percent,
respectively, from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, effects of the situation in Asian financial
markets can be seen in a 14 percent fall in exports to Japan, and
the replacement of Taiwan by Hungary in the list of main trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
However, EU trade with China remains strong with an increase
of 15 percent for exports and 14 percent for imports, the
Eurostat data shows.
</P>
<P>
During the nine month period, Germany still enjoyed the
largest surplus with 51.7 billion euros, while Britain's deficit
rose strongly to 31.2 billion euros, and Ireland continued to
show the strongest growth with the third highest surplus of 14
billion euros.

<HEADLINE> Supplementary Protocol on Balkan Multinational Force Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from Italy
and the southern Balkan countries signed here Tuesday a
supplementary protocol to the last September treaty to set up a
multinational peacekeeping force in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, the multinational force's
headquarters will alternate every four years among the
participating countries in the order of Bulgaria,
Romania,Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The command will be assigned to each of the countries for a
two-year term and Turkey will be the first followed by Greece.
</P>
<P>
The presidency and headquarters of the political and military
committee will be held by each of the participating countries for
a two-year term and Greece will hold the first presidency,
followed by Romania.
</P>
<P>
The multinational force's headquarters is expected to start
operating this summer while the participating countries hope to
hold the first exercise at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and the United States are participating in the force
as observers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be ratified by the participating countries
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministers from Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Italy,
Macedonia, Slovenia, the Chief of Staff of Romania and
ambassadors of the United States and Turkey are present at the
meeting, which began here Monday to discuss a number of issues
concerning the force of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The pact creating a multinational force was signed last
September at a meeting in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, but
disputes over where it should be based and who should head it
delayed its formal adoption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplane Fires Missile at Iraqi Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. F-16 fighter fired a
HARM missile at a radar site in the northern no-fly zone in Iraq
on Tuesday, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft returned safely to its base in Incirlik,
Turkey. the clash took place at 11 a.m. Iraqi time (0800 GMT),
according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear why the pilot fired a missile at
the radar site, but Bridges said the "radar posed a threat to
coalition forces."
</P>
<P>
He said there was no further information, but it is possible
the radar had taken aim at the aircraft, as has occurred in
several previous incidents over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such military clash this week. On Monday U.S.
fighters attacked two Iraqi air defense missile sites in the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, on a trip to Japan,
expressed the U.S. tough position after he was briefed of the
new clash, saying Baghdad would pay a price if it challenged
U.S. and British air might over the northern and southern no-fly
zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen declined to say whether the repeated confrontations in
recent three weeks might prompt wider attacks against the Iraqi
military by American forces.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to protect our forces and take whatever measures
are necessary. Beyond that I woulddn't want to say anything," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The White House was also firm in its response to Iraq's
challenges in both no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
"The no-fly zones are being enforced vigorously and American
pilots will take the appropriate actions to respond to any action
taken against them," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two no-fly zones in northern and souther Iraq were set up
after the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq has announced it would no longer
recognize them since U.S.-British bombing raids against Iraqi
military and security targets in December.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between the United States and Iraqi have thus
increased. And the main Arab nations -- Saudi Arabia and Egypt --
were infuriated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call on Arabs
to overthrow their rulers, which made Iraq in a further isolated
position.
</P>
<P>
"It's been our experience that in times when he (Saddam
Hussein) is isolated and frustrated, he tries to lash out, and
we think now he is in a position where he has never been so

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped the new Turkish
government-led by Bulent Ecevit to achieve political stability and
normality, government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Veteran politician Ecevit, 73, became the neighboring country's
new Prime Minister Monday after a six-week political crisis in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Nikolaou said that the political
stability in Turkey would help Ankara in its European vocation and
in becoming a credible interlocutor.
</P>
<P>
Athens' desire was that any Turkish government respect
international treaties and contribute to conditions of good
neighborliness and peace in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two NATO members have been strained for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, both Greece and Turkey have made efforts to
improve their bilateral relations, but little progress has been
made so far due to their uncompromising stances.

<HEADLINE> Key Member of Israel's Labor Party Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A key member of the Israeli
Labor Party left the party Tuesday and decided to join in former
army chief of general staff to run in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Haggal Meron, also a member of the Knesset (parliament), was
the first leading Labor figure that left the party so far.
</P>
<P>
The centrist party formed by Amnon Lipkon-Shahak is the only
party that can beat the Likud led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May elections, Meron said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Labor party is no longer my political home and I decided
to join Shahak," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shahak officially announced his candidacy for the premiership
last Thursday, attacking Netanyahu as "dangerous to Israel."
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor said Tuesday that Meron's quit will not
undermine the party's strength in its election campaign and it
does not bother the party at all.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Tuesday that
he has not yet decided his political future and it still remains
uncertain whether he will stay or leave the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told the Israel Radio that he would make a decision
"based on the interests of Israel, not on the interests of
Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
Benny Begin and Dan Meridor, two key Likud members, have
already announced to compete in the elections.
</P>
<P>
After more than six years out of the political limelight,
Moshe Arens, former Likud defense minister and foreign minister,
announced on Monday to run against Netanyahu for the Likud
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Likud is to choose its candidate for the prime minister on
January 25.

NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Malawian Defense Minister
Joseph Kubwalo said that the country's presidential and
parliamentary elections are set to take place in May this year,
the Malawi News Agency MANA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged maximum security in the forthcoming
general elections to ensure peaceful and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
"I am saying this because the government is aware that there
are some people who are sowing seeds of division to disrupt the
general elections, just because they know that they will not win,"
Kubwalo said when he opened a two-month Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Army Commander course at the Malawi
Armed Forces College in Salima.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the course will not only help them boost
their professional skills, but to foster interaction between
officers of different armies in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
"This is what our leaders do by interacting on matters that
affect countries in the SADC region," said Kubwalo.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the government's policy to encourage
cooperation in the armed forces among the 14 SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
He expressed contentment to a Namibian female army officer who
is attending the course and said 2Z encourage
Malawi to recruit some female army officers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Malawi Army was ready to protect the
country's hard won democracy process the country is enjoying.

HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi Tuesday said the Standard weekly newspaper will be
punished for publishing a false story of an attempted coup in the
Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Harare, Mahachi said
military coups were taboo in the ZNA and the report was aimed at
tarnishing the image of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces (ZFD).
</P>
<P>
The privately-owned newspaper claimed last week that there was
a military coup in the ZNA and 23 army officers were arrested, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"These unscrupulous media are corrupt liars, and greedy to make
money at all costs, in a mercenary type media and damn cruel
intending to destroy by pen," Mahachi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said while the government fully recognized the
freedom of the press as enshrined in the Constitution of Zimbabwe,
it also had the responsibility to protect the nation from
malicious misinformation deliberately intended to create
instability by some newspapers because of their financial greed.
</P>
<P>
"The government may be forced to take necessary steps to
protect the public, the people, armed forces and the right to be
told the truth," he
said.

HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi said here Tuesday that the Zimbabwean forces in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have captured 40 Rwandan
soldiers and have brought them to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his government was negotiating with
Rwanda for the release of 16 Zimbabwean soldiers who were captured
by the Uganda and Rwanda-backed rebels in the DRC in exchange of
the Rwandan soldiers in Zimbabwe.
</P>

Mahachi, however, said it was not clear where the captured
Zimbabwean soldiers were held in the DRC but assumed that they
were alive.

Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have soldiers in the DRC
fighting against the rebels who since August 2, 1998 have launched
an offensive to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila's government.
</P>

So far, Zimbabwe said it had lost 31 soldiers in the war but

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres announced in Tel Aviv Tuesday the formation of a new
Israeli-Palestinian Youth Council for peace, the Peres Peace
Center said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The council was founded with the aim of preparing the new
generations for peace, Peres said at the closing session of the
three-day meeting of the board of governors hosted by the center.
</P>
<P>
He said the council will bring together Israeli and Palestinian
youths regularly to conduct dialogs on what a peaceful future
they will build.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to prepare new generations for peace because they
have the right and duty to create their future," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed the operations of the center in 1998 and
worked out plans for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Participants visited the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday
and discussed ways of moving the peace process forward with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Palestinian lawmakers there.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Palestinian Council (PC) there, Peres said the
1993 Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians has laid down
the framework of Mideast peace process and the accord must be
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants were former Soviet Union president
Mikhail Gorbachev, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former
United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Polish
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The center, set up by Peres last year, was aimed at enhancing
peace in the region through economic development and cooperation
in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Peres said last week that the center has raised about 60
million U.S. dollars in 1998 and the money has to be well used in
promoting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides helping the Palestinians enhance their educational,
agricultural and technical development, the center also plans
for the near future to form a Jordanian-Israeli fund to help
the Jordanians to speed up their economic development.

Noting that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had supported the

some of the steps we would like to see taken."

KUWAIT CITY, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has agreed to the
deployment of eight more U.S. F-16 jet fighters in the Gulf to
defend the oil-rich emirate, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense
Minister Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to the deployment of these aircraft in line
with the policy to beef up the defense of Kuwait," Salem told
reporters after a parliament session.
</P>
<P>
A United States military spokesman confirmed in Washington
earlier Tuesday that eight F-16 fighters would be sent in to
reinforce supervision of the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 U.S. warplanes, along with more than 20 U.S. warships
and over 20,000 troops, are presently stationed in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Salem confirmed that part of the country's armed forces have
been put on high alert after Iraq stepped up war of words against
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti army is highly prepared to defend the national
territories," Salem said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on reports that Iraq was massing up

</P>
<P>
Iraqi and U.S. warplanes have recently skirmished over the two
no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials said the no-fly zones, set up by the U.S. and
its western allies after the 1991 Gulf War, are illegal and they
threatened to shot down any foreign airplanes in its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Palestinian Refugees to be Held in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- An international meeting on the
Palestinian refugees is scheduled be held in Egypt on January 25,
Palestinian diplomatic sources here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Coordination Committee on the Palestinian
Refugees and the Displaced will hold two-day meetings in the Sinai
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on social programs and training courses
carried out in the host countries of the refugees, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the host countries, including Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon, Syria, Canada, Italy, Spain and Japan, will take part in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also deal with issues pertaining to ways of
solving problems facing the Palestinian refugees and guaranteeing
their return to home, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's occupation of Palestine through four Middle East wars
with Arab countries in the past half a century has reduced
millions of Palestinians to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The International Coordination Committee for the Palestinian
Refugees and the Displace was formed in 1994 within the framework
of the multilateral Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The committee froze its activities after holding three meetings
due to the intransigent policies towards the peace process taken by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since he assumed power
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports U.N. Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner in
Cyprus David Madden on Tuesday expressed Britain's full support to
the U.N. for a settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, Madden
said that Britain will continue to work closely with the
international community and in particular with the U.N. for a
settlement of the issue based on relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and U.N. resident representative Dame Ann Hercus on Thursday
in London would be an initial step in Britain's efforts to support
the initiative the U.N. envoy proposed for a settlement of the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had supported the
U.N. resolution 1218 in a written statement, Madden said that the
resolution is "particularly significant and important because it
sets out very clear objectives for future work and it sets out
some of the steps we would like to see taken."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots
unilaterally declared a republic in northern Cyprus in 1983, which
is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle talks sponsored by Hercus began in mid-October
1998.

<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Tuesday denied reports that he has called for change of
Iraq's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Moussa dismissed the reports as "wholly
untrue," saying the reports "have fabricated the statements" and
attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
A German newspaper reported that Moussa told the paper in a
recent interview that Iraq needs a new leadership to replace
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Moussa maintained that Egypt does not interfere in the internal
affairs of any country and that the question of who should rule a
country is "totally up to the peoples concerned."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iraq have been engaged in a war of words in the
recent days due to the postponement of an Arab foreign ministers
meeting on the Iraqi issue from December 30 to January 24.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Egypt of maneuvering the postponement for
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which have not forgiven Saddam for Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, in return, criticized the Iraqi leadership for adopting
unwise policies, resulting in one crisis after another in the
country and the sufferings of the Iraqi people due to the
crippling international economic sanctions triggered by its
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Take Active Steps for Fighting Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian government is to
take active steps for fighting unemployment, in view of the
redundancy due to massive shut-down of loss-making companies in
this year.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the Government's policy in this field will be
noticed by the end of 1999, the national Rompres news agency
Tuesday quoted Norica Nicolai, Secretary of State in the Ministry
of Labour and Social Security as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newly established National Agency for Employment and
Professional Training is ready to cover all governmental
programs of professional reconversion that will be implemented
for the first time by some private units at the Romanian
Government expense, he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania's unemployment rate is about 9 percent at present,
being estimated a possible rise as against the number of people
that will be made redundant due to the economic measures of the
government in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In order to create new jobs, the state grants credits for the
establishment of small and middle size enterprises. Ten thousands
of new jobs have been created in 1998 with an investment of 25-30
million lei (about 3000 U.S. dollars) for each one. The
expenditures made by the Romanian state for new jobs in 1998
totaled 4.2 million dollars plus unemployment expenditures.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security
found about 45,376 vacancies in Romania and 31,378 people were
hired out of 75,688 who were looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
In view of the 1999 redundancy, Romania's Government will
continue the 1998 active steps with emphasis on those preceding
the lay-off. Among the active steps for fighting unemployment,
the Romanian state will stimulate economic units that hire fresh
university graduates on an open-ended labour contract. Norica
Nicolai also said that Romania's Government took into account some
steps that would fight "the black market of jobs".

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALYA1SOtary 12 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour Tuesday urged people to learn a lesson from conflicts
elsewhere and strengthen their determination to maintain peace and
national solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Amour said the internal conflicts in a number of African
countries and other parts of the world would not have happened if
leaders were not at odds with each other.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally at the Gombani Stadium on the Pemba
Island for celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Zanzibar
Revolution, Amour commended Tanzanians on the mainland and in the
Zanzibar ise] for their spirit of unity, solidarity and peace,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
African nationalists toppled the Sultanese regime on January
12, 1964 in a bloody revolution in Zanzibar. Three months later,
Zanzibar united with Tanganyika forming a united Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A popular tourist destination consisting of two major islands,
Zanzibar and Pemba, along with several other smaller islands in
the Indian Ocean, Zanzibar i{
5nhabited by nearly one million
residents, more than 90 percent of which are Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar leader stressed the importance of a#ipting
election results since winning or losing is a common phenomenon
that should be accepted in multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, under President
Amour, claimed a narrow victory over the opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) in the 1995 elections. CUF has been reluctant to
accept the result.
</P>
<P>
Amour criticized those who thought that the introduction of
party pluralism provided an opportunity for revenge and discord,
noting that ethics is a national issue and does not belong to a
certain party.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar President also hailed the new development in the
East African Co-operation (EAC) of Kenya, Tanzanian and Uganda.

<P>
Visiting Malawian President Bakili Muluzi attended the
celebrations as the guest of honor.

</P>
<P>
The committee invited her to respond to queries arising out of
its investigation on the valley dams scandal.
</P>
<P>
kazibwe said that at the time of contracting out the dams, she
took into account the availability of World Bank funds and the
options of whether to construct valley tanks or dams.
</P>
<P>
She told the committee members that basing on technical
guidance from a number of sources, she recommended the
construction of the valley dams.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe thanked the committee for unearthing irregularities in
the project because this, she noted, has helped her ministry to
streamline the operation of the projects.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, she refuted claims that she does not get along
with Minister of State Miyingo Kezimbira, adding that they had
agreed to disagree at the conceptual level, and this did not in
any way distort their working relationship.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the state minister said that he did not know the
decisions about the valley dams because all of them were made by
the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The valley dams scandal, coupled with others in the
privatization process, has tainted the government image among the
public and there has been a growing outcry for bringing those
responsible to book.

<HEADLINE> WFP Calls for Ceasefire Extension in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- With only three days left
before a cease- fire agreement in southern Sudan expires, the head
of the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) warned Tuesday that a
continued cessation of hostilities was a must to avoid a repeat of
1998's famine, according to a release from the WFP Nairobi office
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"An escalation in fighting in southern Sudan will strike a
deadly blow to thousands of extremely fragile people there," said
Catherine Bertini, WFP Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
Bertini stressed : "So much help has been provided, and so many
lives have been saved, we simply cannot accept that a resurgence
in fighting wipes it all away."
</P>
<P>
The latest ceasefire agreement was renewed by the Sudanese
government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement Army for
three months in mid-October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last January, major clashes in Bahr El Ghazal Province in Sudan
forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes to the
villages where the population was already weak. This sparked off
what evolved into one of the worst famines of this decade, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Through this year, more than two million people in southern
Sudan will continue to require relief food in order to survive and
one-third of the hungry are in Bahr El Ghazal Province.
</P>
<P>
The release said that WFP, which launched the largest
humanitarian food airdrop in history, continues to deliver
thousands of tons of food each month to the victims of famine,
flooding and fighting.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Rise 20-Fold in 10 Years in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Drug addiction rose 20-fold
in the Republic of Moldova over the last 10 years and local
experts estimated that the number of abusers are between 40,000
and 120,000.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Interior Ministry, quoted Tuesday
by the local BASA-Press news agency, of the total 3,969 drug
dependents officially registered, 252 are children, and some 2,450
are young people of 20-25 years old.
</P>
<P>
The spread of drug abuse contributes to the rise of the crime
in general, the report read. In the last five years, the number of
drug related crimes has risen three times. In 1998 alone, police
discovered 870 drug related crimes and offenses, which is 8.5
percent up compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show some 25-30 tons of poppy are in illegal trade
in Moldova. A glass of poppy straws is sold 30 lei (about 3 U.S.
dollars) on the black market.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of desire in society to take measures and continuous
spread of the drug trade will lead to considerable increase of the
number of drug related crimes," said police colonel Andrei
Vataman, chief of the Interior Ministry's anti-drug service.
According to him, it is necessary "to intensify criminal
persecution against the drug traffickers."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns of Instability in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt warned Tuesday of
instability in the Middle East if Israel fails to carry out the
peace agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The failure to enforce these accords implies danger to the
regional scene in general and the peace process in particular,"
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called on the Israeli government to reconsider its
policy and implement the accords as part of the efforts to salvage
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently
suspended the U.S.-brokered Wye accord for alleged Palestinian
non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Netanyahu last October in Washington, Israel should withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his brief visit to Israel on Monday is "very
useful," adding that it is necessary to have "direct and frank
dialog" with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of a gathering of the peace center named after
former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres, Moussa met with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and leader of the opposition
Labor Party Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official maintained that his visit and meetings
provided the opportunity to highlight the importance of carrying
out the agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed that without the creation of a Palestinian
state, stability in the region would be jeopardized and the peace
process would be "in an illogical position and become
counter-productive."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have announced to declare an independent state
in May according to the Oslo accords signed with Israel in 1993.
Netanyahu has opposed the step, threatening to take unilateral
actions against the possible move.

sell cattle and take all possible means to cushion the effects of
food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to villagers in Nzuguni Ward of Dodoma Urban District
in central Tanzania, Sumaye said that the government cannot allow
some cattle owners to have large herds for prestige while their
families are starving.
</P>
<P>
"You must sell your cattle so that you can feed your families,
send your children to school and pay your medical expenses," he
directed.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Sumaye said it is a bad
habit for people to always bank on donations when they have no
food.
</P>
<P>
He criticized pastoralists in the northern Arusha Region who
ignored his call to sell their cattle to buy food, even when a bag
of maize is selling at 20,000 Shillings (about 30 U.S. Dollars)
compared with 3,000 Shillings previously.
</P>
<P>
Most of the regions in Tanzania have suffered from grave
shortages due to bad weather last year. The government has
appealed for urgent food relief as 600,000 tons of food are wanted
in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the weather departments have predicted that
the country will have inadequate rains this year, a situation
which requires people to tighten their belts.
</P>
<P>
He also called on farmers to plant drought resistant crops and
businessmen to boost food circulation.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the 35th anniversary celebrations for Zanzibar
Revolution at Uhuru Primary School in Dodoma later, Sumaye said it
is a shame for a nation to beg for food.
</P>
<P>
He said while celebrating the isle's revolution which toppled
Arab Sultanese regime, Tanzanians should initiate another
revolution to fight hunger.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye urged Tanzanians to change their attitudes toward work
and make greater efforts to combat poverty.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Y2K Program on Track: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Y2K
readiness program is on track and it is expected that by the end
of this year the country will be 65-70 percent compliant, said Jay
Naidoo, Minister of Posts and Communications.
</P>
<P>
"This (percentage) is a conservative figure and assumes that
all the sectors will at least maintain their current rate of
progress.
</P>
<P>
"The country's level of readiness is very dependent on the
extent to which all key players participate in the Y2K challenge,"
Naidoo was quoted as saying by a government statement issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public there is no need for panic, though there
is a need for concerted action by companies, and a need to educate
the general public.
</P>
<P>
He added that mission critical systems -- those in control of
essential services -- will be close to full compliance by the end
of this year, meaning that the majority of people will experience
only minor disruptions in essential services.
</P>
<P>
Most major organizations are progressing well with their
individual Y2K programs, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
However, many organizations have not paid due attention to the
inter- connected nature of their businesses and had ignored their
dependence on other organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, also called the millennium bug, stems from the
fact that old computers recognizes a year only by the last digits.
When the clock of the computer ticks to the year 2000, the
computer will take it as the year 1900, thus causing confusion in
all calculations and operations which take a date into account.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate in France in December Lowest since 1953 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The consumer prices in France in
December 1998 rose by 0.3 percent as compared with the same month
in 1997, scoring the lowest year-on-year inflation rate since
December 1953.
</P>
<P>
The official economic statistics bureau INSEE said on Tuesday
that prices rose by 0.1 percent in December over November.
</P>
<P>
In December 1953, consumer prices fell by 2.3 percent in
France.
</P>
<P>
The INSEE said that low inflation rate does not mean that
France is experiencing deflation, as the economy is still growing
and jobs are created.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding government fixed prices such as public
transport and seasonal prices such as fresh foods and energy, the
inflation rate in France would attain 1.1 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose only by 0.5 percent in December as compared
with 2.5 percent in the same month 1997, while energy prices fell
by 5.2 percent as compared with a fall of 0.3 percent in the same
month 1997.
</P>
<P>
The falling oil price in the world market was one major factor
contributing to low inflation in France.
</P>
<P>
The INSEE said that if world oil price can stabilize in
mid-1999, inflation rate could rise to around 0.5 percent in June
as compared with June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Japan Want More Cooperation in World Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Japan want more
transparency in international financial transactions, agreed
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in their talks in Bonn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This issue would be on the agenda at a meeting of European
Union and Asian finance ministers in Frankfurt this Friday and at
the June G-8 summit of leaders from wealthy industrial nations and
Russia in Cologne, said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also said Bonn and Tokyo would cooperate in efforts
to stabilize the economic situation in Russia, but did not give
details.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi tried to declare that the yen was fit to remain a world
currency with the dollar and the euro. He said the yen's strength
depended on the strength of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
"The euro has had a very nice start," said Obuchi. "I hope the
euro will be as strong as the dollar." The euro was launched by 11
EU states on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Both countries had agreed also to work together on reforming
the United Nations and strengthening the position of the U.N.
secretary-general, said Schroeder, who accepted an invitation to
visit Japan this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi wrapped up a three-nation Europe tour in Bonn from Italy
and France. He flew back to Japan late Tuesday after having a
dinner with Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Obuchi met German President Roman Herzog in Berlin
Monday and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in Bonn Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Plan to Preserve Sensitive Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
unveiled a plan Tuesday to triple spending in an effort to
preserve vulnerable lands in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our population is growing, our cities are growing, our
commitment to conservation must grow as well," Clinton said in
announcing the 1 billion U.S. dollars spending proposal during a
ceremony at the National Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
The "land-legacy initiative" will be included in the fiscal
2000 budget Clinton will send to Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
It calls for adding thousands of acres to the system of
federally protected lands and providing states with nearly 600
million dollars for land preservation.
</P>
<P>
Among the protected areas that would be expanded under the plan
are the Joshua Tree National Park in California and the Florida
Everglades, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes a day after Vice President Al Gore
unveiled a separate program that proposes to use 700 million
dollars in tax credits to finance a 10 billion dollars bond
program aimed at creating suburban parks, greenways and other open
space.
</P>
<P>
That proposal was aimed at dealing with suburban sprawl, while
the new initiative is directed at restoring and protecting
undeveloped, but vulnerable, forests, grasslands, beaches and
marine sanctuaries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Over three decades ago, Congress created a land and water
conservation fund that authorized spending as much as 900 million
dollars a year to buy land for conservation. But in most years
only about a third of that money was ever provided and during the
Reagan administration land purchases were put on hold.
</P>
<P>
This year, Congress provided about 320 million dollars for
federal land purchases.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton proposal calls for full funding of the program and
would funnel millions of dollars more -- for a total of just over
1 billion dollars a year -- into land preservation. Most of the
money would come from revenues collected from offshore oil
drilling, officials said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Leader in Guinea for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's detained rebel
leader Foday Sankoh was flown from his jail to neighboring Guinea
for talks with mediators Tuesday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sierra Leonean Ambassador to Guinea, Ali
Kamara, as saying in a telephone interview that Sankoh went
straight into talks with west African ministers, the United
Nations and the Sierra Leonean government.
</P>
<P>
"He is here in Conakry and is in negotiations," the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's transfer abroad is a key demand of his Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) fighters before they will consider a cease-fire
or political talks.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who led the RUF rebellion in 1991, was put under house
arrest in Nigeria in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
He was handed over to the Sierra Leonean authority after the
west African peace-keeping force chased out the military junta of
Johnny Paul Koromah and restored the government of elected
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was sentenced to death by a Sierra Leonean court last
October for calling on his supporters to ally with the Koromah
junta, though the execution has not been carried out to allow him
to appeal to the higher court.
</P>
<P>
Since Sankoh's death sentence was announced, the rebels have
intensified their attacks and eventually controlled the whole
northern half of Sierra Leone, before they entered the capital
Freetown last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the heat of the fighting between the Nigerian-led ECOMOG
and rebels, Sierra Leone's state radio announced that President
Kabbah and Sankoh had reached a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the rebel's field commander and number two leader Sam
Bockarie said the cease-fire was not true and that his troops
would fight on until Sankoh was released.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has reportedly asked Guinea and
Cote d' Voire to mediate the peace talks, while the international
society, including Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) as well as the United Nations have been playing a
positive role in trying to find a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ECOMOG forces Tuesday continued its mop-up
operations in Freetown, with the rebels retreating from the
central and eastern parts of the city they once occupied.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed ECOMOG officer said there were still small groups of
rebels and isolated gunmen and that it will take another few days
before the city is safe again.
</P>
<P>
The retreating rebels reportedly resorted to murder of
civilians, arson and looting, as witnesses said bodies littered
the streets and many houses were burnt down.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting rages on, thousands of residents remained
trapped in their houses without food, water or electricity.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross and the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees in Geneva have warned that a
humanitarian disaster is looming until some kind of ceasefire is
arranged and humanitarian supplies can be brought in.

He said that the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
must cease hostilities, accept President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah as the
 democratically-elected president of the country and demonstrate a
 willingness to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
"The only way forward is for them to accept the futility of
fighting ... and that the international community wants democracy
in every country and carve out a role for themselves under a
democracy," the Commonwealth chief noted.
</P>

Anyaoku made the remarks Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja when
he met with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) of Nigeria, Justice ephraim Akapata.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, they agreed that a team of experts from
the Commonwealth will be in Nigeria next week to review last
week's governorship and state assembly elections with officials of
INEC.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, after a meeting with Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar, Anyaoku said that the Commonwealth had been
holding talks with both the Sierra Leonean government and the
rebels to pave way for a peaceful resolution of the raging crisis
in that country.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels were in my office last Wednesday and I made it
clear to them that the Commonwealth is in support of President
Tejan Kabbah's ratically- elected government," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I don't believe the rebels are at the moment anymore
on the offensive as the tide of the battle is now turning against
them.
</P>
<P>
"They have been on the retreat from Freetown and the ECOMOG
(west African peace-keeping force) are on the offensive. So I
don't think things are hopeful for them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku reaffirmed that the Commonwealth stands for "peaceful
resolution of the crisis in the country."

JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African Rand
Tuesday dipped below the psychologically important 6.0 level

<P>
The Rand closed 6.01 against the dollar and 9.97 against the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
Although the new weakness of the Rand cast some doubt about the
 continuing decline of interest rates, economists are not entirely
 pessimistic about the economy, according to the South African
Broadcasting Corporation television.
</P>
<P>
But some economists do believe that if the situation persists,
the interest rates will be kept higher than otherwise be

JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's major
vigilante group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad),
Tuesday vowed to continue their battle for a drug and gangster
free society despite the fact that the police had declared war on
them, a Pagad official said.

Pagad's Chief National Coordinator, Abdus Salaam Ebrahim, was

He said Pagad wanted nothing less than the heads of those
police officers who gave the order to fire Friday and they also

hurt the demonstrators.

Salaam Ebrahim said Pagad knew that the police and army were

CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Guo
Zhengxin, Olympic eighth-place finisher, snatched the figure
skating men's singles gold in China's Winter Games Wednesday
night, while his challenger Li Chengjiang stumbled four times and
dropped to seventh.
</P>
<P>
Li, who beat Guo to second and led to the free skating after
Monday's short program, stumbled on his program-opening quad loop
and crashed every time on the following quad-triple attempts,
almost giving up after the third and the hardest fall.
</P>

He carried on his program with the half-packed Five Rings

seventh.
</P>

Guo, who skated to a lackluster free skating program with some
half-finished jumps, escaped with a gold medal which he thought a

<P>
"He (Li) didn't finished his training this morning," Guo said.
"I guess he might be injured."

<P>
"Li strained his back in Monday's short program," his coach
Gao Haijun confirmed with tears in eyes. "We knew we could lose

Li Yunfei and Li Xia took the second and third places
respectively.

Feng Zuojian says that if the creature really exists and has
been seen hundreds of times, why is it described in so many
different ways?
</P>
<P>
When the Shennongjia forest was examined several years ago,
scientists found that the environment of the mainly coniferous
forest had been destroyed somewhat, but that the essential living
condition for the creature, like broad-leaved trees and berries,
were not enough, according to Pan Wenshi, a life sciences
professor at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang Wanbo, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, says
that although the creature may not exist today, perhaps it did
several hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although its possible existence has largely been ignored by
mainstream scientists, several thousand people have claimed to
have encountered it and very large unexplained footprints have
indeed been found in forested parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guoxing, of the Beijing Museum of Natural History, says
that there are still many mysteries in nature like Bigfoot and
UFOs that will still cause investigators to go and have a look.
</P>
<P>
But, Pan Wenshi cautions, protecting the environment rather
than looking for mythical creatures is a far more pressing task
in China now.

<HEADLINE> China Not Taking Part In Search For Bigfoot (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China will not support the
search for Bigfoot, the legendary large, hairy, man-like
creature, which has been reported for years in the forests of
Shennongjia in Hubei Province, according to a State Forestry
Administration official.
</P>
<P>
The official says the administration opposes the reward of
500,000 yuan (60,000 U.S. dollars) that is being offered by the
tourism department of Shennongjia to anyone who finds Bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese scientists have ruled out any possibility
that the creature exist. Since the mid-1970s, Chinese scientists
have had several large-scale search for Bigfoot around
Shennongjia, but have failed to find any conclusive evidence of
the creature's existence, according to Feng Zuojian, of the C
hinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Zoology.
</P>
<P>
Both a skull and a piece of the creature's hair are needed to
prove its existence. So far, only hair or excrement that tests
later proved to have come from other animals have been found,
says Chen Xiaoyi, of China Science Popularization Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the sightings of Bigfoot were reported in areas that
were not far from towns, and I hardly believe they exist so close
to human activities," Chen says.
</P>
<P>
The creature is said to average six and a half feet in height
and to have left large footprints of up to sixteen inches and to
be covered with thick brown or red or white hair.

<HEADLINE> Sports Minister Says Wembley Sale Boosts World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tony Banks, British sports
minister, said on Wednesday that the sale of Wembley Stadium
could be a boost to England's bid for the the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Wembley Plc said earlier that it had agreed to sell the venue
for 103 million pounds (169 million U.S. dollars), ending months
of uncertainty and clearing the way for the development of a new
national stadium on the site.
</P>
<P>
The new stadium is central to England's 2006 bid and Banks
said until the sale was settled the bid was being held back.
</P>
<P>
"Now we know it is secure we can go into the last 12 months
(of the bidding period) on a high," said Banks.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are ready to move pretty fast. There is a great deal
of national pride and prestige behind it."
</P>
<P>
Banks said there were still a number of issues to be raised,
including the future of the stadium's famous twin towers which,
at the very least, will have to be moved, but said he was
delighted by the sale.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the new stadium would be ready in time for th
e 2002 F.A. Cup final but said a more realistic target was the
following year, when the new stadium hopes to host the world
athletics championships.
</P>
<P>
On the 2006 World Cup bid, Banks said: "We have a very, very
strong case and we maintain we are the number one contender.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very tight contest but there are only 24 people to
persuade -- the members of FIFA (executive committee)."
</P>
<P>
Banks said he was annoyed with some sections of the media who
have not given full support to the bid.
</P>
<P>
"I would like people to realise this is a national effort
which has the full backing of (Prime Minister) Tony Blair and the
government," said Banks.
</P>
<P>
Seven other countries bidding for the 2006 World Cup are
Germany, Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and M
orocco.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Nuclear Weapons Cooperation With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday dismissed recent
allegations made by U.S. officials about weapons cooperation
between Iran and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Asefi condemned the statements "which violate Iran's natural
right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes," the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
U.N. National Security adviser Sandy Berger on Tuesday
announced economic sanctions on three Russian institutions for
"directly supporting Iran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The sanction bans all exports to and imports from the Moscow
Aviation Institute, the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical University
and the Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power and
Technology, which were accused of failing to prevent leaks of
nuclear and missile technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Berger stressed that continued contacts and commerce with Iran
on nuclear weapon and missile technology is a threat to the United
States, to Russia and to the world.
</P>
<P>
last July, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on seven Russian
institutes and factories on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that Berger's statements were aimed
at diverting public attention from Washington's "unsparing
support" for Israel, which is "a potential threat to the region
for possessing all kinds of destructive weapons."
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Iran's missile industries are completely
indigenous and that Iran does not rely on any country to this end.
</P>
<P>
Iran is not after stockpiling atomic weapons and its military
facilities play solely defensive roles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian embassy in Moscow on Wednesday also
denied the allegations that Iran was engaged in missile and
nuclear cooperation with the three Russian institutions.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said in a statement that the allegations were
repetition of the same old accusations already denied by both
Iranian and Russian officials.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Trade Deficit Down by 47 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit
decreased by 47.4 percent during the first half of the 1998-99
fiscal year compared with that of the same period in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the current fiscal year (July 1, 1998
to June 30, 1999), the country's trade deficit fell to 594 million
U.S. dollars from 1,130 million dollars in the same period of the
previous fiscal year, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive strategy worked out by the government has led
to considerable improvement in the balance of trade despite the
staggering economic climate confronting the country in the wake of
economic sanctions, the report quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has set the target of bringing the
trade deficit down to a zero level through various pragmatic
measures including bringing down imports, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Total imports during the first six months (July-December) of
the 1998-99 fiscal year fell by 19.6 percent to 4,397 million
dollars from 5,472 million dollars during the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the amount of total exports also showed a downward
trend, decreasing by 12.4 percent from the previous year's 4,342
million dollars to 3,803 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here are of the view that widespread economic recession
in Asia, sharp decline in the prices of products in the world
market and the economic sanctions imposed on Pakistan by the West
have resulted in the reduction in the country's imports and
exports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Outlines This Year's Water Control Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
presented the major principles and tasks of water-control
projects this year at a national conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He asked all parts of the country to implement major river
control plans and to repair damaged water control works, as
detailed by the State Council after last summer's devastating
floods.
</P>
<P>
This year's 10 major principles, he said, are needed for a
country that has been hit by floods and drought and an equal
effort is needed to improve the country's ability to fight both.
</P>
<P>
There will be an overall plan for the development and
protection of water resources and prevention of soil erosion, he
said. Key water control projects will need a scientific study and
will be subject to comparisons and project supervision for the
whole process of construction. Project safety should be above
all, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Because China has a serious water problem, conservation
methods like spray and drip irrigation will be used in all parts
of the country. And, to ensure development, China will stop the
felling of natural forests on the upper reaches of major rivers
and will open up new water resources, he said.

<HEADLINE> Unbeaten Bayi Rockets Runs Winning Streak to Six Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (xinhua) -- National player Liu Yudong
scored a game-high 26 points to lead defending chamion Bayi
Rockets to overpower hosts Jiangsu Dagons 126-92 in the sixth
round of the Chinese first division basketball league in Nanjing
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, fourth time champion since Chinese basketball
introduced the professional league in 1995, remained unbeaten and
proved they enjoyed a comfortable advantage over the other 11
teams.
</P>
<P>
 The dragons, whoes twice regular season MVP Hu Weidong was
sidelined because of an injury, counted on Zhang Guodong and
American Gree Roberson to open an early lead 10-9 right after the
start.
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockets took command very soon thanks to national
star center Wang Zhizhi and finish the first half 59-47.
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Rockets never slowed down their pace in the
second half and swept to victory with ease.
</P>
<P>
 Roberson and Liu Guodong led the Dragons with 19 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
 "Hu's absence dealt a heavy blow to us. We should have done
better if he had not been injured," said Li Changshan, head coach
of the Dragons.
</P>
<P>
 But Li admitted that the Rockets are much stronger than
them. "I have never expected to beat them. There's a big gap
between us."
</P>
<P>
 Liaoning Hunters took their fifth win in six games to remain
the second place in the team standings, beating Jilin Northeast
Tigers 135-112 on a home turf in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
 But the hero of the match was Northeast Tiger's national
forward Sun Jun, who scored a game-high 40 points including a
round-high nine three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
 It was a see-saw game in the first half, which ended 59-55
in the Hunters' favor. But the Hunters stepped up offence in the
second and extended the lead to 99-76 after the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
 "We're too weak in rebounds. I think this is the most
important reason to explain our loss," said Zhang Xiaochun, head
coach of the Northeast Tigers.
</P>
<P>
 In the other matches, Hongyuan Guangdong Tigers beat Jinan
Army Pegasus 100-76, Zhejiang Cyclone routed Shanghai Sharks
115-108, Beijing Aoshen ousted Beijing Ducks 88-79, Shandong
Flaming Bulls defeated Sichuan Pandas 96-78.

<HEADLINE> German Lowest Inflation Since Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Falling fuel and food prices
helped cut inflation in Germany to a post-reunification low of
just 0.9 per cent in 1998, half the 1.8 per cent rise recorded the
year before, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Statistics Office said there was no month-to-month
increase from November to December. In December itself, prices
were just 0.5 per cent higher than 12 months earlier. In November
the year-to-year rise was 0.7 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The average 1998 rate was the lowest since the office began to
compile combined data for eastern and western Germany in 1991, the
first full calendar year after reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, then-West Germany had an inflation rate of just 0.2
per cent.
</P>
<P>
The office said last year's favorable price trends chiefly
were the result of dropping oil prices, a decline which more than
compensated for the one percentage point increase, to 16 per cent,
in the value-added tax last April.
</P>
<P>
On average, heating oil prices fell 24.6 per cent and fuel
prices by 7.4 per cent compared with 1997, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Besides more favorable oil and fuel prices, food costs were
also much cheaper during the course of 1998, the report showed.
Meat prices fell 2.1 per cent, fruit by 9.3 per cent and coffee by
3.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The office said that Germany's inflation outlook for 1999 would
remain favourable.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials prices were expected to remain depressed due to
lower demand resulting from the crises in Russia, Asia and Latin
America, while overcapacity in major industrial sectors around the
world, coupled with cost-cutting efforts by corporations, would
serve to keep prices in check.
</P>
<P>
The report follows predicts by the chief economists of the
three big Frankfurt-based banks, Deutsche, Dresdner and
Commerzbank, that German inflation this year would be between 0.9
and 1.3 per cent.

<HEADLINE> 21 Suspected Terrorist Arrested in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 21 operatives for a
dozen of the world's most notorious terrorist groups have been
arrested in Canada in the past nine years, the National Post
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those caught by Canadian authorities since 1991 include
members of the radical Islamic group Hezbollah, the anti-western
Mujahedin, a shadowy Middle Eastern commando group named Force
17, and Black September, part of the Libya-based Abu Nidal
organization.
</P>
<P>
the 21 operatives, all considered national-security risks,
were arrested under a federal anti-terrorism law, the newspaper
quoted Canadian immigration officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
14 have been deported and another six are still waiting to be
tried. One deportation attempt was rejected by the courts, added
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
While the number of suspected terrorists picked up across the
country remains small, their affiliation to a range of
organizations responsible for some of the worst acts of violence
of the past two decades is a concern to those charged with
safeguarding the security of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists are attracted to Canada for a variety of reasons,
officials said, ranging from using the country to raise funds for
arms purchases, to its easy access to the United States.
</P>
<P>
A rising concern is the growth of Islamic terrorism, officials
said, particularly since the call-to-arms issued in the wake of
the American and British bombing campaigns in Iraq, which
followed the break-down of United Nations weapons inspection
efforts established after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
As part of its anti-terrorism efforts, Canada screens
thousands of visitors and applicants for immigration every year
to ensure they are not security risks.

KUNMING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Some warm weather pants in the
capital of China's Yunnan Province will have to brace themselves
for another round of low temperature in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Kunming is popularly known as the "Spring City" because of its
warm weather. Many people here have never seen snow in their
lives. But, a sudden drop in temperatures and a heavy snowfall
recently are posing a threat to some of the luxuriant plants
here, especially tropical and subtropical ones that have been
moved here in preparation for the World Horticulture Exposition
that will open here in May.
</P>
<P>
At the most important exposition site, a third of the
plastic-covered greenhouses collapsed under the weight of the
newly-fallen snow and the branches of at least a hundred trees
had cracked.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has appealed to local army units for
help and they have responded with 1,500 men who are helping
remove the snow from the exposition's plants and more will be
billeted at the exposition site tonight and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to the local meteorology station, the temperatures,
which were back up today, are expected to drop considerably more,
and one meteorologist commented that, "Anything could happen."
</P>

The exposition's organizers are trying everything possible to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions against Russian Organizations Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Wednesday strongly criticized the U.S. for applying
sanctions against Russian organizations, saying "the use of force
or sanctions against our organizations are counter-productive in
Russian-U.S. relations, to which we attach great importance,"
said the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed economic sanctions Tuesday against
three Russian institutions and accused them of transferring
rocket and nuclear technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were directed against Mendeleyev Chemical
Technology University, the Research Institute of Energy
Technology and the Moscow Aviation Institute.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot comment on this information right now," Primakov
said. "I must study it in all its aspects, and study the
conditions of the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted in a
statement that the U.S. sanctions against the three Russian
institutes "may complicate Russian-American relations.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the latest moves by the United States will not go
unanswered," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said it intends to raise this issue at
the highest political level during Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's upcoming visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russian investigatory agencies revealed that the charges of
assisting Iran in implementing missile and nuclear programs,
brought against three Russian institutes, "Are unfounded,"
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
"the U.S. administration's moves are at odds with the
agreements on the development of bilateral cooperation on
non-proliferation and in export control, which were reached by
the Russian and American presidents in September 1998."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mendeleyev University Rector Pavel Sarkisov said
the U.S. decision to apply sanctions to three Russian
organizations was "absolutely groundless".
</P>
<P>
He said the Chemical Technology University "is not engaged in
any nuclear research and has no direct or covert agreements with
Iran."
</P>
<P>
"We have offered all the persons concerned, including
Americans, to visit our educational institutions and to draw
their own conclusions."

WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. warplanes
patrolling the northern no-fly zone on Wednesday attacked Iraqis
radar sites, the third such incident this week, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force F-15 and F-16 jet fighters encountered Iraqi
radar at five or more air defense sites at about the same time.
They fired high-speed, anti-radiation missiles and AGM-130
precision-guided bombs in response, and early indications were
that two AGM-130s scored direct hits, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 3 a.m.(0800GMT)
</P>
<P>
All the U.S. warplanes returned safely to their bases in Turkey
after attacking the Iraqi air defense radar sites near the city of
Mosul, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's attack was the seventh such incident in the past
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon spokesman said there also were two Iraqi
incursions into the no-fly zone over southern Iraq on Wednesday.
He said no U.S. planes were in the area at the time.

<HEADLINE> China's Fifth Peak Of Criminal Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China is now going through a
fifth peak of criminal activity, with crimes reported in the
mid-1990s running about 8 times what they were more than a decade
ago, according to Cao Feng, an associate professor at Chinese Peo
ple's University of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Cao has told Procuratorial Daily that current criminal
activities include more serious cases like armed robberies at
financial institutions and jewelry shops.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile delinquency, abuse of power by officials, dru
g-related crimes, and pornography have all become problems in
China, Cao told the paper, and attributed their cause to a change
in systems and the social framework. Because society as a whole
is more vain and because the legal system is not complete, she s
ays, the number of law breakers is on the rise in China.
</P>
<P>
Cao suggests a more dynamic and comprehensive security network
for the family, society, and schools to stop criminal activities
during this peak period.
</P>
<P>
The first peak came after the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, and was characterized by
counter-revolutionary activities and a survival of earlier
problems.
</P>
<P>
The second peak came in the 1960s when China had a series of
natural disasters that led to an increase in the number of cases
of theft of property.
</P>
<P>
China had a third and fourth peak of criminal activities
during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and at the beginning
of the reform and opening-up period in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP and LP Reach Agreement on Paving Way for Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) and the Liberal Party (LP) on Wednesday struck an agreement
on key policy issues concerning security, and paving the way for
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to reshuffle his cabinet to launch a
LDP-LP coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Japan's Self Defense Forces (SDF) will
"actively participate and cooperate" in U.N. peacekeeping
missions if they are authorized by U.N. resolutions and if Japan
is asked by the United Nations to contribute its forces, party
officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the SDF will not participate in battles and will not take
part in activities that are integrated in missions that involve
the use of force, such as the shipment of goods to battle zones,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also agreed that a decision on whether the SDF
can participate in certain missions will be made by the cabinet
on a case-by-case basis, they said.
</P>
<P>
Policies concerning the role the SDF can play in U.N. missions
differed between the two parties and had been a sticking point in
the two parties' negotiations for the formation of a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have been squabbling over policy differences
on defense since the coalition was first proposed last November.
</P>
<P>
On a set of bills for implementing the updated guidelines for
defense cooperation between Japan and the United States, the two
parties basically agreed to support the bills, but will continue
talks on some points in the bills, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Japan and the U.S. updated the 1979 defense
guidelines to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in
the event of emergencies in "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
The package of bills, which was submitted by the government
last April, is expected to be deliberated in the coming regular
Diet (parliament) session, which convenes January 19.

<HEADLINE> China's Export Increase: Hard to Come By (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's exports increased only
0.5 percent in 1998, but even that modest figure was hard won
with pressure from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's imports and exports were down 0.4 percent from the
previous year, but exports overall were worth 183.76 billion U.S.
dollars, up 0.5 percent, according to Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
The year was unexpectedly hard on China's exporters. The
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
suggested export growth of 10 percent early in 1998 after
considering the Asian financial turmoil. But its negative effects
went far beyond what people expected. Export decreased almost
monthly after March, and fell continuously from August to
November. During that period, they were the lowest in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Southeast Asia and China's other neighbors,
where most of China's exports go, were hit hard by the financial
crisis and exports were down dramatically because of currency
devaluations.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asia were worth 98.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998,
down 9.9 percent from a year before. The slow-down in the global
economy lowered the price of raw materials and other products,
meaning less income from exports.

<P>
The Chinese Government promptly made adjustments, lowering
bank interest rates several times last year to encourage exports
and cut operation costs.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC officials held several seminars for foreign trade
departments and trade companies and had a vigorous export
encouragement policy. It also asked trade officials and companies
to make a great effort up to the last minute of 1998 to reach the
target.
</P>
<P>
Some provincial governments came up with policies to encourage
local trade companies to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
Through this joint effort, exports brought things out of the
red in the last month of 1998. December's exports were worth 20
billion U.S. dollars, up 4.3 percent from the same month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other parts of the world, especially the United
States and Europe, were also up a great deal. Exports to the
United States were worth 37.98 billion U.S. dollars, up 16.1
percent, and to the EU, 28.15 billion U.S. dollars, up 18.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
This growth in 1998 was not easy to come by, compared with
some Asian nations which scored a sharp decrease in exports.

<HEADLINE> Central Discipline Inspection Commission Holds Plenum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held
its third plenary session in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The main topics for discussion were a review of improvements
in the Party's work, building a clean government and fighting
corruption in 1998, and objectives for the new year.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, reported that progress had been made in
building cleaner government and opposing corruption, especially
in curbing extravagance and waste in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Party and government organizations at or above the county
level have found 569,000 unwarranted telephones at the homes of
Party and government officials and 383,000 mobile phones
purchased with public funds. A new management system for phones
is expected to help cut public expenditure by 2.5 billion yuan
annually, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, China had suspended construction work,
or expansion work and decoration on 11,000 office buildings,
canceled 22,000 celebration activities and called off overseas
visits by 7,400 groups.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee, said that discipline inspection
departments had received reports of more than 1.61 million cases
of corruption by the end of November, investigated 142,000 cases,
and reached a decision on 124,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
Of Party members who were penalized, 3,970 were officials at
the county magistrate level and 304 were above the prefecture
commissioner level, including the former secretary of Beijing's
Municipal Party Committee, Chen Xitong.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with these cases successfully, discipline
inspection departments recovered 4.66 billion yuan (about 560
million U.S. dollars) in what would otherwise have been losses,
Wei reported.
</P>
<P>
The country had canceled the collection of 9,000 unreasonable
fees of various kinds aimed at farmers by the end of October,
reducing farmers' burdens by 6.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 21,000 kinds of fees levied on enterprises were
stopped, saving them a total of 80 billion yuan, he said.

in a combined time of two minutes 12.28 seconds, beating France's
Maxence Idesheim to second in 2:13.36 and Austrian Stefan
Kaltschuetz third in 2:13.83.
</P>
<P>
However, reigning champion Thomas Prugger of Italy skied out
in the first leg on the hard, icy Goetschen piste, and Olympic
champion Ross Rebagliati of Canada dropped out of contention by
losing over two seconds in a shaky first run.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Nicolas Huet, who led after the first leg, fell on
the lower part of the course in the second leg. He managed to
complete his run but finished outside the top five.
</P>
<P>
Ebner burst into the limelight by scoring his first World Cup
win in a parallel giant slalom last week in Morzine, France.

<HEADLINE> Childhood Asthma Cases rise in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cases of asthma among children
across Canada jumped dramatically over the last two decades,
according to the latest government data.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Canada study released Tuesday concludes that
between 1978 and 1995 there was more than a four-fold increase in
childhood asthma cases.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, an estimated 2.5 percent of
children under age 15, or about 141,000, were diagnosed with
asthma in 1978-79. By 1994-95, 11.2 percent of children had
asthma, or about 672,000.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the study period, asthma was more commonly reported
among boys than girls. In 1978-79, 3.4 percent of boys and 1.6
percent of girls had asthma. By 1994-95, 13 percent of boys and 9
percent of girls had it. According to the study, boys are also
more likely to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The data also indicates that children in middle-income
households have a significantly lower incidence of asthma,
compared with those in both lower-and-higher-income households.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Intervene in UK Pinochet Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) - Britain's highest court on
Wednesday granted Chile the right to be represented in a
rehearing of whether former leader Augusto Pinochet enjoys
immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong for them to be excluded." Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, chairman of a House of Lords appeal committee,
said after granting Chile's application.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the Chilean government, Laurence Collins, said
he would argue in the rehearing that Pinochet, as a former head
of state, has immunity under international law from facing
charges of torture, murder and kidnap.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely elementary under international law that only
the state has the right to waive immunity," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
The rehearing was made possible by Pinochet's lawyers after
they argued to the House of Lords that one of the five judges,
who ruled in November by three to two that Pinochet was not
immune from prosecution, had close connections with the human
rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
The rehearing on Pinochet's immunity is scheduled for next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is now under police guard in a mansion in the
suburb of London. A Spanish judge accused him of responsibility
for the death and disappearance of 3,000 people during his
1973-1990 rule, and wanted him extradited to Spain to face
charges.

TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi returned here Tuesday afternoon after wrapping up an
eight-day visit to France, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, which took place soon after the European
single currency euro was launched, Obuchi campaigned for a
tripartite financial world divided by the dollar, the euro and
the yen, and for governments to move to ensure exchange rate
stability.
</P>
<P>
In talks with leaders of the three European countries, Obuchi
also sought their cooperation to control fluctuations among the
three major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Hidden beneath the call for cooperation, analysts pointed out,
was Japan's fear that the yen may be relegated to a local
currency in the shadows of the euro and dollar.

MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday identified the gunmen who raided a market in Marawi
city, capital of the province of Lanao del Sur in the southern
Philippines, as members of a new small group seeking independence
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said that Philippine
President Joseph Estrada has ordered the Armed Forces of the
Philippines to run after the 40 heavily armed men who raided the
market.
</P>
<P>
He clarified earlier newspaper reports that members of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have allegedly rounded up 42
suspected drug pushers in the market.
</P>
<P>
He said that verified reports showed that only 22 persons were
rounded up, but 15 of them have already been released to the
Provincial Crisis Committee whose members include representatives
of the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the incident was caused by either a "local turf
war" between drug syndicates or intention to promote a new group's
call for independence.

<HEADLINE> Mount Batur in Indonesia's Bali Again Spews Out Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Mount Batur in Indonesia's Bali
has again spewed out white smoke and red-hot blaze and sent off
the smell of lava, but it is yet to pose a danger to the community
living around it.
</P>
<P>
"To avoid any uncalled for matters, however, domestic and
foreign mountaineers are not allowed to climb this mountain
temporarily. The mountain is on an alert status," third assistant
to Bangli regional secretary Wayan Suarka told Antara News Agency
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the thick smoke the mountain spewed out Tuesday
afternoon was visible from Kintamani, a tourist resort, followed
by a strong smell of sulfur blown everywhere by quite a strong
wind.
</P>
<P>
The red-hot blaze spewed out from the crater in the western
part of the mountain was originally hot smoke that the mountain
has been sending out in the past few year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the hot smoke has gotten thicker and thicker
and gone up higher and higher, interspersed with the spewing out
of red-hot blaze, particularly during the night when it can reach
as high as 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the belching out of thick smoke, coupled
sometimes with the spewing out of red-hot blaze, the western part
of the mountain foot is now covered with black dust, just like
what happened when the mountain erupted in the middle of 1997 and
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mount Batur offers tourists a beautiful natural panorama which
brings together a mountain, a valley and a lake, all alluringly
visible from Kintamani, some 50 kilometers to the northeast of
Denpasar, capital of Bali province.

<HEADLINE> British Judges Hear New Applications on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) - Three top British judges began
hearing lawyers' applications on Wednesday into whether former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is entitled to immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The judges from the House of Lords, Britain's highest court of
appeal, were hearing applications from lawyers representing the
Chilean government and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers were asking for permission to intervene in the
case, which is due to come before Britain's highest court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Five law lords ruled 3-2 that 83-year-old
Pinochet, currently living under police guard in a mansion in the
suburb of London, was eligible for extradition to Spain despite
his status as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
But the House of Lords, in an unprecedented move last month,
overturned its own verdict when Pinochet's lawyers argued that
one of the five judges had close links with human rights group
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital on October 16 while
recovering from minor back surgery.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused Pinochet of being responsible for the
deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his
17-year rule in Chile, which ended in 1990, and wanted the
retired general to be extradited to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
However, Pinochet said in a London court in December that he
does not recognize any court outside Chile.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Take Important Steps on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An official of Libyan Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has said that Libya
is to take important practical steps toward a solution to the
Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after talks between Libyan officials
and Prince Bandar Ibn Sultan, special envoy of Saudi King Fahd,
and Jakes Gerwel, envoy of South African President Nelson Mandela,
Tuesday evening, Libyan News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said wide discussions have been made and all
parties concerned entertained the goodwill to cooperate in search
of a solution.
</P>
<P>
Consultations and efforts in this direction are ongoing to
overcome the existing obstacles facing the trial of two Libyans
suspected of bombing a U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988, leading to the death of 270 people, the
official said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Prince Bandar said "we are currently
trying to help lift the embargo on Libya for good, and our visit
to Libya is in support of the brotherly Libyan people."
</P>
<P>
But he did not tell the content of the initiative of Saudi
Arabia and South Africa he brought here to push the Lockerbie
issue toward a final solution to totally lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Gaddafi has agreed to a second round of talks
Wednesday for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. slapped an air-travel ban on Libya in 1992 after
Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi refused to surrender the two
suspects for trial in the U.S. and Britain, saying they will never
get a fair trial in either country.
</P>
<P>
A compromise was made when the U.S. and Britain agreed the
suspects can be tried in the Netherlands before a panel of
Scottish judges according to Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed in principle to turn over the suspects, but
said arrangments should be made beforehand for their security and
if convicted, they should serve their prison terms in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has good relations with the Libyan leader, talked
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair during his visit to South
Africa on January 6 on the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi envoy has reportedly close connection with
Washington. The two envoys arrived at Tripoli international
airport on a Saudi jet Tuesday afternoon, which was granted a
special permission to fly into Libya by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has decided that the sanctions will
be suspended once the two suspects are surrendered.

<HEADLINE> Villa Manager Gregory Appeals to Hoddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Aston Villa manager John Gregory is urging Glenn Hoddle to step
in and stop central defender Gareth Barry being chosen for the
World Under-20 Championships.
</P>
<P>
Barry is a near certainty for Football Association technical
director Howard Wilkinson's squad for the three-week tournament
in Nigeria in April.
</P>
<P>
But Gregory believes that rising star Barry, already an
under-21 international, will gain more experience that will stand
him in good stead with England by playing in the Premiership
rather than a youth tournament.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "Gareth will be more beneficial to Glenn Hoddle
if he is playing in the Premiership rather than an under-20
tournament in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"The next best thing to playing for the England senior team is
to be playing at the game's highest level in this country.
</P>
<P>
"Premiership experience is even more beneficial than playing
for the England under-21 side. I cannot see the reasoning in
Gareth going away for a tournament like this when he can be
involved in Premiership games."
</P>
<P>
Gregory also believes that Villa's involvement in the title
chase should be taken into consideration by Wilkinson when
selecting his squad.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "Some players who are called up will be squad
members at their clubs but Gareth is an established first-team
player.
</P>
<P>
"There's every chance he will be called up but I would like to
think I would have the full support of the England manager in
this instance."

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Gets Exclusive Right to Develop DPRK's Mount Kumgang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Hyundai Group has
been guaranteed the exclusive right to develop the Kumgang
Mountain into a tourist resort in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang promised to grant Hyundai exclusive rights to build
and use various facilities, including hot springs, ski resorts,
and hotels in and around Mount Kumgang on DPRK's east coast for
more than 30 years, Kim Yoon-kyu, chief of Hyundai's North Korean
Project, said on arrival in Seoul from China Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have received confirmation of the guarantee from the North
Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and a North Korean trader who
is involved,'' said Kim, who discussed the controversial
guarantee with DPRK officials in Beijing early this week.
</P>
<P>
The document guaranteeing Hyundai's exclusive rights will be
delivered later from the DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government did not authorize Hyundai's
revised Mount Kumgang project due to the DPRKs' early refusal to
offer a written guarantee to the group.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to deposit 25 million U.S. dollars in a North Korean
bank account in a third country, possibly in China, upon
receiving the approval from the Unification Ministry (of South
Korea) on the revised application for the development project,''
said Kim.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK threatened to halt the development of Mount Kumgang
tourism if Hyundai did not pay the 25 million U.S. dollars
immediately for the exclusive right before the promised deadline.
</P>
<P>
The payment of the 25 million dollars will be the first
installment of the 940 million dollars Hyundai has promised to
pay over the next six years for allowing South Korean tourists to
visit Mount Kumgang.
</P>
<P>
However, Hyundai failed to pay the sum due to the South Korean
government's refusal to authorize the revised application.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is expected to meet Thursday to
give the green light to Hyundai for its Mount Kumgang project and
the payment of 25 million dollars to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament to Discuss Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of Nepali
Parliament will discuss Thursday a confidence motion tabled by
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on January 1, Speaker Ram
Chandra Poudel told the house session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Poudel expressed the hope that all political parties would help
conduct the house proceedings in a very systematic manner.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier that the main agenda of the winter session of
parliament was the vote of confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that the government is committed to making
upcoming elections free and fair, and all parties should cooperate
for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
"If all parties join the government, it will be helpful to set
an example in international forum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the tri-partite government formed in late
December 1998, the sixth since the mid-term polls in November
1994, is to conduct free, fair and impartial elections by
March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached in December 1998 between the Nepali
Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), the two main ruling partners, in order
to form a national government for elections, the government is
open to other parties represented in parliament which are wishful
to enter.
</P>
<P>
The faction of the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by
former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand has talked with the
ruling parties over its entry into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that after winning the vote of confidence in the
house, Prime Minister Koirala will ask King Birendra to dissolve
parliament for fresh polls. Usually the winter session of
parliament in Nepal lasts for two months.
</P>
<P>
As it enjoys a majority in the house, there will be no problem
for the government to obtain the confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition was formed after the
three-and-half-a-month coalition between the Nepali Congress and
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) broke up
in December 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Now the CPN-ML is the main opposition party in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Mother Baboon Kills Her Baby in Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Arabian baboon in the
Chongqing Zoo recently ate her newborn cub as visitors to the zoo
looked on, according to the latest issue of the Yangcheng Evening
News.
</P>
<P>
Zoo workers said they were surprising at this extreme behavior
of the mother baboon who had been taking good care of her
one-month-old baby, the Guangzhou-based paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, this was the second such incident
among the baboons in the zoo. Previously, a male baboon with a
high position in the ape hierarchy violently tore a younger
baboon to pieces.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that many males in the animal kingdom take to
killing younger members of their species who threaten their
social position.
</P>
<P>
However, they could not explain the eccentric behavior of this
mother killer, and scientists plan to investigate further, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies To Be Listed On NASDAQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Frank Zarb, the president of
the U.S. National Association of Securities Dealers and CEO of
NASDAQ, says that this year the first group of Chinese companies
will be listed on NASDAQ, the second biggest stock market in the
United States and the world's first computerized stock market.
</P>
<P>
Three to six companies will be a good target, he says, and if
they perform well and the results are good, then more will follow.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Securities Dealers and NASDAQ have had
discussions with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the
country's securities market watchdog, on personnel exchanges and
professional training and have agreed to launch a joint website
soon.
</P>
<P>
NASDAQ has some 6,000 corporations, including 500 from outside
the U.S. The criterion for listing is simply "high quality," Zarb
said, and that could translate into strong leadership, products
or services with potential profitability, and company integrity.

<HEADLINE> South Australia to Further Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua)-- With the announcement of
several key initiatives that have been put into place, Premier of
the State of South Australia John Olsen said here today that his
current trip in China has been "valuable" with "productive and cor
dial" talks with relevant government departments.
</P>
<P>
Olsen met with Premier Zhu Rongji yesterday and he described
the meeting as significant since it shows the importance of South
Australia to the Government of China.
</P>
<P>
According to him, South Australia-based Architect Woodhead
International have won a 55 million US dollar contract to develop
and preserve a key residential district in Shanghai. "The
intention with this project is to preserve the historical
character and texture of the existing area which has an estimated
population of 4,000 and comprises 65,000 square meters. It will
also provide valuable export revenue for South Australia." he said
</P>
<P>
Also, a South Australian company is selling its library
automation system to the Shanghai Library - the second largest in
China, and a number of Shanghai universities are using this
package.
</P>
<P>
South Australia Water has signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with the Shanghai Municipal Waterworks focusing on exchange of
expertise and the provision of technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, South Australia will open a commercial
representative office in Beijing, with similar offices already
set up in Jinan, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The state will also help
establish a new hospitality and hotel training school for 500
students for the Beijing hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
South Australia will look for more co-operative opportunities
with China in the educational, manufacturing, and the mineral
processing sectors, and explore more business opportunities
between South-Australia based companies and their Chinese
counterparts, he added.
</P>
<P>
South Australia, one of the six states of Australia, covers
about 984,000 square kilometers and hosts a population of 1.5
million. China, overtaking Japan, stood as the state's largest
export market last year. Its major export products are grain,
wool and minerals.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Agree To Increase Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, China's
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and
his Portuguese counterpart Joaquim Pina Moura agreed here today
that there will be concrete measures to increase trade relations
and economic cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the 4th meeting of the
Sino-Portuguese Mixed Committee on Commerce and Trade, where Shi
said that a group of Chinese business people will visit Portugal
this year to learn more about the country and seek opportunities
for cooperation, in a trip organized by MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese enterprises are welcome to trade fairs and to
exhibit goods and technology in China, and to invest in China, he
said, pointing out that trade between the two countries only
accounts for a tiny proportion of their overall foreign trade.
Investment has just started, he said, and there is potential in
bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Annual trade between
China and Portugal is worth about 200 million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
Moura said that the Portuguese Government is not satisfied
with the current trade and economic cooperation with China, and
is determined to increase relations.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China will handle trade and economic cooperation
with Macao in accordance with the principle of "one country, two
systems" after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mainland and Macao are two different tariff
zones, so business will be done in accordance with international
norms. He said he hopes that China and Portugal will contribute
to the prosperity and stability of Macao and make it a bridge in
between China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two ministers signed an agreement on
the talks, and representatives of the Northern China Electric
Group and the Welding and Quality Research Institute of Portugal
signed a letter of intent on cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 1,700-year-old Tower No Longer Leans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A 1,700-year-old tower in
downtown Shanghai recently saw its leaning come to an end under
the careful supervision of local experts.
</P>
<P>
The ancient brick-and-wood tower, built during the Three
Kingdoms Period (220 - 265), had been tilted by 50 centimeters,
the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lack of renovation had brought about the tower's weathering
and cracking to the point where it leaned to a gradient of 4.73
percent, or eight times the acceptable degree, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has pledged to carefully monitor the
tower while landscaping work for a new entertainment center
nearby is underway.
</P>
<P>
Experts directed workers to consolidate the tower base and
prevent it from tilting even further, and architects will keep
the tower under close observation.
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities also plan to alter the major road
passing through the area near the tower, the newspaper said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China recovered defaulted tax
payments of over 20 billion yuan in 1998, according to figures
released during the on-going national work conference on taxation.
</P>
<P>
Twelve billion yuan of the total involved defaulted taxes
payable before last year, with the figure accounting for 36
percent of the pre-1998 amount outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China accelerated efforts to determine
the actual amount of overdue taxes, with the effort yielding tax
payments of over 46 billion yuan. Tax departments collected 15.7
billion yuan more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments at all levels strengthened the clamp down
on tax evasions. Over 2.24 million businesses were charged with
tax evasion during 1998. The recovery of evaded taxes increased
revenues by 2.33 billion yuan on 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenues for 1998 hit 850 billion yuan, up 100
billion yuan on the previous year.

The NPC chairman said the law should provide solutions for
"triangular" and overlapping debt which continue to plague the
Chinese economy, as well as protect the economy from the adverse
impact of the ongoing financial crisis engulfing most of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Discussions during the seminars focused mainly on the validity
of verbal contracts, and the fine line between unpredictable
external changes and normal business risks.
</P>
<P>
The current draft law only recognizes the validity of written
contracts, including fax and e-mail agreements, and the status of
verbal contracts must be settled forthwith.
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders voiced approval for related stipulations and
noted the difficulty in verifying verbal contracts. They also
noted that the new rule will help to reduce the number of
contract disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Safety should be the priority, but efficiency must not be
ignored," according to Jiang Ping, a professor at the University
of Politics and Law.
</P>
<P>
The law should recognize verbal contracts which are commonly
used by small businesses, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hongbin, president of a local court in east China's
Zhejiang Province, said that courts have in most cases partially
recognized the validity of verbal contracts. He added that it
would be inappropriate for the law to make verbal contracts
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Jurists and attorneys suggested detailed additions to address
different situations.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Urged to Create More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting of labor
specialists and employment planners on Wednesday urged Asian
countries to create more jobs in an effort to prevent social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Jongchai
Thiengtham told the opening session that creating jobs should be a
policy priority of Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Delegates representing employers, workers and governments from
12 countries were attending the meeting, organized by the
International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
"Employment is no longer likely to be viewed as an automatic
outcome of economic growth. It is likely to be viewed as a policy
priority in its own right," said Jongchai.
</P>
<P>
He said that for many countries in the crisis-struck region
"the greatest shortfall has been in the mechanisms and
institutions of social protection and social security".
</P>
<P>
Jongchai stressed the need for social dialogue at a time when
"sacrifices need to be made and there are and will continue to be
job losers".
</P>
<P>
He said that Asia's traditional strengths of high economic
growth rates and export orientation needed to be built upon,
notably by enacting "employment policies and strategies aimed at
developing human resources to respond to labor markets".
</P>
<P>
The technical report prepared for discussion at the meeting
depicted a gloom employment situation across the region, with no
country immune to job losses.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, some 8 million jobs were lost in 1998 and the
unemployment rate could rise as high as 20 percent. In Thailand
and South Korea, the crisis sent unemployment figures from 2.2
percent to 5 percent and from less than 3 percent to 7 percent
respectively. In the Philippines, unemployment is estimated to be
at least 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the transition economies of East Asia (such as Laos and
Vietnam) and South Asian economies (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka), job quality was deteriorating, forcing people back
into casual employment and subsistence agriculture. Neither were
the developed economies unaffected by unemployment -- Japan's rate
had gradually risen to 4 percent, while in Australia and New
Zealand, rates had hovered around 8 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which runs from January 13-15, delegates are
expected to recommend measures to spur job creation, emphasizing
human resource development, social dialogue and development
planning.

<HEADLINE> Over 120,000 Corrupt Party Members Penalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 124,000 corrupt Communist
Party of China (CPC) members had been penalized by the end of
November of 1998, according to the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has 50 million members.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's third plenum which opened here
today, discipline inspection departments across the country had
received more than 1,612,000 reported cases of corruption by the
end of November of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The departments investigated 142,000 cases and brought 120,000
of them to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Of the penalized Party members, 3,970 were officials at the
county magistrate level, and 304 were above the prefecture
commissioner level, including the former secretary of the Beijing
Municipal Party Committee, Chen Xitong.
</P>
<P>
By successfully dealing with these cases, discipline
inspection departments recovered 4.66 billion yuan (about 560
million U.S. dollars) in what would otherwise have been economic
losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to introducing the legal principle of "rebus sic
stantibus", legal and economic experts expressed concern about
the difference between the overwhelming changes in external
circumstances which are beyond the control of debtors and market
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern about protecting the legitimate
interests of Chinese businesses in the foreign trade arena when
the new principle becomes part of the law.
</P>
<P>
"Rebus sic stantibus" refers to the rights of debtors when
unpredictable changes in social and economic situations affect
the execution of contracts and negotiations with creditors
concerning contract terms, as well as seeking arbitration or
court rulings.
</P>
<P>
Li said the new law should address the risk of major
fluctuations in the exchange rate to effectively reduce financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
Participants also discussed whether or not the technology
contract law should be separated and allowed to co-exist with the
new contract law. They pointed out that the Ministry of Science
and Technology has issued comprehensive administrative decrees
regarding implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Members of the judiciary welcomed the 60 pages of special
provisions contained in the draft law, and noted that judges will
have detailed rules to follow when handling related cases.
</P>
<P>
Various participants questioned the ubiquitous right of
government departments to supervise contracts.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Telephone System in Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's telephone
service has unexpectedly been in chaos after its telecommunication
department opened a new phone numbering system on January 1, South
African daily Business Day reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, perplexed at their inability to reach Swaziland by
telephone, have swamped Swazi journalists and government officials
with e-mailed inquiries about whether a coup had taken place.
</P>
<P>
The caller chaos has resulted in financial losses to businesses
and industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, two-digit area code prefixes
have been added to existing five-digit numbers. The Swaziland Post
and Telecommunications Corporation announced the change in local
newspaper advertisements, but did not inform international callers
through pre- recorded messages. As a result, callers from outside
Swaziland found old numbers ringing indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Richards, managing director of the telecommunication,
was quoted as saying that the new numbering system "was put in
place to meet international standards. Foreign phone companies
were told of the change in plenty of time, and it was their duty
to inform their customers."
</P>
<P>
Locally, there is widespread ignorance regarding the new
system, which Richards blames on "a culture where nobody reads".
Those dialling old numbers receive recorded messages saying "the
dialled number does not exist" , and advising that an information
operator be contacted.
</P>
<P>
However, many callers complained that information operators
were frequently unavailable, and some calls to correctly dialled
new numbers did not go through.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit financially has been Swaziland's tourism industry.
"We have lost bookings and customers cannot confirm bookings," a
hotel operator in the Ezulwini Valley complained.

Technology, Correctional Services and Communications, said that
they had completed their Y2K projects while the remaining
departments expect to complete them late in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was driving the
efforts of government on Y2K issues.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader Agrees to Cease Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The rebel leader of Sierra Leone
Foday Sankoh has said that he was willing to sign a truce if he is
freed and his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is recognized by
the Sierra Leonean government, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special representative Francis Okelo made the remarks
Tuesday night in Guinean capital of Conakry following a three-hour
meeting between Sankoh and West African mediators, according to
reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, Sankoh expressed his
willingness to order a cease fire and recognize the legitimacy of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah during the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
"He is 100 percent committed to peace," Okelo was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Okelo noted that West African mediators of Togolese Foreign
Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh and his Cote d'Ivoire counterpart
Amara Essy would present Sankoh's terms to President Kabbah, and
try to arrange a face-to- face talk between Sankoh and Kabbah in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who was sentenced to death by a Sierra Leone court last
October and in government custody until recently was flown from
his jail to neighboring Guinea for talks with mediators on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, witnesses said bodies littered the most streets of
the city following seven days of fighting between the West African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG and the rebels who once
controlled parts of the central and eastern city.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are burning and destroying everything in sight as
they retreat" after the ECOMOG troops launched their offensive on
Sunday, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), Kris Janowski told a news briefing in Geneva that "a
humanitarian disaster is looming in the capital (of Sierra Leone)
unless some kind of ceasefire is arranged and humanitarian
supplies can be brought in."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is quite terrifying for civilians. People are
holed up, and are not in a position to move out of their homes,
let alone flee the capital," he added.

MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed 13 people and

The worst-hit provinces are the Nampula and Cabo Delgado
provinces in the northern part of the country which are in their

</P>
<P>
Rainwater, which has drained excrement and urine everywhere,
has spread cholera virus to residential areas and thus

DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has become the
largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of attracting funds
from foreign explorers for non-ferrous minerals, the Minister of
Energy and Minerals, Abdallah Kigoda, has said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, international explorers spent 57.7 million U.S.
Dollars on Tanzanian mines, or 13.2 percent of the total in
Sub-Saharan Africa, a newspaper published here quoted Kigoda as
saying Wednesday.
</P>

The figure has outweighed Ghana which ranked second in this
regard, the minister told the Financial Times in an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited Tanzania's political stability and
prevailing peace, changed government policies in favor of private
sector as well as a prospective geographical terrain, as major
factors contributing to the growing flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kahama Mining Corporation Ltd, a subsidiary of
Sutton Resources of Canada, has discovered some 239.5 tons of gold
deposits in Kahama District, in northern Shinyanga Region. The
company plans to open an underground mine with projected annual

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian President Warned to Back out From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief government spokesman
Newstead Zimba said former President Kenneth Kaunda should
immediately stop receiving his terminal benefits if he has any
moral conscience and recognizes the law which provides for the
facility.
</P>
<P>
Zimba told journalists Tuesday that Kaunda "can not remain in
politics and have the benefits at the same time because he is
aware of the law regarding benefits for former presidents."
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda's insistence on continuing with party politics
and hoping to assume republican presidency would be contrary to
the constitution which stipulates that one can only serve as
president for two consecutive five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Zimba, who is also Minister for Information and Broadcasting
Services, was reacting to reports quoting Kaunda as having said
the law was designed to hinder his political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, the Post, Wednesday quoted the former
president as saying in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) in London that he "would not retire from active
politics soon because current events in Zambia's political arena
would not warrant that."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said Tuesday that he would contest the Zambian
presidency in 2001. And he would continue leading his party, the
United National Independence Party (UNIP), until his followers
decide he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year old veteran politician ruled the country for 27
years and was defeated by incumbent President Frederick Chiluba in
1991.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kaunda and the government has concluded an
agreement under which he will get all his retirement benefits as a
former president on condition that he retires from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
However, he has not handed a letter of resignation to the party
 secretary-general as required by the party constitution if he
wants to retire before his term of office expires by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to force Kaunda to retire, the Zambian parliament
endorsed last September the Benefits of Former President Amendment
Bill which states that a former president would lose his benefits
if he participates in active politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia displaced arch
rival Britain to take the lead in the IOC President's trophy at
the World Sailing Championships in Melbourne, Australia, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain posted a win in the Laser class to claim the
first Gold Medal of the regatta, Australia moved up the
leaderboard in a number of classes.
</P>
<P>
Two wins on the three-man keelboat Soling course for Cameron
Miles and crew helped the Australian cause, as did a pair of wins
for 470 sailors Tom King and Mark Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
In the 49er class, Chris Nicholson and Ed Smyth have moved
back to the top of the leaderboard, which adds to Australia's
total, for this trophy donated by the president of the IOC for
the best performing country at this regatta.
</P>
<P>
A fourth place in the Lasers for Michael Backburn, was backed
up by Melanie Dennison in the women's single-handed Europe
dinghy, and Paul MacKenzie in the mens' single-handed Finns.

<HEADLINE> Macroeconomic Policies to Promote Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said last week that China
will continue the pro-active fiscal policy and plans to issue
treasury bonds worth 316.5 billion yuan during 1999. He added
that the National People's Congress might adjust the budget
during the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
Additional treasury bond issues should be incorporated into
overall national plans to promote the central finances. Efforts
should also focus on optimizing the term and structure of bonds
in order to tap the potential to bear additional deficits,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
China's deficit is expected to hit 105.3 billion yuan in 1999,
compared to 96 billion yuan in 1998. The increase will mainly go
for water conservancy and infrastructure projects, according to
Xiang.
</P>
<P>
Economists responded positively to increased financial
expenditures, but at the same time suggested that the government
should avoid competitive sectors and instead invest heavily in
the military and space industries since technology developed by
the two sectors is crucial for upgrading traditional civilian
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Macroeconomic control should center on creating and
maintaining a standardized macroeconomic environment, especially
at a time of slowing economic development. Related efforts should
bolster and reinforce the expectations and confidence of
investors. Fiscal policies should also be used to support bank
loans for small- to medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that China's sustained, rapid and stable
economic growth of the long-term will rely on further reform and
opening wider to the outside world, as well as the fulfillment of
basic consumer demand.

<HEADLINE> China Accuses Wei Jingsheng's Taiwan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday expressed
displeasure at Wei Jingsheng's recent Taiwan tour and pointed out
that Wei's allegations made during his stay in the island was
intended to prevent reunification across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is on medical parole in the United States, paid a
two-week visit to Taiwan as a "visiting scholar" last month.
</P>
<P>
During Wei's stay in Taiwan, he met with several high-ranking
officials of the Taiwan authorities and discussed so-called
"political cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities gave him a good opportunity and he
responded in kind" by attacking the reunification policies of the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Taiwan authorities sang the same tune as Wei
against the Chinese mainland, asserting that their cooperation
was for the purpose of making use of each other.
</P>
<P>
In concluding his Taiwan visit, Wei called his meeting with
leaders of the Taiwan authorities a new phase of the relations
between the "democratic movement" and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Taiwan authorities denied a national basis for
cross-straits reunification and repeated that "the democratic
movement is an important precondition and target of cross-straits
reunification," and "the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can be
reunified only when the mainland is democratized."
</P>
<P>
Although the Taiwan authorities treated Wei as a distinguished
guest, the Taiwan media had a cold response to his behavior.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that invitations from the Taiwan authorities
extended to the Dalai Lama and Wei Jingsheng are an obvious
expression of its confrontation with the mainland, and this will
surely hurt the people in Taiwan and the cross-straits relations
if this policy of confrontation continues.

<HEADLINE> New Test-tube Baby Technology Helps Infertile Become Fathers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A 36-year-old Chinese woman
is now three months pregnant after undergoing intro vitro
fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer.
</P>
<P>
This case was rare in today's China, not because of the woman,
but because of her husband who was suffering from an obstruction
in his spermatic duct which prevented the normal ejaculation of
sperm.
</P>
<P>
They were among the first group of 12 Chinese couples who have
benefited from a new test-tube baby technology introduced from
the United States, known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI) and non-surgical sperm aspiration (NSA).
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of all males with poor-quality semen suffer
from spermatic duct obstruction. But NSA now can help them
produce healthy sperm, and ICSI has helped make their wives
become pregnant, said Wang Yun of the Shanghai Ji'ai Genetics &AMP;
IVF Institute - China USA Center.
</P>
<P>
The center, jointly established four months ago by the
Shanghai Hospital of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the Genetics &AMP;
IVF Institute of the U.S., is the only in China providing such
services, Wang Yun told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of males in China suffering from poor-quality
semen remains unknown, but for every 100 couples of child-bearing
age, ten are infertile, and one can have their own babies only
through test-tube technology, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the country's population is so large, the number of
couples needing these services is also expected to be quite
significant," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to this new technology, many infertile men will be
able to have their own children, instead of borrowing the sperm
of others," she added.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Telephone System in Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's telephone
service has unexpectedly been in chaos after its telecommunication
department opened a new phone numbering system on January 1, South
African daily Business Day reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, perplexed at their inability to reach Swaziland by
telephone, have swamped Swazi journalists and government officials
with e-mailed inquiries about whether a coup had taken place.
</P>
<P>
The caller chaos has resulted in financial losses to businesses
and industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, two-digit area code prefixes
have been added to existing five-digit numbers. The Swaziland Post
and Telecommunications Corporation announced the change in local
newspaper advertisements, but did not inform international callers
through pre- recorded messages. As a result, callers from outside
Swaziland found old numbers ringing indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Richards, managing director of the telecommunication,
was quoted as saying that the new numbering system "was put in
place to meet international standards. Foreign phone companies
were told of the change in plenty of time, and it was their duty
to inform their customers."
</P>
<P>
Locally, there is widespread ignorance regarding the new
system, which Richards blames on "a culture where nobody reads".
Those dialling old numbers receive recorded messages saying "the
dialled number does not exist" , and advising that an information
operator be contacted.
</P>
<P>
However, many callers complained that information operators
were frequently unavailable, and some calls to correctly dialled
new numbers did not go through.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit financially has been Swaziland's tourism industry.
"We have lost bookings and customers cannot confirm bookings," a
hotel operator in the Ezulwini Valley complained.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Cabinet Prepares to Fight Y2K Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is studying
to mobilize security forces in the first week of January 2000 to
ensure the maintenance of law and order during the transition
period while the effect of the Y2K bug becomes clear, a government
minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jay Naidoo, minister of Posts, Telecommunications and
Broadcasting Department, told a press briefing in Pretoria that
the cabinet had discussed this mobilization possibility.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Year 2000 Decision Support Center in
Pretoria, the readiness level for government-owned enterprises is
34.59 percent and for the public sector 30.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Three government departments -- Arts, Culture , Science and
Technology, Correctional Services and Communications, said that
they had completed their Y2K projects while the remaining
departments expect to complete them late in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was driving the
efforts of government on Y2K issues.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki had informed directors-generals in writing that it was
their responsibility as head of provinces and departments to
ensure Y2K compliance.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Surgeons Help Cataract Sufferers in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons from military
hospitals in the Chinese capital have performed over 1,000
operations on cataract patients in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The team is participating in the Sight First China Action
program which will dispatch 250-odd medical teams to rural and
remote areas over the next five years to carry out 1.75 million
cataract operations.
</P>
<P>
The program is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Health,
China Federation of Disabled Persons and Lions Club International
(LCI). The LCI alone has donated over 15 million U.S. dollars to
the project.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts have blinded over four million Chinese citizens, or
almost half of the total number of blind people throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans face a much greater risk of cataracts due to high
altitude and strong ultraviolet rays in the Tibet Autonomous
Region. The incidence rate for cataracts in Tibet is twice as
high as in other regions in China, with Tibetans generally
cataracts between 10-15 years earlier than people in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The lack of medical facilities and inconvenient transportation
infrastructure in the region multiply the seriousness of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The program's first mission to Tibet between mid-August and
mid-September was the most extensive rehabilitation program in
the history of the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to Minister
of Health Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
The medical team also supplied the region surgical facilities,
artificial lens and medicines valued at 800,000 yuan (about
99,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang Chengjin, an official with the aforementioned federation,
said the sponsors plan to arrange more medical aid programs to
help cataract sufferers in Tibet.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, visited a
Beijing district court today to solicit opinions concerning
formulation of the country's first unified Contract Law.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Karl Marx Manuscript Found in Beijing Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's oldest and most
important library announced today that for at least 40 years it
has been the custodian of original letters written by Karl Marx
and Frederick Engels.
</P>
<P>
"We have a private letter from Marx to his daughter and a
letter from Engels to a friend of his," said Huang Runhua, chief
of the rare books department of the National Library, in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Few people knew these historic manuscripts were in the
library, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huan Xiang, a diplomat serving in the Chinese Embassy in
London, enthusiastically collected hand-written letters he
obtained from roadside used-book stalls and local auction houses
in 1950s. The state allocated his collection to the National
Library for preservation, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
These letters were well-kept in the library's most advanced
stack room, where humidity and temperature remain constant.
</P>
<P>
The letters, written in black ink, are still very clear, said
Huang.
</P>
<P>
Ranking fifth among the world's libraries in number of
volumes, China's 90-year-old National Library has some 270,000
rare books and 35,000 ancient bones and tortoise shells with
inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
It also has a copy of the earliest version, in Latin, of the
works of Copernicus, published in 1566.
</P>
<P>
The library's huge collection obviously underscores its
prominent position, Huang added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases Result of State Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria has released the final
result of last Saturday' s state governors and legislators
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the result announced in Abuja Tuesday by INEC
Chairman Ephraim Akpata, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) won
the governorship in 19 states, the All People's Party (APP) in
nine and the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in six, said local press
reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By-election will be held in Rivers State Saturday as the
results there are "inconclusive", Akpata told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In the State House of Assembly elections, the PDP won 528
seats, the APP 251 and the AD 166, he said, adding that
by-elections will be held in a few constituencies where elections
could not hold or were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's elections were not held in the Bayelsa State in the
southeast, because of the recent spate of violence there.
</P>
<P>
According to the INEC result, a total of 24,649,434 persons
voted in the elections, which accounted for 46 percent of the
53,161,687 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
Akpata said the elections were largely free and fair and
acceptable to Nigerians, from what he has read in the press and
the reports of both local and international observers.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the United Nations and the Commonwealth for their
assistances in the deployment of logistics and training of INEC
staff, and reiterated the INEC's commitment to the success of
elections remain.

According to the transition to civil rule program announced by
the military government, Nigeria will hold the national
legislators and presidential elections in February, while its

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Flys to France on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon flew to Paris Wednesday morning for talks with his
French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Sharon will explain to Vedrine
Israel's position on the Wye River peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's visit is apparently designed to appease France's
displeasure with Israel for not moving ahead with West Bank troops
pullbacks laid down under the Wye deal, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
commitments in the Wye deal, Israeli government froze the accord
in early December after conducting the first of the three phases
of troops deployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The current impasse has not only delayed the troops withdrawal,
but also put the Israeli-Palestinian final status talks on hold.
</P>
<P>
According to Oslo accords, the final status talks should have
been started by May 1996 to tackle the thornist issues such as the
fate of Jerusalem, the refugees and borders.
</P>
<P>
A permanent peace deal should be signed between Israel and the
Palestinians by May 4,1999 before a five-year interim period

<HEADLINE> Roth: Jiang-Clinton Exchange Marks Positive Accomplishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here Tuesday that the exchange of visits by the presidents of
China and the United States was the first positive accomplishment
of the Clinton administration's Asia-Pacific policy.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
Pacific affairs, told a press conference at the Foreign Press
Center that one could not minimize the significance of President
Bill Clinton's trip to China last June, which followed President
Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very important event in trying to, not only
establish and maintain momentum in U.S.-China relations, but to
try to give meaning to the notion of moving towards a
constructive strategic partnership," said Roth.
</P>
<P>
Roth accompanied Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
several trips to the East Asian and Pacific region last year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits by Presidents Jiang and Clinton
demonstrated that "the ability of the United States and China to w
ork together on a range of issues would be crucial for managing
many of the regional and global challenges that confront us."
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the problems that remain -- and I make no effort
to minimize it in the U.S.-China relations -- I thank that the su
mmit was a major step forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Roth joined the China critics in pressurizing Beijing
for human rights improvements. In March, some Congressmen urged
the administration to sponsor anti-China resolution at the Geneva
U.N. human rights meeting.
</P>
<P>
"On China, even though I put it in the success category, which
I do, I think it's also obvious, as I mentioned before, that
there have been setbacks, most notably recently on human rights
issues," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
The American lawmakers stepped up criticism of China following
the recent detention of some criminals who had attempted to
subvert the government.
</P>
<P>
The China critics and human rights advocators have urged the
administration to postpone the planned human right dialogue with
China, but the State Department refused to heed the call.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya and his American counterpart Harold Koh held closed
meetings in the State Department to discuss the human rights
issue. But nothing was made public so far.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to address the issue separately Wednesday
after the end of the two-day negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Roth hailed the resumption of dialogue between China's
mainland and Taiwan, believing the negotiations have some
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the final major accomplishments would be
resumption of cross-straits dialogue between Taiwan and the PRC
(People's Republic of China), which I believe was a major
development and had some prospects that we should be encouraging
for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have signed three joint
communiques regarding Taiwan, committing the U.S. to One-China
policy. But Congress enacted a law called "the Taiwan Act"
shortly after Beijing and Washington established diplomatic relati
ons on January 1, 1979, allowing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on suggestions that the Taiwan Act came
before the three joint communiques in relations with Taiwan, Roth
said that it involved a legal question and what is more important
was to make the resumed cross-straits dialogue a success.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two sides across the Taiwan Strait to take steps
to build mutual trust and to narrow their differences through
negotiations.

items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The declaration by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on a
hardening of crackdown on juvenile delinquents has caused anger
of magistrates and professionals, who consider the statements on
crimes by both President Jacques Chirac and Jospin as sheer
exaggeration with political purposes.
</P>
<P>
-- Since their surrender to the government of Phnom Penh in
August 1996, the former Khmer Rouge guerrillas under Ieng Sary
have maintained the autonomy of their former stronghold Pailin
and has turned the area with rich mineral resources into a
prosperous ``Far West'' paradise for adventurers and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Re-urged to Resume Inter-Korean Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday
re-appealed to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
to accept its offer to resume the inter-Korean government-level
talks.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is willing to conclude a contract u
nder which it will grant fertilizer, pesticide, vinyl and other
materials necessary to the DPRK to cultivate plants like tobacco
and import them back, Vice Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyuneong
said at a forum on inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
"Those issues can be discussed at government-level talks
between the two Koreas," he said at the forum, which was
organized by the presidential Advisory Council on Democratic and
Peaceful Unification.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister indicated that the government will not
attach tough conditions to assistance to the DPRK if Pyongyang
restores dialogue with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the Beijing talks last year, we need to be flexible in
our negotiations on aid to the North," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official inter-Korean talks held in Beijing last April for the
first time in nearly four years to discuss Seoul's fertilizer aid
to Pyongyang broke down after Seoul put the reunion of separated
families as a condition for assistance to the DPRK.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The defense in former
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's corruption trial
said Wednesday it plans to call Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and three other Cabinet ministers as its witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The defense plans to call Mahathir to testify at the trial
together with Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin, International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz, Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob and former
inspector-general of police Abdul Rahim Noor, if the court orders
Anwar to enter his defense, Anwar's defense counsel Christopher
Fernando told the High Court here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail offered the
defense 47 witnesses who are on a list and said that the
prosecution would make available witnesses not listed.
</P>
<P>
The defense however decided to call 22 witnesses from the list,
and Rafidah who is not listed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 4th International DAB Symposium Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -The 4th International Digital
Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Symposium opened Wednesday with a view to
exchange information on DAB technology and to advance
implementation of strategy on DAB services and business.
</P>
<P>
DAB is the radio technology which allows sound, text and
picture to be digitized -- from transmission to reception. It
enables interference free, CD quality sound with no need to retune
or remember a station's frequency. This three-day symposium is
jointly organized by the World DAB Forum, a non-governmental
organization, and the Singapore Broadcasting Authority.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister of Information and the Arts George Yeo
delivered a key-note speech at opening ceremony participated by
more than 250 delegates from 27 countries and areas.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said digitization has led to rapid changes both in
broadcast technology and the broadcast environment and there is a
growing interest in digital broadcasting in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also announced Singapore will introduce commercial DAB
service this year after more than a year of preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
There is a packed program for this symposium and speakers will
talk about latest information about DAB development across the
world.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis is believed to be laid on starting DAB services,
regulating them, making and launching consumer receiver products
and the business aspects.
</P>
<P>
The World DAB Forum holds a symposium every two years and the
Third Symposium was held in Montreux in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Export More Labors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has planned to send some
20,000 to 25,000 laborers to work abroad this year, Vietnam's
English daily "Vietnam News" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese labor export will be expanded not only in existing
markets such as Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates,
but also to new markets, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brumei, the
Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Vietnamese government planned to seek new
contracts on labor export in Eastern European countries such as
Russia, Moldova, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a lack of capital, Vietnam's Dau Tu
(Investment) newspaper said, Vietnamese labor export businesses
faced difficulties in researching new labor export markets and
promoting existing ones.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs, the number of Vietnamese laborers
sent to work overseas decreased dramatically in 1998. Vietnam's
labor export businesses sent nearly 10,300 people to work abroad,
a mere 60 percent of the 1997's figure.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian President Warned to Back out From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief government spokesman
Newstead Zimba said former President Kenneth Kaunda should
immediately stop receiving his terminal benefits if he has any
moral conscience and recognizes the law which provides for the
facility.
</P>
<P>
Zimba told journalists Tuesday that Kaunda "can not remain in
politics and have the benefits at the same time because he is
aware of the law regarding benefits for former presidents."
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda's insistence on continuing with party politics
and hoping to assume republican presidency would be contrary to
the constitution which stipulates that one can only serve as
president for two consecutive five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Zimba, who is also Minister for Information and Broadcasting
Services, was reacting to reports quoting Kaunda as having said
the law was designed to hinder his political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, the Post, Wednesday quoted the former
president as saying in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) in London that he "would not retire from active
politics soon because current events in Zambia's political arena
would not warrant that."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said Tuesday that he would contest the Zambian
presidency in 2001. And he would continue leading his party, the
United National Independence Party (UNIP), until his followers
decide he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year old veteran politician ruled the country for 27
years and was defeated by incumbent President Frederick Chiluba in
1991.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kaunda and the government has concluded an
agreement under which he will get all his retirement benefits as a
former president on condition that he retires from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
However, he has not handed a letter of resignation to the party
 secretary-general as required by the party constitution if he
wants to retire before his term of office expires by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to force Kaunda to retire, the Zambian parliament
endorsed last September the Benefits of Former President Amendment
Bill which states that a former president would lose his benefits
if he participates in active politics.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Wolf Prize for Medicine, Chemistry Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's 1999 Wolf Prize for
Medicine will be awarded to Vienna-born professor Eric Kandel,
Columbia University, New York, the Wolf Foundation has said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 1999 Wolf Prize for Chemistry will go to
Raymond Lemieux, professor of the Alberta University, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kandel, 69, was awarded for the elucidation of the
organismic, cellular and molecular mechanism, whereby short-term
memory is converted to a long-term form.
</P>
<P>
How learning occurs and memory is stored, is one of the
major questions central to both neural science and congnitive
psychology. Kandel has helped to demystify the study of learning
and memory storage, by delineating the molecular mechanisms
underlying these processes. In so doing, he has discovered the
molecular swith whereby labile short-term memory is converted into
stable long-term memory maintained by structural changes.
</P>
<P>
Kandel has shown how the the methods of psychology can be
merged with those of biology to endow the study of behavior and
learning with renewed vigor and explanatory power. His work has
influenced the way both biologists and pychologists now think
about these processes.
</P>
<P>
Kandel received his B.A. degree from Harvard University and
his M.D degree from New York University. Between 1968-1974,
Kandel served as chief of the Department of Neuro-Biology and
Behavior of the Public Health Research Institute of the City
of New York and as senior Research Psychiatrist and Director
of the Laboratory of Neuro-Psychology of the Massachusetts Mental
Health Center. He has been associated with Columbia university
since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, 78, earned his award for his fundamental and
seminal contributions to the study and synthesis of
oligosaccharides and to the elucidation of their role in
molecular recognition in biological systems.
</P>
<P>
Lemieux's contribution to the study of the chemistry of
carbohydrates has led to a transformation of the discipline,
providing the pillars upon which present-day oligosaccharide
chemistry and biochemistry now rest.
</P>
<P>
The Wolf Prize was established in 1978 by the late
German-born Ricardo Wolf, who lived in Cuba for many years and
served as Cubian ambassador to Israel. The Israel-based Wolf
Prize is awarded to outstanding scientists and artists for
achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations
among peoples.
</P>
<P>
The annual Prize, which amounts to 100,000 U.S. dollars in each area,
are given in four out of five scientific fields, namely
agriculture, chemistry, mathematics, medicine and physics. In the
arts, the prize rotates among architecture, music, painting and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 prizes will be conferred by President Ezer Weizman
in a special ceremony to be held at the Israel parliament, on
May 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wolf prize recipients in Physics and Mathematics will be
announced on January 19.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Supports Dialog for Pan-Arab Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official spokesman
said Wednesday that Iraq is for equal dialog under the umbrella of
supreme Arab interests and for the sake of pan-Arab security.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement following Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein chaired a meeting of high-ranking officials Tuesday
night on the latest developments of the political situation, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting was given by the agency, but
observers here believe that the spokesman was directing at the
forthcoming Arab foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for January
24, during which Iraqi issue will top its agenda.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said equal dialog under umbrella of the supreme
Arab interests could lead to practical solutions to the different
or contradictory positions and ideas.
</P>
<P>
He added that this kind of dialog should be conducted in a
manner expressing attitude of the Arab masses and the pan-Arab
security.
</P>
<P>
Iraq recently stepped up a rhetoric campaign against Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, alleging that the two Gulf neighbors should be
accountable for the damages and casualties caused by U.S. and
British air strikes against the country in mid December.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that cruise missiles fired by the U.S. and British
forces passed through Kuwaiti airspace and more than 100 warplanes
flew over Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the raids. So Iraq
preserves the right for compensation for damages.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Arab Gulf states including Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia strongly rejected the Iraqi threat and insisted on Iraq's
implementation of all U.N. resolutions related to its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that to seriously reach solutions
serving the Arab nation, the pan-Arab security should be
considered as part and parcel and to consider any aggression by
any foreign party on any Arab country as tantamount to an
aggression on the Arab Nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"The matter necessitates a clear-cut and certain stand by the
Arab officials by condemning and denouncing the U.S.-British
aggression against Iraq," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadhan, Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz, parliament Speaker Sadoun
Hammadi, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and Information
Minister Abdul Khaleq, said INA.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Major Decline in Exports Makes Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan, which has long been
beset with economic difficulties, is experiencing a major decline
in its exports, making the annual export target difficult to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures by the Federal Bureau of Statistics show that
despite unprecedented incentives, Pakistan's export earnings
during the first half of the 1998-99 fiscal year (July 1,1998-June
30,1999) stood at 3.84 billion U.S. dollars only, down 12.4
percent from the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the 10-billion-dollar export target for the current
fiscal year, with a 5-billion half-year target, exports have
lagged behind the official projection by 1.16 billion dollars so
far.
</P>
<P>
To catch up with the annual target, Pakistan needs to export
1.02 billion dollars worth of goods each month for the remainder
of the current fiscal year. But exports in the first half of
1998-99 averaged only 640 million dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Most worrisome to the government is the drop of textile exports
which fell considerably by 14 percent during the first half of the
fiscal year to 2.43 billion dollars compared with 2.85 billion
dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's textile industry plays a pivotal role in the
country's export sector. As the figures by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics show, textile products made up 64 percent of the total
exports of 3.84 billion dollars during the first two quarters of
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the textile industry said that of the many textile
products, cotton yarn and fabrics are main products of exports and
these two products in Pakistan are fast losing their international
market shares to India and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the decline trend in the export
sector will make the annual export target too hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan has trimmed its import bill by 1.07 billion
dollars in the six-month period after enforcing a tight policy of
providing minimum foreign exchange to importers.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that during the first six months of
1998-99, the value of imports decreased to 4.396 billion dollars
from 5.472 billion dollars in the same period of 1997-98 with a
major drop in wheat and machinery imports.
</P>
<P>
However, due to declines both in exports and imports,
Pakistan's trade deficit declined to 594 million dollars during
the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, as against 1.13
billion dollars in the same period of 1997-98, showing an
improvement of 536 million dollars or 47.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had hoped that
with enhanced exports it would be able to take care of the
dramatic shortfall in revenue.
</P>
<P>
However, with the major decline in exports, it seems to be
unrealistic that the expected revenue target for the current
fiscal year could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Central Board of Revenue is most likely to post a net
revenue collection of only 305 billion rupees (6.6 billion
dollars) during fiscal 1998-99, which is almost 50 billion rupees
(1.08 billion dollars) less than the original budgetary estimates
of 354.6 billion rupees (7.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The expected revenue indicates a shortfall of nearly 28 billion
rupees (608 million dollars) from the agreed benchmark of 333
billion rupees (7.23 billion dollars) with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that with the IMF and the World
Bank still reluctant to make any definitive commitment about their
relief or bailout package for Pakistan and with no sign of
recovery in the export sector, Pakistan's economic prospects in
the near future will remain dim.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti-Iraqi Ties to be Restored if Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Parliament Speaker
Ahmad Al-Saadoun has said Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties will be normalized if
the incumbent Iraqi regime is toppled, the Kuwaiti Arab Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"None of us expected the Saddam (Hussein) regime to occupy
Kuwait. Now five years after the border demarcation between the
two states, we hear officials of the Iraqi regime renewing claims
that Kuwait is part of Iraq," Al-Saadoun said at a seminar of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, some Iraqi lawmakers called for scrapping a
U.N. resolution 833, which demarcates the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border in
1993, two years after the Gulf War in 1991 set off by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "is without precedent, unfair and arbitrary,"
said the Iraqi lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait National Assembly (parliament), in a hit-back
statement Tuesday, deplored the Iraqi move, terming it "a flagrant
violation to the U.N. Charter and to the Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The assembly expressed concern on the continued "non-commitment
of the Iraqi regime to the international resolutions" and held it
"responsible for the sufferings of its people."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi regime should also be held accountable for the
rupture and diaspora the Arab nation is suffering, the statement
said.

BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition parties
submitted a no-confidence motion against three key members of the
cabinet to House Speaker Wan Muhammad Nor Matha on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The motion was proposed by the opposition leader, New
Aspiration Party Leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Prachakorn Thai
Party Leader Samak Sundaravej.
</P>
<P>
They charged the three key ministers, Deputy Prime Minister and
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda and Transport and Communication Minister Suthep
Thueksuban, of corruption, malfeasance and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition claimed that it has substantial
incriminating evidence against the three ministers, all from the
Democrat Party, the core party of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has said that it is unlikely to win the censure
debate, but it is hoping that by grilling the three ministers, the
image and reputation of the Chuan Leekpai government could be
damaged.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the parliament will hold a two-day censure
debate, the second of its kind since Chuan took his office in
November 1997, at the end of this month.

MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday launched an investigation into reports that the Moro

Officials of the Department of Interior and Local Governments

The MILF has no right to conduct the raid even if its purpose

At least 50 MILF members reportedly raided a public market in
Marawi City, rounding up suspected drug pushers who, they said,
would be publicly executed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Cites Impropriety of "Solar Terms" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Phenologist Wan Minwei said
here today that traditional "solar terms" are outdated due to the
climate change.
</P>
<P>
 Solar terms lasting approximately 15 days each divide the
lunar year into 24 periods with names which indicate obvious
changes in nature at the particular time. Wan, a member of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that ancient Chinese
farmers planted crops according to solar terms. However, the
modern solar calendar features fixed solar terms which fail to
recognize annual climate changes. "The modern solar calendar is
inappropriate for modern agriculture," according to the
nonagenarian phenologist.
</P>
<P>
 Wan said dividing the year according to phenology and
temperature would be more practical for agriculture. He added
that the phenology changes on a yearly basis and could be used as
seasonal index. Wan also suggested the development of a natural
calendar with phenological periods for plants, animals and
crops.

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China will continue and firm
up its ongoing anti-corruption campaign to ensure a clean and
honest government in 1999, a high-ranking Party leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remarks at the third plenary session of the Central
Commission of Discipline Inspection of the CPC, which began here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The session aims to summarize the work of the anti-corruption
campaign launched 1998 and will consolidate its plans this year.
</P>
<P>
In a work report on the campaign's activities, Wei, who is
also secretary of the commission, said that the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council made great efforts in the past
year to achieve a clean and honest government in accordance with
the guidelines set down at the 15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the fight against corruption is
far from satisfactory at present and called for more efforts to
be made to enforce the laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has eased the tight
travel restrictions imposed on Palestinian refugees residing in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"The general directory of the General Security decided to
consider Lebanese travel documents granted to Palestinians living
in Lebanon as passports," a government statement issued Tuesday
said.
</P>
<P>
The General Security, however, later issued a clarification,
saying that Palestinians still need clearance to travel, but
that the permits will henceforth be valid for six months and
enable their bearer multiple trips within that period.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that previously Palestinians needed exit and
re-entry visas for every trip.
</P>
<P>
The government statement said the decision is the result of
talks on the issue between Lebanese leaders and Farouk Kaddoumi,
head of Palestinian Liberation Organization's Political
Department who visited the country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Some 350,000 Palestinians live in 12 refugee camps across
Lebanon. They are denied the right to work in some 75 occupations.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source said further measures, including the
lifting of the working ban on Palestinians in Lebanon, will come
out soon.

cated in the short term, the only solution is to move the
dolphins to a nature reserve with a natural environment similar
to their original habitat.
</P>
<P>
They have chosen some possible sites in Hubei and Jiangxi
provinces, both along the middle reaches of the Yangtze, and have
begun to raise black-finless porpoises there, which are similar
to the Yangtze's white-flag dolphins.
</P>
<P>
Unlike pandas, the Yangtze River dolphins are difficult to
catch and raise. A white-flag dolphin swims at speeds up to 60
kilometers an hour, while the boats used to catch them for
relocation at the nature reserve sail at only 15 kilometers an
hour.
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin also requires a quality environment
including clean water with low-germ content and adequate fresh
food to survive.
</P>
<P>
Several leading scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
have already called on relevant departments urging them to spend
more money and manpower on the rare dolphins, which face possible
extinction within 25 years if they are not better protected than
they are now.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
expects to take effective measures this year to increase demand
locally in an effort to give impetus to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The province will focus on the regulation and direction of con
sumer price systems in the areas of real estate,
telecommunications, automobiles and power.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to standardize local land-transfer prices
and further improve the system of compensation for those who must
move out of old buildings scheduled for demolition. Prices for
commodities, especially affordable housing, will be practically
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Shandong will also reduce telecommunications fees including
those for telephone installation, mobile phones and long-distance
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Automobile prices and charges for follow-up services will be
lower in the province, and procedures will be simplified to
encourage private car purchases in the province.
</P>
<P>
The price of electricity will also be reduced for local
customers.
</P>
<P>
As a result of all these measures, consumer prices for local
citizens are expected to grow by only five percent this year, and
commodity retail-sale prices by only three percent.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Diplomatic Ties Anniversary Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
U.S. Li Zhaoxing gave a grand reception here Tuesday night,
marking the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madelaine Albright and National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger attended the reception at the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
Also present were more than 430 White House and State
Department officials, prominent business representatives,
military leaders and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the bright reception hall, color photos on the wall record
the changes in relations between the two giants, which
established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Berger, accompanied by Ambassador Li, passed
through the big crowd and stepped up onto the platform hung with
the national flags of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, deputy foreign minister before he occupied his current
post last March, took the floor first, saying a healthy and
stable China-U.S. relationship not only serves the fundamental
interests of the two countries but also contributes greatly to
world peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the successful cooperation between the two countries
in the past two decades, he emphasized the progress in bilateral
ties through exchange of visits by President Jiang Zemin and
President Bill Clinton in the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
"These visits have not only greatly enhanced mutual
understanding and friendship between the Chinese and American
peoples, but also moved China-U.S. relations to a new stage of d
evelopment. More importantly, the two leaders agreed that the two
countries should work together to build toward a constructive
strategic partnership, thus setting a framework and objective for
the development of China-U.S. relations oriented toward the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to adhere to the three joint
communiques, which China believes enshrine guiding principles for
Sino-U.S. relations. The three documents mainly deal with Taiwan,
committing the U.S. to one-China policy with Taiwan as its part.
</P>
<P>
"These principles have demonstrated strong vitality and
practicality over the years and will continue to be a guarantee
for stable and healthy growth of China-U.S. relations in the
future," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her part, said that as a former member staff of
the National Security Council in the Carter's administration, she
felt then and feels now that the U.S. decision to establish
diplomatic relations with China was "crucial to the future of the
entire Asia-Pacific region and the world."
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the strategic dialogue with China, Albright
said that the policy was "designed to help us cooperate where our
interests coincide and to narrow our differences where they
exist."
</P>
<P>
The historical summits in Washington and Beijing between
Presidents Jiang and Clinton had further pushed the two countries
to work together in areas of vital significance such as nuclear
non-proliferation, stability on the Korea peninsula, fight
against international terrorism, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that differences still remain on some issues,
she said: "Our relations will be stronger if we are honest about
our disagreements."
</P>
<P>
Albright advocated that the two countries should continue
their dialogue to develop a "close and lasting" relationship
based on shared interests and common pursuit of security and
prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
She also called for continued contact and communications
between the two peoples across full spectrum of human activity.
</P>
<P>
In the end, she proposed a toast for friendship and future of
the two countries in the next century and the accomplishment of
security, liberty and happiness for all the peoples in China and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
A high ranking Chinese diplomat noted here that it was rare
that U.S. officials like Albright and Berger would attend foreign
receptions, and their presence signified that Washington, like
Beijing, is also eager to maintain the momentum of bilateral ties
development despite differences on human rights, trade, Taiwan
and Tibet.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed 13 people and
plagued another 711 in Mozambique in the past five days, an
official with the health authorities of the southern African
country said.
</P>
<P>
Avertino Barreto, Assistant Director of the National Health
bureau said Tuesday at a press conference that cholera has hit all
the 11 provinces but Inhambane Province in the southern part of
the country, the Noticias daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit provinces are the Nampula and Cabo Delgado
provinces in the northern part of the country which are in their
raining seasons.
</P>
<P>
Rainwater, which has drained excrement and urine everywhere,
has spread cholera virus to residential areas and thus
contaminated some wells. Barreto said that about 1,841 people have
died of the disease since it broke out in August 1997.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has become the
largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of attracting funds
from foreign explorers for non-ferrous minerals, the Minister of
Energy and Minerals, Abdallah Kigoda, has said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, international explorers spent 57.7 million U.S.
Dollars on Tanzanian mines, or 13.2 percent of the total in
Sub-Saharan Africa, a newspaper published here quoted Kigoda as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure has outweighed Ghana which ranked second in this
regard, the minister told the Financial Times in an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited Tanzania's political stability and
prevailing peace, changed government policies in favor of private
sector as well as a prospective geographical terrain, as major
factors contributing to the growing flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kahama Mining Corporation Ltd, a subsidiary of
Sutton Resources of Canada, has discovered some 239.5 tons of gold
deposits in Kahama District, in northern Shinyanga Region. The
company plans to open an underground mine with projected annual
output of 9.3 tons of gold.
</P>
<P>
Other companies like De Beers, Anglo-American Prospecting
Services, Arusha Planters and Traders are hunting for diamond,
nickel, cobalt and uranium, he said.

Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered the

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Responsible For Embezzlement Funds: Indonesian Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi M. Ghalib said most witnesses in the former president
Soeharto case confirm that Soeharto is responsible for the
embezzlement of foundation funds, and the issuing of the Timor
national car decree.
</P>
<P>
"But we have not yet cross-checked whether Soeharto ordered it,
or the procedure came from lower levels," Ghalib told reporters
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Timor national car project, the government granted
tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son
Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans
from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor. The project had caused the
country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, Soeharto chaired nine charities, which have
been accused of receiving government privileges and facilities as
well as being one of Soeharto's main business vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine
charitable foundations to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office is questioning some other
officers involved in the decree issue.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib said that the office will not make any careless move to
investigate a corruption case to prevent it from violating human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The investigation for the Soeharto case, he said, will be
finished before the general election in June.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the trial for Soeharto, Ghalib said the attorney
general's official duty is only for prosecution. Furthermore, the
case can go to the court but it is not his authority.
</P>
<P>
He said he only questioned Soeharto from the legal side, not in
political matters.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced down on May 21 last year amid the country's
worst economic and political crisis. An attorney-general team
comprising 13 senior prosecutors has indicated that criminal
elements as well as corruption had taken place in the Timor
national car project, as well as in charitable foundations chaired
by Soeharto.

the first candidate followed by Greece.
</P>
<P>
The force, 3,000 to 4,000 men, created to bring stability to
the Balkan region, was agreed upon last September at a meeting of
the region's defense ministers in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Macedonia will join it as observers.

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Favors Trial of Khmer Rouge Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prince Norodom
Ranariddh said Wednesday that he prefers trying Khmer Rouge
leaders outside the country but called for waiting for the United
Nations' decision.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of social justice, I favor to try the Khmer Rouge
leaders. The King Norodom Sihanouk also supported it," Ranariddh,
president of the National Assembly, told reporters at the Faculty
of Dentist in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
"The question whether to amnesty them or not, I think it's
better to let out high legal bodies of the National Assembly and
the soon-to-be-created senate to decide," he added.
</P>
<P>
The persons the prince referred to for trial include top Khmer
Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, who defected to the
government last month.
</P>
<P>
International pressures are mounting recently on the government
and Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrest and try the pair for "their
crimes against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said earlier that "for the interest to put an end to
the Khmer Rouge organization and for national reconciliation, we
have to leave a tribunal case of Khmer Rouge leaders for the time
being."
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, deputy prime minister and interior co-minister, also
insisted that ending the protracted civil war is a higher priority
than bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to trial. "For the government,
the first priority is peace and ending the war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said while he prefers the court be set up outside
Cambodia, he does not oppose trying the Khmer Rouge leaders at
home if most Cambodian people insist, but pointed out that the
trial should be carried out by international legal experts in
accordance with the international law.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the two high-profile former Khmer
Rouge leaders, are now living in the western town on Pailin, a
former stronghold of Khmer Rouge and a gem-rich area near the Thai
border. It is reported that the pair worried over calls for a
tribunal and had left Pailin "to the Thai border."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Donates Hepatitis Vaccines to Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Lazaro Herrera, minister
counselor of the Embassy of Cuba, announced today that the Cuban
government will donate a shipment of hepatitis B vaccines valued
at 1.15 million US dollars to areas in China hit by record summer
flooding last year.
</P>
<P>
The vaccines will be used to prevent outbreaks of the
hepatitis B virus in the Yangtze River Valley in east China and
along the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in the northeast, according
to Yin Dakui, vice-minister of Health. Yin noted that the related
departments have closely monitored and effectively prevented the
spread of infectious diseases over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 million Chinese citizens, or 10 percent of the
country's total population, are HBV carriers. China plans to
increase inoculation efforts to lower the incidence rate for the
virus to one percent within the next 50 years, with special
emphasis to be place on related programs in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao to Invite Bids for Building Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Qingdao, a
major tourist destination in east China's Shandong Province, will
invite bids for the designs of major public buildings which will
be constructed in the future in an effort to add more color to
the city's appearance.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Chuankang, an official in charge of city planning in
Qingdao, said that public bidding will be arranged for
competitors from both home and abroad for the design of every
large public building from now on.
</P>
<P>
"We need advanced concepts as well as creative designs," Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao is famous for its variety of buildings, including
those in Greek, Japanese and Chinese styles, which were built in
recent centuries and have earned the city a reputation as an
"architectural museum."
</P>
<P>
To protect these historic structures, the city has been
developing a district on its eastern outskirts for new high-rises
since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also laid down a series of
regulations, stressing that all buildings erected in the urban
areas should be in line with the city's original style and
features.
</P>
<P>
The city is now working out a program for enhancing
international exchanges in architectural design.

<HEADLINE> ADB Upgrades Bangladesh's Loan Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has placed Bangladesh under a new classification of loan recipient
countries, a leading English daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's position to receive ADB loan has moved up from the
"eligibility to interest-free loans only" category to one eligible
for a mixed basket of interest-free and interest-bearing loans
under the new classification, The Independent quoted a source in
the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka's reclassification in ADB's loan portfolio became
effective from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The reclassification of Dhaka's position did not take place all
of a sudden, the source said, adding that the donor agencies such
as the World Bank and the ADB had been watching the steady rise in
the country's export earnings over the past years and took into
account Dhaka's capacity for debt serving.
</P>
<P>
This reclassification has opened an additional loan window, and
now Bangladesh would be able to borrow interest-bearing loans,
which are administered from a different window known as the
Ordinary Capital Resource (OCR), according to a source in the ADB
Dhaka office.
</P>
<P>
He, however, pointed out that the OCR falls in the category of
hard loan which is less concessionary. Bangladesh is eligible now
to draw from this fund if the government so desires, he added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that ADB's total loan commitment to
Bangladesh so far stands at 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, of which 1.2
billion dollars are now in the pipeline. There are about 36
on-going projects and the annual disbursement against them is
around 250 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Credit Cooperatives Play Big Role in Rural Financing System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's rural credit
cooperatives, which celebrate their 50th anniversary this year,
have been playing an increasingly important role in the rural
financial system, according to a senior official of the People's
Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the country's central bank,
show that by the end of September 1998, the total assets of
rural credit cooperatives had amounted to 1.55 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of deposits in rural credit c
ooperatives had reached 1.17 trillion yuan, accounting for 12.7
percent of the total deposits in all financial institutions,
while the outstanding loans by rural credit cooperatives was
829.3 billion yuan, accounting for 10 percent of all the loans
extended by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1977, when China first began its reform and
opening policies, the deposits and loans of rural credit
cooperatives have increased by 72 times and 208 times,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that some 80 percent of loans to farmers
and 70 percent of loans to township enterprises have been
extended by rural credit cooperatives.

<HEADLINE> Credit Cooperatives Play Big Role in Rural Financing System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's rural credit cooperatives were organized by farmers
who voluntarily bought shares in them when the People's Republic
of China was founded in 1949. In the 1950s and 1960s these
cooperatives played a significant role in financing farmers'
production and improving their life-styles. Over the recent 20
years, they have experienced fast development along with the
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the cooperatives were separated from the Agricultural
Bank of China, which enabled their standardization to take place
in accordance with the principles imbued in real cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At present China has more than 50,000 independent such
cooperatives with staff totaling 650,000, representing one
administrator per one thousand farmers.
</P>
<P>
The director of the central bank's department for supervising
cooperative financial institutions, Zhang Gongping, said that
there are still difficulties and problems in their management due
to certain policies or organizational and management reasons.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of credit cooperatives are suffering
from a deteriorating asset quality and operating losses, while
some have become insolvent.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, the central bank announced that it intended to
step up supervision on the cooperatives and would try to
introduce a more effective and efficient system within three
years. Pilot programs were then carried out in ten counties to
try and alleviate the financial risk suffered by the cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that the on-going changes planned for the
cooperatives will focus on those that are insolvent or at high
risk, as well as in improving financial supervision, the internal
control mechanisms and the support given to agricultural
production.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of rare plants,
which will be a highlight of the 1999 World Horticulture Expo to
be held in May in Kunming, have been saved by 3,000 local
policemen and civilians from a freak snow-fall which hit the city
last week.
</P>
<P>
Many of the trees and flowers transplanted into the "expo
garden" in southwest Yunnan's capital, are precious, valuable and
from tropical locations; hardly able to cope with the unexpected
cold snap. They were covered with straw in a desperate bid to
keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
In the city, traditionally renowned for its permanent
Spring-like weather, more than fifty bonfires were lit by the
local fire brigades to provide warmth for the special flowers,
trees and other plants which could easily die because of the
cold.
</P>
<P>
And local workers assisted by soldiers were forced to move
more than 10,000 valuable plants out of the expo's fifteen
greenhouses, which were destroyed by the snow storm.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday the snow stopped and sunshine began to melt the ice
, much to the relief of the expo organizers who have worked hard
to meet the deadline - and the quality of the displays - for the
event. Now they plan to re-build the greenhouses and move the
plants back in.

<HEADLINE> Firework Ban Remains in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Deputy Mayor has
vowed to enforce the ban on firecrackers in the city during the
traditional Spring Festival which begins on February 16.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xuenong's ruling came as an illegal firecracker plant in
rural east Anhui Province blew up over the weekend killing 14
people and seriously wounding three others.
</P>
<P>
He has ordered all public security organs and fire brigades to
be vigilant and prevent fires as a result of fire-crackers during
the most important of Chinese holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital has recently suffered a series of
disastrous fires, which resulted in heavy financial losses. The
latest conflagration, last week, completely destroyed the city's
largest lamp market in the southwestern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1993, when Beijing introduced the ban, fewer
people have been injured by firecrackers, which have been a
traditional Chinese way of celebrating festivals for centuries,
and there have been far fewer fires.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from local hospitals show that they received an
average of 1,380 patients injured by crackers every year during
the five years leading up to the ban but only 521 patients were
hospitalized a year later.
</P>
<P>
However, many people are resentful of the ban because they
insist firecrackers add to the enjoyment at festival time and
have called for the municipal government loosen their ruling. And
some other big cities across China have resumed the firework
custom after years of prohibition.
</P>
<P>
But Beijing's local authorities and legislative body have
reiterated the firm stance they have taken against allowing the
setting off of firecrackers.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Arabian baboon in the
Chongqing Zoo recently ate her newborn cub as visitors to the zoo
looked on, according to the latest issue of the Yangcheng Evening

According to local sources, this was the second such incident
among the baboons in the zoo. Previously, a male baboon with a
high position in the ape hierarchy violently tore a younger
baboon to pieces.

Experts say that many males in the animal kingdom take to

social position.

However, they could not explain the eccentric behavior of this
mother killer, and scientists plan to investigate further, the

<HEADLINE> Relations With Zimbabwe Cordial: British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain still views its
relations with Zimbabwe as cordial despite recent assertions by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe that it was leading in
criticism against the country abroad, British High Commissioner to
Zimbabwe Peter Longworth said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Longworth said while the two countries disagreed "now and then"
on some issues, it was natural although both nations hoped the
disagreements were not often.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good thriving relationship with Zimbabwe. Where we
fall out occasionally is on policy," he told journalists at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, President Mugabe accused Britain of
leading the band wagon of criticisms and malicious statements
against his government instead of taking the front seat in
promoting its programs.
</P>
<P>
But Longworth said Britain was one of the donor countries which
wished to see Zimbabwe succeed in every sphere of development and
was actually doing so through various developmental projects it
supports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat denied Mugabe's argument that British companies in
Zimbabwe repatriated large amounts of their profits to Britain
each year yet, in comparison, the aid Zimbabwe got from the
European country was a pittance.
</P>
<P>
On the contentious land issue in Zimbabwe, Longworth said
Britain supported land reforms which were aimed at alleviating
poverty without impacting on agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to allocate resources once the first inception
phase agreed on at the land conference starts," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which
Zimbabwe has intervened in support of President Laurent Kabila's
government, Longworth said his government was behind all efforts
to bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
"We support the withdrawal of foreign troops and signing of a
ceasefire agreement. We have interest in seeing peace and
stability in Africa," he said.

SOFIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Chief of
General Staff Hussein Kivrigouglu said he was happy with the
decision to station the Multinational Peace Force of Southeastern
Europe (MPFSEE) in Plovdiv, the second largest city in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to framework for a regional multinational
peacekeeping force agreed in Athens Tuesday by defense ministers
of seven southern and eastern European states.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, command of the MPFSEE will be rotated

in August 1991, followed by Greece.
</P>
<P>
Kivrigouglu, who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day official
visit, told reporters that cooperation between the Bulgarian and
Turkish military on Bulgarian territory will strengthen bilateral
relations and enhance peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that the Balkan
peacekeeping force may intervene in the Kosovo crisis in case of
deterioration of the situation and following the adoption of the
relevant decision by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Kivrigouglu voiced hopes that a naval force twin to the land
force will be set up in the region of the Black Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Gary Becker, United States
Nobel Economics Prize winner, suggested Mexico adopt the U.S.
dollar to avoid recurrent financial crisis due to Mexico peso's
periodic devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Becker said that Mexico's monetary system should be
permanently reformed through a monetary council to avoid exchange
rate crises such as the 1994 currency collapse, newspapers quoted
Becker as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Becker, born in 1930, was awarded the 1992 Nobel Prize in
economics for his research that extended economic theory to areas
of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
He noted that without permanently aligning the peso at a fixed
rate with the dollar, Mexico will continue to be affected by
world financial turbulence, even though its monetary policy is st
abilized.
</P>
<P>
Becker also recommended that Mexico continue its economic
reforms, boost deregulation and privatization in a bid to attract
more foreign investments and capitals.
</P>
<P>
Exchange markets instability due to a world financial crisis
pushed Mexico's inflation rate to a staggering 18.6 percent last
year, much higher than the predicted 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wobbling exchange rates prompted a debate in Mexico's
financial sectors whether the peso should be linked to the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Number of Bengal Tigers Decreasing in Sundarbans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The population of Bengal tigers,
one of the world's most magnificent animals, is decreasing rapidly
following poaching and shrinking of livable spaces inside the
Sundarbans, which is located in southwestern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to registered cases between 1976 to 1985, the annual
average of tiger killing was 12 while in the year 1997 to 1998
some nine tigers were killed in the area, leading researcher
Professor Anwarul Islam of the Zoology Department of Jahangirnagar
University was quoted by The Daily Star newspaper Wednesday as
saying at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Since the turn of this century, the habitat and number of
Bengal tigers have been reduced by up to 95 percent, said Islam,
who is now leading a research team to study the ecological
requirements of the Bengal tiger in the Sundarbans.
</P>
<P>
Tiger poaching was continuing everywhere in the Sundarbans, the
largest mangrove forest in the world, and there are allegations
that some of the forest officials have connections with the
poachers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tiger skin, though not easily available, was sometimes
illegally sold in the Dhaka and Chittagong markets, he alleged,
adding that tiger teeth, claws and purses made from tiger skins
were also sometimes sold illegally in tourist shops in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Tiger is protected here by third schedule of the Bangladesh
Wildlife Preservation Act, 1974, but these were never properly
implemented, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Bengal tigers are experiencing a major threat due to
habitat loss, rise of salinity and human interference inside the
area, according to the paper presented by the research team.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 people work in the Sundarbans with a total area of
5,800 square kilometers every year for various purposes like
collection of shrimp fry, fishing and felling, the paper observed.
</P>
<P>
The Bengal tiger was once found in all the forests of
Bangladesh but today it is found only in the Sundarbans.
</P>
<P>
However, tidal ecosystem of the Sundarbans is not a suitable
habitat for the tigers, but they were forced to take shelter in
this habitat due to human disturbances and loss of other types of
forest lands, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Prompts Peso to Keep on Soaring? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso has kept on
soaring steadily in the past two weeks, enabling the central bank
to cut key overnight rates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged at a new nine-month high of 37.811 to the
U.S. dollar Tuesday, the highest since last April when it stood at
37.817. In the previous day, the peso closed at 37.830.
</P>
<P>
The peso has gained its strength since this year's first
trading day on January 4, when it ended at a seven-month high. It
closed at 38.57 pesos to the dollar, the highest since hitting
38.47 on May 27 last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the peso's continuous rise, the central bank Tuesday
lowered its overnight borrowing rate to 13 percent from 13.375
percent, and its overnight lending rate to 15 percent from 15.375
percent.
</P>
<P>
But currency traders said that the central bank move is
unlikely to invite a new wave of speculative attacks against the
peso.
</P>
<P>
What has prompted the Philippine currency to keep on rising?
</P>
<P>
The soaring peso, just like other Southeast Asian currencies,
mirrored gains of the euro and the Japanese yen against the dollar
since the beginning of the new year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A buying spree in favor of the euro against the dollar helped
fuel a rally in the peso and other regional currencies, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
The euro's pressure on the dollar and the increase in
investment repatriation by Japanese investors have forced the
dollar to tumble to a 27-month low against the yen this week.
</P>
<P>
The two factors supported the yen's strengthen against the
dollar. The dollar has breached the 110-yen level this week and
slipped to 108 yen Tuesday before it rebounded to 112 after the
Central Bank of Japan intervened in the market.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the yen's surge against the dollar also fueled the
gains in the peso and other Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, Philippine officials have attributed the peso's quick
rebound to the return of investor confidence in the Philippine
economy and a successful bond offering in the international
capital market.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Tuesday that foreign
investors are already making distinctions among economies in the
region and are now looking at the Philippines different from the
other countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The success of the recent floating of 1 billion dollars of
global bonds also led to renewed confidence in the Philippine
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government's offering of 750 million dollars of
global bonds in the U.S. market drew subscriptions totaling 2.5
billion dollars, three times more than the package. The government
described the bond floating as a success.
</P>
<P>
Other officials said that the stable demand of the dollar has
also prompted the peso to rise, as an increase in dollar demand
usually pushes down the peso-dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
There are not so much demand for dollar in the Philippines
because most corporate dollar exposures have already been served,
they said.
</P>
<P>
But a stronger peso is not always a good thing. Philippine
President Joseph Estrada said last week that the peso should be
settled at 39-40 to the dollar this year, as a stronger peso will
affect the country's exports, which already slowed down from an
average growth of 17 percent in the first 10 months of 1998 to 12
percent last November.
</P>
<P>
However, the return of investor confidence and the expected
economic recovery in 1999 may push the peso to the 35 level
against the dollar in the months ahead, traders said.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the peso stable, they said, the central bank
could intervene if the currency continues to appreciate further in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that Tuesday's key rate cuts could ease the
peso's pressure to continue soaring and further cuts in interest
rates are expected soon.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- France, one of the
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, on
Tuesday initiated U.N. talks on a new policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a closed meeting with U.N. ambassadors from the other four
permanent members of the council -- China, Russia, the United
States and Britain -- French Ambassador Alain Dejammet proposed
to loosen U.N. sanctions against Iraq and ease up the arms
inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
France is expected to release a general proposal on Wednesday
to reiterate its earlier ideas on the Iraqi issue, according to
U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the United States and Britain, which
support a tough position on Saddam Hussein's regime, have
cold-shouldered the French proposal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said before the meeting, "Any
change in the sanctions regime that says that Iraq has met its
disarmament requirements is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Burleigh said work must be done to verify whether Iraq had
"relaunched" any project to produce weapons of mass destruction,
particularly in the biological field.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Crime Rate in 1998 Hits Seven Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria registered a total
159,317 criminal offenses in 1998, record low in seven years, the
Bulgarian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zahari Zarkov, head of Coordination and Information Analyses
at the Interior Ministry, said the figure represented a 30
percent drop from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, Zarkov said, the number of crimes related to drug
manufacturing and trafficking were on the rise and the trend was
likely to persist into this year.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile delinquency was on the decline whereas the number of
teenage criminals was up, which, Zarkov said, indicated a growing
trend for gang organization in these crimes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the recorded crime involved thefts, including 28,096
house-breakings, Zarkov said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the 53.42 percent of the crimes had
been cleared, ranking Bulgaria second in Europe in terms of the
clear-up rate, said Chavdar Kroumov, head of Interior Ministry's
press office.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangkok Haunted by Spate of Bomb Hoaxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A series of bomb hoaxes have
haunted Bangkok and put police on high alert, police sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Several rank calls had been made to the 191 police radio center
 Tuesday alone about possible bomb attacks at various spots in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The International School of Bangkok was closed Wednesday after
receiving a bomb threat the day before.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the school said the campus had closed at 6 p.m.
local time for "security reasons". Police sent officers and
sniffer dogs to the scene but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, police arrested a woman Tuesday on
suspicion of making a hoax call about a bomb at a restraurant in
downtown Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Sukanya Chanthong, made the call to the 191 police
radio center on a cellular phone at 11 p.m. local time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sukanya, 20, admitted she had made the hoax call for fun and
expressed regret for her action.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok also received a bomb
threat and was closed for one day.
</P>
<P>
Recently a spate of bombings have rocked the city but caused no
casualties. Police are still searching for the suspects. The
motive of the bombings remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
The bombings have prompted the government to step up security
at official buildings and public places.
</P>
<P>
In a latest bomb attack Monday night, the house of a former
official of the Muang district municipality was damaged.
</P>
<P>
The explosion caused the office roof to cave in and shattered
the windows, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts suspected the attack to be the work of a
professional. The bomb was a home-made device using materials
similar to those used in quarries and was only meant to
intimidate, police said.
</P>
<P>
The targeted house is close to the Democrat Party headquarters
and police are investigating whether the blast is in any way
connected to a series of recent bombings in the city.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Help Probe Sri Lankan Rebels Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan has assured Sri Lanka that Thailand will fully cooperate
in probing Tamil rebels activities in its territory, the official
Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will never allow the use of its territory by foreign
anti-government movements to attack another government, said
Pitsuwan while meeting with Sri Lanka's new Ambassador to Thailand
Karunatilaka Amunugama Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Thailand is ready to cooperate with
Sri Lanka in any way and will offer full cooperation to put an end
to any speculation about rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) using Thai territory.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC World Service Radio "Asia Today" interview aired
Tuesday, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said,
"Some Thai ports have been used by known LTTE ships and coastal
towns on the Thai border have been used as naval bases."
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar, however, assured that relations with the Thai
government would not be soured.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that both the Thai Foreign Ministry and
the Thai army have denied that Tamil Tigers had used Thailand's
coastal areas as secret bases to ship weapons and ammunition to
northern Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Intervenes Rubber Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has resumed
its intervention to curb the drop of rubber prices, government
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since this week, the government has spent 10.1 million baht
(280,555 U.S. dollars) to buy 470,000 tons of rubber.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4 billion baht (1.1 billion dollars) has been set
aside for the intervention, according to Deputy Agriculture
Minister Newin Chidchob.
</P>
<P>
Newin said earlier that the intervention project had so far
drawn "unsatisfactory" response due to some criteria used, weak
public relations and a limited number of buying points.
</P>
<P>
Agencies concerned are to meet later Wednesday to consider
allowing planters to sell more rubber daily and the opening of
more buying points.
</P>
<P>
Rubber planters are currently allowed to sell based on the
ratio of two kilos per rai (one rai equals 0.16 hectares) per day.
They might be allowed to sell more, probably at three kilos per
rai per day, Newin said.
</P>
<P>
Newin claimed the price intervention had helped convince
traders to buy rubber at the prices close to those offered by the
government -- 21.65 baht (60 U.S. cents) per kilo for first grade
rubber, 21.35 baht (59 cents) per kilo for second grade rubber ,
21 baht (58 cents) for third grade rubber and 20 baht (55 cents)
for fourth grade rubber.
</P>
<P>
Newin said he believed that rubber prices would "certainly" go
up but could not say by how much.
</P>
<P>
He said private warehouses paid by the Office of the Rubber
Replanting Aid Fund to keep rubber at the rate of 85 bath (2.36
dollars) per ton/month would have to pay for damage caused to the
rubber in their storage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prasit Damrongchai, permanent secretary of the Prime
Minister's Office, said a working group had been set up to monitor
the use of the 4-billion-baht fund for the price intervention
scheme.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government would
halt any initiative for adoption of Nepali children by foreigners,
The Kathmandu Post Wednesday quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate to abandon your children in favor of
foreigners, an act comparable to selling," Home Minister Govind
Raj Joshi Tuesday told a symposium on the existing laws on
adoption.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we abandon our own children if adoption by
foreigners is so good?" he further said. His ministry decides on
applications for adoption.
</P>
<P>
The Country Code has allowed adoption of Nepali children by
foreigners in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
By mid-November 1998, a total of 788 children had been adopted
by foreigners, most of them Europeans and Americans, The Kathmandu
Post said.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that 150 foreigners are awaiting decision on
their applications for adoption of Nepali children.
</P>
<P>
Adoption by foreigners is criticized in Nepal on grounds of
national dignity and ethics, it added.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of U.N. Plane Found in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) told the
United Nations that it had located the wreckage of a
U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed on January 2 with nine
people aboard, U.N. officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that UNITA had been asked to take a U.N.
search team to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports, presented to Benon Sevan who is the U.N.
under-secretary in charge of security, said that there were no
survivors aboard. But the officials cautioned they had no
independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Sevan is returning from Angola and is expected to be back in
New York on Wednesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The January 2 crash was the second U.N. aircraft that had been
shot down in Angola's central highlands province of Huambo since
December 26.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously
condemned the shoot-down of two U.N.-chartered planes over the
UNITA-held territory and blamed rebel leader Jonas Savimbi for fai
ling to cooperate with the U.N. search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. search team last Friday paid a brief visit to the first
crash site, some 30 kilometers east of Huambo, capital of Huambo
Province, where they found charred wreckage but were unable to con
duct an investigation simply because of the on-going fierce
fighting in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and UNITA blamed each other for the
clashes of the two U.N. planes, which had been delivering
humanitarian aid to the government-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were locked in a civil war in early December,
leading to the breakdown of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Threaten Vietnam's Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires threatened Vietnam's
environment, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A fire lasting from January 4 to January 11 ruined more than
400 hectares of protective forest and natural forest in Vietnam's
northern mountainous province of Bac Kan.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in Nhu Co Commune on January 4 and spread
out to Thanh Binh, Nong Ha, Nong Thinh, Binh Van, Cao Ky and Thanh
Van communes and was eventually extinguished on January 11.
</P>
<P>
According to VNA, some 72 forest fires occurred in Vietnam's
central highlands province of Kon Tum in the 1997-1998 dry season,
destroying nearly 700 hectares of forest in comparison with only 7
forest fires which devastated 45.75 hectares in the 1996-1997 dry
season.
</P>
<P>
The township of Kon Tum alone had 26 forest fires which ruined
175.5 hectares of upstream protective forest.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,681 forest fires, said VNA, occurred nationwide
during the 1997-1998 dry season, ruining 19,819 hectares of
forest, including 6,293 hectares of natural forest, 7,888 hectares
of planted forest and 496 hectares of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged droughts, inefficient fire fighting forces, lack of
fire extinguishers and loose coordination between local
authorities and forest rangers are attributed to forest fires, VNA
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Records 12.1 Pct Industrial Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial growth rate
reached 12.1 percent in 1998, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The output of state-owned enterprises represented 46.18 percent
of the country's industrial production, up by 7.93 percent
compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested sector, including 35 enterprises brought
into operation in 1998, made up 31.82 percent of the nation's
industrial production, an increase of 23.33 percent compared with
1997, the highest rate recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
Non-state enterprises accounted for the remaining 22 percent,
an increase of 6.7 percent, the lowest industrial growth rate in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News quoted Industry Minister Dang Vu Chu as saying
that the production of major industrial products including crude
oil, cement, beer, paper, electricity and motorbikes increased
significantly and contributed to industrial growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector scored such achievements because of new
government policies and initiatives which created favorable
conditions for and facilitated industrial development, Chu said at
a year-end meeting in Ho Chi Minh City Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Vietnam's industrial sector attained a 5,800-6,000
million U.S. dollars export turnover. Major industrial exports
were textiles and garments, crude oil, footwear, electronic
products and coal.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's industrial sector's imports made up 6,200 million
dollars of the country's estimated import turnover of 11,350
million dollars. Major imports were machinery and industrial
production equipment.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Industry Ministry is targeting a 1999 industrial
production growth rate of 10.57 percent.

<HEADLINE> ISRO Satellites, Launchers to Be Ariane Compatible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Space Research
Organization (ISRO) has decided to make its future satellites and
launchers compatible with Ariane space systems to enable one
organization to launch the other's satellites in orbit, official
sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed an agreement between ISRO and Ariane, the
European consortium, late last year which allows Ariane to launch
its low earth orbiting satellites aboard ISRO's medium-range Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). ISRO is hopeful of bagging
satellite launching as well as satellite business from Ariane.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-compatible mating system will be installed in its
Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), ISRO's most
ambitious rocket project expected to take off by the end of 1999.
Similarly, the Insat-3 series of satellites, too, will have Ariane
connectivity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ISRO designed its satellites to suit the launching
contractor. Most of its satellites have U.S. Delta compatibility,
as they were originally built to Ford Aerospace design.
</P>
<P>
Ariane maintains a full order book and, following the
ISRO-Ariane deal, there is a strong possibility of the latter
passing on some of its business to ISRO. Also, Ariane
compatibility will give ISRO the strength to bid independently for
launch and satellite building contracts, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Urges Leniency for 18 Fishermen Jailed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has asked Thailand to
reduce the jail terms for 18 Vietnamese fishermen who were caught
in Thai waters last year, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese were initially sentenced to one month jail and
fined 50,000 baht (1,389 U.S. dollars) each. But none could pay
the fine and opted to serve 714 days in jail instead, the Bangkok
Post quoted foreign ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fishermen have served about half of their jail
terms in Surat Thani, southern Thailand. And a member of the group
has died.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Thailand has expressed regret for not informing
the Vietnamese side of the death until recently.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities are looking into the Vietnamese request
since there is no extradition agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider the conditions that will enable us to meet
the Vietnamese request," one official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Currently, two Thai fishermen and a fishing trawler are
detained in Vietnam, a much smaller number than before because of
positive developments in bilateral relations after a decade of
dispute over fishing rights in overlapping territorial waters in
the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have tried to improve their ties with an
agreement to delimit the overlapping boundary in the Gulf of
Thailand, signed in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, commanders-in-chief of the Thai and
Vietnamese navies will sign a memorandum of understanding on joint
patrols along the 80-nautical-mile demarcation line of the
exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will launch joint patrols in sea rescues and
operations against smugglers and pirates.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy to Recover in 2000: Think-Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's leading private
economic think-tank Econit has predicted that the country's
economy will recover next year, the Indonesian Observer reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's economy will still see a contraction of minus four
percent in 1999... (and) enter a phase of economic recovery in
2000. But this largely depends on a new platform of political
stability," Econit said in its report entitled "Econit economic
outlook 1999: The year of resolution".
</P>
<P>
The government, in its draft budget last week, forecast zero
economic growth in the 1999/2000 fiscal year compared with a
12-percent contraction expected in the 1998/99 fiscal year ending
March 31.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast an inflation rate this year of around 25
percent, higher than the government's estimate.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of (1999) inflation will be a lack of supply of food
such as rice, meat, chicken and soybeans. In addition, inflation
will also be caused by plans to end the subsidies on petrol,
electricity and rising prices of a number of commodities. With an
estimate of a budget deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP (gross domestic
product), inflation is expected to reach 25 percent in 1999," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget assumed an average inflation of 17 percent in
1999/2000, with a budget deficit of around 4.8 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Econit said a credible leader is essential for economic
recovery in the world's fourth most populous country of 200
million people.

<HEADLINE> Machine-Building Industry To Concentrate on Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's machine-building
industry has to improve its production capacity and marketing in
order to tap into the big potential market in rural areas, the
State Administration of Machinery Industry SAMI) director Shao
Qihui warned recently.
</P>
<P>
He announced that in the next five years, the industry will
concentrate on developing technology and products that meet the
demand in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"The auto industry has failed to capture the market for
vehicles in rural areas due to a lack of market research. This is
a profound lesson that the whole machine-building industry should
learn," said Zhang Xiaoyu, deputy-director of the SAMI.
</P>
<P>
The annual production output of powered vehicles, including
tractors, for farming areas has now reached 1.8 million units,
far exceeding China's general auto output.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang pointed out that in the past the machinery industry
did not pay enough attention to the rural market and instead
dumped, stockpiled or even sold inferior products in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics supplied by SAMI, farming communities
in China will have a need for 3,000 to 5,000 large tractors every
year by 2000. However, at present there is only an annual
production capacity of several hundred large tractors and the
sector has been forced to rely on importing several thousand
tractors annually over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Yet, there are twelve tractor manufacturers in China with a
total production capability of 100,000 small to medium sized
tractors every year but half of their capacity is idle.
</P>
<P>
At present, only four percent of rice and less than one
percent of corn is mechanically harvested in China but it is
estimated that by 2000, the number of combined harvesters
bringing in the rice crop will increase by 8 to 16 times from
26,000 unit to 50,000. The number for harvesting corn is expected
to increase five fold to 16,000 units.
</P>
<P>
It is also predicted that China will need 2,000 to 3,000 grain
dyers and 60,000 to 70,000 sets of irrigation and water conservan
cy equipment. In addition there will be a huge demand for
cultivating machines, environmental protection and pest control
machines, feed processing machines and diesel engines for farm
machines.
</P>
<P>
The SAMI has listed nine machinery products that it plans to
develop for rural consumers. In the meantime, it recommends the
phasing out of a number of farm machines that have become
obsolete and of no further use on farms.
</P>
<P>
The China National Harvester Machinery Corporation started
manufacturing combined harvesters for bringing in the wheat crop
for individual farmers ten years ago. Now it has become the
largest combined harvester manufacturer in the world, holding
over 70 percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Company President Lang Zhongqiang said that the company has
become the most profitable enterprise in the country's farm
machine industry because it provides rural consumers with
reliable products and a complete range of after-care services.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Judge to Attend Pinochet Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish
judge whose warrant led to the arrest of Augusto Pinochet, will
go to London to attend hearings of Britain's highest court on the
fate of the former Chilean dictator, legal sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Garzon was authorized by the General Council of Legal Powers,
the highest body governing Spanish judges, to be present when
seven Law Lords re-hear arguments next Monday on whether Pinochet
enjoys immunity from prosecution as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
However, Garzon will take no part in the hearing which begins
on January 18. His views will be represented by the British
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Garzon's request for Pinochet's arrest and extradition on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism led to the dictator's
detention in London last October. Pinochet remains under police
guard at a mansion some 30 kilometers west of London.
</P>
<P>
An initial decision by the House of Lords that Pinochet had no
sovereign immunity for crimes committed during his 17-year rule
was overturned after one of the judges was found to have links to
the human rights group Amnesty International which had lobbied
for his prosecution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A newly-adopted regulation
encouraging investment from pharmaceutical or other sectors is
expected to spur development of new traditional Chinese medicines
(TCM).
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation published by the State Administration of
TCM (SATCM), a list of key projects for TCM scientific and
technological research will be published. Research institutes and
investors could participate in open biddings and sign cooperative
contracts.
</P>
<P>
SATCM will supervise contracts and help promote outstanding
research results and products, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The administration plans to promulgate another regulation to
tighten management over laboratories for TCM scientific and
technological research programs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drive will speed up advancement of TCM science and
technology and deliver research results quickly for production
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 10 to 20 percent of scientific research
regarding TCMs can be put into production, according to
statistics of SATCM.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Laureate Recommends Mexico Adopt US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Nobel Economy Prize
laureate Gary Becker has suggested Mexico adopt the US dollar to
avoid recurrent financial crises due to the peso's periodic
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Becker said that Mexico's monetary system should be perm
anently reformed through a monetary council similar to those set
up by countries like Argentina to avoid exchange rate crises such
as the 1994 currency collapse.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 68, one of the world's most influential economists,
was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992 for his work linking economic
analysis to the sociological study of human relations and
behavior.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if monetary policy was stabilized without
permanently aligning the peso at a fixed rate to the dollar,
Mexico would continue to be affected by world financial
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Becker recommended continuing with economic openness reforms,
boosting deregulation and privatization, and promoting free
enterprise to continue attracting foreign investment and capital
to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Last year's instability on the exchange markets with the world
financial crisis led to adjustments in interest rates and a
strong rise in inflation to a staggering 18.6 percent, a 55
percent increase above the predicted 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wobbling exchange rates prompted a debate in financial sectors
which recommended linking the peso to the dollar through a
monetary council or through the adoption of a single currency
within the North American Free Trade market.

<HEADLINE> China Needs To Restructure Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- As mergers sweep through the
world's auto industry, creating monolithic giants capable of
dominating the market, China's own fledgling car manufacturers
see a growing need to pull the companies together to have an even
chance of competing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, deputy director of the State Administration of
Machinery Industry (SAMI), acknowledged recently that China's
auto companies are still too weak and dispersed.
</P>
<P>
Now, he revealed, the administration has drawn up a plan to
accelerate the integration of the country's auto industry by
developing three huge companies and a dozen major manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shao Qihui, the director of SAMI, believes
that if China is finally allowed into the World Trade Organiz
ation (WTO), it will have only a few years to upgrade its auto
industry to tackle the competition from international rivals.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we concentrate resources to develop our
own cars in the near future," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are now 200 auto companies in China but their annual
output is only 1.6 million vehicles, equal to that of a medium
sized auto factory in the west. The three largest, the Shanghai
Automotive Industry Corporation, First Automobile Works (FAW)
Group and Dongfeng Motor Corporation, each has a production
capacity of less than 200,000 vehicles per year. And FAW's annual
sales revenue is equal to only two percent of that achieved by
General Motors of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Despite stringent efforts to use domestic made parts for
foreign cars manufactured in China, more than 75 percent of the
technologies used to make new models are imported. And the time
cycle for developing a new car is at least twice that of foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
With several large Japanese auto firms on the verge of being
taken over by larger companies, a Chinese auto industry expert
said that if the country relaxed protection of its national auto
industry, local companies, which are less competitive than the
Japanese, will be no match for the foreign giants.
</P>
<P>
He estimates that the cost of developing a new car is at least
150 million US dollars. However, the Chinese Government plans to
invest 109.1 billion yuan (1.3 billion US dollars) in the auto
industry in the last five years of the century. But, he noted, if
China wanted to develop a new car every six months, it would only
have 130 million US dollars of government funds for each one.
</P>
<P>
All auto companies in China are under government control and
are burdened with an average debt-to-asset ratio of 80 percent,
while a fierce price war is also eating into their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
"No individual auto car maker in China can currently afford
the cost of developing a new vehicle," China Qingqi Group
Vice-President Zhou Zhongwei said.
</P>
<P>
He suggests that besides the need to localize the industry,
the Chinese Government should ask foreign companies setting up
joint-ventures in China to meet certain criteria for joint
research and development activities and for technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
"We should trade our market potential for technology which we
can use in the future to develop a domestic industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese auto companies have sent hundreds of talented
engineers to foreign car makers to take part in research and
development projects to learn new technologies and skills which
can be used in China.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claim that
they have developed an advanced computer super server system
which can be widely used in research fields of oil, power, space,
banking and other basic projects.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from National Intelligence Computer Research Center

<HEADLINE> Stable Steel Market in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's steel market expects
better results in 1999 with a rise in demand and a reasonable
pick-up in prices, according to China Metallurgical News.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts indicate that steel consumption will grow by about
four percent this year, alleviating the excessive oversupply,
while 1998's consumption is estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The higher consumption will be triggered by fixed-asset
investment although the demand for household manufactured goods
may decline.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that steel exports will continue to drop
due to the ongoing effect of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The supply of steel resources expects to increase at a rate no
more than five percent and although a hike in prices could
improve the recovery, no substantial price rise is expected since
it will remain a buyer's market.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Head: Yugoslav Captives to be Soon Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek, said Tuesday that the eight Yugoslav
soldiers taken captive by the ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
would soon be released.
</P>
<P>
In Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo, Vollebaek said
negotiations to free the hostages ended successfully, the
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have had positive results," he said. "We have reached an
agreement with the KLA on an early release of the detainees."
</P>
<P>
However, he made no mention of the specific time for the
release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
International monitors in Kosovo have been talking with both
the KLA rebels and Serbian authorities since the soldiers were
kidnapped last Friday in KLA-held territory in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Vollebaek's announcement, the Yugoslav army
warned the soldiers must be released "unconditionally" or it
would use force to free them.
</P>
<P>
Milivoje Novkovic, information director of the Headquarters of
the General Staff, said the captives were members of the
legitimate armed forces of the Yugoslav Federation, an
independent and sovereign state. No one had the right to deprive
them of their freedom without authorization.
</P>
<P>
"The kidnapping of Yugoslav army members by Albanian
separatists and terrorists is a flagrant example of an insane
criminal act," he said.
</P>
<P>
Novkovic welcomed the international community's condemnation
of the terrorist activities by the ethnic Albanian separatists,
and the efforts made by Vollebaek and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) verification mission
for their release.
</P>
<P>
Novkovic said the Yugoslav military was doing everything
necessary to free the soldiers. He warned that the Yugoslav
military did not rule out the possibility of using their right to
rescue the hostages by force.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told Vollebaek in
Belgrade on Monday that time was running out for the KLA rebels
to free the captives.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav army tanks were deployed close to Stari Trg, near
where the soldiers were being held in the village of Bajgora,
poised for action in case talks failed.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the Kosovo conflict last February, more
than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands
displaced despite the ceasefire under the peace deal struck by
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke last October.
</P>
<P>
The Pristina Information Center said Tuesday that in the first
11 days of 1999, the armed ethnic Albanian forces in Kosovo
launched a total of 80 attacks against policemen, military troops
and civilians alike, killing four policemen and six civilians.
</P>
<P>
Nine policemen and five civilians were wounded in the attacks
while eight Yugoslav soldiers and one civilian were taken
hostage.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Ambassador to Return to London This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean ambassador to
Britain, Mario Artaza, will return to London this weekend for the
start on Monday of the House of Lords ruling on whether former
dictator General Augusto Pinochet has the right to diplomatic imm
unity from extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza on Tuesday said that the
return of Artaza, who was recalled to Santiago since the
beginning of December, was due to the fact that "we have many
affairs to attend there, many problems to face, since there will
be political measures that will have to be taken concerning this
situation".
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the Pinochet case, many leading
political figures were travelling to London and that constant
contact had to be maintained with the British Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said that if "intervening parties" were called in the
case, Chile should be chosen first.

<HEADLINE> Italian Banks Suffer from Launch of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian banks have found that the
arrival of the single currency euro has actually brought them
loss from the exchange commission between the Italian lire and
other Euroland's currencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian banker's association ABI, before
January 1 their commission on money-changing was incorporated
into the difference between the buying and selling rates. But
now they are bound to buy and sell at the same rate and so the
hidden costs are completely visible.
</P>
<P>
A rapid survey of exchange rates showed that a million lire
last month bought 1,005 marks or 3,335 francs. On Monday it
yielded 974 marks or 3,269 francs, resulting in loss of 30,000
and 25,000 lire respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the euro for non-cash transactions,
Italian banks had adopted a standing charge of 5,000 lire plus 3
percent on the overall amount being exchanged. But ABI pointed
out that the 3 percent commission charge had been fixed as a
maximum recommended rate and that, hopefully, competition between
banks would bring the percentage down.
</P>
<P>
The association also stressed that the partial arrival of a
single currency had not reduced in any way the cost storing,
transporting and insuring foreign currencies like marks and
francs. The Italian banks will lose profits from
forthcoming-lower commission, the ABI forecast.

<HEADLINE> China's Female Students Outnumber Males in Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's university
administrators are faced with something of a thorny problem they
could never have imagined in the past as the number of female
students taking arts subjects has now far overtaken the male
input.
</P>
<P>
In a survey among all students reaching minimum entry
standards for Beijing colleges, female candidates accounted for
74 percent of the total and even in subjects normally dominated
by males, the female candidates reached 42 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
And at the Shanghai International Studies University last year
the admissions department found that all eighteen of the
candidates in Beijing for arts subjects were female.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Foreign Studies University, female students account
for 75 percent of the total. Among 1998's 62 newly recruited
students in the foreign languages department of the People's
University, only twenty are males.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics in the 1998 national college
entrance examination the ratio of male participants to female was
1:0.7, but a snap survey revealed that female examinees scored
higher in arts subjects than their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Now in order to restore the balance, a number of colleges say
they will introduce different acceptance standards for male and
female candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou Xiaozheng, professor of sociology in the
People's University says there is no need to worry about the
situation which is very normal given the nature of China's
current development.
</P>
<P>
"The national college entrance examination is a very fair
system of choosing talented students in China. Everyone, without
regard to his or her ethnic group, gender or background, has the
right to take part in the exam. The success of female students in
the national college examination is due to their own efforts," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pledges Greater Commitment to Fight Against Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government has
announced a series of measures to crackdown on serious crime
after a wave of killings shocked the country in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, Interior Minister Rosa Russo
Jervolino and local authorities held an anti-crime meeting in
Milan Tuesday, following a rash of unrelated homicides and other
crimes there, including nine murders in the first nine days of
1999. Those crimes have shocked the country with the media and
political spotlight on what is perceived as a law-and-order
emergency.
</P>
<P>
The immediate measures announced by D'Alema at the meeting
involved more police, greater powers and more up-to-date
equipment. He also introduced a single emergency number for all
the police operation rooms in order to resume control at a local
level where small-scale crime tends to go relatively unchecked.
</P>
<P>
To achieve closer integration in the battle against crime, the
prime minister said mayors of local governments would join the
local security and public order committees chaired by the
prefects, the government's administrative and judicial
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, an elected official, has no right to become
involved in security and public order affairs under the Italian
Constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chronic illnesses such as
heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases and cancer are now
responsible for more than 75 percent of deaths in Shanghai,
China's most populous city, and the increasingly unhealthy
life-style of its residents is the main culprit.
</P>
<P>
Smoking, alcohol abuse and an excessive intake of salt are
ranked as the habits most damaging to health while infectious
diseases, once the biggest killers in this east China
municipality, are better controlled, thanks to modern medicines.
</P>
<P>
According to health statistics, only 341 people out of every
100,000 people are currently affected by such diseases, the
lowest level in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
Health experts have now warned residents in Shanghai to keep a
check on other high risk habits such as eating fat-rich food and
shunning physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
Now, in a bid to improve public awareness of health,
authorities in the municipality's education and health
departments are to promote a "health education week" which begins
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, say officials, is to offer health education to
citizens thus giving them the chance of enjoying healthy
lifestyles in the new century.

candidates in an effort to trim the continent's bids,
secretary-general Mustapha Fahmy said.

But he admitted that CAF cannot impose the decision that there
should be one African bid since only national associations, not
confederations, have the right to apply.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy would not disclose whether CAF favoured one country but
South Africa, which is understood to be backed by FIFA president

<HEADLINE> Nearly 40,000 Hectares of Plantations Looted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 39,800 hectares of
plantations in Indonesia were looted in 1998, causing an estimated
material loss of 196 billion rupiah (26 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Most of the looted plantations are oil palm and rubber
plantations, the majority located in North Sumatera and East
Java," Director General of the Ministry of Forestry and
Plantations Agus Pakpahan said.
</P>
<P>
Looters hit hundreds of thousands of metric tons of oil palm
fruit, latex, cocoa beans and other items as well as destroying
plantation facilities such as vehicles, processing plants and even
employees' houses, Agus was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plantation security personnel were usually outnumbered by
the looters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Agus added that a big plantation company in North Sumatera had
to deal with an average of between 30 and 50 cases of looting per
month in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The government will solve these problems and will continue to
improve the security of plantation firms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is facing the worst economic crisis in its history.
The number of the poor has soared, and cases of rampant theft and
looting have also increased greatly in certain pockets of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The looters, mostly people from villages neighboring the
affected plantations, plundered the plantations because they
consider that the firms have contributed nothing to the
improvement of local welfare, Agus said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Announces New Banking Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia has announced
several new banking laws, designed to limit foreign exchange and
lending risks, and to improve transparency, the Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia director Subarjo Joyosumarto said the central
bank had lowered banks' maximum net open foreign exchange to 20
percent of capital, from the previous 25 percent, to reduce the
risks of exposure on foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The changes in the net open position condition are intended to
encourage banks to be more careful when taking foreign exchange
position as an anticipation on possible future losses due to
exchange rate fluctuation," Subarjo told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The net open position is the difference between a bank's long-
and short-term foreign exchange position.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said that the new ruling was signed by Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin on December 31, 1998 and was effective
since the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Banks breaching the new ruling would face stiffer sanctions
according to the new 1998 Banking Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had also introduced a ruling on the legal
lending limit of banks.
</P>
<P>
The lending limit to a non-affiliated single party had been
relaxed to 30 percent of capital, from the former maximum of 20
percent, for the period until December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The lending limit would be tightened to 25 percent from January
1, 2002 until December 31, 2002, Subarjo said, adding that the
limit would be returned to the 20-percent level beginning 2003.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said certain lending activities, however, were allowed
to surpass the 30-percent limitation.
</P>
<P>
This included extending heavily-subsidized government loans in
which the bank is the executor, and lending to open letters of
credit.
</P>
<P>
He added that funds for buying Bank Indonesia promissory notes
and government-guaranteed bonds were excluded from any of the new
lending limits.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo dismissed worries that the new 30-percent lending limit
requirement could be abused by bank owners to recapitalize their
ailing banks, saying the central bank's supervision system had
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
According to the new 1998 Bank Law, banks are now obliged to
issue financial reports every quarter, compared with twice a year
under the previous laws. The new reporting schedule, which will
start in June, must include records of lending and capital status.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said that under this new law, banking secrecy only
covers the liability side, not the asset side.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Risks Trial if He Remains in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan risks being tried in Italy if he remains in the country,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Ocalan remains in Italy, he risks being put on trial
here," D'Alema told the Senate, adding that if Ocalan decides to
go, he can do so because he is a free man.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, if he were to leave the country, he would get us
out of some difficulties," the premier said, pointing out that
the government has always sought to have Ocalan tried for the
crimes he is accused of, even though they were not committed in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish extradition request accused Ocalan of a long list
of terrorism and terrorism-related crimes. His extradition is
ruled out by Italian law, which excludes it to countries where
the death sentence is in force.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that, while arguing that he should be tried, the
Italian government has never seen the case as a "simple judicial
fact" and the accusations are to be considered within the context
of the Kurdish people's rights.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said both the possibility of granting political asylum
and simple expulsion were ruled out. He explained that the
expulsion would be impracticable and the political asylum would
have violated the Geneva Convention, which does not envisage
political asylum for those accused of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on November 12 last year, and the
Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel restrictions on
him. On December 23, D'Alema announced that he could leave Italy,
ignoring the extradition request by the Turkish government.

<HEADLINE> "Fledgling Eagles" Drive Helps Young Grow Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A drive to prepare Chinese
young people for the demands of the 21st century is progressing
well, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Sun Shoushan,
vice-director of the National Work Committee on Young Pioneers as
saying that the Trans-Century Fledgling Eagles drive, which began
in 1994, was designed to help provide skills to youngsters that
will allow them to survive and develop in a competitive world.
</P>
<P>
The drive's mission is to help participants develop a "healthy
and active mentality."
</P>
<P>
Sun said a healthy and active mentality includes a strong
consciousness of patriotism, self-discipline, self-reliance,
team-work and creativity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese youngsters are encouraged to learn and think on their
own while nurturing a competitive attitude that aspires to
confidence, perseverance and self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
Learning to co-operate with others is crucial for youngsters'
growth. Sun said that young people should welcome a sense of
responsibility towards society and help others.
</P>
<P>
The drive seeks to inspire the nation's youth to care about
science and to be more skeptical in their studies. Creativity of
youngsters is highly sought.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trying to overcome mental obstacles to academic
excellence, the drive's organizers want to improve young people's
primary survival and development skills.
</P>
<P>
These skills involve taking care of themselves and improving
basic work skills and service skills. The program stresses the
use of creativity in applying science to practice, the paper
says.

<HEADLINE> Probe Finds Violation of Law by Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of Indonesia's
attorney-general's office Soehandoyo Tuesday announced temporary
results of the probe of former president Soeharto, which indicated
violations of the law by Soeharto during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
An attorney-general team comprising 13 senior prosecutors has
indicated that criminal elements as well as corruption had taken
place in the Timor national car project, as well as in charitable
foundations chaired by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soehandoyo, however, refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot reveal any further details because we still need to
delve deeply to confirm their accuracy," the Indonesian Observer
Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general team Tuesday conducted an evaluation of
the ongoing investigation into corruption and power abuse
allegations against Soeharto, who was forced to step down on May
21 last year amid the country's worst economic and political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the Timor national car project, the government granted
tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son
Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans
from South Korean car maker Kia Motor. The project had caused the
country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, Soeharto chaired nine charities, which have
been accused of receiving government privileges and facilities as
well as being one of Soeharto's main business vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine
charitable foundations to the government.
</P>
<P>
"For more accuracy, the team will have to summon the other
parties related to these issues. We still need more information
from witnesses in order to probe the two cases clearly,"
Soehandoyo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the attorney-general's office will soon question other
treasurers of the charities, who include Soeharto's daughter Siti
'Tutut' Hardiyanti Rukmana and former minister Bustanil Arifin.

<HEADLINE> On-Line Rail Ticketing System Hits The Buffers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- People who use the Internet to
book rail tickets on-line merely to test the system and never
pick them up have been criticized for their behavior in a signed
article in Beijing Daily, which says they are causing problems
for railway staff.
</P>
<P>
Since the Beijing railway bureau started its on-line ticketing
service on New Year's day, approximately 350 tickets were booked
up to January 5 but only 70 tickets were collected and used,
bureau officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official said that two staff have been deployed to
handle the administration work but because many people didn't
follow the system through, they are experiencing problems in
keeping it efficient and the records accurate.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that there are two main reasons for this
behavior: curious Internet browsers who simply want to try out
the system and potential passengers who are keen to check out if
it really works but have no intention of traveling.
</P>
<P>
The railway bureau admitted that it knew the ID card numbers
of the offenders and maybe even their E-mail addresses but didn't
want to take official action at this stage in the hope that this
warning will persuade them to stop abusing the service and behave
responsibly.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Slovakia Up to 15.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's unemployment rose to
15.4 percent in 1998, an increase of 2.44 percent on the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released on Tuesday, a total of
383,000 people registered as the jobless by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in 1998 was the highest since the republic's
independence in 1993, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
They also show that the unemployment rate was higher than that
of other Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the increase to unreasonable economic
structure and poor management and called for reforms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Offer Ukraine 195 Million Dollars in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Congress has
decided to grant Ukraine 195 million U.S. dollars in aid in 1999
to support the former Soviet republic's ongoing economic reforms,
U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Stephen Pifer said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But half of the amount will be made available only after
February 18, when U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
delivers a positive report to the congress on Ukraine's reform
process and U.S. investment in the country, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine must push forward large-scale economic reforms and
effectively implement new trade and tax laws so as to qualify for
the aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, a U.S. government delegation, headed by
Albright's special aide in charge of U.S. aid to newly
independent states, was visiting Ukraine to prepare the report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. also demanded that half of its 225 million
dollars in aid to Ukraine be linked to Ukraine's reform
achievements.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior UEFA officials rejected
FIFA president Sepp Blatter's plan to hold the World Cup every
two years here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting of the five-member
presidential board, UEFA said it was rejecting Blatter's proposal
on sporting, medical and commercial grounds.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Presidential Board not only objected to the
idea but also condemned the way the project was presented,
without prior consultation with any of the relevant bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Board believes that the project would produce negative
consequences in sporting, medical and commercial contexts and
have a damaging effect on domestic competitions, it said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Board, composed of UEFA president Lennart Johansson and
four UEFA vice-presidents, also questioned Blatter's motives by
saying "the project could be a matter of personal prestige".
</P>
<P>
Blatter first made public his wish to introduce a biennial
World Cup in an interview with a Swiss newspaper at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Johansson has already voiced publicly his personal negative
opinions about the plan.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Officials Deny Games to Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Salt Lake City Olympic
organizers scrambled Monday to dismiss reports that the 2002
Winter Games might be moved.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Games will be in Salt Lake City in 2002," said
Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's
board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, senior International Olympic Committee
member Marc Hodler said the Games could be moved if the bribery
scandal erodes Salt Lake City's ability to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
Michale Payne, marketing chief for the IOC, said Hodler's
statement were not the official position of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Payne said he could only see "war, earthquake, civil
disturance or an act of God" moving the Games.
</P>
<P>
John Krismsky, head of the joint marketing venture between
Salt Lake and the U.S. Olympic Committee, said Hodler is "simply
wrong."
</P>
<P>
Krismsky hopes to find the $250 million left from the $859
million goal by August 2000.
</P>
<P>
Governor Michael Leavitt, who has taken a lead role in the
Salt
Lake City cleanup, said: "I vigorously disagree with Hodler's
analysis."

</P>
<P>
The move will pave the way for the 320m project to build a new
stadium, which would form the centrepiece of the bid to host the
2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders' approval is expected within the next month to
seal the deal, which sees ownership of the stadium and adjoining
land passing to the English National Stadium Development Company
(ENSDC), a subsidiary of the FA.
</P>
<P>
ENSDC chief executive Bob Stubbs dismissed reports that delays
had been threatening to scupper the deal - but he did admit that
negotiations had been "complicated".
</P>
<P>
Other interested parties had attempted to scupper the deal.
Only last week leisure company ENIC made a last-ditch bid to
capitalise on a reported split among the Wembley plc board over
the proposals.
</P>
<P>
But the ENSDC cemented the deal and Stubbs declared: "I'm
absolutely delighted.
</P>
<P>
"A new National Stadium is crucial to the 2006 World Cup bid
and as the FA will now own the stadium, all profits will be
ploughed back into the game's grass-roots."
</P>
<P>
But there are still potential problems that must be resolved
and the new National Stadium is not likely to be opened before
the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding work cannot begin until consent has been obtained
from Brent council and English Heritage, and the debate over the
future of the evocative Twin Towers, which are expected to have
to be knocked down, still rages.
</P>
<P>
The FA's acting executive director David Davies said: "This is
clearly a huge boost to the 2006 campaign and it is a major
milestone in the development of a stadium for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do now is to press on with increased vigour
to make sure that the stadium is ready for the 2003 World
Athletics Championships and then, we all hope and pray, for the
major event in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"We congratulate Ken Bates and the FA staff who have worked
long hours on this deal, as well as all those at the English
National Stadium Development Company," he added.

PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 World Cup made a

A satisfied Platini said one part of the profits should go to

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Move to Have NBA-wide Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan plans to
hang up his Nikes Wedneaday, a decision that would signal the end
of the Chicago Bulls' dynasty and the start of a new NBA era.
</P>
<P>
According to people with knowledge of his long-awaited decisi
on,
the transcendent star plans to make his announcement at a news
conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
That would bring the curtain down on an unparalleled 14-year
career of rings, recordss and worldwide recognition, and sent in
motion the rebuilding of the six-time champions and retooling of
the NBA's very image.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's departure would pave the way for Tim Floyd to
officially succeed Phil Jackson as coach and be the final straw
in the dismantling of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Without Jordan, the Bulls aren't expected to re-sign free
agents Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the core of the team
that beat Utah in the 1998 Finals.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's retirement would stamp the Reggie Miller-led Indiana
Pacers as the new leader on the Eastern Conference block. Under
first-year coach Larry Bird, the Pacers lost to the Bulls in a
seven-game conference final last spring.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Air Apparent would not be as obvious at a time when
the NBA is looking to win back fans after s six-month labor
dispute. Asked about filling Jordan's shoes last week, Stern
said: "One of these days, Michael Jordan is going to retire. It
is sad, but inevitable. The rest of the best players in the world
are itching to get the opportunity to get onto that stage."

<HEADLINE> Oversupply of College Graduates in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- With the reduction of
government departments and the cutting down on staff in
institutions and enterprises, college graduates will find it hard
to find a job in Beijing this year, according to the Beijing
Educational Commission.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today show that more than 60,000 college
students and post-graduates will graduate from 65 colleges and
universities and 110 research institutions in Beijing this year,
the largest number in history.
</P>
<P>
Graduates majoring in basic theories, foreign trade, geology,
philosophy, history and management are apparently in oversupply.
</P>
<P>
But students majoring in computer, telecommunications,
electronics, finance, teaching, English and clinical medicine are
still in great demand, so are students from elite universities
such as Qinghua University.

<HEADLINE> Keane: I Want 40,000 Pounds a Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United skipper Roy
Keane will walk out of Old Trafford next year unless the club
meet his massive wage demands.
</P>
<P>
The Irish international is believed to have asked for 40,000
pounds a week to sign a new deal with the Champions' League
quarter-finalists - a sum which would blow the club's tight wage
structure apart.
</P>
<P>
United boss Alex Ferguson has constantly claimed Keane is his
number one player and will be desperate to keep the 27-year-old
on board.
</P>
<P>
However, with the BSkyB takeover still pending and the City
keeping a close eye on their financial dealings, chief executive
Martin Edwards may struggle to find the funds which will keep
Keane happy.
</P>
<P>
And, while he insists that in a perfect world he would stay at
Old Trafford, Keane is prepared to face the consequences that his
cash demands could bring.
</P>
<P>
Keane told The Sun newspaper: "This is not blackmailing
anybody. I am not making threats.
</P>
<P>
"If it's not the contract I want, I won't sign. Hopefully, we
can agree things when we sit down. But if we don't it could be
very interesting.
</P>
<P>
"It's just the way football is going and also the position I
am in.
</P>
<P>
"But if I don't sign, I know there will be other options."

<HEADLINE> Moderate Growth of AIDS in Moldova in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 415 AIDS infected
and four AIDS diseases were reported in the Republic of Moldova in
1998, Chief of the National AIDS Center Stefan Gheorghita was
quoted Tuesday by the Moldovan Interlik news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
A moderate growth of this disease is observed, compared with
1997, when 407 AIDS cases were reported, Gheorghita said, adding
that as in the previous year, the infection continued
disseminating among able-bodied young people under the age of 39.
</P>
<P>
Gheorghita said that 84 percent of the total number of the
infected make up addicts, taking narcotic drugs by means of
intravenous injections and using the same needles and syringes for
groups of people.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 drug addicts have been officially registered in
the medical institutions of the country and in the police,
according to the latest statistics. But local experts estimated
that the real number is between 40,000 and 120,000 people, who day
by day become victims of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
There are 20.45 infected per 100,000 people in Moldova, with
the main AIDS infection center in Belti municipality where there
are 252.23 infected per 100,000. In the capital of the republic it
constitutes 41.30, in rural areas it wavers between 15.58 in
Falesti and 0.74 in Orhei.
</P>
<P>
The course of the implementation of the National Program for
Preventing and Combating AIDS for the period up to 2000 was
examined last year at a government sitting of the
Interinstitutional Commission for AIDS Prevention and at
collegiums of the Ministry for Health Protection, where measures
were outlined for improving the epidemic situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Gheorghita, this year the experts are planning to
improve the mechanism of epidemic supervision over the AIDS
infection, to implement a number of measures to this effect and to
carry out a whole range of actions for instructing the population
on preventing the infection.

<HEADLINE> Pak Army Helps Eliminate Power Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani army has got
into the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) with the
mission to eliminate power theft and to affect recovery of the
defaulting amount.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in Lahore Tuesday, WAPDA Chairman Zulfiqar
Ali Khan said that the operation will commence from January 15,
the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
Zulfiqar advised the power thieves to end their evil practice
for their own good as well as in the interest of the nation. He
also exhorted the defaulters of WAPDA, particularly chronic ones,
to clear their dues forthwith to save themselves from the evil
consequences.
</P>
<P>
He warned that anyone found indulging in power theft would not
be spared and the defaulters would be dealt with strictly.
</P>
<P>
The WAPDA chief expressed his confidence in revamping WAPDA and
setting the institution in order despite its multifarious
maladies.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the army would continue this operation for
six months and after that most of the force would go back.
</P>
<P>
He placed the rate of power theft in Pakistan at around 30
percent, saying it was much higher than in the other countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a staggering amount of 14 billion rupees
(304 million U.S. dollars) was outstanding against private
consumers besides 28 billion rupees (608 million dollars) due from
the government.
</P>
<P>
The army, he said, has been called upon to avert the impending
disaster, and to make WAPDA a productive organization once again.
The army will be employed at different tiers of the distribution
system for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Nine Automakers Form Alliance in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Nine major global automakers
formed a new trade association in the United States Tuesday to
represent the common interests of their members on policy issues,
according to a news report received here.
</P>
<P>
The companies forming the association, called the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers, include BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford,
General Motors, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based alliance said in a news release that its
members have 255 manufacturing facilities in 33 U.S. states with
642,000 employees and cover some 90 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
It has a special commitment to improving the environment and
motor vehicle safety, said alliance chairman Peter Pestillo, who
is also vice chairman of Ford Motor Company.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the alliance came after the dissolution of the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) on December
31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 98-year-old trade association, whose members were three
major U.S. automakers, closed in the wake of the merger of

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks plunged
Tuesday, dragged down mainly by profit-taking as investors cashed
in the buoyant market.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite suffered its first loss
since the New York stock market opened on Jan. 4 this year,
closing at 2,320.75, down 63.84. The Nasdaq was up 40.18 at a
record high of 2,384.59 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest losers in the Nasdaq composite was
Amazon.com, which fell 17 15/16 at 166 11/12 during the trading
day. Yahoo and Intel also sank ahead of their fourth-quarter
earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 145.21 at 9,474.68,
the second consecutive drop. The Dow lowered 24.43 at 9,619.89
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index also dropped 24.37 at 1,239.51,
while the NYSE composite index was down 9.45 at 594.59.
</P>
<P>
"Shares rose too far too fast in a remarkable week in the
market," said Franklin Morton, research chief at Ariel Capital
Management in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
A week into the year, the Nasdaq was up 7.3 percent, the Dow up
4.1 percent and the S&AMP;P up 2.5 percent. Investors now decided to
take profits from the flying high market.
</P>
<P>
The slump was also driven by the weaker U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen Monday, which reduced to 108.93 yen, a 28-month low.
Investors were concerned with the lower dollar.

<HEADLINE> Apple Browning Delayed By U.S. Agriculture Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from
Agriculture Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, have come
up with a way to keep apples from turning brown for up to five
weeks after they have been sliced or peeled.
</P>
<P>
The new technique which uses natural products and doesn't
require special packaging, could eventually have a major impact
on the marketability of fresh-cut fruit.
</P>
<P>
Most apples, once cut, begin to turn brown in a matter of
minutes. This browning known as enzymatic oxidation, has been a
major impediment to expanding the "shelf life" and marketability
of fresh-cut fruit.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-browning treatment uses a combination of
compounds, either natural products or their derivatives, including
various combinations of enzymatic inhibitors, reducing agents and
anti-microbial compounds containing calcium.
</P>
<P>
The treatment also can slow down microbial decay and changes in
organic acids and sugars during storage.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Be Flexible on EU Majority Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain Tuesday said it would
keep an open mind to suggestions that the European Union should
make more of its decisions by less than a unanimous vote, even
those on tax, in a departure likely to arouse domestic resentment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain had
always appreciated the need for an extension of the so-called
qualified majority voting system and in terms of tax issues, each
proposal would be judged on its merits, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
This appeared to be a softer line than that adopted by the
government late last year when it was faced with a barrage of
European tax scare stories in the press.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman was responding to remarks made earlier
Tuesday by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer who said his
government favored killing off the need for unanimous voting in
most areas of European Union decision making.
</P>
<P>
"We have never said we opposed the extension of qualified
majority voting and in terms of tax issues we would consider each
proposal on its merits," the spokesman was quoted by Reuters as
saying. "If something is proposed (the cabinet) would clearly need
to discuss it and look at the advantages and we would need strong
convincing."

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Meets Saudi, S. African Envoys on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi
Tuesday met Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar Ibn Sultan and an envoy
of South African President Nelson Mandela on the long-running
Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince, who is the kingdom's ambassador to
Washington, and Jakes Gerwel, who is director-general of Mandela's
office, were trying to persuade Gaddafi to surrender the two
Libyans suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Libyan capital Tripoli,
the two envoys handed over messages from Saudi King Fahd and
Mandela on "the efforts exerted by the two countries to find a
solution to the so-called Lockerbie issue."
</P>
<P>
The contents of the letters were not disclosed, but the Libyan
News Agency said a six-point new proposal on solving the Lockerbie
issue was made by King Fahd and Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused by the U.S. and Britain of
planting a bomb aboard the passenger plane that exploded in the
air, killing 270 people in the plane and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has good relations with the Libyan leader, talked
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair during his visit to South
Africa on January 6 on the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi envoy has reportedly close connection with
Washington. The two envoys arrived at Tripoli international
airport on a Saudi jet, which was granted a special permission to
fly into Libya by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. slapped an air-travel ban on Libya after Gaddafi
refused to surrender the two suspects on the ground that they
would never get a fair trial in either the U.S. or Britain.
</P>
<P>
A compromise was made when the U.S. and Britain decided the
suspects could be sent to the Netherlands for trial before a panel
of Scottish judges according to Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed in principle to turn over the suspects, but
said arrangments should be made beforehand for their security and
if convicted, they should serve their prison terms in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has decided that the sanctions will
be suspended once the two suspects are surrendered.

<HEADLINE> Investors to Return to Biotech Stocks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Investors are expected to
renew their interest in biotechnology stocks in 1999, a survey in
the United States has found.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Genetic Engineering News (GEN), which
conducted the survey, said on Tuesday that hot biotech stock picks
for 1999 include veteran companies and those focusing on cell
growth, cell multiplication and tissue engineering.
</P>
<P>
The GEN said in its January 15 issue that investors shieded
away from biotech stocks in 1998 due to disappointing results in
several clinical trials and instability in the global markets.
</P>
<P>
They are now seeking companies with a revenue stream, strong
potential earnings and near-term product launches.
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology is seen by investors as a profit-making business
sector instead of a R&AMP;D enterprise as they saw it before, an
analysis pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stock market had double-digit gains for the fourth
consecutive year in major indexes in 1998, led by information and
communication technology stocks with biotechnology shares left
behind.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Attacks on High-Rate Burglaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Secretary Jack
Straw unveiled burglary attack strategy on Tuesday, saying burglars
would face a minimum of three years in jail if caught over three
times.
</P>
<P>
His aim was to reduce the number of burglaries in England and
Wales, currently running at just over a million a year -- the
highest rate in the Western world.
</P>
<P>
The measure will take effect by the end of the year and mean
burglars will be sent to prison for at least three years after their
third conviction.
</P>
<P>
Straw insisted the law had now been modified to act in a "just
way" to permit particular personal circumstances to be taken into
consideration by courts.
</P>
<P>
However, both the opposition and civil rights leaders attacked
Straw's adoption of a "three strikes and you're out" strategy for
burglars.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dispute Settlement Body
(DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Tuesday agreed to set
up a panel to arbitrate within 90 days if the new banana import
policy of the European Union (EU) is in conformity with a previous
WTO ruling.
</P>
<P>
Following the WTO ruling in September 1997 that the EU's old
banana regime violated trade rules, the EU modified the policy and
implemented it on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, together with Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and
the United States, complained that the modified EU policy was
still against the WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Both the EU and Ecuador requested setting up of a panel to
settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the DSB chairman Monday, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama and the United States tried to block the EU's request,
arguing that the EU's request is causing confusion and it has no
legal basis for its complaint.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the three-man panel established Tuesday is
supposed to deal with issues raised by both the EU and Ecuador:
two topics under one panel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the DSB special meeting Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador
Rita Hayes called on the EU to "negotiate a substantive resolution
of this dispute" but she did not rule out use of sanctions against
the EU.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, of course, retains all of its WTO rights
and may exercise those rights whenever it wishes," she said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Continue To Be Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets slid
Tuesday as Wall Street is declining and U.S. dollar faltering.
</P>
<P>
London shares fell back in late trading after a strong ride,
hit by a weaker opening in New York and further profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed down 51.4 points at 6033.6 on volume
of one billion shares.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters poll of 13 UK stock strategists concluded that
British stocks have room to rise further thanks to expectations of
lower interest rates, but all bets are off if Wall Street slumps.
</P>
<P>
After losing early gains, German stocks slide further on the
back of a weak Wall Street opening amid a lack of fresh corporate
news with the leading Dax index closed down 70 points at 5200.1.
</P>
<P>
Traders forecast that the market will remain in consolidating
mode for the rest of the week, with the key index hovering around
5200 and 5300 points.
</P>
<P>
The French stock market pulled back in late trade as the Dow's
losses provided an extra excuse to book profits.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index finished down 101 points at 4100.3.
One trade said: "It's nothing to worry about, just a little
consolidation after yesterday's rise."

<HEADLINE> France to Present Proposal on New Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- France will present on Tuesday to
four other permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council a proposal on establishing a new disarmament control
system in Iraq to replace the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials said that French ambassador
to the U.N. Alain Dejammet will display for the first time the
French "ideas" on the new control methods in Iraq to his
counterparts from the United States, Britain, China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador presented the proposal to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan Tuesday morning, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Tuesday in
Moscow, where he was making a visit, that France would submit to
other members of the Security Council some ideas on how to go out
of the present situation and change the U.N. monitoring method in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed establishing a new regime of disarmament
control in Iraq while lifting the oil embargo on Iraq imposed by
the U.N. eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright said on
Tuesday it is not time to talk about lifting embargo because Iraq
must completely disarm itself first.
</P>
<P>
She said that Washington is only interested in studying
suggestions on improving the efficiency of the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Ties With Developing </HEADLINE>

<P>
He said that China is willing to make joint efforts with other
developing countries including most of the African states to
establish a new, fair and reasonable world economic and political
order.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival at Lusaka International Airport, the Chinese
foreign minister told reporters that no matter what happens, China
will forever follow this principle "steadily and firmly".
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, Tang further noted, China will
consolidate its cooperation with other developing countries to
defend the just and reasonable rights and interests of all
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the support given to China by many
African countries including Zambia which always pursues one-China
policy.
</P>
<P>
Tang hoped that during his three-day stay in Zambia, he will
exchange views with his Zambia's counterpart, Keli Walubita, on
all the matters of interest to both countries.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the peace talks on the five-month Congo
(Kinshasa) conflicts to be held in Lusaka at this weekend, Tang is
optimistic about its success and hoped Zambia which is busy
mediating between the warring parties can play a very important
role during the talks.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Walubita reiterated Zambia's one-China
policy, adding "Zambia, without any controversy and without any
doubt, firmly stands for one-China policy."
</P>
<P>
"This is a policy that will guide our direct understanding in
the said area yesterday, today and forever," said the Zambia
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He also reviewed the long history of the friendly relations
between China and Zambia, saying the two countries willl continue
to be all- weather friends.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister who led a high-profile delegation
began his five-nation African tour early this month and Zambia is
his last stop.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Says Misconducted Hospital "Shameful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank
Dobson said on Tuesday an official probe into a top-security
mental hospital painted a "shameful picture."
</P>
<P>
The report, conducted by Peter Fallon on the Personality
Disorder Unit (PDU) at the Ashworth high security mental hospital
in Maghull, Merseyside, uncovered a catalogue of drug abuse,
pornography, poor patient care and security lapses.
</P>
<P>
"Too many people at Ashworth failed to do properly the jobs
they were paid to do," Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the National Health Service (NHS) to take action
against staff found to be culpable in the report.
</P>
<P>
There are three such hospitals in Britain -- Broadmoor in
Berkshire, Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Ashworth, and they are
home to some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
</P>
<P>
Dobson said: "For the foreseeable future, the three special
hospitals must continue to be the main providers of high security
services. There is no practical alternative in the short term."
</P>
<P>
Fallon, the investigator, said the situation had not been the
fault of staff. "The problem here was the system," he said. "The
system itself was rotten - it needed changing. The nurses, on the
whole, were doing an extremely good job."
</P>
<P>
He added that he found pornography was "widely available on the
ward; patients were running their own businesses; hospitals were
ignored and security was farcical."
</P>
<P>
The inquiry said the personality disorder unit was "a deeply
flawed creation."
</P>
<P>
"A number of highly serious reports have demonstrated Ashworth
Hospital's failure to care for and manage a large group of
severely personality disordered patients," Fallon said in the
report.

<HEADLINE> IMF Resumes Aid to Moldova After 18-Month Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Moldova will
soon receive a 35-million-dollar tranche of the Extended Facility
Fund from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after a suspension
of one year and a half.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors of the IMF decided last week to resume
its financial assistance to Moldova, the Romanian Rompres news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mark Horton, IMF resident representative in Chisinau, was
quoted by the Moldovan BASA-Press news agency as saying that
Moldova practically met all the conditions it had agreed with the
fund to gain further financing, the major achievement being the
adoption of the 1999 budget and new administrative-territorial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The credit is granted to the National Bank of Moldova to
complete the country's reserves of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Horton, the IMF was planning to change the
reimbursement conditions for the next tranches. In particular, to
raise the repayment period from 5-7 years to 10 years and the
grace period from 2-3 to 5 years. The fund also intended to slip
the annual interest rate from 5.5 down to 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moldova has "good chances" to enjoy agreements of this kind, as
such facilities are granted only to poor nations and those lacking
foreign financing, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of IMF financial assistance has cleared the way
for the World Bank to disburse the second tranche of its SAL-II
loan, and the 35-million-dollar loan will be used to fill in the
budgetary deficit to honor exterior obligations and pay off
salary and pensions arrears.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank suspended their financial assistance
to Moldova in 1997 due to the "worsening political and economic
situation" of the former Soviet republic.

<HEADLINE> Diana Fund Donates 1 Million Pounds to Landmine Charities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Diana, Princess of Wales,
Memorial Fund Tuesday donated over 1 million pounds (1.6 million
U.S. dollars) of grants to 13 charities working with the victims
of landmines.
</P>
<P>
The 13 charities cover landmine projects in Africa, South
America, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Many deal with the
rehabilitation of victims who have lost limbs.
</P>
<P>
The fund's trustees defended their decision to give cash solely
to victims of landmines and none to landmine clearance.
</P>
<P>
"Like Princess Diana we are strongly in favor of landmine
clearance, but we have to keep asking ourselves how best we can
make a difference with our money," said Christopher Spence, a
trustee of the fund which was set up after Diana's death in a car
crash in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spence said he would not rule out that grants would be awarded
to projects for mine clearance in the future, but they had to bear
in mind that governments had pumped millions of pounds into mine
clearance.
</P>
<P>
In the final months of her life, the princess threw herself
into campaigning for victims of landmines and pushing for a
worldwide ban. Television pictures of her visiting victims around
the world brought the issue firmly to public attention.
