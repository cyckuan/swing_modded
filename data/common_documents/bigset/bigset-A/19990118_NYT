   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MINNEAPOLIS _ If it had been John Elway, you'd accept it. If it
were Joe Montana, you'd expect it.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Chris Chandler making all of the right reads,
making all of the right plays, and suddenly it was the Falcons who
were soaring.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-yard sideline pass to Terance Mathis, then a 29-yard
strike to Ronnie Harris, and there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   A crack in a collapsing pocket, and there was Chandler lumbering
up the middle for a nine-yard gain, looking about as nimble as an
escaped convict in leg irons. He stubbed his toe on the artificial
turf, tripped and eventually fell to the carpet, hitting his shin
and picking up a noticeable limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice,'' Chandler would say later. ``That must have looked real
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, gorgeous and fetching were just a few of the
adjectives that came to mind three plays later when Chandler
drilled a death-ray laser into the teeth of the Vikings' defense
for the tying touchdown, then Atlanta went nearly 12 minutes into
overtime before Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal lifted the
Falcons into the Super Bowl 30-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it! They don't believe it! They don't
believe it!'' yelled Atlanta free safety Eugene Robinson, referring
to the crowd of 64,040 stuffed inside the echo chamber they call
the Thunderdome as he raced off the field.
</P>
<P>
   What was there to believe?
</P>
<P>
   That the most prolific offense in the history of the NFL could
be held to just one lonely touchdown for the final 44 minutes of
the game?
</P>
<P>
   That the fearsome combination of Randall Cunningham to Randy
Moss would look like a couple of guys who had their phone lines
disconnected after the first quarter?
</P>
<P>
   That the Vikings' Gary Anderson, who had succeeded on a record
42 consecutive field goals, would be wide left by about a foot on
what would have been the game-clincher?
</P>
<P>
   That five weeks after lying on an operating table undergoing
cardiac bypass surgery, coach Dan Reeves would have the ol' ticker
still beating inside the chest of this unlikely Atlanta team?
</P>
<P>
   Or is the most unlikely chapter in the story the fact that
Chandler wrote the dramatic finish to as gripping, yo-yoing,
unpredictable and wonderfully entertaining a playoff game as has
been served up maybe since San Diego vs. Miami back in 1982?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler took them 71 yards on eight plays in 1:18, the Falcons
are Miami-bound, and now there is a little more elbow room for Bud
Adams in that closet where the NFL keeps the owners of the forlorn
franchises that have never been to even one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chris that it was as good as anything by Elway or any
of them,'' said Reeves. And he should know. Reeves was coaching the
Broncos in 1987 when a young Elway led the 98-yard drive at
Cleveland _ the last conference championship game to go to overtime
_ that firmed up his reputation as a clutch performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing that drive by Elway on TV,'' Chandler said.
``It did really amaze me. Mine just wasn't as big a finish. I
didn't throw for the winning touchdown like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Chandler was exactly like Elway. ``The Drive'' tied
the score in regulation, and the Broncos won on a field goal in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Just call this the land of contrasts, where a professional
wrestler can be elected to the highest office in the state and then
the honorable Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura can celebrate at his
inauguration party by singing a duet with rocker Warren Zevon:
Werewolves of Minnesota. Anything, it seems, can happen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons are indeed the Dirty Birds, then Chandler is the
grungiest of them all, a homing pigeon who got lost and wound up in
Atlanta's nest. An erstwhile Colt, Buccaneer, Cardinal, Ram and
Oiler and now working on his sixth team in an 11-year NFL career,
you figured that Chandler has as much historic precedent to be
leading the charge as Barney the Dinosaur has presiding over the
presidential impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as redemption or vindication,'' Chandler
said. ``I just see it as proof that after getting knocked around a
lot early in my career, this is the proof that I can be a pretty
good quarterback. The satisfaction comes from knowing that all
those teams in my past are still struggling to find their way and
now I've made it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I got tired of looking at the papers where they were
saying that all they had to do to win the game was stop the run. I
took that personally.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NFC's leading rusher, Jamal Anderson, limited to 67
yards on 23 carries by the Minnesota defense, Chandler went to work
constructing the pyre for a Viking funeral, hitting 27 of 43 passes
for 340 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It was as shocking a big-game performance as you'll see,
particularly to the strutting Vikings and their haughty fans who
seemed to truly believe that stuff about the Falcons being 11-point
underdogs. There wasn't a purple-clad person in the building Sunday
who thought Atlanta had the slightest chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham hit Moss for a 31-yard touchdown on their first
possession, and the Vikes cranked out 20 points the first four
times they touched the ball. Then, the machine was shut down.
Atlanta used a soft zone to bottle up Moss, who caught five passes
for just 44 yards the rest of the way, and Cunningham began to look
like his former incarnation in Philadelphia as the game got late.
</P>
<P>
   The daring, swashbuckling Vikings became conservative, not
stretching the defense, and even after the Chandler-to-Mathis TD
tied the score, Vikings coach Dennis Green chose to take a knee,
running out the last 30 seconds of regulation and gambling on
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling on our sidelines when Anderson missed that field
goal was like we had already won the game,'' Chandler said. ``All
day long they weren't able to put us away, and all we wanted was a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they got. Which they made count. Thanks to Chris Chandler,
of all people.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To all appearances, the loan agreement Gloria Knight
signed in 1995 was a classic transaction between savvy mortgage
salesmen and an unsophisticated borrower in a poor Brooklyn
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight, a 55-year-old retired teacher, said she was
persuaded by the salesmen who knocked on her door to put her house
up as collateral for an $88,000 loan at 13 percent interest, even
though she had no income and no way to make the $973 monthly
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But when she defaulted on her loan, leading to eviction notices
last year, she ended up in the grip of something far larger than
Delta Funding, a relatively obscure Long Island mortgage company
that solicits business among poor homeowners. Delta's partner in
trying to take her home is Bankers Trust Co., America's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest lending in poor neighborhoods has long produced
high profits for lenders and, often, equally high burdens for
homeowners. But the entry of big banks like Bankers Trust has
changed the equation. Over the last several years, Delta has
converted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of its mortgages
into securities much like bonds, which it sells to investors
through Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Bankers Trust has provided Delta with hundreds of
millions of investors' dollars, allowing it to make more loans and
become a major player in high-interest lending in New York and 21
other states.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem: a high percentage of the homeowners
cannot afford the mortgages they are getting through Delta. Many
say they were deceived into getting the loans and now risk losing
their homes, as Delta and Bankers Trust seek to reclaim the money
for their investors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight, who has since been found to be delusional by a
psychiatrist for the city's Protective Services for Adults, cannot
even afford electricity. She keeps warm with a kerosene heater and
cooks over a makeshift grill in her backyard. But despite being
poor, she had something that made her attractive to lenders like
Delta: her rowhouse in East New York, which was fully paid for and
which served as security. Legal Services lawyers say she will now
almost certainly lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's business has recently produced civil lawsuits in three
states and has drawn the attention of low-income housing advocates
and social-services agencies, who say the company has generated
more complaints of abusive lending than any other high-interest
lender in New York City. They contend that Delta has taken
advantage of scores of homeowners and violated federal and state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chief Judge Charles P. Sifton of the federal Court
for the Eastern District of New York stopped the foreclosure sales
of homes of three people who defaulted on Delta loans, because, he
wrote, the mortgages ``on their face'' violated federal law, and so
the borrowers showed a good chance of winning their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners have sued Delta and Bankers Trust, claiming they
violated, among other laws, a federal prohibition on making loans
based solely on equity in a house and not on a homeowner's ability
to repay. The suit seeks to represent tens of thousands of other
Delta borrowers whom lawyers say are in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by the
German banking giant Deutsche Bank, declined repeated requests for
interviews. On Friday, William McBride, a bank spokesman, said:
``Bankers Trust's sole responsibility in these situations is to
safegaurd the interests of investors. We have no other connection
to these actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc E. Miller, Delta's general counsel and a son of its
founder, vigorously denied that the company engages in deceptive
lending, saying it made no sense financially for the company to
make loans it knew would fail. ``There is sometimes this myth
that's spread around that lenders do make money'' from foreclosed
properties, Miller said. ``And it is a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to comment on cases that are in litigation, he
added that ``if a loan simply doesn't make sense for a borrower, we
won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city real estate records show high foreclosure rates on
Delta mortgages in some neighborhoods. In Brooklyn, where the
company is most active in the city, a search of records found that
48 of 363 loans made by Delta in 1995 _ or about 13 percent _ have
ended up in default, and Delta has begun foreclosure actions. For
1996 loans, the records show, the figure is 99 of 923 _ or about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission
last year, Delta reported that 4.65 percent of all its loans were
in foreclosure, calculated by the dollar amount of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Inside B&AMP;C Lending, an industry newsletter that
reports statistics from several large lenders, about 2.65 percent
of the amount of high-risk loans nationwide were in foreclosure as
of September 1998, the most recent date for which information was
available. An additional 1.9 percent were 90 days delinquent and in
danger of foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's critics contend that the company has devastated the
lives of many working-class homeowners, most of them elderly.
``These folks not only lose their homes, but lose every dime of
equity they have built up, and in most cases this is all they have
to show for years of hard work,'' said Josh Zinner, a lawyer with
the Foreclosure Prevention Project for Seniors, a branch of South
Brooklyn Legal Services set up last year to pursue claims of
abusive lending.

</P>
<P>
   Anna Dawson, a 67-year-old Brooklyn widow who is fighting Delta
and Bankers Trust in state court for her home, may get help from
prosecutors. The Brooklyn district attorney's office is
investigating an independent broker who refers business to Delta
and who, she contends, falsified her mortgage application without
her knowledge to make it appear she could afford a $99,000 mortgage
with monthly payments of $1,017
</P>
<P>
   In reality, her only income was roughly $700 a month in
survivor's benefits from her late husband. But her application
included a letter saying she was an office manager at United
Equities in Brooklyn and a lease that made it appear she rented out
a floor of her home. The company does not exist at the address on
the letter, and Ms. Dawson said she has not worked in more than two
decades. She has no renter. In addition, the signature on the lease
does not appear to be hers.
</P>
<P>
   Her loan became part of $340 million worth of 1997 Delta
mortgages put into a trust managed by Bankers Trust and sold to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, her
lawyers contend that the mortgage broker and a home-improvement
contractor came to her house uninvited several times, persistently
pushing her to get a loan for repairs to her house.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she was unable to make her payments, and Delta and
Bankers Trust have begun to foreclose against her. Meanwhile, like
many other Delta borrowers who claim to have been deceived, she
said she was left with almost no proceeds of her loan _ after
paying Delta's fees, settling a previous low-interest loan and
paying the same home-improvement contractor, who she said did
little work.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest lending became a big business in low-income
neighborhoods nationwide after 1986, when a change in the federal
tax code gave a break to homeowners who took out second mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints about abuses began almost immediately.
Unscrupulous finance companies often singled out homeowners, many
of them elderly, who had substantial equity in their homes; in case
of default, lenders could recoup the loan by taking the home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs reported
that finance companies, usually working with crooked home
improvement contractors, had ``fleeced thousands of lower-income
and minority New York City homeowners'' out of equity in their
homes by tricking them into loans for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many finance companies resold their mortgages to big banks. But
Delta _ founded in 1982 in by Sidney A. Miller, a former planner
for insurance companies _ was one of the first to see a vast
untapped resource beyond the banks: the investment market. By
converting loans into securities and selling them to investors,
finance companies could generate a faster profit and have access to
much more capital, and make many more loans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the market in asset-backed securities like
those issued by Delta has grown from $9 billion to more than $140
billion, as investors pursued the rapidly expanding trade in
high-risk auto loans, credit cards and home-equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the high-risk home-loan industry alone reached more
than $120 billion in loans issued nationwide in 1997, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, big lenders like Chase Manhattan, Norwest,
Nationsbank, General Electric, Keycorp, Countrywide Credit
Industries and others have expanded their involvement in
high-interest lending.
</P>
<P>
   Delta began selling loans as securities in 1991, giving
investors the right to share in mortgage interest payments, and
Bankers Trust's California branch soon began to manage the trusts
that held these securities. Delta's business zoomed. In 1994, it
made about $100 million in loans. By last year, according to its
federal securities filings, its loans increased to more than $1
billion. It grew from about 150 employees to more than 1,000. In
1996, it went public, on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1997
it reported profits of more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Brennan, a lawyer for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society
who specializes in lending abuse cases and is familiar with
lawsuits against Delta, criticizes Bankers Trust as Delta's
``enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers Trust would never make these kinds of loans
themselves,'' he said, ``but they put themselves in the position of
enhancing the power of Delta Funding to engage in abusive lending.
And they do it because there's lots of money to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Marc Miller, whose family runs Delta, based
in Woodbury, N.Y., ``there are many people who want and need a loan
and can't get one. From that standpoint we fill a very legitimate
niche in the consumer finance field.''

 By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ Yes, it's true Frans Botha tried to get inside the head
of Mike Tyson. But without the necessary surgical tools, or a saw
and butter knife, the plan was doomed to fail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the mystics in the media poked Sunday through the ashes and
tea leaves of Tyson's fifth-round knockout, this much was obvious:
Few believe he can regain his form of the late 1980s, when he ruled
the heavyweight galaxy. It isn't clear that Iron Mike believes so,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, his punches were wild and more or less in the wrong
time zone. After sitting out half of this decade, at the request of
the law and the NBA _ the No Biting Association _ he looked not
only rusty but corroded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what Tyson did best was regain his composure and not
unravel after a shaky start. Botha admitted freely, even proudly,
that part of his plan was to upset and incite Tyson, who in recent
years has been about as stable as nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   The amiable South African hit him late, and Mike retaliated.
Botha used the punch-and-clinch tactic, constantly tying Tyson up,
and Mike was frustrated. When Botha hit him after the bell for the
first round, Tyson hit back and gave Botha's arm and upper body a
half nelson. For a few scary seconds, 12,519 antsy patrons thought
they might see Mike implode.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and Botha kept talking to each other in a taunting and
profane dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But referee Richard Steele got both fighters under control and
took a point away from Tyson in the second round for ``unnecessary
roughness.'' In football, this would have been a 15-yard penalty,
so Tyson did not complain.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers were waiting to see if Mike was toast or still a
contender. He gave them a fleeting answer with the last punch of
the night, that lightning bolt of a right hand sending Botha
sprawling. Botha said he never saw it coming, and you could not
disbelieve based on his futile attempt to regain his footing. He
was on his back, then on his big buffalo bottom, then pitched face
forward, his nose touching the mat. Finally, he almost fell through
the ropes, and Tyson helped pull him back.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever appeal Tyson has left stems from the suspense of never
knowing what to expect of the one-time Brooklyn delinquent, who
came to the title at 20 with a sense of history and even a touch of
humility. But you study him closely, and it isn't hard to
understand why Tyson identifies with the late Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might sound pretty morbid and grim,'' he said, ``but he
was absolutely a great fighter. He just wanted people to love and
respect him, and it never happened. He may have got a raw deal, but
we all write our own books in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Love and respect have been continuing themes for Tyson, who has
been devoured by the temptations that have undone many a boxer _
bright lights, fast sex, bad company.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone beat the odds, it may have been Liston, who was sullen
and a loner when he reached the heights and didn't let fame change
him. Sonny died in Las Vegas of a heroin overdose, alone at 38. His
wife found his body when she returned from a trip. It is doubtful
he called for help. He never had.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson came out of poverty, uneducated and crude, Liston had
it far worse. He was one of 25 children in a destitute family that
lived and worked on a farm. Liston left home at 13, selling a sack
of pecans for bus fare. He couldn't read. His prime assets were his
muscles, and he used them as a head-buster for unions and the mob.
He quit that work when he learned he could use his fists for an
honest living, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   Wistfully, he once recalled his only defeat in his first 11
years of fighting. He had ridden in a chair car from St. Louis to
Detroit for an eight-rounder. His purse was $75, plus train fare.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny arrived in the afternoon, just hours before the fight. He
left with his money from the promoter and a broken jaw from his
opponent. Without even bothering to get the jaw set, he caught the
night train back to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Liston enjoyed a brief, golden moment after he won the
heavyweight title from Floyd Patterson. He lost it to the young,
brash Cassius Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tyson carries on as boxing's most disturbing figure, trying
to rediscover his raw, primitive power. This was his first fight
under the direction of Tommy Brooks, who was the No. 2 man in
Evander Holyfield's corner on bite night 1{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks chided Tyson for looping his punches and not working on
Botha's ample body. ``He was headhunting,'' the trainer observed.
``I told him he had to throw his punches straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, Tyson received and delivered the message.

 NEW YORK: finance field.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gertrude Menzel, an elderly Queens woman who had lived in her
two-story rowhouse in Ridgewood since she was a teen-ager, took out
an $81,000 Delta mortgage in the summer of 1994, when she was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Bankers Trust and Delta say Ms. Menzel owes
more than $123,000 in principal and interest, and they are trying
to take her house.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that Ms. Menzel signed the loan papers. But
little else is clear, including her motivation, since her first
mortgage was paid off and she appeared to have no debts. Her lawyer
said that she was talked into the loan by an acquaintance who had
previously taken financial advantage of her and ended up taking the
proceeds of her loan for himself.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about whether she was competent when she
closed the mortgage in Delta's offices. Workers at a Queens center
for the elderly, who saw her almost daily, said they noticed memory
lapses and confused behavior well before the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By Thanksgiving, six months after she got the mortgage, she
``was wearing house slippers out into the cold and was not taking
care of herself,'' said Thomas Crossman, who ran the Ridgewood
Older Adult Center at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, according to court papers, two psychiatrists hired by
the center found symptoms of dementia and memory loss. One reported
that she ``does not have any knowledge of her assets or income.''
</P>
<P>
   By May 1995, Ms. Menzel was ruled legally incompetent in State
Supreme Court, and she later defaulted on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But Bankers Trust argued in court papers that her mortgage was
valid because Ms. Menzel had not been ruled incompetent before the
closing. Partly for that reason, a State Supreme Court judge, Edwin
Kassoff, declined to let Ms. Menzel out of the mortgage. Bankers
Trust and Delta continue to fight her in court.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's critics say that the company commonly works with
aggressive, often unscrupulous mortgage brokers and
home-improvement contractors who canvass poor neighborhoods,
looking for elderly homeowners willing to put up their homes as
collateral for loans to help with bills or home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A search of court records and Delta loan documents found that at
least two people who have referred loans to Delta _ John Gizze, the
owner of a mortgage consulting firm in Hempstead, N.Y., and Gary
Feldman, a Queens home improvement contractor _ have pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in federal court in cases
unrelated to Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Both men admitted in court that they had falsified papers to
exaggerate the income of borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Gizze's lawyer, Allen Drezin, said Gizze has subsequently had
``some dealings with Delta Funding,'' but they ``have been up to
the standards of the industry.'' Feldman is now a defendant in a
federal civil suit filed by Mary Lewis, a Queens woman who claims
he and Delta deceived her when she took out a home equity mortgage
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Feldman said he has closed few loans
with Delta, and denied engaging in any deceptive lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials said they were unaware of the criminal pasts of
either man, but they added that they do not routinely perform
criminal background checks on brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with thousands of different brokers,'' said Marc
Miller, the general counsel, ``it would, frankly, be impossible for
us to stay on top of every broker at every instant.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is now the target of at least four federal civil
suits, three of which seek to represent classes of thousands of
homeowners whom lawyers allege were deceived or mistreated by
Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed late last year in federal District Court for the
Eastern District, which included Brooklyn and Queens, accuses Delta
of consistently lending to people based on the equity of their
homes and not on their ability to pay, a practice the plaintiffs'
lawyers say has led to scores of foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also accuses Delta of breaking federal law by charging
exorbitant extra interest once a loan goes into default. (A review
of Delta loan papers for several borrowers found that the interest
commonly jumps to 24 percent after default. In New York, interest
rates over 25 percent are prohibited by criminal usury laws.)
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Bankers Trust, represented by a single law firm in the
case, have not yet responded to the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi and Georgia, two federal civil suits allege that
Delta is one of many high-interest mortgage lenders paying fees to
mortgage brokers. The suits allege that these fees are, in reality,
a kickback to brokers for steering borrowers to the lenders, even
though it may not be in the borrowers' best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials deny the accusations. But in a similar federal
class-action case in New York, Delta recently settled with the
plaintiffs in a confidential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the company's general counsel, said in a written
statement that all such suits contain ``accusations, rather than
fact'' and have been filed ``solely for the purpose of delaying or
preventing Delta Financial from protecting its rights.'' But Delta
has not always been successful in challenging claims of abuse. In
October 1991, Theresa Leonardi's husband of more than 50 years had
just died. In November she went into the hospital with thyroid and
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after she was released from the hospital, she was
taken to Delta's offices, then in Great Neck, N.Y., by a
stockbroker who later pleaded guilty to mail fraud against her in
connection with the loan and served time in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leonardi took out a $95,000 mortgage on her home in
Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, but she said later in a lawsuit against
Delta that she had no idea what kind of papers she was signing.
</P>
<P>
   The papers described her as a 68-year-old self-employed investor
making $7,000 a month. In fact, she was almost 73 and was living
mostly on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In giving the loan to Mrs. Leonardi, according to court
documents, Delta waived its written policy stating that income tax
returns should be used to verify the income of loan applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her lawyers say, all her mortgage proceeds went
directly to the stockbroker, and Mrs. Leonardi never made a single
loan payment. By December 1992, the bank began a foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Felsenfeld, a former Citicorp vice president who was an
expert witness for Mrs. Leonardi, said in a deposition that the
case showed ``clear and convincing evidence of Delta's
participation in the fraud perpetrated on Mrs. Leonardi.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta denied the accusations and pointed out that Mrs. Leonardi
had chosen the unscrupulous stockbroker herself. ``It is a sad
commentary on our society,'' a Delta vice president, Marie Klasa,
wrote in a letter in 1995, ``that people must seek to blame others
for their own errors in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the trial approached last summer, Delta agreed to pay
Mrs. Leonardi $200,000 _ more than twice the amount of her mortgage
_ in a confidential settlement in which Delta admitted no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the company settled because it believed it would be
less costly than pursuing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual facts,'' he said, ``are that Delta made a loan that
made sense at the time to a woman who knew what she was doing at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leonardi remembered it differently. ``At no time did any of
these people explain to me that I was signing papers for a mortgage
on my home,'' she stated in court documents. ``They merely pointed
to the lines, and I signed or initialed as directed. At the time I
was so weak that I couldn't walk without assistance and could not
read any of the papers that I was asked to sign.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ The most crucial win in Mike Tyson's career is in the
record books, though not without a great deal of difficulty, as
might be expected, coming off a 19-month layoff.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He overcame a sluggish, tainted, error-filled start Saturday
night against Francois Botha at the MGM Grand Garden Arena to
record a fifth-round knockout in a fight he had to win.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the thoughts of the 32-year-old former undisputed
heavyweight champion turned not to potential opponents or paydays
but to two weeks of rest and relaxation and a return to boxing's
laboratory in an effort to refine skills caked with rust.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks (of rest), I'm going to get back in the gym
and just keep working, capitalizing on everything I screwed up on
Saturday night,'' Tyson said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His technique was far from perfect, but the power that has
sustained Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) through a career that will
land him in the Boxing Hall of Fame was evident to the announced
crowd of 12,519 and a worldwide pay-per-view audience.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson trailed on the scorecards of all three ringside judges
until he floored the 6-2, 233-pound Botha (39-2, 24 KOs) at 2:59 of
the fifth round. But Tyson initially was unaware of what he had
done when Botha hit the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him on the floor and thought, `Is this guy
quitting?''' Tyson said. ``I didn't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he lost, Tyson would have dropped back into the shadows of
the heavyweight division. Now, his path to glory is clearer.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing most clear in the mind of his new trainer, Tommy
Brooks, through the first three rounds was worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was good for Mike just to get back in the ring
after a year and a half,'' Brooks said. ``I was a little worried at
first because he went out, he started looping his punches. He came
back to the corner, and I told him you've got to throw your
straight punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working for 2{ months on firing at the body; he was
headhunting. But he came out, settled down and started throwing
straight punches.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson was sure of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've got him in my sights, coach, just give me some
time,''' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was asked what he proved with the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prove anything,'' he said. ``I'm just constantly
trying to do well. I have a long way to go. But I have a new
trainer and we're working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the fifth round, Tyson trailed 39-36 on the scorecard
of judge Bill Graham, 40-35 on Dave Moretti's and 40-35 in the eyes
of Dalby Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth round, he caught Botha with a short right to
the head that dropped him. Botha twice struggled to regain his
feet, the second time nearly falling through the ropes after he had
been counted out, when he was restrained by Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, he's a brother,'' Tyson said. ``What can I say? It's
not that serious; it's just a boxing match.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no love lost between the two in the ring. The
first two rounds yielded dirty, illegal tactics by both, most after
the bell.
</P>
<P>
   When the first round ended, the two had to be separated by
handlers from each corner, turning the ring into a scene
reminiscent of June 1997, when, in the same ring, Tyson bit the
ears of Evander Holyfield to earn a one-year suspension of his
boxing license and a $3 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Botha) got rough with me; I got rough right back,'' Tyson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Tyson had a point deducted by referee
Richard Steele for unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He twisted my arm,'' Botha said. ``He was trying to break
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that was his intention, Tyson said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tyson might not be considering potential opponents,
Shelly Finkel, his new adviser, has drawn up a list that includes
Lou Savarese of Houston, Vaughn Bean and Shannon Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson on Sunday emphasized his desire to fight four more times,
then retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I fight four more times this year, then, yeah, I'm gone,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond boxing, Tyson has a couple of immediate personal matters
to clear up. On Feb. 5, he faces sentencing in Maryland on a
no-contest plea to two misdemeanor assault charges that stemmed
from a minor auto accident last summer. Tyson has settled out of
court with the two other drivers involved. Depending on the outcome
of the sentencing, Tyson could be judged in violation of his
Indiana parole and put back in jail.

 &HT;    Denver comes back, holds off Jets in AFC Championship
 &HT;    By Kent Mincer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and New York Jets coach Bill
Parcells both went into Sunday's AFC Championship at Mile High
Stadium unbeaten in conference championship games.
</P>
<P>
   What gave was a Jets defense that had held the Broncos scoreless
through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Denver spotted new York the game's first 10 points Sunday before
roaring back to score the final 23 and earn a berth in their sixth
Super Bowl, 23-10.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the game Jan. 31 will be against the coach who took
Denver to three of those Super Bowls, Atlanta's Dan Reeves, whose
Falcons pulled off the upset of the playoffs in defeating Minnesota
on the road 30-27 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   If mistakes are a key in a conference championship game (and
they are), both teams failed early in their attempts to establish
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   New York drove nine plays after taking the opening kickoff but
Jets kicker John Hall missed wide right from 42 yards out, hampered
by an 20-30 mile-an-hour wind that brought the wind chill in Mile
High Stadium to 18 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Denver went nowhere on its first series. The Jets took over at
their own 38 after the punt and Curtis Martin promptly fumbled. The
Broncos drove 55 yards in 12 plays, converting one fourth-down
play. But the drive stalled at the Jets 1 when the Broncos again
went for it on fourth and one, quarterback John Elway's pass
attempt being tipped as he released it.
</P>
<P>
   But New York coughed up the ball again, Keith Byars fumbling
after a Glenn Cadrez hit and John Mobley recovering at the Denver
13 with 10:14 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was becoming a tale of opposite offenses. New York
quarterback Vinny Testaverde completed his first 13 passes, a
personal record, but the Jets' Curtis Martin, who rushed for 124
yards in their divisional playoff win over Jacksonville, was held
to 11 yards on eight carries in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seven of Elway's first eight passes fell incomplete,
but Bronco running back Terrell Davis, the NFL's leading rusher
this season, had 75 yards rushing and 12 yards receiving through
the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best running back in football,'' Elway said. ``He's
what every quarterback wishes for.''
</P>
<P>
   But with 38 seconds left in the first half, New York took over
at the Denver 46 after a punt. Six plays (including four
completions) later, Hall, who had missed four of his previous six
field goal attempts on the road, connected from 32 yards out as the
half ended for the game's first score.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets made things happen three minutes into the third quarter
as the Broncos, backed up by a 52-yard John Kidd punt and a holding
penalty, went nowhere and were forced to punt. Blake Spence stepped
in to block Tom Rouen's attempt and Fred Baxter recovered at the
Denver 1. Martin then took a pitch over left tackle to put the Jets
up 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Broncos 3:33 to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Denver moved from its own 36 to the New York 11 in two plays,
including a 47-yard pass reception by Ed McCaffrey on first down.
Elway connected with fullback Howard Griffith for the score as the
Broncos cut the Jets' lead to three with 10:18 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault; I bit on the crossing route,'' New York
safety Victor Green said. ``If we had made a stop there, we would
have been in control of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway later said that McCaffrey and Rod Smith got switched
around coming out of the huddle before the big play. Ironically, it
was McCaffrey who was supposed to come underneath on a crossing
pattern with Smith heading deep on a post route.
</P>
<P>
   A short kick on the ensuing kickoff became a loose ball, with
Denver's Keith Burns pouncing on it, giving Denver possession at
the Jets' 31. A holding penalty wiped out a Davis run to the 11,
but Jason Elam tied the game with a 44-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Denver forced a punt on New York's next series. On fourth down,
Elam hit from 48 yards out to give Denver its first lead at 13-10
with 2:58 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing another punt, Darrien Gordon returned it 36 yards to the
Jets 38. Davis ran it three straight times, the final from 31 yards
out to the end zone. And in a little more than 11 1/2 minutes, the
Broncos went from 10 points down to 10 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   New York drove into Denver territory to start the fourth
quarter, but Steve Atwater forced a fumble by Alex Van Dyke, New
York's fourth of the day, after a pass reception, with Bill
Romanowski recovering at the Denver 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the combination of turning the ball over three times
across midfield, which limited our scoring opportunities,'' said
Parcells, who added he will be back as coach next season. ``Then we
had special teams mistakes as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored their final points on a 35-yard Elam field
goal with 3:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Gordon to seal the win with a pair of
interceptions sandwiched around Elam's final boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat a very, very good football team, well-coached,''
Shanahan said following the win. ``We managed to keep our
composure, even though we made a bunch of mistakes. That's the sign
of a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospects of facing the Falcons and the man
under whom Shanahan served as offensive coordinator, the Broncos
coach admitted, ``They're playing great defense, great offense.
That's a credit to Dan and his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons and the Broncos will meet at 4:18 Mountain Time in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, with the Broncos facing their former coach, who
is 0-3 as a head coach in Super Bowls, something has to give.

 &HT;    Elway not perfect _ but good enough
 &HT;    By Kent Mincer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He didn't have his best day as a Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   No, John Elway completed only 13 of 34 passes against the New
York Jets in Sunday's AFC Championship game. In fact, he was only 4
of 14 in the first half and, barely three minutes into the second
half, he found his team trailing 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   But there's always been something special about the Elway magic
at Mile High Stadium. That magic was never more evident than in the
second half, when Elway and the Broncos scored 23 unanswered points
to defeat the Jets 23-10 and move into Super Bowl XXXIII Jan. 31 in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum was definitely leaning New York's way when the
Broncos quickly answered to the Jets' lone touchdown, set up by a
blocked punt at the Denver 1.
</P>
<P>
   Denver got a touchdown in three plays, recovered a free ball on
a kickoff and tied the score within a span of 3:33 and went ahead
for good with less than three minutes remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And while Terrell Davis, the NFL's leading rusher this season
with 2,008 yards, certainly had a hand in things with 167 yards and
one touchdown, it was up to Elway to summon the comeback magic
that's hallmarked his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was probably the ugliest,'' Elway said of his five
AFC championship wins. ``But they all feel the same when they're
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway connected on 9 of 20 passes in the second half, including
an 11-yard touchdown to fullback Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little shocked at halftime that we were down
3-0,'' he said of a Jets field goal at the end of the half which
were the half's only points. When asked if he said anything to his
team in the locker room at intermission, he said, ``Yeah, 'We've
got to get going. We definitely can't win scoring no points.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the day was most magical because it was anticipated that
this might be Elway's last appearance at Mile High Stadium. He's
rumored, as he was last season, to be considering retirement at the
end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd knew it could be the last time it got to see his Mile
High Magic. With less than two minutes remaining and the Broncos
moving for what appeared to be their last drive, flashbulbs popped
all over the stadium, fans grasping to catch Elway's final moments
on the fabled turf.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:09 left and the Broncos offense exiting after giving the
ball over on downs _ he just overthrew Ed McCaffrey in the end zone
_ a cheer erupted throughout the stadium as fans cheered Elway off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped to a makeshift podium in the middle of the field to
interview with a postgame television broadcast that was boomed over
the public address system. ``One more year,'' the fans chanted.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was, indeed, his last game in Denver, Elway
hedged. ``I can't tell you that yet,'' he said to a rousing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   At a postgame press conference, Elway, who took a victory lap
around the stadium after the television interview, said his
greatest recollection of the lap was ``how happy the fans were.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway again was hesitant to make any commitments after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not make any decisions until down the line,'' he said.
``My main focus is to finish out this year before I think about
next year,'' he said, vowing to spend the next couple of weeks
concentrating instead on the upcoming Super Bowl battle with the
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it will be against a coach with whom Elway had his
share of disagreements during Dan Reeves' tenure in Denver, which
included three trips to the Super Bowl, all losses. Still, Elway
gave Reeves his due for getting the Falcons into the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got them playing great,'' said Elway. ``And Dan's a great
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Falcons to go into Minnesota and win there (30-27 over
the favored Vikings in overtime Sunday), they're playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Elway said he and his teammates ``are just
thrilled to death to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   So the legend in Denver vows to spend the next two weeks
focusing on how to beat Atlanta in Miami in two weeks. He'll be
making his fifth start in a Super Bowl, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   He's got plenty of time in the off-season to worry about the
future.

ANALYSIS :  WITH FOREIGN RESERVES DOWN, BRAZIL HAD TO FLOAT THE
REAL
</HEADLINE>

 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO  
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ On the trading floor of the Sao Paulo
stock exchange, it led to a breathtaking buying spree. In
Washington, officials were relieved. But in Brazil, the
government's decision to stop protecting the currency that beat
hyperinflation signaled the end of a celebrated monetary plan that
promised to transform Latin America's biggest country into a modern
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The dream has been personified by President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, a multilingual former sociology professor and finance
minister who has roamed world capitals and financial centers for
the last four years, selling his vision of a modern Brazil, intent
on reform and backed by a stable currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   He told Brazilians, most of whom had never lived without runaway
prices, that inflation was the cruelest tax of all, striking the
poor whose salaries lost value by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   It complicated long-term investments and planning, so industry
failed to modernize, relying instead on trade barriers to keep out
cheaper imports. Brazilians rewarded Cardoso for his Real Plan's
success in beating hyperinflation by voting him president twice _ a
first for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors signed on, seeing in Brazil huge, untapped
market of 160 million for everything from telephones to
refrigerators, and potential base for exports to the rest of South
America. Direct foreign investment, $2 billion at the Real Plan's,
totaled $36 billion by last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cardoso stood before his nation on television for two
and a half minutes, to say that he had done all he could to protect
the real by intervening on currency markets, but could no longer
spend foreign reserves that had dwindled to $30 billion from $75
billion in five months. The real would be free to float on world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reaction was frenzied buying, which gave the Sao
Paulo Bovespa index its second-biggest rise in a single day: 33.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only higher increase, 36.05 percent, occurred on Feb. 4,
1991, when the second phase of former President Fernando Collor de
Mello's economic plan was announced. He left office one step ahead
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while economists and industrialists debate the size of
price increases likely to hit stores this week and the possible
nature of ``Real Plan II,'' there is little disagreement about the
cause of the current failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Plan foundered on the same rocks that sank a half dozen
other plans to transform Brazil over the last 15 years: the
government's inability to maneuver reform past vested interests
that enjoy benefits and breaks Brazil cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said a year ago that his predecessor, Collor de Mello,
was drummed from office not so much for corruption as for angering
the elite by going too fast with reform. This president learned the
lesson, and navigated reform measures through Congress cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months into office, he turned his attention to winning a
constitutional amendment to permit his re-election, a complicated
process that cost political capital needed he would need later. In
doing so, he put off the further economic and political change
needed to make Brazil the modern nation of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cardoso has been brought up short by the refusal of a
political rival, Itamar Franco, governor of the second-largest of
Brazil's 26 states, to make his state's payments to the federal
coffers. Franco's default has whipped up a wave of discontent among
opposition governors, who are now demanding that the federal
government renegotiate the terms of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Cardoso and his government may try to portray Friday's
move as a simple shifting of gears to juggle the concerns of those
who favor growth, and those who want a stable currency, there is
little sign that the president had any option but to surrender
stability he could no longer sustain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the financial markets appeared pleased that Brazil
would no longer drain foreign reserves to bolster its currency. But
there was a sense of betrayal among those who had believed Brazil's
leaders when they repeatedly ruled out devaluation. What other
elements of his vision will Cardoso surrender?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's the emperor has no clothes syndrome,''
said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Programs at
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Cardoso administration has made important
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It pushed through measures to force government to lay off public
workers if a state's payroll exceeds 60 percent of its budget, and
has had partial success adopting laws that should trim the deficit
left by pensions that are more generous than the state can afford.
It has privatized state-owned mining, telecommunications and
utility companies, and cleaned up state-owned banks notoriously
used as political kitties by state governors.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the Real Plan, its raison-d'etre, was its goal
of curbing inflation that topped 2,500 percent a year before the
plan's creation in July 1994. Successive Brazilian administrations
over the last 40 years had either proved powerless to fight
inflation or embraced it as a way to create the illusion of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has become a group of characters in search of a
play,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political consultant based in the
capital, Brasilia. ``They had the play of the Real Plan, based on
some premises, but those premises are not valid anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the level of government indebtedness now will be
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's dream for Brazil grew more expensive each year that it
remained unrealized, because _ without the fig leaf of inflation _
the government has had to borrow to cover its overspending.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Real Plan began in 1994, the Brazilian government had
no deficit to speak of, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho Neto, the
Central Bank's director for International Relations, said in
October. Government agencies would rely on inflation to cure any
shortfalls, delaying adjustments in salaries for inflation and
using the money saved to cover overspending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Without inflation, the budget deficit has ballooned, lumbering
now toward $65 billion, or 8 percent of the gross national product.

   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an important commitment to shore up
its wide-receiver position Sunday when high school All-American
Steve Stevenson said he will play for the Trojans next season.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, of Charter Oak High in Covina, selected USC over
UCLA, Colorado, Oregon and Texas A&AMP;M. He caught 34 passes for 630
yards and 10 touchdowns while rushing for more than 600 yards and
17 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson is listed as an All-American by several recruiting
services. USC returns just two receivers _ R. Jay Soward and
Windrell Hayes _ who caught a pass last season. Besides Stevenson,
USC has also received a commitment from Long Beach Poly wide
receiver Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   USC also hosted wide receiver Ronald Bellamy, of Marrero, La.,
who is expected to make a decision this week. Bellamy is
considering USC, Michigan, Ohio State, Kansas State and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Marcell Allmond of St. Paul, another All-American,
will visit USC this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   USC also received a commitment from offensive lineman Norman
Katnick (6-foot-3, 225 pounds) from Esperanza High. He is the
nephew of former USC lineman John Katnick.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also lost a couple recruits recently. Westchester
High's Courtney Morgan, who committed last month, has now said he
will attend Michigan. Quarterback Ken Dorsey of Miramonte High in
Orinda selected Miami over the Trojans on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   USC is also no longer recruiting defensive lineman Malcolm
Woolridge of Boca Raton, Fla. He will not qualify academically and
is expected to attend a prep school next year.

<P>
   DENVER _ For more than half of Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game, the Jets could see all the way to
Miami and the Super Bowl, the game that they had helped turn into
one of the biggest spectacles in sports 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then they began to drop the ball, turning it over six times
on a day when the Denver Broncos needed the gifts. And in a
10-minute splurge after halftime, the Broncos, the defending Super
Bowl champions, rallied for 20 points and defeated the Jets by
23-10 to earn the trip to Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the high-powered Broncos was not a surprise, but
their Super Bowl opponent is: the Atlanta Falcons, who shocked the
heavily favored Minnesota Vikings for the National Conference
championship, winning by 30-27 in overtime in Minneapolis. The
Falcons _ led by a coach, Dan Reeves, who had heart bypass surgery
a month ago _ will play in the Super Bowl for the first time in
their 33-year history and will again be underdogs, this time to the
Broncos, Reeves' former team.
</P>
<P>
   On the best of days it would have been difficult for the Jets to
halt Denver, which was 14-2 in the regular season and had won 18
consecutive games at Mile High Stadium. But the Jets, who led by
10-0 early in the second half, could not overcome their mistakes:
the six turnovers, including four fumbles, and a botched kickoff
that set up a Denver field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can do the things we did in a championship
game against a team like this,'' said a subdued Bill Parcells, the
Jets' coach, who in two breathless seasons had rebuilt the National
Football League laughing stocks and brought them within 60 minutes
of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells held his post-game news conference, Elway was
busy running a victory lap around Mile High Stadium after what was
probably his last game in Denver. The quarterback, who was
energized by the fans and by the Jets' mistakes in the second half,
is likely to retire after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Elway, who won his fifth AFC championship in his
16th season, was not at his best, completing 13 of 34 passes for
173 yards. But his 11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith in the
third quarter started Denver's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis once again led the Broncos, rushing for 167 yards
and a touchdown. The Jets' failures, meanwhile, were punctuated by
the startling fact that Curtis Martin, their leading runner and one
of the best in football, was held to 14 yards on 13 carries. It was
the worst day of his pro career, and it included a lost fumble, his
second in the playoffs. During the regular season, he had lost the
ball only once in 369 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were making their first appearance in a conference
championship game in 16 years, and their upset victory 30 years ago
in Super Bowl III remains their only Super Bowl visit. But into the
second half Sunday, their surprising run to the playoffs seemed to
be gaining even more momentum. Vinny Testaverde, who had come to
symbolize the Jets' resurrection under Parcells, completed his
first 13 passes and would finish 31 of 52 for 356 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic,'' Jets guard Todd Burger said. ``There was
so much optimism. But then you think you've got almost 250 yards by
halftime and you've only got 3 points, and Denver must be thinking,
`All we're behind is by 3 and we're playing lousy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, one of the NFL's best-conditioned teams, had not
collapsed like this in a game this season. Reasons for Sunday's
failure could be found, perhaps, in the mile-high altitude or the
atmosphere in the tumultuous stadium, where more than 75,000 people
stomped their feet so hard it seemed that the looming Rockies might
quiver.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Jets came apart near the end, with Testaverde
intercepted twice in the fourth quarter, it was apparent that the
franchise had gone into a new era. It just was not going to the
Super Bowl yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we came a long way,'' Testaverde said. ``A longer
way than people expected us to.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars, one of the ``good hands'' people with whom Parcells
had surrounded Testaverde, produced a rare fumble after a reception
to stifle a drive deep in Denver territory in the second quarter.
The game was scoreless, and mistakes like that kept Denver hoping.
In fact, the Jets lost the ball to Denver three times within the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ball tucked,'' said Byars, the leading career
receiver among NFL running backs. ``If I had to do it over again,
I'd do it the same way. I must have made that play hundreds of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't make it Sunday. Nor did other Jets.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams combined for more than 900 points during the
regular season. But it took almost the entire first half before
anyone scored even 3 points. That turned out to be the Jets, who
finally put up points after dominating for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That sole score was John Hall's 32-yard field goal as time
expired, and it was positioned, in the mistake-filled half, by a
Broncos penalty on a punt. That put the Jets in good field position
after they had misfired repeatedly themselves. Indeed, the game's
opening drive ended with a failed 42-yard field-goal attempt by
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was kicked amid gusts that hit 32 mph and sent
orange balloons swirling, flags snapping to attention and stray
pieces of paper flying. Whatever the reason, a Jets drive deep into
Denver territory was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos went three-and-out and the Jets got the ball again,
but Martin lost the ball and Tyrone Braxton recovered at the Denver
44.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense troubled Elway for much of the game. He moved
his team to the 1-yard line after Martin's fumble, but the Broncos
were halted. On fourth-and-goal from the 1, Mo Lewis tipped away
Elway's pass.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos weren't only stopped close. Repeatedly, they
could not solve the defense orchestrated by Bill Belichick. The
Jets, using a 3-4 alignment that relied on a coordinated rush and a
pass-defense alignment that took away the center of the field,
simply looked better than Denver. Elway did not have a completion
in his first three drives. The Jets took away the middle,
double-teamed the Pro Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe and did not
seem concerned about Elway throwing the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, the Broncos heard their first boos _
quite possibly their first here of the season _ when they went
three-and-out and Tom Rouen botched a 29-yard punt.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later, a Jets rookie tight end named Blake Spence,
who had not even put on a uniform for 10 straight games, loomed out
of obscurity to block a punt that put the Jets only 1 yard out of
the Denver end zone. Spence, a fifth-round draft pick, suited up
because Parcells was unhappy with free safety Jerome Henderson. So
Spence blocked Rouen's punt from the end zone. The Jets' Fred
Baxter recovered on the 1.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Martin found the end zone, and the Jets led by
10-0.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could not build on that momentum. In fact, the Broncos
smothered it immediately. Vaughn Hebron returned the kickoff 28
yards, and then Elway connected with Ed McCaffrey, who had earlier
dropped two passes, for a 47-yard completion over a fooled Victor
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Elway and the Broncos had rediscovered their
quick-strike capability. The drive took 93 seconds and ended with
an 11-yard touchdown toss to Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets' turnovers finally cost them points. Jason
Elam's kickoff, held by the wind, bounced in front of the returner,
David Meggett. The Jets' James Farrior tried to snare the ball, but
fumbled it away to Keith Burns on the Jets' 32.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a 44-yard field goal by Elam to tie the score at
10-10 with 8 minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter. The
sense that something had turned was palpable. Soon, helped again by
good field position after Darrien Gordon's 11-yard punt return,
Elam cut through the dangerous winds for a 48-yard field and a
13-10 lead. It was Denver's first.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third quarter ended, Davis punctuated the
Broncos' comeback with a 31-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter brought another Jets fumble, this time by the
seldom-used receiver Alex Van Dyke, and then Testaverde's first
interception of the game. Gordon returned it 18 yards to the Jets'
18, and it led to Elam's 35-yard field goal and the crushing 23-10
lead. Later, Testaverde was intercepted again, on a deflection as
he started to throw the ball _ a reminder of times when he played
for teams who needed his strong arm to mount comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, the team that had surrounded him most of the season
had collapsed, and so did many of its big-play performers.

   NEW YORK _ The time? About 10 years from now. The place? A busy
city newsroom. The circumstances? A breaking story, perhaps a
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter grabs a note pad, a tape recorder and something else:
a mobile journalist work station that includes equipment that will
plug the user into the Internet, allow transfer of information from
editors and tap into a data base of information about the
reporter's surroundings. It includes eyeglasses with built-in
liquid-crystal displays, a small high-speed wireless modem and a
global positioning satellite hookup that can pinpoint location to
within an inch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vision of the future that a group at Columbia University
_ John Pavlik, director of the Journalism School's Center for New
Media, Steven Feiner, a professor of computer sciences, and some of
their students _ is working to make into a reality. A prototype of
the work station, about the size of a large backpack, is being
developed with about $120,000 a year in grants from the Office of
Naval Research and the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, an
organization that promotes the use of computer networking
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system works interactively. In the future, a miniature
camera may make it possible to beam images from remote spots to a
home base, like a newsroom or a television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik said the work station, if eventually shrunk to an easily
portable size, could become an important information-gathering
tool, giving ``better access through wireless technologies to a
wide spectrum of information, including the Internet, but also to
remotely located experts and editors.'' It could provide immediate
context for reporting, he added, leading to greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The project was not originally developed as a reporter's tool.
Feiner was researching what is called mobile augmented reality when
he and Pavlik realized its journalistic possibilities. Feiner said
he hoped to make the work station no larger than a hand-held radio
and reduce the cost to about $150, so that it would appeal to
ordinary consumers. He said travelers could use it as an aid in
exploring cities, ``something akin to a Michelin guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Naval Research has less pedestrian uses in mind:
it wants the work station to provide information to soldiers on a
battlefield. Dr. Larry Rosenblum, a researcher at the Naval
Research Laboratories, said, ``We want to give a marine a natural
interface without having him have to stop and punch into a
computer.''

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Virginians are struggling to decide what odors
wafting out of New York City smell more foul _ mushrooming mounds
of garbage or uppity pronouncements from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Nostrils flared across the Old Dominion last week at news of a
possible tripling of deliveries of New York City garbage. Up to 2.2
million tons a year, Virginians learned, could be heading up the
James River, bound for landfills in a state that already is
embarrassed to place second (behind Pennsylvania) as America's top
garbage destination.
</P>
<P>
   Noxious as the news was _ Gov. James Gilmore III called it
``highly unacceptable'' and spoke of his ``duty'' to ban garbage
barges on state rivers _its perceived toxicity was quickly exceeded
by the mayor's statement about why non-New Yorkers have garbage
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the top-drawer culture that visitors soak up in
New York, the mayor argued, they should be willing to bury some
trash back home. A ``reciprocal relationship,'' he called it.
</P>
<P>
   In this state where people take pride in their manners, the
mayor's reasoning has incited widespread outbreaks of incivility.
Long-simmering suspicions about Yankees _ their arrogance, their
pushy politicians and the unspeakable nature of their garbage _ are
suddenly boiling over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let me see if I got it right,'' said state Sen. William
Bolling, a Republican and longtime critic of out-of-state trash.
``I come up to New York and I spend my hard-earned money and
somehow in exchange for that privilege, I am supposed to take your
trash? This represents a certain arrogant attitude that is not
consistent with the way we do business in Virginia. I can't think
of a single issue that has made my blood boil more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday at the governor's mansion, Gilmore, a
Republican, said he was ``offended'' by the Republican mayor's
reasoning on garbage, which he described as ``really an outrageous
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out and basically try to further the discussion by
saying we had a moral obligation because some Virginians from time
to time visit New York is not proper,'' said Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was concerned that the image of Virginia,
which he described as ``one of the top technology states in the
country,'' with more than 1,000 high-tech companies, including
America Online, was being unfairly maligned by the trash issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much on the rise and we don't want anyone to get
the impression that Virginia is only good as a garbage
repository,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office has dismissed such comments, which resounded
here in the state capital during last week's opening of the General
Assembly, as mere carping from ``pandering politicians trying to
achieve their own agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just politicians are peeved. Business leaders with
multimillion-dollar investments in garbage importation speak
bitterly of the public-relations disaster they say the mayor has
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this past week, when people here say Yankee trash, they
think it's redundant,'' said Charles Carter III, an 11th-generation
Virginian whose family owns Port Tobacco at Weanack, a
state-of-the-art facility for containerized garbage on the James
River.
</P>
<P>
   Carter finds it hard to believe that Giuliani is entertaining
thoughts of running for national elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani couldn't have said anything that could have harmed
his own cause more. He is definitely not presidential material,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia's governor and the Legislature follow through on
last week's threats to ban garbage barges on the river _ and there
are constitutional reasons why such a state ban might not hold up
in court _ Carter stands to lose lots of money. He says his family
does not have the resources to take the state on in a long court
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's advice to the mayor: ``We'll take the trash, but keep
your mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest company that disposes of New York's garbage in
Virginia is Waste Management Inc. of Houston. It has invested $15
million in Port Tobacco and had planned to begin barge shipments
there in April. Asked if the mayor had helped Waste Management in
its delicate negotiations with the governor and the Legislature, a
company spokeswoman, Christine Meket, who has been dispatched to
Richmond for damage control, said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmental groups, investigative reporters and a
few lawmakers in Virginia have tried to raise public awareness of
what they see as the ecological and road-safety risks of the
state's rapidly increasing importation of garbage. The business has
boomed here in the last decade, creating giant landfills located
mostly in land-rich, cash-poor African-American communities in
central Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, driven by the legal deadline to close its
landfill at Fresh Kills on Staten Island by Dec. 31, 2001, has
become Virginia's fastest-growing source of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage-truck accidents, complaints about putrid odors and state
records documenting the arrival of untreated syringes and vials of
human blood have all raised public awareness here about trash
rolling into this state from New York. A poll released last week by
Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public Policy found
that 87 percent of Virginians want to cap trash shipments into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Giuliani, said Sunday that
at least some Virginians welcomed New York's trash. ``Simply put,
this is a business that creates jobs and generates economic
activity,'' he said. ``New York City has already been contacted by
a number of communities in Virginia that want this trade.'' He
would not say which communities wanted the city's garbage. But he
said the city had no choice but to find alternatives to Fresh
Kills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But judging by comments this weekend from shoppers at a mall
outside Richmond, Giuliani has been uniquely effective in
crystallizing attitudes toward big-city garbage in the minds of
average Virginians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not been thinking about it until Giuliani made his
remarks,'' said Kitty Jones, 55, a school secretary from Henrico
County who was having lunch on Saturday outside the Chick-Fil-A
booth in the food court at Virginia Center Commons mall.
</P>
<P>
   Since reading about the mayor in the papers and watching him on
television in the past week, Ms. Jones said she had found herself
wondering why Giuliani would say such a thing and what kind of town
would support such a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of New York, you think of arrogance,'' Ms.
Jones said, adding that it was probably unfair to judge a whole
city on the basis of its mayor's behavior. ``I'm sure they are all
not like that, are they?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia Legislature this year _ an election year here _
garbage is emerging as the hot-button issue. On one side, there are
quality-of-life complaints, especially from lawmakers in affluent
northern Virginia, where highways in the Washington suburbs are
inundated with out-of-state garbage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, there is the deepening dependence of central
Virginia counties on revenue from landfills. In Charles City County
south of Richmond, $32 million in revenue from a landfill that
takes New York City garbage has allowed county supervisors to build
a new school system and an industrial park and to cut property
taxes by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the legislative mix, according to state records, is an
increasing flow of campaign money from waste industry companies.
</P>
<P>
   Given the volatility of the garbage issue, state legislators on
both sides of the aisle here said they were stunned by both the
content and the timing of Giuliani's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor should realize that this is a hot political topic
and the general approach should not be to fan the flames,'' said
Delegate Kenneth Plum, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
``But this is effectively what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Charles City County, whose 934-acre landfill is operated
by Waste Management Inc., school leaders and county planners
reacted more in sadness than in anger to the mayor's theory of
interstate garbage-culture reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   They said the county, which has a population of about 7,000
people, many of whom are among the poorest residents of Virginia,
simply cannot afford a huge, politics-driven reduction in the
amount of garbage coming into the landfill. It is ready to begin
receiving New York garbage from the new port on the James River _
if the barges are not banned by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landfill is the biggest boon to Charles City County in
modern times,'' said Bill Britton, the county planning director.
``Every tax since 1988 has either stayed the same or has been
lowered. At the same time, we have been able to build a whole
school system _ not just one school _ but a $21 million school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The county's school board chairman, Charles Giles, agreed
wholeheartedly with Giuliani's statements last week that any
attempt by Virginia to ban barge shipments of garbage would be
overturned by federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to interfere with interstate commerce,''
Giles said. ``It is a constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Britton declined to comment on the mayor's
invocation of a garbage obligation in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, managing director of the family-owned port on the James
River, had no such reticence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that before last week's comments by the mayor, he had
heard sketchy reports of a similar public-relations debacle in New
Jersey. In December, the mayor surprised and infuriated Gov.
Christie Whitman with a plan to ship trash to transfer stations in
her state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought that brouhaha must have been exaggerated,''
Carter said. ``But it sounds like the mayor has apparently got a
big enough mouth that he not only can get his feet in it, but
several other people's feet in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter then allowed himself to ask what he described as a
sarcastic question: ``Is the mayor always such a wonderful and wise
person in all his comments?''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They were 14-2 in the regular season but didn't
earn the home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They knocked off perennial power San Francisco in the divisional
round but still weren't thought to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   They had won 10 consecutive games but entered the NFC
Championship Game as 11-point underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons proved everyone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime conference-championship game since coach
Dan Reeves' Broncos beat Cleveland in the January 1987 AFC title
game, Reeves' Falcons (16-2) knocked off the Minnesota Vikings
(16-2) for Atlanta's first trip to the Super Bowl. Minnesota, only
the third team to finish the regular season 15-1, becomes the first
of the three not to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the best-kept secret in the NFL,'' Atlanta free safety
Eugene Robinson said. ``I looked at ESPN, Fox, CBS, TNT, Fox Sports
South, Fox Sports West and nobody thought we could win the game.
But there's something special about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the game turned on a missed field goal by the
Vikings' Gary Anderson. He had already connected on kicks of 29 and
35 yards, improving his streak to 42 straight field goals this
season. But with Minnesota leading 27-20 with 2:07 remaining,
Anderson's 38-yard attempt was wide left, and the Falcons were
still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Though he didn't get credit, Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan
said he got to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nicked the ball,'' Buchanan said. ``I think he still hooked
it enough trying to get away from the pressure on the left side. I
was coming around the left side, and it went wide left. If he would
have kicked it straight, it would have been clearly blocked because
I got right through. Then when I got to the sideline, I thought,
`Wow, that was my man right there. He had a perfect season. He's a
Pro Bowl guy.' Man showed us a little favor right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several big plays. The Falcons got the ball back
needing a 71-yard touchdown drive to tie the score. Quarterback
Chris Chandler completed three straight passes, including a
29-yarder to Ronnie Harris, his only catch of the game. Finding an
open lane, Chandler scrambled to pick up nine yards and reach the
Vikings' 22. Jamal Anderson, who had been contained most of the
afternoon, picked up six yards to the Minnesota 16, and Chandler
then threw a bullet to Terance Mathis in the end zone to tie the
score at 27 with 49 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum swung back and forth in overtime. With less than
nine minutes remaining, Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham
threw a long pass to rookie Pro Bowler Randy Moss near the Atlanta
16 on third-and-10. Robinson knocked it down to get the ball back
for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   On Atlanta's second OT possession after it stopped Minnesota
twice, Chandler connected with tight end O.J. Santiago for pickups
of 15 and 26 yards. The Falcons, who started on their nine-yard
line, ran nine plays to the Minnesota 21 before bringing Morten
Andersen onto the field. Andersen connected on a 38-yarder to send
the Falcons to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't intimidate us,'' Santiago said. ``Nobody has done it
all year long. We are 14-2 (during the regular season). I don't
understand why people don't realize we were 14-2. You don't go 14-2
being scared, being intimidated. You go 14-2 with consistent play
on offense, defense and special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who set an NFL scoring record this season, were
known for big plays. But with the exception of a 31-yard touchdown
pass to Moss on their first possession, there were none longer than
17 yards. The Falcons, meanwhile, had a 70-yard pass from Chandler
to Tony Martin to set up an Andersen field goal early in the fourth
quarter. There were four other plays of 19 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Vikings were able to contain the league's
second-leading rusher, holding Jamal Anderson to 67 yards, Chandler
took to the air, passing for 340 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been talk in the paper, we kind of heard it all
week, that `If you stop the running game, stop Jamal, we're going
to beat the Falcons,''' Chandler said. ``I wanted to show
everybody, especially the Vikings, that we can throw the ball as
well as you guys can. We can make a lot of big plays throwing the
ball. To overlook our passing game is a mistake. We were very
effective throwing the ball today.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to be, especially after Minnesota took a 20-7 lead.
Atlanta scored on its opening possession as Anderson caught a
five-yard pass from Chandler. The Vikings then scored 20 unanswered
points, in part the result of two Atlanta fumbles. The first, by
running back Harold Green, was recovered at the Minnesota 40 and
eventually led to a field goal early in the second quarter. The
next, a fumble by Santiago on Atlanta's first play of the ensuing
possession, turned into a Minnesota touchdown as Cunningham plunged
the final yard to cap a six-play, 33-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cut that lead to six before halftime when Chuck Smith
forced a fumble with a sack on Cunningham and Travis Hall recovered
the ball. The Falcons got the ball at the Minnesota 14, and
Chandler connected with Mathis for a one-play touchdown drive to
cut the deficit to 20-14 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings scored only once more, on a five-yard pass to
Matthew Hatchette with 13:41 remaining in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta came here and played a perfect game,'' Moss said.
``They were down, and they stuck with their game plan. I think we
got a little rattled in the end, and we couldn't make anything
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the Super Bowl pits Reeves against the franchise he
took there three times. And for a guy five weeks removed from
quadruple-bypass surgery, life doesn't get much more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stand today, my heart's got to be in great shape,''
Reeves said. ``It can't be much harder. The only thing harder will
be dancing in downtown Atlanta the `Dirty Bird.' That's not going
to be a pretty sight.''

CHANDLER'S TIME HAS COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Aside from the tight knot of Atlanta Falcons
celebrating disbelievingly at the bottom of the Metrodome, the only
sound in the moments after the NFC championship game Sunday was the
bonk of 64,000 strong Norwegian jaws dropping onto the concrete
floor in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   One jaw, however, was making a different noise.
</P>
<P>
   Bounding from the field up the stairwell toward the locker room,
three steps at a time, was Eugene Robinson, who really didn't need
steps.
</P>
<P>
   To no one and everyone, in the high-pitched staccato screech
that earned him the nickname ``Orca'' by his former Seahawk
teammates, the Falcons' safety shouted:
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!''
</P>
<P>
   Most assuredly, they didn't believe it. And remember, this is a
population that recently elected a pro rassler as governor, so its
capacity for active imagination is not to be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not in their darkest, lutefisk-induced nightmares did
Minnesotans envision Sunday: Their invincible, invulnerable
Vikings, a magnificent 16-1 this NFL season, losing a berth in the
Super Bowl 30-27 in overtime to an 11-point underdog team led by a
peripatetic grid hobo, Chris Chandler, whose nickname, ``Chrystal
Chandelier,'' is a testament to his physical fragility.
</P>
<P>
   By the Falcons' own admission, they are Dirty Birds, coached by
a guy who needs a zipper on his chest to deal more easily with his
heart problems. The relentless Vikings put 20 unanswered points on
that heart in less than 14 minutes of the first half, usually a
signal for even a healthy ticker to take the rest of the career
off.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Vikings lost, fergawdsakes, AT HOME, where rivals' ears
go to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come in here, with this crowd, and do what we did,'' said a
beaming Chandler, ``is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a description he might have reserved for himself, not only
for Sunday but for his advance from the back alleys of pro football
to the Boulevard of Pigskin Dreams, which this year is shaded by
the palms of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett native and former University of Washington
quarterback was good for a pick-free day of 340 yards and three
TDs, including a 16-yarder to Terance Mathis inside the final
minute of regulation. That touchdown not only concluded a marvelous
clutch drive that forced overtime, it drove home a point Chandler
was eager to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of looking at the papers and seeing (the Vikings
say) all they had to do was shut down our running game,'' he said.
``I took that personally.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have known Chandler through his often convulsive
career as a Husky and in the NFL, they know that when he takes
something personally, drama is imminent. Earlier in his career, the
drama was often self-destructive. But these days, a more serene
Chandler simply gets even. Or, as was the case Sunday, three points
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were 15-2 primarily upon the rushing feats of
running back Jamal Anderson, who had 1,800 yards during the season.
Held to a quiet 67 Sunday, the offense for the biggest game in the
Falcons' tepid NFL history reverted to Chandler, heretofore a
figure in NFL records only because he is the sole quarterback to
start for six different teams.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, not long off a hospital gurney after bypass
surgery, armed Chandler with the key maneuver to survive the audio
riot _ a silent snap count, which eliminated the need for words
beyond the huddle. To carry out the lip-synch, Chandler even bobbed
his head as if he were calling signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard on the silent count all week,'' said Chandler's
partner in deceit, center Robbie Tobeck, who happens to be the QB's
natural-born enemy _ he's a Washington State Cougar (class of '93.)
``It really helped because it took the crowd's influence out of the
game. I don't think we had a single problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams often use silent counts for two or three series in a domed
stadium, and rarely have the cohesion to sustain it for a game. But
the Falcons used it throughout to accumulate 427 yards of offense,
including a touchdown and two field goals in the final 23 minutes
of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tip your hat to Atlanta,'' said Vikings cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock. ``They were prepared for the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Added offensive teammate Randy Moss: ``Atlanta came here and
played a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chandler, a third-round pick in the 1988 draft, it was a
perfect, albeit tardy, breakthrough to the big time. Always
well-praised for his skills, he nevertheless had either bad timing
or bad luck _ and occasionally a bad temper _ that produced pink
slips from Indianapolis, Tampa, Arizona, the L.A. Rams and Houston.
But at 33 and with his sixth team, he has found health, quality
teammates and some security _ in September, he signed a four-year,
$25 million extension that included a $6 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a lot of places in this league,'' he said. ``None
of them were good _ until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his previous teams never won, Chandler might be the most
obscure quality quarterback in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy, and very good,'' said Falcons tight end O.J.
Santiago. ``We know that in Atlanta. If the rest of the country
doesn't know it, maybe they will after today.''
</P>
<P>
   After outdueling the more celebrated Randall Cunningham, the
Vikings, suspected of being one of the great teams of the decade,
are no longer making that misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   Too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``To overlook our passing game was a mistake that hurt them,''
said a defiant Chandler, still taking it personally long after the
Vikings and their noisy fans felt an insult far more deeply.

IN THE SPIRIT OF DR. KING, PLEAS FOR COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By NADINE BROZAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  NEW YORK _ The words spoken at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
Harlem Sunday morning were probably much like those delivered from
many pulpits on the day before the federal holiday honoring the
nation's most celebrated civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation of the poor in America is our plight, our
sickness,'' the speaker said, quoting a close friend and ally of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ``To be deaf to their cry is to
condemn ourselves. Martin Luther King is a voice, a vision and a
way.
</P>
<P>
   What was unexpected for a Baptist church setting became clear as
the quotation continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``I call upon every Jew to hearken to his voice, to share his
vision, to follow in his way. The whole future of America will
depend upon the impact and influence of Dr. King.''
</P>
<P>
   That call was first delivered on March 25, 1968, by Rabbi
Abraham Joshua Heschel in a talk to a meeting of rabbis 10 days
before King was assassinated. The words were reiterated Sunday by
Rabbi J. Rolando Matalon, who along with Rabbi Marcelo R. Bronstein
and 100 members of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, the Conservative
synagogue on the Upper West Side, snapped up the limited number of
seats reserved for them at the Harlem church.
</P>
<P>
   They had come in response to an invitation issued on Jan. 9 by
the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor of the church, when he
delivered a sermon to the synagogue as a possible first step in
forging an alliance between the congregations to fight racial,
social and economic injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last there is a chance, maybe not to stretch hands across
the sea but to begin to close a chasm,'' one of the synagogue's
members, E.M. Broner, a writer, said as she stood in line outside
the church Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The B'nai Jeshurun rabbis and Butts repeatedly invoked role
models for cooperation in their talks from the pulpit. They cited
King, who would have turned 70 on Jan. 15 and whose birthday
celebration provided the theme of the service, and Heschel, the
Jewish theologian who marched with King in Selma and who persuaded
him to become involved in protests against the Vietnam War.
Heschel's 26th yahrzeit, the anniversary of his death, was observed
last week.
</P>
<P>
   In his sermon, whose title, ``Moral Grandeur and Spiritual
Audacity,'' was taken from Heschel, Butts said, ``This church
celebrates Abraham Joshua Heschel, who helped to guide Martin
Luther King, and now we have the opportunity to move forward to
better the city, the state, the country, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King and Abraham Joshua Heschel were hit by the
spirit, and they joined hands. They knew the storm troopers were
out there. They knew there was a bullet that had King's name on it,
but the spirit of audacity brought them together.''
</P>
<P>
   In his talk on Jan. 9, which won a standing ovation, Butts said
of the two men he called prophets: ``It didn't matter that one was
a rabbi and one was a Christian clergyperson. What mattered was
that they shared the same experience with God and were willing to
run the risk of facing violence arm in arm in Selma on the bloody
Sunday when marchers were beaten into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have to do that again?'' he implored. ``Do we have to
stand in the face of that kind of ugliness? Eventually, if not
today, we're going to have to start walking together.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the impassioned words delivered in sermons translate
into tangible action for onetime allies whose relationship has been
sorely tested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have for a long time felt the cooling off of
black-Jewish efforts,'' Matalon said the other day. ``There was a
time when blacks and Jews collaborated in significant projects
bringing about social change. Then a number of factors divided and
separated those communities, all sorts of issues, some having to do
with affirmative action, South Africa, the Middle East and the
emergence of a vocal sector in the Jewish community that is much
more politically conservative. The majority of American Jewry fell
into silence and acquiescence. Now it is time to rebuild those
coalitions to move forward together.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Pollack, a professor of biology at Columbia University
and the president of the Jewish Campus Life Fund, who described
himself as ``probably the only member of B'nai Jeshurun to know
Reverend Butts longer than I know my own rabbis,'' seemed
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Reverend Butts 15 years ago when I was the dean at
Columbia College and he was the mediator to end the blockade of
Hamilton Hall protesting the investment in South Africa,'' he
recalled. ``This is not merely a political event between blacks and
Jews, but is a coming together of serious Jews and serious
Christians. This morning is a statement of shared commitment.''

 EDITORIAL: AN ALMOST-SUPER SUNDAY  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 18:
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl Sunday, in two weeks, will have to summon up some
heavy-duty drama to match Sunday's conference finals, which
produced one big upset and two tense, competitive games. Sadly for
New York fans, the Jets' remarkable season came to an end with a
23-10 loss to the Broncos on a cold, windy afternoon in Denver.
Repeated turnovers _ fumbles, a botched kickoff return, two
interceptions _ destroyed whatever hopes they had of reaching their
first Super Bowl in 30 years. The Jets needed a mistake-free game
to beat last year's Super Bowl champions, and they did not deliver.
</P>
<P>
   What they did deliver was a courageous defensive game and an
honorable performance under difficult conditions by Vinny
Testaverde, their quarterback. The Jets' running game disappeared,
so Testaverde threw, passing for more than 300 yards. Neither
interception was completely his fault. As for the defense, it held
the Broncos scoreless in the first half, a remarkable achievement
against a team that outscored its opponents 207-74 in the first
half in its games earlier this season. Indeed, a field goal and a
touchdown following a blocked punt gave the Jets an improbable 10-0
lead early in the second half. But it was only a matter of time
before John Elway, the Denver quarterback, and Terrell Davis, the
Broncos' magnificent running back, got their acts together. When
they did, the Jets were done.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first game, between the Atlanta Falcons and the
heavily favored Minnesota Vikings, came down to two kickers, one
named Anderson and the other Andersen, and the guy with an ``e'' in
his name was one kick better. Minnesota's Gary Anderson, who had
not missed a field goal all year, pulled one to the left late in
the fourth quarter that almost surely would have have put the game
out of reach. With 3:22 left in overtime, Morten Andersen was
successful on a virtually identical kick to give the Falcons a
30-27 victory and their first conference championship in team
history. This was a superb matchup. The Falcons kept Minnesota's
awesome passing attack under reasonable control, and gave their own
quarterback, Chris Chandler, time to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are the sixth team in the last decade for the
33-year-old Chandler, who played much of the final quarter on an
injured knee. He was one of three aging re-treads on view Sunday.
The others were two 35-year-olds, Testaverde and Randall
Cunningham, who came out of retirement and off the bench and
performed magically for the Vikings all season.
</P>
<P>
   But the oldest and best of all of them is Elway who, at 38, is
likely to retire after the Super Bowl. The oddsmakers say he will
go out a winner. As John Glenn demonstrated in a wholly different
context, age doesn't mean that you can't repeat the past.  &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 18:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants to increase military spending by $110
billion over the next six years, the first significant increase in
the defense budget since Ronald Reagan's Cold War buildup of the
mid-1980s. Congressional Republicans want to spend even more. But
soaring spending is unnecessary to assure that America's armed
forces remain strong, decently paid and appropriately equipped for
the battlefields of the 21st century. Most of what the Pentagon
legitimately needs can be paid for by trimming pork from
acquisition programs, closing unneeded bases and reducing America's
nuclear arsenal from excessive Cold War levels.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, Clinton will request $269 billion. That is $4
billion more than he originally planned to seek. But he will also
let the Pentagon retain and spend an additional $8 billion in
savings from lower than expected inflation. Although a detailed
breakdown is not yet available, the White House has already
indicated that $2.5 billion will go for well-deserved pay and
pension increases, an additional $2 billion will support
peacekeeping in Bosnia and most of the remainder will be used for
spare parts and recruiting. In the five following years, most of
the new spending will be for new weapons programs, including $7
billion to be set aside for possible later construction of a
limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In the future smart weapons will shape the battlefield and
defense priorities will include shielding vulnerable computer and
telecommunications networks and protecting civilians from
biological and chemical attack. Unfortunately, much of the new
money Clinton seeks will go to advanced fighter aircraft and
nuclear attack submarines, areas where the United States is already
far ahead of any prospective foe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 balanced-budget agreement, any increase in
defense spending must be paid for by tax increases or reductions in
domestic programs. The White House hopes to get some defense money
from a new cigarette tax. But if the Republicans approve such a
tax, the money should be used for health programs. Meanwhile, the
administration has failed to identify any domestic programs it will
cut. Some compensating savings will have to be found, and the first
place to look should be elsewhere in the defense budget. New
weapons spending should be cut back. America does not need three
separate advanced fighter plane programs. Two would be more than
enough. The production of additional attack submarines, which serve
no current military need, could be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has blocked two more rounds of base closings proposed
by the Pentagon that could save as much as $2 billion a year.
Legislators also shamelessly fatten defense budgets to benefit home
districts, last year adding $5 billion for weapons, research and
military construction the Pentagon had not requested.
</P>
<P>
   Further savings can be achieved by reducing America's nuclear
arsenal to the target level of 2,500 warheads Washington seeks in
the next arms reduction agreement with Russia. Even without a
treaty, financial pressures will lead Russia to match America's
cuts. Together, these savings could finance more than half of the
increased spending Clinton is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold-War world has not turned out to be as peaceful as
Americans originally hoped and the United States needs to maintain
a strong and ready military. But it should do so by reallocating
existing defense spending, not by raiding already threadbare
domestic spending programs.

 EDITORIAL: MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S AMERICA  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 18:
</P>
<P>
   For many young Americans, the heroic life and tragic death of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are historical artifacts from
the turbulent 1960s, distant chapters in the multi-volume history
of the American experiment. In the decades since then, the ranks of
those with vivid memories of the human rights struggle King waged
in the South and up North have thinned. Yet neither of these
circumstances should nudge Americans toward allowing each year's
observance of his birthday to morph into another three-day get-away
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's religious ceremonies and commemorative speeches have
value in and of themselves. But in the long run, it is more
important for Americans of all classes, colors and creeds to
recommit themselves to King's unfinished human rights agenda. From
Jasper, Texas, where a black man was dragged to death behind a
pickup truck to the abyss between whites and blacks in income and
wealth, one does not have to look far to find the damage done by
intolerance and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible to divine how King would assess these United
States in 1999. Yet his words remind us that continuing to inch
toward a colorblind, equitable society requires so much more than
court rulings and laws. In a 1968 essay, published posthumously and
entitled ``A Testament of Hope,'' he dissected the riddle that
bedevils American society to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the issue of equality still so far from solution in
America, a nation that professes itself to be democratic,
inventive, hospitable to new ideas, rich, productive and awesomely
powerful?'' King asked. ``The problem is so tenacious because,
despite its virtues and attributes, America is deeply racist and
its democracy is flawed both economically and socially. All too
many Americans believe justice will unfold painlessly or that its
absence for black people will be tolerated tranquilly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh evidence of the persistence of racism is visible in the
predicament of Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss. The Senate majority leader
has fumbled numerous opportunities to clarify his links to the
white separatist group called the Council of Conservative Citizens.
Rather than apologize for giving speeches to a racist organization
or explain why he allowed the Mississippi group to use his name, he
chose the path of obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Lott said he had ``no firsthand knowledge''
of the CCC's thinly veiled white supremacist agenda. Lott's uncle,
Arnie Watson, said otherwise. Watson told The Times' John Kifner
last week that his nephew, the senator, was ``an honorary member''
of the group and had spoken at its meetings. Others with ties to
this group include Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi and Sen. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, both Republicans. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
has also been criticized for speaking before the group.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of questions, Lott released a statement that
broadly condemned bigotry, declaring, ``I have made my condemnation
of the white supremacist and racist view of this group, or any
group, clear. . . .'' His shifting explanations suggest that he
knew it was wrong to appear before the group, but did so to curry
favor and political support. To preserve respect for his office,
Lott needs to repudiate the CCC, a direct descendant of the
Citizens Councils that opposed the Supreme Court's 1954 school
desegregation decision. Until he does so, he will inevitably raise
questions about his fairness in leading the U.S. Senate, an
institution that ought to be wholeheartedly committed to Martin
Luther King's unfinished agenda.

DAVID W. BELIN, WARREN COMMISSION LAWYER, DIES AT 70
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn., Iowa, Fla., Calif., Mich., Ariz., Md., England,
Australia)  (ko) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David W. Belin, a lawyer for the Warren Commission, which
investigated the Kennedy assassination, and for the Rockefeller
Commission, which looked at Central Intelligence Agency activities,
died Sunday at St. Mary's Hospital of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn. He was 70 and lived in Windsor Heights, Iowa, and in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was head injuries sustained in a fall in his hotel
room in Rochester, where he had gone for his annual physical
checkup at the Mayo Clinic, said Michael Gartner, the editor of The
Tribune in Ames, Iowa. After the fall, Belin was in a coma for 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   Belin (pronounced BELL-in) was a co-owner of The Tribune with
Gartner, a former president of NBC News, and of other Midwestern
publications. At his death, he was the senior partner in the Des
Moines law firm Belin Lamson McCormick Zumbach Flynn. He worked in
various areas of the law, including corporate and estate law and
litigation. In New York, he served as an adviser to wealthy
families.
</P>
<P>
   He was described, in an editorial written for Monday's issue of
The Tribune, as ``a moderate Republican who had no use for the far
right of his party or the far left of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Belin was appointed by Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1964 to be
assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, which was created by
executive order of President Lyndon B. Johnson and given broad
powers to investigate the assassination of President John Kennedy
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Belin concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had worked entirely on
his own as the president's assassin, and the commission's main
finding was that speculation that conspirators or government
elements had involved in the killing was false. In its final
report, the commission affirmed that Oswald had acted on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Belin defended his work against those who
criticized the investigation of Kennedy's death, and his writings
included two books about the assassination. The truth, he liked to
say, was all that had been sought by the commission, and he
remained adamant in his conviction that the truth had indeed been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1988, Belin
declared: ``The truth is that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman
who murdered President John F. Kennedy and Dallas Police Officer J.
D. Tippit on that tragic Friday afternoon in Dallas.'' But he went
on to acknowledge that, as he put it, ``25 years after the event, a
majority of the American public does not believe the truth. Rather,
polls have shown that most Americans believe President Kennedy was
assassinated as an outgrowth of a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Belin was appointed by President Gerald Ford, who had
been a member of the Warren Commission, to be executive director of
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's Commission on CIA Activities
Within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While serving on the commission's staff, Belin learned of
extensive government plots to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro. He
proposed a congressional investigation to examine ``whether or not
there is any credible evidence of a foreign conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warren Commission found none,'' he said, ``but the Warren
Commission did not have any information concerning the CIA
assassination plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Around that time a Senate select committee issued a 347-page
report declaring that U.S. officials had ``instigated'' plots to
kill two foreign leaders and had known about or supported the
overthrow of three others that had resulted in their deaths. The
report found no evidence that the CIA had carried out any
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Commission report found that on the day Kennedy
was killed, the CIA was equipping an operative, code-named Am/Lash,
with a poison pen device to kill Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Belin was involved in various nonprofit and
business activities. He was involved as an investor, along with Dow
Jones &AMP; Co., in an unsuccessful bid for the purchase of the Des
Moines Register and Tribune Co. in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active for many years in Jewish community
activities. He established the Jewish Outreach Institute in 1987
after serving as chairman of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations' outreach commission.
</P>
<P>
   Belin was born in Washington and raised largely in Sioux City,
Iowa. After serving in the Army in Korea and Japan, he received a
bachelor's degree in 1951, a master's degree in business in 1953
and a law degree in 1954, all from the University of Michigan. He
began practicing law in Des Moines in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He married Constance Newman in 1952. She died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Belin is survived by his wife, Barbara Ross Belin, whom he
married in 1992; three sons, Jonathan, of Pembroke Pines, Fla.,
James, of Phoenix, and Thomas, of Santa Monica, Calif.; two
daughters, Joy Belin of Chevy Chase, Md., and Laura Belin of
London; one grandchild; a stepson, Lee Ross of Sydney, Australia;
and a stepdaughter, Jenifer Ross Schumacher of Tarrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While Belin lay in a coma in his last days, a friend, visiting
him, sought to appraise how ill he really was. He held Belin's
hand, watched his face hopefully and, after a preliminary remark,
said, ``David, I think there was a conspiracy to kill John F.
Kennedy.'' The friend was grieved when, for once, Belin gave no
rebuttal.

JAMES GIFFORD, 56, A SPOKESMAN FOR BUSINESS AND CHARITY GROUPS

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Priest Gifford, a political strategist,
spokesman and lobbyist for New York businesses and institutions,
died in Manhattan on Jan. 9. He was 56 and lived on the East Side.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a heart attack while on a midtown shopping trip,
said Evangeline Binder, vice president of Hudson Strategies Inc.
Dr. Gifford, its president, founded the company last year. It
represented businesses and other clients in their dealings with New
York City and New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Clients who sought his expertise in public policy included the
Chase Manhattan Bank, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Trinity Church
and the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, of which he
was a founding board member. The committee, formed in 1983, is a
consortium of more than 800 nonprofit organizations; he sat on
several of their boards.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former executive vice president of the New York Chamber
of Commerce and Industry as well as the New York City Partnership,
a business alliance affiliated with it. He held leading posts in
both organizations from 1983 to 1996, acting as lobbyist and chief
spokesman before city, state and Federal offices.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford was born in Mechanicsburg, Pa. He graduated in 1963 from
Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and received his M.A. (1965) and
Ph.D. (1970) degrees in political science and public administration
at Columbia University. He taught political science at the State
University at Stony Brook, Jersey City State College and Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty of City University's John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in 1970, rising to acting chairman of the
department of government. In 1978, Frank J. Macchiarola, Chancellor
of the New York City Board of Education, named him a special
assistant. He earned his spurs as a lobbyist and spokesman while
serving as the board's legislative representative from 1978 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he was chairman of the New York City Youth
Board; a trustee of Sailors' Snug Harbor, a seamen's retirement
home; director of the New York Business Group on Health, and
co-chairman of the New York City Human Services Action Group
Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Judith Neunzig of Bethlehem, Pa.,
and his wife, Karen Gifford of Manhattan, from whom he was
separated.

BRONCOS OUST JETS, PARCELLS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ John Elway thanked the wrong people when he grabbed the
microphone after Sunday's AFC Championship Game and told the Bronco
fans, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   But, John, what about the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Denver Broncos are in the Super Bowl
after the New York Jets gift-wrapped a 23-10 victory for the home
team with six _ count 'em _ six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had too many turnovers,'' said Jets coach Bill
Parcells, reaffirming what he told the team before the game: ``Turn
it over and we will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had been billed as a battle of big offenses, pitting
the top two offenses in the AFC. But defense was the story.
</P>
<P>
   Although Broncos star Terrell Davis ran well, and Elway, after a
first-half funk, played better down the stretch, the Denver defense
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, going against an offense some considered the best
in the NFL over the second half of the season, gave up only one
touchdown, and that came on a ``drive'' that covered all of 1 yard.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 3-0 lead on a 32-yard field goal by John Hall
that ended the first half, the Jets moved ahead, 10-0, three
minutes into the third quarter after taking over at the Denver
1-yard line following a blocked punt. Curtis Martin made it a
touchdown with a run over left tackle on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were flying high at this point. In addition to the
lead, they had a strong wind at their backs and had silenced the
normally thunderous crowd of 78,000.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly the game swung to Denver on a string of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   New York self-destructed over the final 25 minutes, and Denver
had the poise to convert the Jets' gifts into points.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was a dismal 4 for 14 passing in the first half for just
33 yards. He opened the game 0 for 5. In contrast, New York's Vinny
Testaverde hit his first 13 passes, but got nothing out of it
because his teammates couldn't hold onto the ball.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 minutes left in the third, Elway got the ball on his 36.
He took his team out of the huddle, and there was obvious
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lined up on the wrong side,'' said Denver's Rod Smith. ``I
was supposed to be where Ed McCaffrey was. Time was running out. So
John told us to stay where we were. So we swapped assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Jets who wound up confused. McCaffrey ran
straight down the middle and no one covered him.
</P>
<P>
   Elway hit McCaffrey in stride for a 47-yard gain, more than he
had thrown for in the entire game to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, he threw over the middle to Howard Griffith for
11 yards and a score. The Jets still led, 10-7, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of some Broncos, the key play came next. The Denver
kickoff got caught in the wind, it landed untouched, and the
Broncos recovered on the New York 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest play,'' said Denver linebacker Bill
Romanowski. ``They seemed to be stunned after that. They never
recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Elam later kicked a 44-yard bomb into the tough wind to
tie the game, 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Broncos from there on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed up on defense,'' said linebacker Glenn Cadrez. ``We
started rushing just three men and dropped eight back into
coverage. This seemed to confuse them. We stopped their running
game completely and we made them throw the ball short.''
</P>
<P>
   New York ran for just 14 yards on 13 carries, all by Martin.
Before the third quarter was over, Denver would run 10 more points
to take a 20-10 lead, and with the way the Broncos' defense has
been playing, that was all they needed.
</P>
<P>
   With three minutes left in the third, Elam somehow nailed a
48-yard field goal into the blistering wind to put his team ahead,
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Denver put the game away as Davis bolted 31
yards off left tackle for a touchdown that highlighted his
32-carry, 167-yard day.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis did not dominate this game. And Elway was only 13
for 34, as the Jets deflected a half-dozen passes and sacked him
three times.
</P>
<P>
   But with New York going nowhere on the ground, Testaverde had to
go it alone. He threw for 250 yards in the first half, and had just
3 points to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Keith Byars, both former Patriots, surrendered the
first two of four fumbles. Testaverde hit on 31 of 52 passes, but
threw two fourth-quarter interceptions, one when his reciever,
Wayne Chrebet fell down, another when the receiver ran the wrong
route.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most meaningful stat was the turnovers: Jets 6,
Broncos 0. The Jets, who had fumbled the ball away only 11 times in
17 games, did it four times Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets defense played extremely well, the Broncos
defense was better.
</P>
<P>
   It bent, but never collapsed. Denver kept its poise, and it paid
off with its record sixth Super Bowl trip.

Falcons outlast Vikings, earn trip to Miami
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They were 14-2 in the regular season but didn't
earn the home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They knocked off perennial power San Francisco in the divisional
round but still weren't thought to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   They had won 10 consecutive games but entered the NFC
Championship Game as 11-point underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons proved everyone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime conference-championship game since coach
Dan Reeves' Broncos beat Cleveland in the January 1987 AFC title
game, Reeves' Falcons (16-2) knocked off the Minnesota Vikings
30-27 for Atlanta's first trip to the Super Bowl. Minnesota, only
the third team to finish the regular season 15-1, becomes the first
of the three not to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the best-kept secret in the NFL,'' Atlanta free safety
Eugene Robinson said. ``I looked at ESPN, Fox, CBS, TNT, Fox Sports
South, Fox Sports West and nobody thought we could win the game.
But there's something special about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the game turned on a missed field goal by the
Vikings' Gary Anderson. He had already connected on kicks of 29 and
35 yards, improving his streak to 42 straight field goals this
season. But with Minnesota leading 27-20 with 2:07 remaining,
Anderson's 38-yard attempt was wide left, and the Falcons were
still in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Though he didn't get credit, Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan
said he got to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nicked the ball,'' Buchanan said. ``I think he still hooked
it enough trying to get away from the pressure on the left side. I
was coming around the left side, and it went wide left. If he would
have kicked it straight, it would have been clearly blocked because
I got right through. Then when I got to the sideline, I thought,
`Wow, that was my man right there. He had a perfect season. He's a
Pro Bowl guy.' Man showed us a little favor right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several big plays. The Falcons got the ball back
needing a 71-yard touchdown drive to tie the score. Quarterback
Chris Chandler completed three straight passes, including a
29-yarder to Ronnie Harris, his only catch of the game. Finding an
open lane, Chandler scrambled to pick up nine yards and reach the
Vikings' 22. Jamal Anderson, who had been contained most of the
afternoon, picked up six yards to the Minnesota 16, and Chandler
then threw a bullet to Terance Mathis in the end zone to tie the
score at 27 with 49 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum swung back and forth in overtime. With less than
nine minutes remaining, Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham
threw a long pass to rookie Pro Bowler Randy Moss near the Atlanta
16 on third-and-10. Robinson knocked it down to get the ball back
for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   On Atlanta's second OT possession after it stopped Minnesota
twice, Chandler connected with tight end O.J. Santiago for pickups
of 15 and 26 yards. The Falcons, who started on their nine-yard
line, ran nine plays to the Minnesota 21 before bringing Morten
Andersen onto the field. Andersen connected on a 38-yarder to send
the Falcons to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't intimidate us,'' Santiago said. ``Nobody has done it
all year long. We are 14-2 (during the regular season). I don't
understand why people don't realize we were 14-2. You don't go 14-2
being scared, being intimidated. You go 14-2 with consistent play
on offense, defense and special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who set an NFL scoring record this season, were
known for big plays. But with the exception of a 31-yard touchdown
pass to Moss on their first possession, there were none longer than
17 yards. The Falcons, meanwhile, had a 70-yard pass from Chandler
to Tony Martin to set up an Andersen field goal early in the fourth
quarter. There were four other plays of 19 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Vikings were able to contain the league's
second-leading rusher, holding Jamal Anderson to 67 yards, Chandler
took to the air, passing for 340 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been talk in the paper, we kind of heard it all
week, that `If you stop the running game, stop Jamal, we're going
to beat the Falcons,''' Chandler said. ``I wanted to show
everybody, especially the Vikings, that we can throw the ball as
well as you guys can. We can make a lot of big plays throwing the
ball. To overlook our passing game is a mistake. We were very
effective throwing the ball today.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to be, especially after Minnesota took a 20-7 lead.
Atlanta scored on its opening possession as Anderson caught a
five-yard pass from Chandler. The Vikings then scored 20 unanswered
points, in part the result of two Atlanta fumbles. The first, by
running back Harold Green, was recovered at the Minnesota 40 and
eventually led to a field goal early in the second quarter. The
next, a fumble by Santiago on Atlanta's first play of the ensuing
possession, turned into a Minnesota touchdown as Cunningham plunged
the final yard to cap a six-play, 33-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cut that lead to six before halftime when Chuck Smith
forced a fumble with a sack on Cunningham and Travis Hall recovered
the ball. The Falcons got the ball at the Minnesota 14, and
Chandler connected with Mathis for a one-play touchdown drive to
cut the deficit to 20-14 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings scored only once more, on a five-yard pass to
Matthew Hatchette with 13:41 remaining in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta came here and played a perfect game,'' Moss said.
``They were down, and they stuck with their game plan. I think we
got a little rattled in the end, and we couldn't make anything
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the Super Bowl pits Reeves against the franchise he
took there three times. And for a guy five weeks removed from
quadruple-bypass surgery, life doesn't get much more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stand today, my heart's got to be in great shape,''
Reeves said. ``It can't be much harder. The only thing harder will
be dancing in downtown Atlanta the `Dirty Bird.' That's not going
to be a pretty sight.''

FABRIZIO DE ANDRE, SONGWRITER OF ITALIAN PROTEST MOVEMENT, 58

<P>
   ROME _ Fabrizio De Andre, one of Italy's most popular singers
and songwriters, died on Jan. 11 in a hospital in Milan where he
was admitted in December. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to Italian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Known in Italy as the ``poet of music,'' De Andre became popular
during the mid-1960s when his songs of rebellion and social justice
struck a note with Italian youth.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity rocketed after his songs were adopted as the
anthems of the protest movement that swept Italy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leonard Cohen, De Andre was recognized foremost as a poet
who put his own words to music. In Italy he developed the idea of
the concept album with songs revolving around one theme.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most popular works were ``The Good News,'' based upon
the Apocrypha, and a 1971 album based on ``Spoon River Anthology''
by Edgar Lee Masters.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the first Italian performers to integrate his
songs with musical influences from different ethnic backgrounds,
including those of native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrizio De Andre was born in Genoa in 1940. His first musical
hit came in 1965 when Mina, a popular Italian singer, recorded a
best-selling version of his ``Canzone di Marinella.'' Best-selling
albums followed, weaving De Andre's compelling lyrics and his
multifaceted musical vision into songs that gave voice to the angst
of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Eclectic in his choice of subjects, from big-hearted prostitutes
to disaffected civil servants, his music reflected a wide range of
influences.
</P>
<P>
   De Andre lived for many years in Sardinia, even after he was
kidnapped by political extremists and held hostage with his wife,
Dori Ghezzi, for more than three months in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, a son, Cristiano, and a daughter,
Luvi.

TETHERED SATELLITES, DIES AT 74 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Italy, Russia, Mass., Texas ) DR. MARIO GROSSI, DEVELOPER OF By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mario Dario Grossi, a radio physicist and engineer who
developed the concept of tethered satellites as well as the
hardware that made such free-flying space maneuvers possible, died
Jan. 11 at Boston Medical Center in Boston. He was 74 and lived in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with a colleague, Dr. Giuseppe Colombo, Grossi did much
of his work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
where he had an office to work on the tether project. Until 1995 he
was also a consulting engineer for the Raytheon Company in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Grossi first approached the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration with the idea of tethered space orbiters in 1972. He
and Colombo of the University of Padua studied and tested its
feasibility, and NASA issued the contract to build a system in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   It took another 10 years for the space shuttle Atlantis to put
the tether to the real test in space, in July 1992, and it worked.
The shuttle crew reeled out a half-ton satellite of the Italian
Space Agency dangling on a spaghetti-thin cord 12 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was to place the spherical research satellite, five
feet in diameter, high above the shuttle. An Italian
astronaut-engineer, Franco Malerba, oversaw the operation from the
shuttle cabin as the sphere flew away and, hours later, was reeled
back in.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its scientific harvest, the successful flight
provided data on how long wire tethers could be used in building
space stations and operating instrument-laden satellites far from
the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Grossi was born in Tuscany. He received a doctorate in
radio engineering at the University of Pisa in 1948 and a degree in
microwave physics at a center in Florence. He worked as a research
and design engineer in Italy before he joined Raytheon's Equipment
and Systems Division in 1958 as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he also became associated with the Smithsonian
Observatory and accepted the position of research associate at the
Harvard College Observatory. His investigations covered many areas
in radio physics and engineering and contributed to various NASA
projects besides the tethering.
</P>
<P>
   Grossi also engaged in humanitarian work, like helping dissident
Jewish scientists leave the Soviet Union. In 1996, the president of
Italy presented him with the country's Gold Medal for the
Betterment of Science and Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Grossi's survivors include his wife of 42 years, Adele Sangi
Grossi; a daughter, Marina Grossi of Boston; a son, Fabio, of
Grapevine, Texas, and two granddaughters.

ELWAY LEAVES HIS FANS THE RIGHT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ His numbers were not like the old days, and neither was
his performance or his team's need for him, but in the end John
Elway left Mile High Stadium the way he should have Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He left after making the play, and if he never plays another
game in Denver, isn't that how he should be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the final play this time. It wasn't the game-winning
play or the most dramatic play or the fourth-quarter comeback play
he's made 47 times in his career. Certainly it wasn't the only play
because, frankly, running back Terrell Davis made most of those in
Denver's 23-10 AFC Championship Game victory, but Elway made a
winner's play.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was what he has been doing for 16 years in Denver.
He made the play that righted his team when it seemed like it might
sink under the relentless defensive assault of the New York Jets.
He saved the day if not the game. He was, for a few brief minutes
at least, once again ELWAY.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had just gone ahead, 10-0, with 11:56 to play in the
third quarter after having conspired with a stiff wind to hold
Elway to 33 yards passing and the Broncos to no points in the first
half, and now people began to mumble about seeing a repeat of the
Falcons' upset of the Vikings in the NFC title game that was less
than two hours old.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that moment that Elway became ELWAY. He was no longer
a little bit older and a little bit slower and a little less able
to throw any pass he wanted. Right then, when the Broncos needed
him more than anyone else, he fired footballs into the air and his
team was back in business.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos came out of the huddle with the ball on the 36-yard
line barely 40 seconds after the Jets' Curtis Martin had scored a
1-yard touchdown to take a 10-0 lead and Elway noticed his two
receivers had lined up on the opposite sides of where they should
have been. Rod Smith gave Elway a hand signal that he knew what
route to run and understood the mixup but Ed McCaffrey was
frantically running toward him, baffled and panicked.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached, Elway calmly whispered, ``A post,'' meaning
his assignment was now to run the route Smith originally had been
assigned. As he did, Elway took the snap, gave a perfect play fake
that froze the defense, and hit a wide open McCaffrey downfield
with a 47-yard pass to the Jet 17. Two plays later he threw an
11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith that may well be his last
in Denver if he follows through on what many here believe is a plan
to retire after Super Bowl XXXIII, and the Broncos were in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later he would complete a 10-yard throw on third-and-15
that got Denver just close enough for Jason Elam to kick a
game-tying 44-yard field goal, and the world was safe for Terrell
Davis once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big momentum swing for our team, being down 10-0,''
said Denver coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Davis tore the Jets apart. He rushed for 167 yards
and scored a 31-yard touchdown that broke the Jets' spirit as the
third quarter ended and made Elway a footnote in his sixth and
possibly final AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you never can be a footnote in Denver if you are Elway, even
at a time in his career when he no longer carries the Broncos but
instead vies for Best Supporting Actor nominations to Davis's
starring role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell is always the most important thing to have in the
backfield,'' Elway said, knowing that for years that would have
been a lie. For years the Broncos never would have won a big game
in which John Elway was 13 of 34 for 173 yards and was sacked three
times.
</P>
<P>
   For years Elway was the Broncos and he relentlessly took them to
three Super Bowls on the strength of his arm and legs alone and
lost them all, only winning on his fourth try last season because
Davis was there to pound out a victory over the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Elway understands this change, but what he also understood after
everything was done if not quite yet all said was that something
more was required of him before he left Mile High one last time
than to throw three critical passes. Something he didn't
particularly feel comfortable doing but was being urged to by
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over. They were returning to the Super Bowl. It was
done. So now, Shanahan told him, it was time for a victory lap. Not
the Broncos, just the soul of the Broncos. Just ELWAY.
</P>
<P>
   And so he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional thing for John,'' Shanahan said. ``He got
to take that lap around the field. I urged him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing he did because otherwise Elway would have
left with his thumb pointing to the sky after having told the fans
he loved them at the presentation of the Lamar Hunt Trophy and
nothing more. But this moment, if it was his last in Elway City,
required something more, and the fact that he took the lap may have
spoken louder about his retirement plans than all his pubic
insistences that he has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have been great to me for 16 years but, I don't know,
I didn't feel comfortable (doing a victory lap) but now I'm glad I
did it,'' Elway said. ``When you're here, you're focused on the
game. It was nice to be able to focus on the fans. It was so great
to see how happy the fans were.''
</P>
<P>
   They were happy about everything but the prospect of Elway not
returning, and they let him know it as he rounded the field.
</P>
<P>
   They continued their lobbying efforts during his postgame news
conference outside the locker room and every shout of encouragement
made Elway smile that smile that still makes him look like a kid
despite the age lines around his eyes. In the end, those pleadings
will not deter him, just as no defense ever did. He will do what he
wants, as he has for most of his career with so many defenses
massed to prevent him.
</P>
<P>
   He will also do what he believes is right, as he did when he
told McCaffrey to run the deep post, then found him with what may
be his last long ball at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But if he goes, John Elway will have to make one last stop at
the Super Bowl first, a place he's been to five times now. If he
wins, he will be among the few to do it twice in a row, joining
Terry Bradshaw and Bart Starr and Joe Montana. And if he doesn't,
does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Not to Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has done so much for Denver,'' the Broncos tight end
said. ``He has more wins than any other quarterback. He'll be
starting his fifth Super Bowl. When you think Denver you don't
think skiing. You think John Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for just a few short minutes when his team needed him
most, he reminded anyone who might have forgotten why that is.

FATE GIVES ANDERSON SWIFT KICK 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ This was right out of Sophocles or Aeschylus or
whomever happens to be your favorite Greek playwright.
</P>
<P>
   It was all about gods and fates and mortality. The moral of the
story: do away with perfection before it comes back to bite you in
the you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's NFC Championship Game, Minnesota Vikings
kicker Gary Anderson was perfect for the entire season. He had been
good on 37 of 37 field goal attempts (35 in the regular season and
two last week in a 41-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals). He
had been 59 for 59 on extra points.
</P>
<P>
   That's why any intelligent Vikings fan should have been very
nervous when Mr. Anderson set up for a 38-yard field goal that
would have given the team a 10-point lead over the Atlanta Falcons
with 2:07 remaining in the fourth quarter. This is the NFL, and you
just don't do perfect in the NFL. You can be almost perfect. You
can be real good. You can be real, real good. But in the history of
this league no one ever has gone through a season without missing
at least one field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   To get this far in the season without a miss is to thumb your
nose at the fates. And so when the snap came from center Mike
Morris to holder Mitch Berger it was ball down, kick up and _ OH
NO! IT'S A HALF-FOOT WIDE TO THE LEFT!
</P>
<P>
   Like anyone should have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest. You know that the feisty Falcons drove 71
yards in eight plays, tying the score at 27 on a 16-yard Chris
Chandler-to-Terance Mathis pass with 57 seconds left and that in
overtime Atlanta's Morten Andersen, no stranger to late-game
boo-boos (ask anyone in Jacksonville), nailed a field goal from the
exact same spot on the field to give Atlanta a 30-27 win and send
the Falcons to the Super Bowl for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   The men in question have been in just about every situation
during their lengthy careers. Anderson, a native of South Africa,
is 39. This is his 17th year in the league. Andersen, 38, is
likewise in his 17th year. Each has had a Hall of Fame career. That
such a high-stakes game should come down to a matter of which one
could make a 38-yard field goal is, well, I really don't know.
Football, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw it,'' said Anderson. ``I was buried under a couple
of guys. Obviously, there are no words to describe how disappointed
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not exactly Anderson's happiest day in football, but he
faced the media hordes like a professional and a gentleman. He must
have used variations on the word ``disappoint'' a half-dozen times
in the span of two minutes, but what else could he say? He never
has wanted to make a field goal more in his life. A 10-point lead
with two minutes and change left would have put the game away. Now
the Vikings are going home.
</P>
<P>
   He swore he never had dwelled on the fact that he had been
perfect. He certainly never had entertained notions of missing an
unneeded field goal on purpose merely to satisfy the gods. ``It's
just part of field goal kicking,'' he said with a sigh. ``It's the
way kicking goes. You try to approach every kick the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I feel bad for him,'' said Andersen. ``I know how
he must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen also claims he hadn't thought much about the
ramifications of his counterpart's perfect status entering the
game. To Morten Andersen, what Gary Anderson was doing made perfect
sense, if you'll pardon the expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed my mind (that Anderson was due for a miss),''
claimed Andersen. ``Gary is just so solid.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Andersen, whose own 38-yarder was right down Broadway, he
said he was very calm. ``I was just waiting patiently for my
chance,'' he said. ``You just have to let these situations come to
you. You can't force anything. I find that patience really helps in
these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now then. Can we accurately say that Gary Anderson lost the game
for his team? Certainly not. He could have clinched it; that's all.
The Minnesota defense had to hold in what was Atlanta's most
important possession, and it didn't. The most famous offense in the
league scored 7 points in the second half. As in any such game,
there were the usual litanies of shouldas and couldas and wouldas,
of turnovers and dropped passes and missed assignments and
inefficient tackling and all sorts of human imperfections that both
preceded and followed Gary Anderson's brush with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   And still ... it was set up for the perfect kicker to deliver
the goods. He was 23 for 23 outside the 30 during the regular
season. He was kicking, as usual, on turf, the kicker's best
friend. He had his usual snapper and his usual holder. He didn't
say anything about the snap or the hold being bad. He just ...
</P>
<P>
   Missed.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected him to miss _ on either side. I'm sure Atlanta
coach Dan Reeves figured his team's wonderful ride was over as
Anderson trotted onto the field. ``A guy who hadn't missed all year
missed and gave us a chance to win it,'' said the Falcons mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings won the toss at the start of overtime, and so most
everyone figured they would make a few first downs and Gary
Anderson would have a chance to redeem himself. Unfortunately, he's
still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall Cunningham came over and said, `Don't worry; you'll
get another chance,''' said Anderson. That was certainly a logical
assumption and a very good bet. But the best Minnesota could do in
the overtime was get to its 42. Gary Anderson is very good, but
neither he nor anyone else has a 75-yard field goal in him.
</P>
<P>
   You say life will go on, but Gary Anderson is 39. Was this his
final chance to be kicking in front of the entire nation on Super
Sunday? Very likely. ``That's why it's so disappointing,'' he said.
``We had such a great year. But that's what field goal kicking is
all about. You have to be a man about it. This is your job, to line
up and fire that field goal through. With the year we've had, not
to make it to the Super Bowl is bitterly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson made no excuses. He kicked the ball the way he
usually does, but this one time the ball went about a half-foot
wide. All it goes to show is that no one is perfect. Not now, not
ever.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't fool with the fates.

PANTHERS OBTAIN BURE IN A SEVEN-PLAYER TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pavel Bure refused to return to Vancouver this season and forced
the Canucks to trade him. The Rangers and the Islanders were among
the teams bidding for The Russian Rocket, one of the elite hockey
players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bure will play in New York twice this week, but not in a
home-team uniform. The 27-year-old right wing is scheduled to
appear at the Nassau Coliseum on Wednesday and in Madison Square
Garden on Thursday as a member of the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   They obtained Bure Sunday in a multiplayer deal that may be the
National Hockey League's most significant trade since Edmonton sent
Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fast and exciting, and he's a guy who gets points,'' said
Bryan Murray, general manager of the Panthers. ``It's something we
needed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were among the final teams contacted by Brian Burke,
the Vancouver general manager, before he concluded the trade. Burke
wanted the rookie center Manny Malhotra from the Rangers as part of
any package.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he asked the Rangers' general manager, Neil Smith:
``Is Malhotra definitely out of the question?'' Smith replied:
``He's definitely out.'' At that point, Burke told Smith, ``There
isn't much left to talk about.'' Even with Malhotra, Burke added,
the Rangers' package might not have been better than the Florida
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The most important player going from the Panthers to Vancouver
is Ed Jovanovski, 22, a big defenseman in his fourth season. Also
involved were center Dave Gagner, goalie Kevin Weekes and left wing
Mike Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Bret Hedican and Brad Ference join Bure in going from
the Canucks to the Panthers. In addition, the Canucks will get
Florida's first-round draft choice in either 1999 or 2000. When
that happens, the Panthers will get a third-round pick from
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Bure has been living in Moscow this season and working out with
a team there. The Panthers said he will not play in Monday's home
game against Buffalo but will report to the team Tuesday. Bure led
the Russian Olympic team to a silver medal last winter at Nagano,
Japan. In NHL play, he scored 51 goals and totaled 90 points over
all, tied for third in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had one year remaining on his contract, Bure refused
to report to the Canucks for his eighth season for reasons he has
not discussed publicly. He was to make $8 million this season.
Unless he signs an extension with the Panthers, Bure will be a
restricted, Group 2 free agent this summer. Jovanovski's contract
also is in its final season.
</P>
<P>
   A fast skater with a hard, accurate shot, Bure is one of the few
players in the 27-team league with the charisma to sell tickets at
home and on the road. By acquiring him, the Panthers could become a
threat to win the Southeast Division and contend in the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 15-15-11, the Panthers are second in their division,
four points behind Carolina. In the Eastern Conference, they are
tied for ninth place; eight teams from each conference make the
playoffs. Divisional winners get automatic berths.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said Sunday that Bure told him he resented the Canucks'
ownership and management for not backing him more vociferously when
people questioned Bure's back injury, and for accusing him of
threatening not to play in the 1994 Stanley Cup finals against the
Rangers unless the Canucks negotiated a new contract immediately.
Burke said he explained to Bure that the Canucks have different
owners and management now, but that did not sway him.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Burke talked to Mike Milbury, the coach and
general manager of the Islanders, about Zigmund Palffy, who was
without a contract and not playing at the time. Burke said he spoke
with Milbury again last week but nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks (14-23-5) are currently out of the playoff picture
under Coach Mike Keenan and captain Mark Messier, who led the
Rangers to the 1994 Cup. Burke said Sunday he is aware that Messier
might not be happy with the immediate returns in the deal. ``My
guess is he's not ecstatic,'' Burke said. But he added that he told
Messier that Messier is just a player, not a personnel director, in
his 20th season, with one year left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful of the clock ticking on Mess,'' Burke said. ``But
this is the best proposal we received short-term.'' &QL;

ATLANTA REACHES FIRST SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Long after Morten Andersen had hit a 38-yard field
goal to kick one of the most futile franchises in NFL history into
the grandest surprise of all for Dixie, the Super Bowl, Gary
Anderson still was sitting in the Vikings Lounge atop the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could have been from a wake. Friend after friend came
by to pat the Vikings kicker on the shoulder. Teammate after
teammate came by to whisper comforting words, quarterback Randall
Cunningham talking to Anderson at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just can't be words to describe the disappointment I'm
feeling,'' said Anderson, ``especially with the season we had.''
Then, when he was left alone, Anderson crossed his arms against his
chest and stared into the void.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons advanced to the Super Bowl two weeks hence
in Miami with a 30-27 win over the Vikings in overtime Sunday, a
game that may have been one for the ages. For sure, though, the
shocking loss by the 16-1 Vikings will heat the cold and brutal
winters of Minnesota with debate for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Anderson, the first NFL kicker to be perfect
during a season, missed a 38-yarder with little more than two
minutes to play, letting the Falcons come back and tie the game and
then win it in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Said exuberant Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, ``When Anderson
missed, I ran up up to Chris Chandler (the Atlanta quarterback) and
I said, `Chris, that's it, he missed it. Now we have a chance, now
you have a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if he makes that field goal, it was going to be
much, much harder for us to win,'' said Chandler of Anderson's miss
with Minnesota leading, 27-20. ``And when he missed it, the whole
sideline erupted as if we just won the game. It gave us a new
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler took over on his 29-yard line with 2:07 to play, and
moved the Falcons 71 yards, but not without a few frights. Such as
when he scrambled for 9 yards with 1:47 left, banged his knee, and
had to use a timeout he did not wish to use to limp to the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I banged the inside of my knee,'' he said. ``I'm sure all of
you have done it, where you hit that inside part of your knee and
it really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chandler stayed in the game, and a couple of plays later
fired a pass to the inside of the field toward Terance Mathis, a
pass virtually identical to one Mathis had dropped for a TD earlier
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried the exact same route where one of their guys had
gotten a hand on it,'' said Chandler of the ball that this time
went for a 16-yard score. ``They flushed me from my left and I
rolled to my right _ at that point, it was just schoolyard football
_ and I looked and saw Terance coming into the hole and I just
threw it as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' Andersen had to try the extra point for the tie
twice, the Vikings being offside the first time. Andersen was just
as good on his second try.
</P>
<P>
   With the Vikings tied at 27 with 57 seconds left, the true
shocker came next. Cunningham scrambled for 7 yards from his 20,
then threw incomplete on a bomb to Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, with 30 seconds left, only 40 or so yards from
field goal range, Vikings coach Dennis Green waved the white flag
for the rest of regulation time, instructing Cunningham to take a
knee. There was stunned silence in the Metrodome, and all
throughout football, as the best offense in the league decided not
to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why they took a knee then,'' said Atlanta
defensive lineman Chuck Smith. ``They were afraid, that's why. They
were afraid of me doing what I did just before the half, stripping
the ball from Cunningham.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Smith had turned the game around for his team in the
second quarter. The Vikings were leading, 20-7, and were on the
move when Smith cleanly beat star tackle Todd Steussie and caused
Cunningham to fumble at his 14. One play later, Chandler hit Mathis
for a TD and Atlanta was still breathing, trailing only 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down to 30 seconds, then you need to take two good
downs, and if you don't have a first down by then, then you'd
better move on and go the other way,'' said Green of his decision
to run out the clock. ``We had had troubles in protection schemes
and we had a couple of fumbles. We took two good shots at it and
hoped to get it done. We didn't. It did work to our favor. We
(received) the kick (in overtime), we got the return, but we just
didn't score with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green's decision not to go after the victory at the end of
regulation had sent a clear signal. ``They were saying they didn't
have to try and score then,'' said Robinson. ``They were saying
they just had to come out in OT and they'd score on our defense.
Well, they're not the first ones not to respect us, and they're not
the last ones who'll pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first drive in OT, Cunningham was short-arming his
passes. On Chandler's first drive in OT, he looked like a triplet
to Jake Plummer and Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Minnesota could get only two first downs despite
having its hands on the ball twice. Then, on Atlanta's second OT
chance, starting from its 9, Chandler was immense. Twice he found
tight end O.J. Santiago for huge gains, one a 15-yarder and the
next a 26-yarder on which Santiago beat linebacker Bobby Houston to
get it to the Vikings 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it personal when they said all they had to do was stop
the run,'' said Chandler, the son-in-law of former NFL great John
Brodie. ``I know we have a passing game, too, and you can't think
if you just stop Jamal Anderson you're going to beat us. So I had
more motivation, a little more zeal coming into this game. And
ending it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was so proud of the performance by the well-traveled
Chandler that he told his QB his effort ``ranks right up there with
any of the big-time quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, as Jamal Anderson toted the ball three straight times
into field goal position, the Vikings' Anderson kept pacing the
sideline. And when the Falcons' Andersen booted the ball, the
Metrodome suddenly was silent. So silent.

SINCE DOTTING THE I'S IS HARD, CAMPS MAY OPEN LATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought the National Basketball Association was
back in business, the league and the players' union are dueling
again.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides are continuing to work on putting the
terms of the new collective bargaining agreement into writing, but
a disagreement over a crucial economic issue now threatens to delay
the start of training camp and the free-agent signing period on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues still open,'' Jeffrey Mishkin, the
league's chief legal officer, said Sunday. ``We're trying to get it
done by Monday night, but I don't know if that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the league nor the union would give specifics, but
officials on both sides said the biggest stumbling block was over
the maximum length of contracts under the mid-level salary
exception.
</P>
<P>
   The exception starts at $1.75 million, rises to $2.25 million by
the third year and becomes whatever the average salary is in the
league in the fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   The union contends that the two sides agreed that mid-level
contracts could be signed for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   The league says the length of mid-level contracts was not
settled at the 12-hour negotiating session that saved the NBA
season from cancellation 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The management has proposed that players be able to sign a
contract for three years under the exception.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the other issues the two sides are still
haggling over:
</P>
<P>
   _ The definition of basketball-related income, which is split
between the league and the players.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sharing of television revenue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several conduct issues, including the details of a new
antidrug program.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout remains in effect until an agreement is signed,
meaning that training camps and the signing and trading period may
not begin until later this week.  &QL;

PREDATORS NO LONGER THE PREY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins are expected to break their three-game
winless streak when they meet Nashville Monday. In fact, nearly
every NHL team expects to end its misfortune or continue its good
fortune when it meets the expansion Predators.
</P>
<P>
   But that perception seems to be changing as Nashville remains in
playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a team loses to us, you would think the world ended
for them,'' Nashville coach Barry Trotz said Sunday. ``I'm upset
that teams think that way. We're no different than anyone else. Our
players look for respect. Every night we go out and we have to earn
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville has mostly achieved that, despite an occasional 8-0
loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philadelphia game (last Monday) was one of those nights
where they scored on every power-play shot,'' Trotz said. ``They
also scored twice in the last minute and a half when our goaltender
let in goals that shouldn't happen at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to break the Philadelphia trap and get some
two-on-ones, but we just couldn't convert. It was a long night, but
instead of beating ourselves up over it, we went over what we did
well and what we didn't do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to learn from every game and go on. If we had dwelled
on that game too long, it would have been a long year. Every second
day, we are preparing for a team we don't match up against, and we
have to rely on work ethic, good team play, good goaltending to
stay competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula has produced impressive wins over Detroit and
Phoenix recently, and Nashville's 34 points in 42 games has it in
third place in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Trotz and general manager Dave Poile emphasized ``character and
quickness'' in building the team. They brought in Tom Fitzgerald as
captain, drawing on his experience with Florida's expansion team in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sure what to expect,'' center Scott Walker said.
``Tom had been through it before and he told us that if we relied
on each other, expected a lot from each other, worked hard and
played hard, we would have a lot of fun. People would be willing to
give us a break if we gave an honest effort. It's not fun when you
are losing 8-0, but we've beaten some good teams and it's not like
we're sacrificial lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville has not been at full strength, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've been going with our No. 2 and 3 goaltenders
and with six or seven guys out of the lineup and we keep plodding
along and getting some wins,'' Trotz said. ``In the past, some
expansion teams would probably have crumbled, but we've stayed
together. Sometimes you have to look past the names on the jerseys.
Some players who have name value in the league are not much
different than the guys we have, who don't have the name value. You
might have never heard of them, but they do a great job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the playoff race and I don't think anybody expected
that. From Day 1, our expectations have been to be competitive on a
nightly basis, and so far we've attained that. Secondly, we wanted
to win on a consistent basis. Thirdly, we want to make the
playoffs. On the ice, we don't match up with any team. Every team
is more experienced, bigger, or they have more skill. There are not
a lot of areas we can say we're better. But we work hard and we've
gotten good goaltending and done the simple things.''

<P>
   DENVER _ With just under 12 minutes to play in the third quarter
Sunday, the Jets were ahead of the Denver Broncos, 10-0, and 75,482
orange zealots were sitting on their hands as the Broncos took over
on their 36-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the visitors' sideline, the Great White Tuna had to
be feeling pretty good. His defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick,
had taken Terrell Davis out of the game and the Jets were on the
brink of making their first trip to the Super Bowl in three
decades, just two years after going 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   Then it unraveled in a hellish hail of blown coverages, fumbles,
interceptions, and stupid mistakes. For Bill Parcells, it must have
felt a little like Desmond Howard Redux as the Broncos seized
control with a 20-point third-quarter blitz en route to a 23-10 AFC
Championship Game victory and a return ticket to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, Parcells looked like Humphrey Bogart playing Rick
Blaine _ standing on the train platform in Paris, rain streaming
off his hat as he waited for a woman who wasn't coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good team,'' the former Patriots coach said after
shaking the hand of Denver head man Mike Shanahan. ``I don't think
we can do the things we did and expect to win a championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had 'em on the ropes in the first half (which ended
with the Jets leading, 3-0). Then we went to sleep. Victor Green
went to sleep. That's that. It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   This would have been an upset of monstrous proportions. The
Broncos are 16-2, defending Super Bowl champs, and haven't lost a
home game in two seasons (19-0). They were 9-point favorites
against a Jets team that two years ago was the laughingstock of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells thought he might be able to come in here and
steal one with inferior talent, and for 33 minutes he was looking
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But the mistakes were too much to overcome, especially against a
team of Denver's caliber. This was a game in which Curtis Martin
fumbled to give the Broncos possession near midfield. It was a game
in which the always-reliable Keith Byars (another ex-Patriot)
fumbled when it looked like the Jets were streaking toward a
second-quarter touchdown. It was a game in which Jets strong safety
Green ``fell asleep,'' getting beaten on a long pass play that
eventually allowed the Broncos to get on the scoreboard in the
third quarter. And it was a game in which none of the Jets bothered
to pick up a Denver kickoff, which resulted in a Broncos recovery
that led to a 10-10 tie (imagine what we'd all say if Pete
Carroll's team did that).
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over there would be another Jet fumble (four lost
in all), a couple of Vinny Testaverde late-game, desperation
interceptions, and a lot of Bronco-mania in honor of what likely
was King John Elway's last home game.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets went home. Disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em I was proud of a lot of things they accomplished
this year,'' said Parcells. ``I thought we did a good job in many
areas. But it's foolish to be told you can pick up where you left
off next season. You have to go back and start where we started. I
hope to get back to this game with a different perception of what
it takes to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppered with questions about the turnovers, dumb mistakes, and
disappointment, Parcells could not help but remind the media,
``Look, there's not anybody standing there that thought we'd be
here talking about this. Not one.''
</P>
<P>
   When a well-meaning reporter asked about the ``baby steps'' it
takes to get to a championship level, the Tuna said, ``This wasn't
baby steps. This was a quantum leap for this team, about as far as
you can jump. I think it compares favorably with any team in
history over a two-year period. I'm not saying that from an
egotistical standpoint, but from an accomplishment standpoint on
the players' part.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Super Bowl will go on without him. Instead of two
weeks of Tuna and Dan Reeves, a pair of former Giant coaches
squaring off, we'll have two weeks of Reeves vs. Mike Shanahan, the
once and present Broncos coaches. While Shanahan works eight days a
week to prepare for the Falcons, Parcells will stack some doo-wop
cassettes in the front seat of his Caddy, and hit the Jersey
Turnpike, bound for Palm Beach. He won't have an opportunity to
ruin Bob Kraft's Super Bowl week for the second time in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing too much else, fellas,'' he said as he left the
podium. ``I'm a little tired.''

WITH SAMPRAS OUT, THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN IS WIDE OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 - OPEN-NYT   (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ A weary Pete Sampras decided to skip the
Southern Hemisphere this month. Others will have to swat away the
flies, pull their caps low in the dry heat and withstand the bump
and grind of three-of-five-set tennis on the rubberized hardcourt
surface at Melbourne Park, which can make young joints feel like
older joints.
</P>
<P>
   In Sampras' opinion the tennis season is too long, and he has
shortened it by choosing, surprisingly, not to chase Roy Emerson's
record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles on Emerson's turf at the
Australian Open. Sampras' rivals, several of whom played more
matches than he did last year, would surely relish extended
vacations of their own. But the other 29 men in the top 30 are all
back at work, and when play begins here on Monday, there will be no
one man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the best player in the world doesn't show up to a Grand
Slam,'' said Mark Philippoussis of Australia, ``it's a big
opportunity for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 ranking is also there for the taking, but not everyone
with a big reputation appears poised to seize the opportunity.
Marcelo Rios, the left-handed Chilean who temporarily bumped
Sampras out of the top slot last year, is nursing a sore leg and
back, and had to default from his most recent tournament in
Auckland, New Zealand. Patrick Rafter, the two-time defending U.S.
Open champion, has responded to the massive support and interest he
generates in his native Australia by losing early in his first two
tournaments this year. After cutting his 1998 season short in
November to rest and rehabilitate a sore knee, Rafter has looked
more rusty than fresh and more awkward than at home under a
powerful microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not a physical thing, it's definitely a mental
thing having to deal with the expectations all the time,'' said
Rafter, who has yet to reach the quarterfinals at his national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda, last year's winner here, had such a miserable second
half of the season that he is unseeded, and now he must defend his
title as he continues to defend his reputation after a positive
test for the steroid nandrolone. More Korda scissor kicks on the
final Sunday appear unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, another former champion here, who can still
generate as much controlled pace from the baseline as anyone, has
not advanced past the fourth round in a Grand Slam event since 1996
and is bearing an increasingly strong resemblance to a
best-of-three-set player. But when fit and motivated, as he is now,
Agassi cannot be discounted; not with his timing and returns. ``I
feel more ready now than I have in a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a slight favorite among the men, it is Alex
Corretja, the Spaniard who won the ATP Tour Championship in Germany
in late November and is now ranked third behind Sampras and Rios
(though he lost to the American Todd Martin, another player in fine
fettle, in the final of last week's ATP event in Sydney). Corretja,
who was to play his first-round match against Takao Suzuki of Japan
early Monday, is striking his groundstrokes and passing shots with
enormous confidence and attacking more frequently. His game is
well-suited to the high bounce that balls take off the Rebound Ace
surface here, and he has an excellent early draw, but he has never
won a Grand Slam event or made it past the third round in
Melbourne, and like Sampras, he played a great deal of tennis down
the stretch in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the 16 seeded men have won a total of eight Grand
Slam singles titles: three fewer than Sampras, and 13 fewer than
Steffi Graf, who has returned to Melbourne after a one-year hiatus
and is in good spirits and, more important for her, good health.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Graf's longtime rival Monica Seles played at
Melbourne Park, it was still known as Flinders Park. That was in
1996. She won the tournament, just as she had on her three previous
visits. Her career record in the Australian Open is 28-0, but she
will play here without her Australian coach, Gavin Hopper, with
whom she split late last year after a brief but relatively fruitful
partnership during which she reached the French Open final.
</P>
<P>
   Seles will face a qualifier in the first round. Her fellow
American Lindsay Davenport, seeded first for the first time at a
Grand Slam event, drew Gala Leon Garcia of Spain but has bigger
potential hurdles to clear in the third round, where Lisa Raymond
could be lurking, and in the quarterfinals, where fifth-seeded
Venus Williams should be lurking. But if the 6-foot-2-inch
Davenport, who took over the No. 1 ranking in October, continues to
play as confidently and aggressively as she did in beating Martina
Hingis in straight sets in Saturday's final in Sydney, the hurdles
will start to seem smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The Davenport-Hingis rivalry is now tied at 7-7, and Davenport
holds a 6-3 edge on hardcourts, the surface she grew up with in
Southern California. But Hingis is the two-time defending champion
here. She will play Lilia Osterloh of the United States in the
first round and could face the promising 15-year-old Australian
Jelena Dokic in the third round. Dokic, the 1998 U.S. Open junior
champion, defeated Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the Hopeman Cup
earlier this month, giving Australians a hint that they might have
a future force in the women's game to complement Rafter and
Philippoussis in the men's.  &QL;

THERE'S A JUMP IN ROBINSON'S STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ When Morten Andersen's kick had sailed between the
uprights, when the Atlanta Falcons jumped onto a platform at
midfield to accept the NFC title trophy and, of course, do their
``Dirty Bird'' dance, Eugene Robinson finally began running off the
Metrodome field.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, the Atlanta safety would stop, but his mouth
never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a solid team here, man,'' Robinson shouted. ``We got a
bona fide team here that can win. We can flat out play and nobody
would ever recognize that. Nobody, I say. Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was giving the familiar football player's lament _
``Nobody respects us'' _ when suddenly the safety who had been to
the last two Super Bowls with Green Bay began blurting out, ``The
Patriots ... the Patriots were the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? The Patriots are home by the hearth, no longer
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostile territory here, man, and we come right in and do it,''
Robinson shouted. ``This reminds me of the Patriots game when we
went into the Patriots and we played them tough. Man, we almost
dismantled the Patriots (winning, 41-10). So we played the Patriots
tough. And the same hostile atmosphere that the Patriots had was
here. The same hostile atmosphere existed here. And we didn't give
up, not even when it was 20-7 (Vikings) in first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Robinson give up on his biggest play of the game, when
Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham threw a ball 65 yards in
overtime toward Randy Moss. The ball seemed to hang in the
Metrodome atmosphere, with Moss and Robinson at the Atlanta 15,
ready for the jump ball that just might decide each other's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I come up and make plays,'' said Robinson, his mouth
still moving very swiftly. ``Somehow I come up and keep on making
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But this play had to be made, or the season almost certainly
would be over. Moss, the Vikings' brilliant rookie, had outjumped
many a defensive back in similar situations all season, coming down
with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Moss is faster than me, yeah, Moss can outjump me,''
shouted Robinson. ``I'll concede that. I'll give him that. But when
that ball was in the air, I just said, `I'm just going to play that
ball.' All my career, all I ever did was play the ball, and so I
made up my mind I'd play the ball and I'd meet Moss at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This was football at its ultimate. The uncoverable rookie, the
receiver who just may become one of the best in football history,
staring up at that ball with Robinson, the canny veteran who had
come out of Hartford, gone to Colgate, somehow found his way into
the NFL, and become one of the best. Not just the ball, but the
season, hung in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Moss may be faster than me but he may be too fast,''
said Robinson. ``We had studied the film and we'd seen that Randall
tends to underthrow Moss because of Moss's speed. And he underthrew
him this time, too. It worked for me that Moss has that speed
because Randall couldn't get him the ball and I had time to
react.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss and Robinson jumped for the ball. It was exquisite. Each
got their hands on it. There was a hush in the Metrodome. Who would
come down with it? The ball fell to the turf. The Vikings punted.
Atlanta soon would have its winning field goal. Once again, Eugene
Robinson had made the play. And, because of that play, Eugene
Robinson would be going to his third straight Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'd have thunk it?'' Robinson blurted. ``The Dirty Birds
going to the Super Bowl. Who'd have thunk it?''
</P>

BRUINS' RECRUITS COULD GO TO HEAD OF CLASS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins are in position to land another
top-ranked recruiting class, with a half-dozen elite players
expected to commit this month.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to commit is Dallas-area receiver Ryan Smith, who has
been compared in size and style to Danny Farmer. He's also a former
Westlake Village resident and close friends with Westlake tight end
_ and UCLA recruit _ Mike Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have 11 oral commitments, including Smith, leaving 10
unclaimed scholarships. The names to watch in coming weeks are:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seidman, one of the nation's top tight ends. He has narrowed
his choices to UCLA and USC. Recruiting insiders believe he'll sign
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   __ San Jose's Marcus Reese, the top-ranked linebacker in the
state. Sources said he has given the Bruins a soft commitment and
will make it official as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Steve Sanchez, a 280-pound defensive lineman from Visalia and
the nephew of former UCLA cornerback Lupe Sanchez. Steve Sanchez
has given Cal a preliminary commitment but is reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fresno cornerback Ricky Manning, whose finalists include
UCLA, USC, Michigan and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   __ Narbonne safety Nnamdi Asomugha, who has UCLA and Cal on his
short list. He is expected to make a decision this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Norman Boebert, a defensive end from Glendale, Ariz., and a
nationally ranked player whose finalists are UCLA and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   __ Atari Callen, a defensive back from the storied Concord De La
Salle program. It's UCLA and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   __ T.J. Duckett, a 250-pound linebacker from Kalamazoo, Mich.,
and the No. 1-rated player in the country _ any position. Michigan
State will be tough to beat, but the Bruins are running a close
second. Duckett is so good his signature would instantly give UCLA
a top-five class.
</P>
<P>
   __ Borges update: Offensive coordinator Al Borges interviewed
Friday for the same post with the San Diego Chargers. The situation
could be resolved this week, Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Knee problems: Senior safety Larry Atkins did not sprain the
medial collateral ligament in his right knee in the Rose Bowl,
after all. He did much worse, tearing the anterior cruciate
ligament. Atkins will not recover before the NFL draft in April.
</P>
<P>
   __ Linn's in: UCLA has named Mike Linn as its new strength
coach. Linn was an assistant under former coach Kevin Yoxall, who
departed several weeks ago for Auburn. A former UCLA player, Linn
has received stellar reviews from the players.

RANGERS ARE BAFFLED BY A LOST WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Rangers had looked at their last four games, a
span in which they played four teams occupying last place in their
divisions, and had seen an opportunity. As they walked slowly and
quietly to the bus here on Saturday night, through a small crowd of
encouraging family and friends, they saw an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had just been shut out by the Montreal Canadiens,
3-0, fewer than 24 hours after a disappointing defeat at home to
the Chicago Blackhawks. The two losses gave the Rangers a split of
the four games, and rather than lift themselves back into the
playoff picture as the All-Star Game break approaches, the Rangers
dropped into a three-way tie with the surging Canadiens and the
Florida Panthers for ninth place in the Eastern Conference, 4
points behind Boston and Carolina for the final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough conference,'' Wayne Gretzky said afterward.
``Every game is a battle. It's going to be a battle to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Rangers can be a part of that battle is a question even
they don't profess to have an answer for. Their scoring has been
inconsistent, particularly recently: In their past 12 games, they
have scored five or more goals three times, but have scored two or
fewer seven times. Their power play, which has carried them for
much of the year, ranking second in the National Hockey League, has
failed them now, too, coming up empty on the past 15 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been either feast or famine,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler
said. ``We're either scoring six or getting one or none.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the five-on-three advantage has failed. On Saturday,
the Rangers had a two-man advantage for 1 minute 2 seconds, but
took only one shot and never threatened. That marked the third
consecutive two-man advantage that has failed to produce a goal for
the Rangers. In the losses Friday and Saturday, the Rangers scored
only one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have to do,'' Brian Leetch said. ``We have to
work hard and find some ways to score. The power play is still
getting it in the zone and creating chances. When you're accustomed
to the puck going in all the time for you, it seems like a big
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a big part of our team and when it's not there,
it's very noticeable. We can't explain goals. You can control the
work ethic, try to create chances. but you can't always control the
puck finding its way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Troubles like these are certain to bring back the cries for
trades, but even the acquisition of a strong shooter might not be
the solution. The Rangers have displayed other flaws, surrendering
goals on the first shot in three of their past five games, and
falling behind in 28 of their 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the answer, I'd be a great coach,'' Gretzky said.
``We don't have a natural goal scorer, our goals come from hard
work, from guys like Adam Graves, Todd Harvey and John MacLean. We
don't have that guy who can look at the net and it goes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battle hard for all the goals. I don't know if the lack of
a goal scorer is the reason why we lost. Throughout the year our
guys have worked hard in practice. That hasn't been our biggest
liability.'' &QL;

BIG RIGHT WINS IT FOR TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The only thing shot at the MGM Grand Saturday night
was Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months after his rematch with Evander Holyfield turned
into a riot in which shots allegedly were fired in the MGM's casino
after Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield, Tyson returned
to boxing by knocking out Francois Botha in the fifth round with
one crushing right hand. Many will misread that, believing Tyson is
back because of it, despite the fact that he looked rusty and often
amateurish while losing the first four rounds on two judges' cards.
</P>
<P>
   But if Tyson is as much a student of boxing as he claims, he
will know better because the true meaning of what happened is not
that he still can punch _ which has been the case during his
ascendancy and his slow decline _ but that his mystique is gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new in the fight game. Punchers traditionally
get older faster than boxers, and punchers who have led the kind of
troubled life Tyson has get older quicker than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   There is much proof of that in the career of the fighter he says
he most admires, Sonny Liston, but a student of the game will
remember back to another night and another big punching heavyweight
who came back from a bad defeat and a layoff the same way Tyson
did.
</P>
<P>
   They will remember how Jack Dempsey lost badly to Gene Tunney in
a fight people dismissed as a fluke, then came back to knock Jack
Sharkey flat after struggling with him. Everyone said Dempsey was
back. His next fight he lost to Tunney again and retired.
</P>
<P>
   So part of the lesson of Tyson's one-punch devastation is not to
forget it came after he'd been beaten up twice by Holyfield, sat
out 19 months after being suspended, and came back to lose the
first four rounds to Botha and looked uncomfortable doing it until
he landed the kind of bomb that can erase many things, including
both short-term and long-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   What it can't erase is the fact that no one's afraid of Mike
Tyson any more. They may lose to him. They may even be knocked out
by him. But as Botha proved with his fatal cockiness, no one fears
the beaten bully, which means every fight from now on will be
dangerous and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Tyson enters the ring he will get hit more than he's
ever been hit and he will know pain more than he ever did and he
will be pressured more than he ever was because Holyfield has shown
everyone the way to beat him and Botha showed the plan still can
work if you follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sticking to the game plan until he got cocky,'' said
Panama Lewis, Botha's trainer. ``He dropped his hands and got
caught, but I can't take anything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because until he did, Botha lured Tyson into the same
mistakes Holyfield had and made him look worse. The fact that he
couldn't finish the job was more a reflection of what Botha is not,
not what Tyson still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed,'' Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) said.
``If I was fighting Mike Tyson and he was fighting like that, he'd
have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the old young Tyson would beat the new old
Tyson. Frankly, so would more than a few other top heavyweights
today, given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   During those first 12 minutes of Saturday night's 10-round
fight, Botha not only roughed Tyson up on the inside but talked
trash to him the way no opponent ever has, goading him and once
boxing his ears. At one point, he even shoeshined Tyson with a
flurry that had the crowd at the Grand Garden Arena laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really expected more from him,'' Botha (39-2, 24) said.
``Mike has a lot of power and I walked into a punch you don't see
but I was controlling the fight real easy and keeping away from his
power until I got cocky. I started fooling around too much,
probably. I got careless. I'd like to have a rematch but I know a
lot of other people want a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is a new fact of Tyson's boxing life. Opponents
always have wanted to sign to fight him, but few besides Buster
Douglas and Holyfield actually wanted to fight him. Now they all
do, which means life just became much more difficult for a man who
always has been a small heavyweight made to look bigger by an aura
of intimidation that won him many fights before they had begun. As
Tyson's trainer, Tommy Brooks, said several weeks ago, ``That's
gone. Now he has to learn how to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, it is difficult to learn those lessons under the white
heat of a heavyweight assault. You may look good in the gym, as
Tyson did, but when the fight comes and your opponent is coming
forward instead of backing up and punching rather than covering up,
you forget those gym lessons quickly and revert to what you are _
which in Tyson's case is a one-punch knockout artist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most ominous for the future was that at the end of the
first round, the two fighters engaged in a brutal moment of
violence in which Tyson seemed to suddenly lose it just as he had
in the Holyfield rematch, twisting Botha's arm against his side as
the bell rang. When later told Botha accused him of trying to break
it, Tyson said, ``He's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   A second later, Tyson pushed his left forearm into Botha's
throat as Botha hollered and tried to free himself. When he could
not, he hit Tyson after the bell and both corners emptied while
police rushed the ring apron and surrounded it, fearing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Had referee Richard Steele wanted to disqualify Tyson right then
he could have but he did not and a round later Tyson was screaming
at him, claiming Botha was headbutting. Tyson made the same false
charges against Holyfield yet after the fight was over his new
manager, Shelly Finkel, said ``a lot of things were done in there
but the best part was Mike's composure was there early.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel did not explain if that was before or after the cops
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When order was restored, the second round began with a clearly
wild-eyed Tyson whistling amateurish punches well over Botha's
head, losing his balance and stumbling several times when he did.
More and more the two began to wrestle in the clinches until Tyson
tried to push Botha in the face with an open glove and Steele took
a point away from him. This is composure?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Tyson did solve Botha and when he did he had a
moment of clarity. Later he would say he never realized he had
thrown the lethal right hand that dropped Botha at his feet like an
unwanted leaflet and he was not lying. Punches like that come from
instinct, not plann

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ You didn't have to be a lip reader to know John Elway said
a naughty word. His presumed final pass ever at Mile High Stadium,
which should have produced an exclamation-point touchdown, was
instead just another incompletion. He flat-out missed his tallest
target, Ed McCaffrey, who had a huge step on the nearest Jet in the
end zone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Elway knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up,'' he admitted. ``But Eddie almost made a great
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway knew he missed a bunch of targets Sunday. He knew he
messed up a lot. He threw too short, and he threw too long. He had
four passes pawed off course. Denver's brisk and chilly crosswinds,
with which he has such a wealth of experience, repeatedly bedeviled
him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when New York held its 10-0 lead, Elway was a
hapless _ hopeless? _ 4-for-18 for 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out of sync,'' he understated.
</P>
<P>
   Not the stuff of legends, that ugly ratio. Artistically
speaking, of the countless games Elway has played here in the
shadow of the Front Range over his 16 seasons, this one, with
another AFC championship at stake, wouldn't have cracked his
personal top 100.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics, though, like the aforementioned McCaffrey
misfire, were rendered inconsequential by the Denver 23, New York
10 score. The afternoon wrapped exactly as it was supposed to, with
the most famous smile in football back where it belonged, plastered
upon Elway's chiseled face. On the top of his head, sitting there
like a deserved crown, would rest the Lamar Hunt Trophy, the prize
awarded to the AFC's premier team.
</P>
<P>
   So retirement is a minimum of four quarters away for King John,
Denver's divine. One game remains, a game that will make him the
only quarterback to date to start a fifth Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle of Elway's career is that he entered the league in
1983 as one of the NFL's most overhyped prospects, certainly up to
said point in the league's history. Yet he somehow exceeded the
absurd expectations for him. Whatever happens in Miami on the final
day of January, and whatever his subsequent decision about staying
or going, the erstwhile ``Golden Boy'' will, in the end, go out
with pure platinum credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Is he done in Denver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that yet,'' Elway replied. ``I'll make my decision
after the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to him say his farewell is a foregone conclusion.
Of course, we believed that to be the case last January, when he
finally won a Super Bowl after three humbling experiences in same.
Why would he push his luck, we wondered. What sense would it make
to return?
</P>
<P>
   Had the Jets proved capable of playing a second half worthy of
their first, you can bet the subject would have been revisited. Had
Vinny Testaverde _ 13-for-13 at the outset _ stayed his unconscious
early course, Elway likely wouldn't have been in a position to go
out as a two-time champion.
</P>
<P>
   It would have proved a bitter, unsettling conclusion to a year
launched with 13 successive victories and the resulting crush of
contemplation regarding a possible perfect season. It would have,
no question, left a speck of tarnish on Elway's glittering
mystique.
</P>
<P>
   But then everything turned on a single play, a perfect Elway
strike for 47 yards over the middle to McCaffrey immediately
following the Curtis Martin touchdown that put New York up _
improbably _ by 10.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, the right guy in the wrong place at the right time,
slipped behind a dozing Victor Green. Elway laid the football
squarely in McCaffrey's hands, and the Jets' long day's journey
into night had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the play we needed to get us out of our funk,'' Elway
said. ``It was huge. It got the momentum going, got our fans back
in it, restored a little confidence and perked everyone up.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Elway, too, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. The comebacks he's most noted for are
fourth-quarter spectaculars, dramas that commence just as all hope
appears lost. By Elway's standards, Sunday's script was mundane at
best. Once the Broncos got rolling, posting 20 points in a
10-minute third-quarter blitz, the Jets were rendered about as
impotent as the 1-15 ragnots Bill Parcells inherited in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, New York had a remarkable season, going 12-4 to
win the AFC East, then beating Jacksonville in the divisional round
last week. By no measure were the Jets ready to supplant the
Broncos as champions of the resurgent American Conference, no
longer the NFL's grubby stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one person in this whole arena thought we could be doing
what we did today,'' Parcells argued.
</P>
<P>
   Least of all Elway. He would not be further upstaged by the
upstarts from the Jersey swamp. After all, had the tide not turned,
he would have had to return next season to make amends. This way,
he's got closure _ if he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you!'' Elway screamed to the madding crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And his love, as you might have guessed, was not of the
unrequited variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year! One more year! One more year!'' the
Broncomaniacs pleaded as Elway took his victory _ farewell? _ lap
around the field.
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking, by all accounts. But who could blame them for
asking?

<P>
   DENVER _ If Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the New York
Jets turns out to have been Denver quarterback John Elway's last
game at Mile High Stadium, his coronation was fit for a king.
</P>
<P>
   With 75,482 fans worshipping at his altar, Elway provided the
inspiration and Terrell Davis the perspiration in the Broncos'
23-10 victory that sends them to Miami for Super Bowl XXXIII
against the Atlanta Falcons and their former coach, Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   In the week leading up to the game, Elway was besieged with
questions about his imminent retirement. The Denver media have been
predicting that he will retire at some point after the Super Bowl.
The newspapers ran farewell tributes to him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was John's last game here, we sure didn't want him to
go out a loser,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``When you
consider everything he's done here, I don't think there's any
player who symbolizes his city more than John.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of Denver, they don't think of skiing. They
think of John Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Elway saluted his coaches and teammates, told
the fans he loved them and did a victory lap around the field where
he became one of the most legendary players in the history of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is to finish this season before I think about what
I'm going to do,'' Elway said. ``I told the fans I love them
because they've been great for 16 years. I'm thrilled to get back
to the Super Bowl, but our work isn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, ended the Jets'
seven-game winning streak and denied Bill Parcells' attempt to
become the first coach to take three different teams to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always very disappointing to lose a game like this, but
there's not one person in this whole arena who thought we could be
doing what we did today,'' Parcells said about the Jets' storybook
season. ``Hopefully, we can start from here next year and improve
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate Denver. They're a good team. They have a chance
to win two (Super Bowls) in a row, and that's no small task.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in a wicked wind that caused problems for the
quarterbacks, kickers and punters, Elway overcame a horrible first
half to become the first quarterback who will start in five Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets led 3-0 after the first half, when Elway was 4-of-14
for 33 yards. The Broncos fell behind 10-0 before Elway, Davis,
kicker Jason Elam and an underrated defense ignited a brilliant
comeback with a 20-point third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elway finished 13-of-34 for 173 yards and a touchdown. He wasn't
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Davis carried 32 times for 167 yards and a touchdown. He had 199
yards rushing and two touchdowns in the divisional win over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell could have run for 200 yards,'' Sharpe said. ``We have
to tip our hats to our offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw what kind of problems the wind was causing, we
couldn't throw the ball down the field much. We knew we had to keep
giving the ball to Terrell up the middle. That's always pretty good
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense doesn't get nearly as much credit as it
deserves. The Broncos forced six turnovers _ five by the defense _
and limited the Jets to 14 yards on 13 carries. It was the second
consecutive playoff game in which they allowed only 14 yards
rushing on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some adversity in the first half, but we kept our
composure and stepped up in the third quarter,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``The wind was a huge factor for both teams, and it
caused a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had it in the third quarter, we decided to air it out
to try to keep them off-balance.''
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the third quarter was the Broncos'
worst. In 16 games, they scored only 64 points in the third
quarter, but they got 20 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Broncos, the biggest play came after the Jets
had blocked a punt at the Denver one and scored their only
touchdown on Curtis Martin's one-yard run for a 10-0 lead with
11:56 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elway called a play in which receiver Ed McCaffrey was supposed
to run a crossing route and receiver Rod Smith was supposed to run
a post route. McCaffrey and Smith lined up wrong, but they made the
right adjustment. Smith ran the crossing route, and McCaffrey went
deep to catch a 47-yard pass to the Jets' 17.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Elway threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to
fullback Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it backward,'' Elway said about McCaffrey and Smith.
``They came out on the wrong side, but they're bright guys and they
just switched assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was huge because it got the fans back in the game
and gave us the momentum. It got us out of a funk, restored a
little confidence and perked everyone up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next kickoff, Elam kicked the ball high and into the
stiff wind. It bounced backward and was touched by Jets linebacker
James Farrior and covered by Broncos linebacker Keith Burns at the
New York 31. The Broncos took advantage by tying the score on
Elam's 44-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very big play,'' McCaffrey said. ``After we got the
ball, we scored a lot of points in a hurry. That was the difference
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Broncos got the ball, they drove to the Jets'
29, and Elam kicked a 48-yard field goal to give them a 13-10 lead
they would never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Darrien Gordon's 36-yard punt return to the New York 38 set up
their next score. Davis carried three times for all 38 yards. His
touchdown came on a 31-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pitch, and the back side was open,'' Davis said. ``I
told myself to be patient. I saw the flow of the line and cut back.
When I saw the seam, I just went as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets committed three turnovers in the fourth quarter, with
Elam completing the scoring with a 35-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure on us,'' Broncos linebacker Bill
Romanowski said about the defense. ``We stepped up and made a lot
of big plays. If you don't play good defense in big games like
this, you're making plans for the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon intercepted Jets QB Vinny Testaverde two times in the
fourth quarter. Testaverde finished 31-of-52 for 356 yards. He
didn't have a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to come this close, but losing still's a big
disappointment,'' Testaverde said. ``Turnovers and penalties killed
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we were very successful this season. We came a lot
farther than people expected.''

ELWAY LEAVES HIS FANS THE RIGHT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ His numbers were not like the old days, and neither was
his performance or his team's need for him, but in the end John
Elway left Mile High Stadium the way he should have Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He left after making the play, and if he never plays another
game in Denver, isn't that how he should be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the final play this time. It wasn't the game-winning
play or the most dramatic play or the fourth-quarter comeback play
he's made 47 times in his career. Certainly it wasn't the only play
because, frankly, running back Terrell Davis made most of those in
Denver's 23-10 AFC Championship Game victory, but Elway made a
winner's play.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was what he has been doing for 16 years in Denver.
He made the play that righted his team when it seemed like it might
sink under the relentless defensive assault of the New York Jets.
He saved the day if not the game. He was, for a few brief minutes
at least, once again ELWAY.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had just gone ahead, 10-0, with 11:56 to play in the
third quarter after having conspired with a stiff wind to hold
Elway to 33 yards passing and the Broncos to no points in the first
half, and now people began to mumble about seeing a repeat of the
Falcons' upset of the Vikings in the NFC title game that was less
than two hours old.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that moment that Elway became ELWAY. He was no longer
a little bit older and a little bit slower and a little less able
to throw any pass he wanted. Right then, when the Broncos needed
him more than anyone else, he fired footballs into the air and his
team was back in business.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos came out of the huddle with the ball on the 36-yard
line barely 40 seconds after the Jets' Curtis Martin had scored a
1-yard touchdown to take a 10-0 lead and Elway noticed his two
receivers had lined up on the opposite sides of where they should
have been. Rod Smith gave Elway a hand signal that he knew what
route to run and understood the mixup but Ed McCaffrey was
frantically running toward him, baffled and panicked.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached, Elway calmly whispered, ``A post,'' meaning
his assignment was now to run the route Smith originally had been
assigned. As he did, Elway took the snap, gave a perfect play fake
that froze the defense, and hit a wide open McCaffrey downfield
with a 47-yard pass to the Jet 17. Two plays later he threw an
11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith that may well be his last
in Denver if he follows through on what many here believe is a plan
to retire after Super Bowl XXXIII, and the Broncos were in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later he would complete a 10-yard throw on third-and-15
that got Denver just close enough for Jason Elam to kick a
game-tying 44-yard field goal, and the world was safe for Terrell
Davis once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big momentum swing for our team, being down 10-0,''
said Denver coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Davis tore the Jets apart. He rushed for 167 yards
and scored a 31-yard touchdown that broke the Jets' spirit as the
third quarter ended and made Elway a footnote in his sixth and
possibly final AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you never can be a footnote in Denver if you are Elway, even
at a time in his career when he no longer carries the Broncos but
instead vies for Best Supporting Actor nominations to Davis's
starring role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell is always the most important thing to have in the
backfield,'' Elway said, knowing that for years that would have
been a lie. For years the Broncos never would have won a big game
in which John Elway was 13 of 34 for 173 yards and was sacked three
times.
</P>
<P>
   For years Elway was the Broncos and he relentlessly took them to
three Super Bowls on the strength of his arm and legs alone and
lost them all, only winning on his fourth try last season because
Davis was there to pound out a victory over the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Elway understands this change, but what he also understood after
everything was done if not quite yet all said was that something
more was required of him before he left Mile High one last time
than to throw three critical passes. Something he didn't
particularly feel comfortable doing but was being urged to by
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over. They were returning to the Super Bowl. It was
done. So now, Shanahan told him, it was time for a victory lap. Not
the Broncos, just the soul of the Broncos. Just ELWAY.
</P>
<P>
   And so he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional thing for John,'' Shanahan said. ``He got
to take that lap around the field. I urged him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing he did because otherwise Elway would have
left with his thumb pointing to the sky after having told the fans
he loved them at the presentation of the Lamar Hunt Trophy and
nothing more. But this moment, if it was his last in Elway City,
required something more, and the fact that he took the lap may have
spoken louder about his retirement plans than all his pubic
insistences that he has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have been great to me for 16 years but, I don't know,
I didn't feel comfortable (doing a victory lap) but now I'm glad I
did it,'' Elway said. ``When you're here, you're focused on the
game. It was nice to be able to focus on the fans. It was so great
to see how happy the fans were.''
</P>
<P>
   They were happy about everything but the prospect of Elway not
returning, and they let him know it as he rounded the field.
</P>
<P>
   They continued their lobbying efforts during his postgame news
conference outside the locker room and every shout of encouragement
made Elway smile that smile that still makes him look like a kid
despite the age lines around his eyes. In the end, those pleadings
will not deter him, just as no defense ever did. He will do what he
wants, as he has for most of his career with so many defenses
massed to prevent him.
</P>
<P>
   He will also do what he believes is right, as he did when he
told McCaffrey to run the deep post, then found him with what may
be his last long ball at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But if he goes, John Elway will have to make one last stop at
the Super Bowl first, a place he's been to five times now. If he
wins, he will be among the few to do it twice in a row, joining
Terry Bradshaw and Bart Starr and Joe Montana. And if he doesn't,
does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Not to Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has done so much for Denver,'' the Broncos tight end
said. ``He has more wins than any other quarterback. He'll be
starting his fifth Super Bowl. When you think Denver you don't
think skiing. You think John Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for just a few short minutes when his team needed him
most, he reminded anyone who might have forgotten why that is.

FATE GIVES ANDERSON SWIFT KICK 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ This was right out of Sophocles or Aeschylus or
whomever happens to be your favorite Greek playwright.
</P>
<P>
   It was all about gods and fates and mortality. The moral of the
story: do away with perfection before it comes back to bite you in
the you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's NFC Championship Game, Minnesota Vikings
kicker Gary Anderson was perfect for the entire season. He had been
good on 37 of 37 field goal attempts (35 in the regular season and
two last week in a 41-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals). He
had been 59 for 59 on extra points.
</P>
<P>
   That's why any intelligent Vikings fan should have been very
nervous when Mr. Anderson set up for a 38-yard field goal that
would have given the team a 10-point lead over the Atlanta Falcons
with 2:07 remaining in the fourth quarter. This is the NFL, and you
just don't do perfect in the NFL. You can be almost perfect. You
can be real good. You can be real, real good. But in the history of
this league no one ever has gone through a season without missing
at least one field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   To get this far in the season without a miss is to thumb your
nose at the fates. And so when the snap came from center Mike
Morris to holder Mitch Berger it was ball down, kick up and _ OH
NO! IT'S A HALF-FOOT WIDE TO THE LEFT!
</P>
<P>
   Like anyone should have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest. You know that the feisty Falcons drove 71
yards in eight plays, tying the score at 27 on a 16-yard Chris
Chandler-to-Terance Mathis pass with 57 seconds left and that in
overtime Atlanta's Morten Andersen, no stranger to late-game
boo-boos (ask anyone in Jacksonville), nailed a field goal from the
exact same spot on the field to give Atlanta a 30-27 win and send
the Falcons to the Super Bowl for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   The men in question have been in just about every situation
during their lengthy careers. Anderson, a native of South Africa,
is 39. This is his 17th year in the league. Andersen, 38, is
likewise in his 17th year. Each has had a Hall of Fame career. That
such a high-stakes game should come down to a matter of which one
could make a 38-yard field goal is, well, I really don't know.
Football, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw it,'' said Anderson. ``I was buried under a couple
of guys. Obviously, there are no words to describe how disappointed
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not exactly Anderson's happiest day in football, but he
faced the media hordes like a professional and a gentleman. He must
have used variations on the word ``disappoint'' a half-dozen times
in the span of two minutes, but what else could he say? He never
has wanted to make a field goal more in his life. A 10-point lead
with two minutes and change left would have put the game away. Now
the Vikings are going home.
</P>
<P>
   He swore he never had dwelled on the fact that he had been
perfect. He certainly never had entertained notions of missing an
unneeded field goal on purpose merely to satisfy the gods. ``It's
just part of field goal kicking,'' he said with a sigh. ``It's the
way kicking goes. You try to approach every kick the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I feel bad for him,'' said Andersen. ``I know how
he must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen also claims he hadn't thought much about the
ramifications of his counterpart's perfect status entering the
game. To Morten Andersen, what Gary Anderson was doing made perfect
sense, if you'll pardon the expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed my mind (that Anderson was due for a miss),''
claimed Andersen. ``Gary is just so solid.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Andersen, whose own 38-yarder was right down Broadway, he
said he was very calm. ``I was just waiting patiently for my
chance,'' he said. ``You just have to let these situations come to
you. You can't force anything. I find that patience really helps in
these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now then. Can we accurately say that Gary Anderson lost the game
for his team? Certainly not. He could have clinched it; that's all.
The Minnesota defense had to hold in what was Atlanta's most
important possession, and it didn't. The most famous offense in the
league scored 7 points in the second half. As in any such game,
there were the usual litanies of shouldas and couldas and wouldas,
of turnovers and dropped passes and missed assignments and
inefficient tackling and all sorts of human imperfections that both
preceded and followed Gary Anderson's brush with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   And still ... it was set up for the perfect kicker to deliver
the goods. He was 23 for 23 outside the 30 during the regular
season. He was kicking, as usual, on turf, the kicker's best
friend. He had his usual snapper and his usual holder. He didn't
say anything about the snap or the hold being bad. He just ...
</P>
<P>
   Missed.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected him to miss _ on either side. I'm sure Atlanta
coach Dan Reeves figured his team's wonderful ride was over as
Anderson trotted onto the field. ``A guy who hadn't missed all year
missed and gave us a chance to win it,'' said the Falcons mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings won the toss at the start of overtime, and so most
everyone figured they would make a few first downs and Gary
Anderson would have a chance to redeem himself. Unfortunately, he's
still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall Cunningham came over and said, `Don't worry; you'll
get another chance,''' said Anderson. That was certainly a logical
assumption and a very good bet. But the best Minnesota could do in
the overtime was get to its 42. Gary Anderson is very good, but
neither he nor anyone else has a 75-yard field goal in him.
</P>
<P>
   You say life will go on, but Gary Anderson is 39. Was this his
final chance to be kicking in front of the entire nation on Super
Sunday? Very likely. ``That's why it's so disappointing,'' he said.
``We had such a great year. But that's what field goal kicking is
all about. You have to be a man about it. This is your job, to line
up and fire that field goal through. With the year we've had, not
to make it to the Super Bowl is bitterly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson made no excuses. He kicked the ball the way he
usually does, but this one time the ball went about a half-foot
wide. All it goes to show is that no one is perfect. Not now, not
ever.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't fool with the fates.

ATLANTA REACHES FIRST SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Long after Morten Andersen had hit a 38-yard field
goal to kick one of the most futile franchises in NFL history into
the grandest surprise of all for Dixie, the Super Bowl, Gary
Anderson still was sitting in the Vikings Lounge atop the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could have been from a wake. Friend after friend came
by to pat the Vikings kicker on the shoulder. Teammate after
teammate came by to whisper comforting words, quarterback Randall
Cunningham talking to Anderson at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just can't be words to describe the disappointment I'm
feeling,'' said Anderson, ``especially with the season we had.''
Then, when he was left alone, Anderson crossed his arms against his
chest and stared into the void.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons advanced to the Super Bowl two weeks hence
in Miami with a 30-27 win over the Vikings in overtime Sunday, a
game that may have been one for the ages. For sure, though, the
shocking loss by the 16-1 Vikings will heat the cold and brutal
winters of Minnesota with debate for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Anderson, the first NFL kicker to be perfect
during a season, missed a 38-yarder with little more than two
minutes to play, letting the Falcons come back and tie the game and
then win it in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Said exuberant Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, ``When Anderson
missed, I ran up up to Chris Chandler (the Atlanta quarterback) and
I said, `Chris, that's it, he missed it. Now we have a chance, now
you have a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if he makes that field goal, it was going to be
much, much harder for us to win,'' said Chandler of Anderson's miss
with Minnesota leading, 27-20. ``And when he missed it, the whole
sideline erupted as if we just won the game. It gave us a new
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler took over on his 29-yard line with 2:07 to play, and
moved the Falcons 71 yards, but not without a few frights. Such as
when he scrambled for 9 yards with 1:47 left, banged his knee, and
had to use a timeout he did not wish to use to limp to the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I banged the inside of my knee,'' he said. ``I'm sure all of
you have done it, where you hit that inside part of your knee and
it really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chandler stayed in the game, and a couple of plays later
fired a pass to the inside of the field toward Terance Mathis, a
pass virtually identical to one Mathis had dropped for a TD earlier
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried the exact same route where one of their guys had
gotten a hand on it,'' said Chandler of the ball that this time
went for a 16-yard score. ``They flushed me from my left and I
rolled to my right _ at that point, it was just schoolyard football
_ and I looked and saw Terance coming into the hole and I just
threw it as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' Andersen had to try the extra point for the tie
twice, the Vikings being offside the first time. Andersen was just
as good on his second try.
</P>
<P>
   With the Vikings tied at 27 with 57 seconds left, the true
shocker came next. Cunningham scrambled for 7 yards from his 20,
then threw incomplete on a bomb to Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, with 30 seconds left, only 40 or so yards from
field goal range, Vikings coach Dennis Green waved the white flag
for the rest of regulation time, instructing Cunningham to take a
knee. There was stunned silence in the Metrodome, and all
throughout football, as the best offense in the league decided not
to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why they took a knee then,'' said Atlanta
defensive lineman Chuck Smith. ``They were afraid, that's why. They
were afraid of me doing what I did just before the half, stripping
the ball from Cunningham.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Smith had turned the game around for his team in the
second quarter. The Vikings were leading, 20-7, and were on the
move when Smith cleanly beat star tackle Todd Steussie and caused
Cunningham to fumble at his 14. One play later, Chandler hit Mathis
for a TD and Atlanta was still breathing, trailing only 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down to 30 seconds, then you need to take two good
downs, and if you don't have a first down by then, then you'd
better move on and go the other way,'' said Green of his decision
to run out the clock. ``We had had troubles in protection schemes
and we had a couple of fumbles. We took two good shots at it and
hoped to get it done. We didn't. It did work to our favor. We
(received) the kick (in overtime), we got the return, but we just
didn't score with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green's decision not to go after the victory at the end of
regulation had sent a clear signal. ``They were saying they didn't
have to try and score then,'' said Robinson. ``They were saying
they just had to come out in OT and they'd score on our defense.
Well, they're not the first ones not to respect us, and they're not
the last ones who'll pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first drive in OT, Cunningham was short-arming his
passes. On Chandler's first drive in OT, he looked like a triplet
to Jake Plummer and Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Minnesota could get only two first downs despite
having its hands on the ball twice. Then, on Atlanta's second OT
chance, starting from its 9, Chandler was immense. Twice he found
tight end O.J. Santiago for huge gains, one a 15-yarder and the
next a 26-yarder on which Santiago beat linebacker Bobby Houston to
get it to the Vikings 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it personal when they said all they had to do was stop
the run,'' said Chandler, the son-in-law of former NFL great John
Brodie. ``I know we have a passing game, too, and you can't think
if you just stop Jamal Anderson you're going to beat us. So I had
more motivation, a little more zeal coming into this game. And
ending it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was so proud of the performance by the well-traveled
Chandler that he told his QB his effort ``ranks right up there with
any of the big-time quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, as Jamal Anderson toted the ball three straight times
into field goal position, the Vikings' Anderson kept pacing the
sideline. And when the Falcons' Andersen booted the ball, the
Metrodome suddenly was silent. So silent.

BIG RIGHT WINS IT FOR TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The only thing shot at the MGM Grand Saturday night
was Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months after his rematch with Evander Holyfield turned
into a riot in which shots allegedly were fired in the MGM's casino
after Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield, Tyson returned
to boxing by knocking out Francois Botha in the fifth round with
one crushing right hand. Many will misread that, believing Tyson is
back because of it, despite the fact that he looked rusty and often
amateurish while losing the first four rounds on two judges' cards.
</P>
<P>
   But if Tyson is as much a student of boxing as he claims, he
will know better because the true meaning of what happened is not
that he still can punch _ which has been the case during his
ascendancy and his slow decline _ but that his mystique is gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new in the fight game. Punchers traditionally
get older faster than boxers, and punchers who have led the kind of
troubled life Tyson has get older quicker than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   There is much proof of that in the career of the fighter he says
he most admires, Sonny Liston, but a student of the game will
remember back to another night and another big punching heavyweight
who came back from a bad defeat and a layoff the same way Tyson
did.
</P>
<P>
   They will remember how Jack Dempsey lost badly to Gene Tunney in
a fight people dismissed as a fluke, then came back to knock Jack
Sharkey flat after struggling with him. Everyone said Dempsey was
back. His next fight he lost to Tunney again and retired.
</P>
<P>
   So part of the lesson of Tyson's one-punch devastation is not to
forget it came after he'd been beaten up twice by Holyfield, sat
out 19 months after being suspended, and came back to lose the
first four rounds to Botha and looked uncomfortable doing it until
he landed the kind of bomb that can erase many things, including
both short-term and long-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   What it can't erase is the fact that no one's afraid of Mike
Tyson any more. They may lose to him. They may even be knocked out
by him. But as Botha proved with his fatal cockiness, no one fears
the beaten bully, which means every fight from now on will be
dangerous and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Tyson enters the ring he will get hit more than he's
ever been hit and he will know pain more than he ever did and he
will be pressured more than he ever was because Holyfield has shown
everyone the way to beat him and Botha showed the plan still can
work if you follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sticking to the game plan until he got cocky,'' said
Panama Lewis, Botha's trainer. ``He dropped his hands and got
caught, but I can't take anything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because until he did, Botha lured Tyson into the same
mistakes Holyfield had and made him look worse. The fact that he
couldn't finish the job was more a reflection of what Botha is not,
not what Tyson still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed,'' Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) said.
``If I was fighting Mike Tyson and he was fighting like that, he'd
have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the old young Tyson would beat the new old
Tyson. Frankly, so would more than a few other top heavyweights
today, given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   During those first 12 minutes of Saturday night's 10-round
fight, Botha not only roughed Tyson up on the inside but talked
trash to him the way no opponent ever has, goading him and once
boxing his ears. At one point, he even shoeshined Tyson with a
flurry that had the crowd at the Grand Garden Arena laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really expected more from him,'' Botha (39-2, 24) said.
``Mike has a lot of power and I walked into a punch you don't see
but I was controlling the fight real easy and keeping away from his
power until I got cocky. I started fooling around too much,
probably. I got careless. I'd like to have a rematch but I know a
lot of other people want a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is a new fact of Tyson's boxing life. Opponents
always have wanted to sign to fight him, but few besides Buster
Douglas and Holyfield actually wanted to fight him. Now they all
do, which means life just became much more difficult for a man who
always has been a small heavyweight made to look bigger by an aura
of intimidation that won him many fights before they had begun. As
Tyson's trainer, Tommy Brooks, said several weeks ago, ``That's
gone. Now he has to learn how to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, it is difficult to learn those lessons under the white
heat of a heavyweight assault. You may look good in the gym, as
Tyson did, but when the fight comes and your opponent is coming
forward instead of backing up and punching rather than covering up,
you forget those gym lessons quickly and revert to what you are _
which in Tyson's case is a one-punch knockout artist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most ominous for the future was that at the end of the
first round, the two fighters engaged in a brutal moment of
violence in which Tyson seemed to suddenly lose it just as he had
in the Holyfield rematch, twisting Botha's arm against his side as
the bell rang. When later told Botha accused him of trying to break
it, Tyson said, ``He's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   A second later, Tyson pushed his left forearm into Botha's
throat as Botha hollered and tried to free himself. When he could
not, he hit Tyson after the bell and both corners emptied while
police rushed the ring apron and surrounded it, fearing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Had referee Richard Steele wanted to disqualify Tyson right then
he could have but he did not and a round later Tyson was screaming
at him, claiming Botha was headbutting. Tyson made the same false
charges against Holyfield yet after the fight was over his new
manager, Shelly Finkel, said ``a lot of things were done in there
but the best part was Mike's composure was there early.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel did not explain if that was before or after the cops
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When order was restored, the second round began with a clearly
wild-eyed Tyson whistling amateurish punches well over Botha's
head, losing his balance and stumbling several times when he did.
More and more the two began to wrestle in the clinches until Tyson
tried to push Botha in the face with an open glove and Steele took
a point away from him. This is composure?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Tyson did solve Botha and when he did he had a
moment of clarity. Later he would say he never realized he had
thrown the lethal right hand that dropped Botha at his feet like an
unwanted leaflet and he was not lying. Punches like that come from
instinct, not plann

ELWAYS-REEVES FEUD A SPICY DISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a Super Bowl if there weren't a few sweet
storylines emanating from the NFL Palace.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks between now and kickoff of Super Bowl XXXIII,
also known as the longest fortnight, you will be treated to the
literally heart-rendering story of Dan Reeves, the last ride of
John Elway, the Lourdes miracle that is Chris Chandler, and the
up-from-pigeonhood saga of the Dirty Birdz.
</P>
<P>
   But at the risk of interrupting the league's bliss, this Super
Bowl will also offer something hot and sweaty, something that's
been missing on Super Sunday since the AFL's grubby Jets
cold-cocked the NFL's arrogant Colts 30 years ago: malice and
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Malice might be too cold a word, especially in light of Reeves,
the Falcons coach, going from ICU to SB. But retribution fits.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, Elway and Mike Shanahan once worked together in Denver.
Reeves was the coach who took the team to three Super Bowls. Elway
was the league's best clutch quarterback. Shanahan was the
innovative strategist. Sometime in 1991, this triangle blew apart
like a natural-gas explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 season, which ended with a AFC title game loss to
Buffalo, Reeves fired Shanahan, claiming the assistant coach had
overstepped his authority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Elway and Reeves feuded daily, leading to a
playoff-less 8-8 season and Reeves' firing by Broncos owner Pat
Bowlen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Elway brayed that playing under Reeves had been
``hell'' and that Reeves' conservative style had held Elway and the
Broncos back all those years. Reeves responded by calling Elway a
spoiled brat, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Shanahan, fresh from three successful years with the
49ers, returned to Denver as head coach, which was all Reeves
needed to support his decision to fire Shanahan in the first place.
Shanahan obviously learned a few things in his year-plus as the
sorcerer's apprentice with the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are excellent that the participants of this mess will
try to gloss over it as much as possible. The NFL might promote the
War Theatre philosophy to attract fans, but it actually hates
infighting (see Al Davis v. NFL, et al).
</P>
<P>
   But there is no love lost here. Reeves, less verbose, has
limited his comments of late to sarcastic digs. Back in August,
Reeves said Chandler throws the best deep ball of any quarterback
he's ever worked with. His praise of Chandler after Sunday's upset
of Minnesota focused on his ability to play within himself and the
team's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In their three years together at the top of the Broncos food
chain, years that have seen the Broncos transform their image from
mules to stallions, Shanahan and Elway talked up the new era at the
expense of the old.
</P>
<P>
   Elway said Reeves' philosophy was physically draining _ play
conservative on offense, nibble for field position, take advantage
of turnovers, stay in the game, and then storm the goal line in one
all-out push if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drains you,'' said Elway during his run to the Super Bowl
last year. And here you thought he enjoyed his 40-plus comeback
wins. ``I hated that, always having to stay close, stay close, stay
close until Dan would say, `OK, go ahead and win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just the drive. I'd be pacing the sidelines during
the entire game wondering how I was supposed to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has since admitted he often blew off some of Reeves' play
calls, most often by ad-libbing in the pocket. Shannon Sharpe,
Elway's favorite receiver and The Human Quote around Denver,
described Reeves' use of Elway thusly: ``It was like making Picasso
paint with a spray can.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has said there isn't a NFL passing record Elway
wouldn't own if he had played in a system that used his talents
rather than neutered them. ``And no one but Elway could have taken
those (Broncos) teams to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Those teams would be Reeves' three Broncos teams that were
impaled in Super Bowls _ 39-20 by the New York Giants, 42-10 by
Washington and 55-10 by San Francisco. In Denver, the history of
Orange Crushed was demoralizing enough for the franchise to shed
its trademark orange jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides prepare to stare at each other, there is
probably some truth in both sides of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Elway has benefited from the change. The offense is
more wide open and the Broncos now go for the jugular in the first
quarter. Elway's yardage, touchdowns and efficiency rating have all
improved the last three years, and his interceptions are down.
</P>
<P>
   Elway also has better personnel around him, notably the
franchise's best running back ever, Terrell Davis, and receivers
Sharpe and Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves can also point to Davis as the big difference in
Denver. It wasn't necessarily Reeves' fault that he was never in
draft position to get any back better than Sammy Winder, or any
receivers taller than the smurf-like Three Amigos.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in the Super Bowl supports his philosophy that a
running game, some Art Shell-instructed linemen and a quarterback
who doesn't beat you can take you a long way. In the shallow water
that is quarterbacking in the NFL, The Dirty Birdz are a tonic to
all teams that do not have an Elway.
</P>
<P>
   There are a half-dozen other subplots which enrich the
anticipation, including Chandler and Denver's Howard Griffith
staging their own little Los Angeles Rams alumni meeting, and the
vision of Shanahan and Shell on opposite sidelines of a Super Bowl.
The Silver and Black are back, they're just not in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But the vicious triangle that is Reeves, Shanahan and Elway is
keenest. Having seen too many boring Super Bowls, you'll forgive me
if I pass the sugar and go right for the hot stuff.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least the suspense is over. On Jan. 13 Gustavo Franco,
Brazil's central-bank governor, resigned and his successor allowed
the country's currency, the real, to devalue by over 8 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's giant, the eighth-biggest economy in the world,
which only two months ago won a $41.5 billion international support
package to defend the real, has admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Warsaw, financial markets shuddered, fearing
possible contagion from a Brazilian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a single question haunts investors and
policymakers alike. Will a Brazilian devaluation precipitate global
financial meltdown?
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely three months ago, when markets were at their most
jittery, that seemed a strong possibility. Whether it remains so
depends on two other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will Brazil be able to control this devaluation, to regain
investor confidence and to continue with its economic reforms _ or
will it descend into Asian-style chaos? And will the rest of the
world react calmly or panic?
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Brazil should gain from a cheaper currency. The
real was widely thought to be overvalued and speculation about
devaluation was rife.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Brazil's interest rates remain so high (the
benchmark rate is 29 percent, despite falling prices) is that
investors were demanding compensation for the risk of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, now that the devaluation has happened, Brazil's
exporters should become more competitive and interest rates should
come down.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of reigniting inflation, even in inflation-prone
Brazil, seems low in an economy that is now heading for a deep
recession. And since the Brazilians still have some $35 billion of
reserves left (even without the international package) there is
plenty of ammunition with which to defend the real.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, then, Brazil should be able to manage a
controlled devaluation, just as it did in 1995 after Mexico's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is too sanguine. Brazil was forced to devalue this week
because investors had lost confidence in the government's ability
to tackle the country's main problem: fiscal profligacy,
particularly a public-sector deficit running last year at 8 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of the real in 1994, Brazilian
politicians have bet that high interest rates and a stable exchange
rate would keep inflation at bay and attract enough foreign money
to allow budget reforms to work slowly through the country's
political labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   That bet has been lost, partly because sentiment about emerging
markets has soured so spectacularly and partly because the
Brazilians have so conspicuously failed to deliver on their fiscal
promises, even after they were hauled back from the brink by the
promised $41.5 billion of loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months the government has proved politically
weak (it failed to muster a simple parliamentary majority to raise
civil-service pension contributions), incompetent (it bungled the
renewal of a tax on financial transactions) and unable to restrain
free-booting state governments (witness last week's partial debt
moratorium by the state of Minas Gerais).
</P>
<P>
   These failings have not been solved by a devaluation that may
turn out to have been too modest. Instead, the government's
domestic credibility has taken a hammering.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is indelibly linked with a
strong real, a policy he himself invented. Only a year ago in an
interview with The Economist, Cardoso made clear that devaluation,
whenever it took place, would be a ``political disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: it is hard to see a weakened Cardoso administration
credibly implementing the fiscal measures needed to restore
confidence. Much as a controlled devaluation and a return of
investor confidence would be welcome, the chances of either seem
pretty slim.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is what international impact a Brazilian crisis
will have. Certainly markets are calmer than they were in October.
Wall Street has surged back (and beyond) its 1998 jitters.
Investors are no longer eschewing all risk in debt markets; even
emerging economies are gradually regaining access to world capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the stability is still fragile. America's economy is relying
ever more heavily on a stock market-fuelled consumption boom, and
the stock market itself has reached ever more surreal heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's travails are far from over; China looks increasingly
ropy. Within Latin America, the uncertainties that Brazil has this
week created could push several countries into recession, perhaps
into financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the ingredients for global meltdown remain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can be avoided will depend primarily on whether
markets still believe in international policymakers, especially the
IMF and America's Treasury. Yet it is hard to see how investors can
have much faith in either. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. UNCUT VERSION IS 1,150 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Superficially, at least, Brazil seems to be just one more in a
string of IMF debacles. As in Russia, attempts to shore up an
exchange-rate peg with high interest rates and promises of
financial support have failed. In many eyes, the IMF will have lost
as much credibility as the Cardoso government.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining it will not be easy. The most important step must be
to revamp the details of Brazil's IMF agreement. Provided that
Brazil regains its nerve on fiscal policy and makes every effort to
pass the tough measures it promised, the loan package should stay
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brazil fail to deliver on its promises, however, it would
clearly be wrong to throw good money after bad. But for now, the
presumption ought to be that the government will seek to salvage
things.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   At least the suspense is over. On Jan. 13 Gustavo Franco,
Brazil's central-bank governor, resigned and his successor allowed
the country's currency, the real, to devalue by over 8 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's giant, the eighth-biggest economy in the world,
which only two months ago won a $41.5 billion international support
package to defend the real, has admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Warsaw, financial markets shuddered, fearing
possible contagion from a Brazilian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a single question haunts investors and
policymakers alike. Will a Brazilian devaluation precipitate global
financial meltdown?
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely three months ago, when markets were at their most
jittery, that seemed a strong possibility. Whether it remains so
depends on two other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will Brazil be able to control this devaluation, to regain
investor confidence and to continue with its economic reforms _ or
will it descend into Asian-style chaos? And will the rest of the
world react calmly or panic?
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Brazil should gain from a cheaper currency. The
real was widely thought to be overvalued and speculation about
devaluation was rife.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Brazil's interest rates remain so high (the
benchmark rate is 29 percent, despite falling prices) is that
investors were demanding compensation for the risk of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, now that the devaluation has happened, Brazil's
exporters should become more competitive and interest rates should
come down.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of reigniting inflation, even in inflation-prone
Brazil, seems low in an economy that is now heading for a deep
recession. And since the Brazilians still have some $35 billion of
reserves left (even without the international package) there is
plenty of ammunition with which to defend the real.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, then, Brazil should be able to manage a
controlled devaluation, just as it did in 1995 after Mexico's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is too sanguine. Brazil was forced to devalue this week
because investors had lost confidence in the government's ability
to tackle the country's main problem: fiscal profligacy,
particularly a public-sector deficit running last year at 8 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of the real in 1994, Brazilian
politicians have bet that high interest rates and a stable exchange
rate would keep inflation at bay and attract enough foreign money
to allow budget reforms to work slowly through the country's
political labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   That bet has been lost, partly because sentiment about emerging
markets has soured so spectacularly and partly because the
Brazilians have so conspicuously failed to deliver on their fiscal
promises, even after they were hauled back from the brink by the
promised $41.5 billion of loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months the government has proved politically
weak (it failed to muster a simple parliamentary majority to raise
civil-service pension contributions), incompetent (it bungled the
renewal of a tax on financial transactions) and unable to restrain
free-booting state governments (witness last week's partial debt
moratorium by the state of Minas Gerais).
</P>
<P>
   These failings have not been solved by a devaluation that may
turn out to have been too modest. Instead, the government's
domestic credibility has taken a hammering.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is indelibly linked with a
strong real, a policy he himself invented. Only a year ago in an
interview with The Economist, Cardoso made clear that devaluation,
whenever it took place, would be a ``political disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: it is hard to see a weakened Cardoso administration
credibly implementing the fiscal measures needed to restore
confidence. Much as a controlled devaluation and a return of
investor confidence would be welcome, the chances of either seem
pretty slim.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is what international impact a Brazilian crisis
will have. Certainly markets are calmer than they were in October.
Wall Street has surged back (and beyond) its 1998 jitters.
Investors are no longer eschewing all risk in debt markets; even
emerging economies are gradually regaining access to world capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the stability is still fragile. America's economy is relying
ever more heavily on a stock market-fuelled consumption boom, and
the stock market itself has reached ever more surreal heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's travails are far from over; China looks increasingly
ropy. Within Latin America, the uncertainties that Brazil has this
week created could push several countries into recession, perhaps
into financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the ingredients for global meltdown remain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can be avoided will depend primarily on whether
markets still believe in international policymakers, especially the
IMF and America's Treasury. Yet it is hard to see how investors can
have much faith in either. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. UNCUT VERSION IS 1,150 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Superficially, at least, Brazil seems to be just one more in a
string of IMF debacles. As in Russia, attempts to shore up an
exchange-rate peg with high interest rates and promises of
financial support have failed. In many eyes, the IMF will have lost
as much credibility as the Cardoso government.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining it will not be easy. The most important step must be
to revamp the details of Brazil's IMF agreement. Provided that
Brazil regains its nerve on fiscal policy and makes every effort to
pass the tough measures it promised, the loan package should stay
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brazil fail to deliver on its promises, however, it would
clearly be wrong to throw good money after bad. But for now, the
presumption ought to be that the government will seek to salvage
things.
</P>
<P>
   The best course for the outside world is to go on supporting it
in those efforts _ so long as they seem sincere. Indeed outsiders
could go further, by putting pressure on international bankers not
to pull all Brazil's credit lines.

<P>
   HURRICANE-MIGRANTS (Tapachula, Mexico) _ Spurred by the ravages
of Hurricane Mitch, Central American migrants are now crossing the
Guatemalan border with Mexico and heading to the United States in
alarming numbers, officials say. By Ginger Thompson. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-ARCTIC (Igloolik, Northwest Territories) _ During the
Arctic's ``great darkness'' the sun does not appear at all for
seven weeks. The day the sun finally did emerge from the horizon
was the most important day of the year for Igloolik's eskimos. Now,
after years of neglect, some of the old ceremonies that used to
welcome the sun's return are coming back. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-TRASH-VIRGINIA (New York) _ Yes, Virginia, there is a lot of
trash in New York. And getting rid of it is a problem. But where to
go? A look at why nobody in the Old Dominion wants Gotham's
garbage. &UR;  &LR; By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   MISLEADING-MORTGAGES (New York) _ A mortgage lender named Delta
Funding has made a profitable business of loaning money in poor
neighborhoods, where many homeowners can't afford to make their
monthly payments and thus default, losing their homes. Delta is
affiliated with Bankers Trust, and its business has drawn the
attention of law enforcement officials and low-income housing
advocates, who contend that the company is violating federal and
state laws by misleading borrowers and signing homeowners up for
mortgages they cannot afford. &UR;  &LR; By Randy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   SANFRAN-SPCA (San Francisco) _ San Francisco's SPCA not only has
a no-kill policy for the pets left with it, but plush
accommodations for them, too. Now it has $200 million to take
no-kill national. By Evelyn Nieves. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-POLITICS (Philadelphia ) _ Philadelphia has come a long
way with Ed Rendell, one of the nation's best-known mayors, leading
it, but now that he's not seeking re-election, the city trembles a
bit as it waits to see the candidates who would succeed him. By
Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GUNSALES (Los Angeles) _ Acting on a growing body of
research showing that gun dealers are selling firearms into an
illegal black market, the Los Angeles City Council is about to
limit gun buyers in the city to one gun per month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LEGAL (Undated) _ After three days of impeachment
arguments from the House managers, constitutional law scholars said
the presentations last week gave the strongest legal arguments yet
against Clinton. But in a series of interviews over the weekend
that amounted to evaluations of the House's impeachment case so
far, some legal authorities generally agreed that if the House
Republicans made any headway in their case against the president,
it was merely in a subtle shifting of emphasis that could easily
shift again. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMPAIGN-MONEY (Washington) _ The compressed calendar of primaries
and possibly the most wide-open race for the White House in decades
has set off a frenzy among Republican and Democratic prospects who
believe they must begin to raise money almost immediately or they
may find it impossible to catch up. In many ways, this year is more
crucial than 2000 in determining whom the two parties will
nominate, because as experts in both parties agree, for now the
survival of candidates comes down not to issue stands or personal
appeal, but to who has enough money. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-SPENDING (Washington) _ Not much has changed in the
office deep inside the Pentagon where Franklin C. Spinney has
worked ever since he had a few moments of notoriety in the 1980s
with this shocking assessment: the more Reagan spent on defense,
the less the military was ready to fight. Nearly two decades later,
Clinton has proposed the largest increase in Pentagon spending
since those heady days, and to Spinney (and a few stray voices in
Washington), the same is true today. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VODAFONE-AIRTOUCH-TALKS (Undated) _ It took two weeks of
all-night strategy sessions and telephone calls between
sleep-deprived executives in four time zones for Vodafone to woo
Airtouch from the embrace of Bell Atlantic. Vodafone prevailed and
last Friday announced a $60 billion Vodafone-Airtouch combination
that will create a global wireless powerhouse to rival
telecommunications blockbusters like AT&AMP;T or British
Telecommunications. By Laura Holson. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   AIRTOUCH-GINN-PROFILE (Los Angeles) _ Sam Ginn's gamble has paid
off, in a huge way. With the acquisition of Airtouch Communications
Inc. by Vodafone Group PLC, Ginn, the chairman and chief executive
of Airtouch, will walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars
from stock and options he owns. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TABLOIDS-MEDIA (Undated) _ At the very moment when tabloid
topics have become big news on the most respected television news
programs, the generation of shows that spawned the term ``tabloid
television'' is dying. From a heyday when there were a half-dozen
such shows, only three remain. Tabloid TV news magazines have
withered because certain kinds of tabloid-style stories have
migrated to the traditional news organizations. By Laurie Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   TV-HITS-MEDIA (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Maybe network television can
still produce hits after all. In five days, three networks started
new series and all of them scored ratings that would qualify them
as significant hits, by far the biggest new hits of what has been a
woebegone television season. By Bill Carter.

<P>
   For a brief moment, harmony prevailed. On Jan. 8 the Senate
agreed unanimously on the rules that would govern Bill Clinton's
trial, and senators congratulated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be like their colleagues in the House, both
Republican and Democratic, who had turned the president's
impeachment into something resembling warfare. They would show that
the upper chamber was a civil and responsible place, and that the
trial of a president was a sober judicial proceeding. And all would
be well.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for good intentions. As Bill Clinton's trial opens in
earnest, the two sides are lining up again. The Democrats see no
need to call witnesses; the Republicans consider that this will not
be a proper trial without them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are convinced that Clinton has done nothing to
deserve removal from office; many Republicans see this as their
last chance to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   The party's diehards detest this man not just for his ideology
(which, after all, has sometimes mimicked theirs), not just for the
misdeeds he is charged with, but as a person. And the president's
supporters, in turn, detest his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 trial managers, drawn from the House, are pictured as
sanctimonious hypocrites whose own misdeeds now stand exposed by
the publisher of Hustler magazine and whose impeachment charges, in
the words of a Democratic senator, Tom Harkin, amount to ``a pile
of dung.''
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment process against a president is inevitably
political; but it does not have to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   The articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon were voted
almost unanimously. The feeling was one of immense pride that the
Constitution worked, and could efficiently remove a bad apple from
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the impeachment procedures against Clinton have
been so partisan that they have had the opposite effect. They do
not prove that the system works; they seem merely to prove that it
can be abused by zealots on both the Republican and Democratic
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship already has a bad name in America. The public
associates it with gridlock, and is happiest when centrists in each
party make pacts with each other. Yet in recent years, for many
reasons, American politics has become more strident and divided,
and often along personal rather than ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for Congress must appeal for funds continually from
the most committed (and often more extreme) members of their
parties. At the same time, they must grab the attention of the
majority, who do not vote at all, with ten-second soundbites and
30-second negative commercials. In the past year, the president's
bad behavior has hardened attitudes still further.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sort of partisanship that is useful, indeed
essential, to the government of democracies: the friction of
different, but considered, points of view, as a result of which
problems are solved and excesses kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard-hitting, but it keeps to the high ground; it has
nothing to do with personal vendettas. And it is in short supply
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are no longer sure where either party, but especially
the Republican one, stands on the issues that concern them: reform
of entitlements, education, health care, the role of government.
</P>
<P>
   They have been treated to a brand of partisanship that is mostly
destructive. As they see it, the impeachment process is a nasty
game being played in Washington, which has nothing to do with them
and makes little difference to the smooth running of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they are right. America's economy booms along
without hindrance; the states bask in budget surpluses; crime is
falling, jobs are growing. In most people's lives, most of the
time, Washington is indeed a sideshow, and even an economic
downturn or a foreign-policy crisis would give it only a temporary
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet democracy is hardly healthy when most Americans want no part
of politics, abandoning it instead to the destroyers and the
bigots. Perhaps this trial, founded fast in personal animosity as
well as presidential misdeeds, will finally wake them up. &QL;

<P>
   Who will bring peace to Africa? From north to south, east to
west, large swathes of the continent are at war, but almost all
efforts at pacification have come to naught.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, a ragged rebel movement has given the
Nigerian-led intervention force a fearful drubbing. In Angola,
faced by the determination of both sides to start fighting yet
again, the United Nations' secretary-general may soon recommend the
withdrawal of the U.N. force monitoring what is supposed to be a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   To send foreign soldiers, whether African or not, to intervene
in any of the continent's manifold disputes looks ever more
hopeless, ever more foolish.
</P>
<P>
   For America, Somalia was the turning point. When 18 crack
American soldiers died there in one disastrous night in October
1993, the intervention force of which they were a part was pulled
out and the Americans resolved never to intervene in Africa again.
Next year came genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   When the full enormity of the killing there became clear,
western governments had a rethink. They were still unwilling to
send their own troops to stop African wars, and had little faith in
the U.N., so they promoted regional peacekeeping: the neighbors
should police their own block.
</P>
<P>
   America, France and Britain started to train African armies in
peacekeeping techniques. Unfortunately, the programs were not
coordinated and American money soon ran out. Some of the countries
given peacekeeping training, such as Senegal and Zimbabwe, then
went off to fight wars of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Regional forces have now intervened in five African wars. In
none have they been neutral, always weighing in on one side or the
other _ and not always backing the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberia, the West African peacekeeping force was itself
divided over whom to support. The Nigerians, who came to dominate
it, changed sides to back the man they had earlier tried to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia claimed a mandate
from the Southern African Development Community to intervene in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, another member, vigorously disagreed but then
claimed a similar mandate when it intervened in Lesotho last
September.
</P>
<P>
   These interventions have received no official blessing from the
U.N. The world has generally supported Nigeria's attempts to beat
the rebels in Sierra Leone but frowned on the intervention in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself, which at present has four missions in Africa,
is not fighting or even keeping the peace, merely observing. Its
attempt to bring peace to Sierra Leone has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In Western Sahara and the Central African Republic, U.N.
missions are stuck while one party exploits their presence to
strengthen its own position. The mission in Angola hangs in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique provides the only recent example of successful
peacekeeping in Africa. There a nasty civil war ended, the rebels
stood for election, lost and became a loyalish opposition. But the
success owed less to effective peacekeeping than to the commitment
of both sides to make the peace deal work.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that, in a continent where guns are plentiful and
guerrillas can operate with relative ease, the only kind of force _
African or not _ that is likely to be successful is one which is
monitoring an existing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it must be an agreement that all sides genuinely want
to last. Africa must get more of these if it is ever to have more
peace. &QL;

<P>
   Who will bring peace to Africa? From north to south, east to
west, large swathes of the continent are at war, but almost all
efforts at pacification have come to naught.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, a ragged rebel movement has given the
Nigerian-led intervention force a fearful drubbing. In Angola,
faced by the determination of both sides to start fighting yet
again, the United Nations' secretary-general may soon recommend the
withdrawal of the U.N. force monitoring what is supposed to be a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   To send foreign soldiers, whether African or not, to intervene
in any of the continent's manifold disputes looks ever more
hopeless, ever more foolish.
</P>
<P>
   For America, Somalia was the turning point. When 18 crack
American soldiers died there in one disastrous night in October
1993, the intervention force of which they were a part was pulled
out and the Americans resolved never to intervene in Africa again.
Next year came genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   When the full enormity of the killing there became clear,
western governments had a rethink. They were still unwilling to
send their own troops to stop African wars, and had little faith in
the U.N., so they promoted regional peacekeeping: the neighbors
should police their own block.
</P>
<P>
   America, France and Britain started to train African armies in
peacekeeping techniques. Unfortunately, the programs were not
coordinated and American money soon ran out. Some of the countries
given peacekeeping training, such as Senegal and Zimbabwe, then
went off to fight wars of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Regional forces have now intervened in five African wars. In
none have they been neutral, always weighing in on one side or the
other _ and not always backing the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberia, the West African peacekeeping force was itself
divided over whom to support. The Nigerians, who came to dominate
it, changed sides to back the man they had earlier tried to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia claimed a mandate
from the Southern African Development Community to intervene in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, another member, vigorously disagreed but then
claimed a similar mandate when it intervened in Lesotho last
September.
</P>
<P>
   These interventions have received no official blessing from the
U.N. The world has generally supported Nigeria's attempts to beat
the rebels in Sierra Leone but frowned on the intervention in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself, which at present has four missions in Africa,
is not fighting or even keeping the peace, merely observing. Its
attempt to bring peace to Sierra Leone has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In Western Sahara and the Central African Republic, U.N.
missions are stuck while one party exploits their presence to
strengthen its own position. The mission in Angola hangs in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique provides the only recent example of successful
peacekeeping in Africa. There a nasty civil war ended, the rebels
stood for election, lost and became a loyalish opposition. But the
success owed less to effective peacekeeping than to the commitment
of both sides to make the peace deal work.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that, in a continent where guns are plentiful and
guerrillas can operate with relative ease, the only kind of force _
African or not _ that is likely to be successful is one which is
monitoring an existing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it must be an agreement that all sides genuinely want
to last. Africa must get more of these if it is ever to have more
peace. &QL;

CORRETJA AND VENUS WILLIAMS SURVIVE OPENING ROUND
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-AUSTRALIAN-OPEN, which focuses on Sampras
withdrawing and does not contain results; Monday is cq in 4th
graf.)

 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The opening day of the year's opening
Grand Slam tournament did not begin with major upsets, but that
does not mean it was lacking for surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have expected a slender Croatian with a ranking of 82
to get within 2 points of beating fifth-seeded Venus Williams in a
marathon third set? Or for a Japanese man playing in his first
Grand Slam event to serve for the match in the fourth set against
second-seeded Alex Corretja?
</P>
<P>
   But in a global sport, there are no shortages of potential
hazards for the stars, and though Takao Suzuki and Silvija Talaja
could not finish what they had started, neither Williams nor
Corretja will forget their opponents' games or names soon.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won her match Monday on Court 1 by 3-6, 6-3, 9-7.
Corretja won his on Center Court, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say which seeded player had the more
difficult time on a day when the sun shone brightly but the
temperatures did not soar.
</P>
<P>
   Williams began her 1999 Grand Slam season in a black and red
ensemble that left most of her back exposed. But her tennis was not
quite as striking as her attire. She made a rash of unforced errors
and struggled with her serve against Talaja, a steady 20-year-old
baseliner with a wicked backhand and a combative temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Talaja has won only one match in a Grand Slam event, but she
might have won more if not for a right shoulder injury that forced
her to miss nearly six months of activity at the end of 1997 and
the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She has now recovered, and she tracked down Williams's powerful
ground strokes in the corners throughout the match. She could not
find a way to close out the match against the younger yet much more
experienced Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Croatian would come was in the third set when
Williams served to stay in the match at 4-5 and quickly fell behind
by 0-30 on her serve. But Williams would win the next 4 points to
get even. She was still a long way from getting to the second
round. She served for the match for the first time at 7-6 but
squandered two match points at 40-15, the second with a double
fault, and Talaja then finished off the break.
</P>
<P>
   Williams returned the favor in the next game and this time, she
did not flinch when she served for the match. When it ended, she
thrust both long arms into the air with relief. The Croatian fans
were no longer waving their national flags.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a few Japanese flags in motion on Center Court
earlier in the afternoon. No Japanese man had won a match at the
Australian Open since 1989, and though Suzuki could not put an end
to that losing streak, he came close enough to make Corretja very
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for my chance, and I have to say that I was
almost done,'' Corretja said.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, the 118th-ranked player in the world, served for the
match at 5-4 in the fourth set. The quick young man from Sapporo
had gotten to that point by playing like the Australians of yore,
serving and rushing the net with regularity and success, knocking
away tightly angled volleys and reading Corretja's normally passing
shots consistently well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was playing fantastic tennis,'' Corretja said.
</P>
<P>
   But Corretja has experienced a lot more pressure-filled moments
in his career than Suzuki, who was making his Grand Slam debut in
front of a large crowd on Centre Court. At 15-15, the genial
Spaniard would finally take control. He won the first point after
hitting an odd, looping backhand return that landed on the line and
forced Suzuki to retreat and fire up a weak lob. He won the next
point with a swashbuckling forehand pass down the line. He then
broke Suzuki's serve by passing him down the line with a backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that even if you are struggling and you
trust in yourself, good things can happen,'' Corretja said.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The ATP Tour Player Council announced on Monday that it would
support an increase in the ban from one years to two years for
players who test positive for a Class I performance-enhancing
substance. The International Tennis Federation has announced its
support for the change, which would bring tennis in line with most
other Olympic sports and satisfy the International Olympic
Committee's demand for uniformity as it prepares to host a drug
conference in early February. The Women's Tennis Association has
expressed preliminary support for the increase but has yet to
announce a final position.  &QL;

<P>
   Praise be to Michael Jordan. At long last a grateful nation has
a good reason to turn its attention from the travails of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's transcendent star is at last retiring. This week,
even the expectation of such an announcement was enough to claim
front-page coverage, first spot on the television news and a sober
lead editorial in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Surely only insensitive curmudgeons, remote from the feelings of
ordinary folk, will argue that the priorities were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some non-sporting innocents will still need convincing. To
them basketball is just a game in which very tall men crowd on to a
rather small court to bounce a ball and then throw it through a
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Why these physical freaks should be paid so much (the average
salary in the National Basketball Association last year was $2.6
million, and Jordan's was an astounding $33 million, to which he
added more than $40 million in commercial endorsements) is a
mystery explicable only by the bizarre economics of television and
the willingness of young men to buy overpriced sneakers as though
clothes alone will help them emulate their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these innocents have a point. Even the sport's fans have
been bemused over the past few months by a self-destructive dispute
between owners and players which, it was accurately argued, boiled
down to a wrangle between short billionaires and tall millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two points they neglect. The first is the sheer
athleticism of the sport. No other American sport, certainly not
football, with its regimented moves, or baseball, with its tedious
longueurs, has the same combination of sustained physical grace,
effort, creativity and personality.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the slender Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers draw
away from his marker and score from the three-point line is to see
poetic elegance; to watch Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks play
on despite a recently fractured wrist is to see a courage money
does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   The second point is Jordan himself. ``His Airness'' (the title
is thanks to his gravity-defying slam-dunks and jump shots, and the
Air sports shoes that Nike named after him) is a star who deserves
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the evidence is statistical: five times the league's
most valuable player; six times a championship winner with the
Chicago Bulls; twice an Olympic gold medallist.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement press conference, the Bulls' owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, described him as ``simply the best player who ever put
on a basketball uniform.'' With due respect to Wilt Chamberlain and
Magic Johnson, Reinsdorf is right.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It is true that America, in contrast to those
countries that meanly cut their stars down to size (Australians
call it ``the tall poppy syndrome''), is a country happy to be
star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to be a star is to outshine the competition, which
for America's values is an essential attribute; hence the ready
acceptance of salaries for corporate chieftains that elsewhere
would seem quite grossly excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in America, Jordan seems an exceptional star. Would
the retirement of Bill Gates, richer even than Jordan, command
quite such rapt attention? Possibly not.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gates is simply an exceptional example of a common
phenomenon, the successful white businessman. Michael, as his fans
tend to call him, is also a successful businessman, but he is a
black one, and that combination is dispiritingly uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Black stars shine mostly in sports and show business, and even
there precious few appeal to the white majority.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali is one, but only since the baby-boomer generation
reached maturity and disregarded their elders' fears of Ali's Islam
and his opposition to the Vietnam war. O.J. Simpson was another,
but that lasted only until his trial for murder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jordan's reach beyond the boundaries of race is
unqualified: his shaven head is a poster icon for black and white
alike (one piece of market research found that the back of his head
is more recognized than the faces of Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich
and Jesus Christ).
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the basketball court has helped a sport that is
80 percent black win an audience that is 80 percent white; and the
products he endorses, from Gatorade soft drinks to MCI telephone
services, are aimed at the whole nation, not just its black
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Fortune magazine analyzed what it called ``the
Jordan effect,'' it calculated that, since joining the NBA in 1984,
he had brought the league some $10 billion in tickets, TV revenues
and merchandise sales _ only a small part of which can have come
from America's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Jordan's multiracial appeal should be no mystery at
all. In a sport in which too many players are ill-educated or badly
behaved, the articulate Michael embodies virtues that pretty well
all Americans can identify with: an extraordinary discipline and
work ethic, enabling him to be the best in his field even at the
age of 35; an ability to inspire his colleagues; and a will to win
so strong that in one session of the 1997 finals against the Utah
Jazz he played a winning game despite a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? Unlike most sportsmen, Jordan has retired at the
top (his very last shot was the one that last year won the NBA
championship with just 6.6 seconds left to play).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, the greatest running back in professional football,
is another black American who retired at the top; he then went on
to be a movie star and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown this week had some cautionary words in the New York Times
for well-paid black athletes in white-controlled sports: ``They
keep saying the owners should hire more black coaches, but even if
you had all black coaches, that's not helping black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that the owners and the agents control the
black athlete. The athletes should take the bull by the horns and
have more control over their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Will His Airness take up the challenge? It would be progress for
all Americans if the short white billionaires in the owners' box
were to be joined at last by a tall black one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Praise be to Michael Jordan. At long last a grateful nation has
a good reason to turn its attention from the travails of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's transcendent star is at last retiring. This week,
even the expectation of such an announcement was enough to claim
front-page coverage, first spot on the television news and a sober
lead editorial in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Surely only insensitive curmudgeons, remote from the feelings of
ordinary folk, will argue that the priorities were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some non-sporting innocents will still need convincing. To
them basketball is just a game in which very tall men crowd on to a
rather small court to bounce a ball and then throw it through a
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Why these physical freaks should be paid so much (the average
salary in the National Basketball Association last year was $2.6
million, and Jordan's was an astounding $33 million, to which he
added more than $40 million in commercial endorsements) is a
mystery explicable only by the bizarre economics of television and
the willingness of young men to buy overpriced sneakers as though
clothes alone will help them emulate their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these innocents have a point. Even the sport's fans have
been bemused over the past few months by a self-destructive dispute
between owners and players which, it was accurately argued, boiled
down to a wrangle between short billionaires and tall millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two points they neglect. The first is the sheer
athleticism of the sport. No other American sport, certainly not
football, with its regimented moves, or baseball, with its tedious
longueurs, has the same combination of sustained physical grace,
effort, creativity and personality.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the slender Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers draw
away from his marker and score from the three-point line is to see
poetic elegance; to watch Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks play
on despite a recently fractured wrist is to see a courage money
does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   The second point is Jordan himself. ``His Airness'' (the title
is thanks to his gravity-defying slam-dunks and jump shots, and the
Air sports shoes that Nike named after him) is a star who deserves
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the evidence is statistical: five times the league's
most valuable player; six times a championship winner with the
Chicago Bulls; twice an Olympic gold medallist.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement press conference, the Bulls' owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, described him as ``simply the best player who ever put
on a basketball uniform.'' With due respect to Wilt Chamberlain and
Magic Johnson, Reinsdorf is right.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It is true that America, in contrast to those
countries that meanly cut their stars down to size (Australians
call it ``the tall poppy syndrome''), is a country happy to be
star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to be a star is to outshine the competition, which
for America's values is an essential attribute; hence the ready
acceptance of salaries for corporate chieftains that elsewhere
would seem quite grossly excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in America, Jordan seems an exceptional star. Would
the retirement of Bill Gates, richer even than Jordan, command
quite such rapt attention? Possibly not.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gates is simply an exceptional example of a common
phenomenon, the successful white businessman. Michael, as his fans
tend to call him, is also a successful businessman, but he is a
black one, and that combination is dispiritingly uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Black stars shine mostly in sports and show business, and even
there precious few appeal to the white majority.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali is one, but only since the baby-boomer generation
reached maturity and disregarded their elders' fears of Ali's Islam
and his opposition to the Vietnam war. O.J. Simpson was another,
but that lasted only until his trial for murder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jordan's reach beyond the boundaries of race is
unqualified: his shaven head is a poster icon for black and white
alike (one piece of market research found that the back of his head
is more recognized than the faces of Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich
and Jesus Christ).
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the basketball court has helped a sport that is
80 percent black win an audience that is 80 percent white; and the
products he endorses, from Gatorade soft drinks to MCI telephone
services, are aimed at the whole nation, not just its black
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Fortune magazine analyzed what it called ``the
Jordan effect,'' it calculated that, since joining the NBA in 1984,
he had brought the league some $10 billion in tickets, TV revenues
and merchandise sales _ only a small part of which can have come
from America's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Jordan's multiracial appeal should be no mystery at
all. In a sport in which too many players are ill-educated or badly
behaved, the articulate Michael embodies virtues that pretty well
all Americans can identify with: an extraordinary discipline and
work ethic, enabling him to be the best in his field even at the
age of 35; an ability to inspire his colleagues; and a will to win
so strong that in one session of the 1997 finals against the Utah
Jazz he played a winning game despite a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? Unlike most sportsmen, Jordan has retired at the
top (his very last shot was the one that last year won the NBA
championship with just 6.6 seconds left to play).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, the greatest running back in professional football,
is another black American who retired at the top; he then went on
to be a movie star and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown this week had some cautionary words in the New York Times
for well-paid black athletes in white-controlled sports: ``They
keep saying the owners should hire more black coaches, but even if
you had all black coaches, that's not helping black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that the owners and the agents control the
black athlete. The athletes should take the bull by the horns and
have more control over their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Will His Airness take up the challenge? It would be progress for
all Americans if the short white billionaires in the owners' box
were to be joined at last by a tall black one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ William Kelley, chief executive of the University
of Pennsylvania Health System, strides over to his Penn Tower
window and, like a latter-day emperor, reviews his territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1.3 million square feet of new research space in this
campus...We have the advantage here of a fully integrated health
system. We own four hospitals...We take care of 20 percent of the
people in the Greater Philadelphia market.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Schuylkill River, Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief
operating officer of the SmithKline Beecham pharmaceutical company,
does a similar spot of high-rise window-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color of the Schuylkill is different every day. It's an
easy city to commit to,'' he says. ``There are now several hundred
biotech labs around here. There's a critical mass of people trying
to develop drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this really be Philadelphia, Penn., which W.C. Fields (a
humorously ungrateful son of the city) famously said was closed on
Sundays?
</P>
<P>
   True, the city has its Liberty Bell, and a quaint grid of
cobblestoned streets befitting America's first capital. But
Hollywood has engraved into the nation's consciousness a grimmer
image.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s a track-suited Sylvester Stallone sprinted up the
steps of the Museum of Art and became Rocky Balboa, a tough hero
from a tough neighborhood; in the early 1990s Tom Hanks played an
AIDS victim to the plaintive strains of Bruce Springsteen's
``Streets of Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outsiders connect Philadelphia with medical and scientific
excellence; they think, instead, of Boston or of sunny parts of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pity, given that the reality of Philadelphia and its
suburbs is rather more encouraging than the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 80 colleges and universities, churning out
50,000 graduates a year; there are six schools of medicine and 24
teaching hospitals; budding scientific entrepreneurs can seek the
help of bright MBAs from the Wharton School of Business and can tap
the resources ($2.7 billion at the last count) of more than two
dozen venture-capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the birth of companies such as Centocor, which makes drugs
for heart disease and may soon have new ones for colon-rectal and
prostate cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Since like attracts like, it is easy to see how clusters of
excellence form in health care and pharmaceuticals, and in
associated financial and data services.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, for instance, talks of the ``synergies'' with chemical
and bio-engineering schools, notes the competitive success in
getting research money from the National Institutes of Health and
happily provides visitors with a photocopy of a patent for a
``viral-mediated gene transfer system,'' awarded two years ago to
him and two colleagues at Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kelley could work anywhere _ but has chosen
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Others, of course, have chosen to leave: not
necessarily the area, but certainly the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``hollowing-out'' process familiar to older cities across
the nation, much of the white middle class in the 1970s and 1980s
moved to the suburbs, leaving behind a ``core city'' of poor
schooling and inadequate housing and shrinking tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, when Philadelphia had around 2 million residents,
the city's population has slumped by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Vietnam war, the industrialization of Southeast
Asia and then, in the early 1990s, the closing of the naval
shipyard all contributed to the demise of Philadelphia's
labor-intensive manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 20 percent over
the past 30 years in the metropolitan region, and by 50 percent in
the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, barely five years ago, that the city was on the verge
of insolvency, rescued only by bonds issued by the Pennsylvania
Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, a state agency set up to
supervise the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to America's economic boom, those days seem a distant
memory. But not everyone has forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, the city's Democratic mayor since 1992, wins
plaudits from the business community for his energy, his ideas and
his determination (early on he faced down union wage demands and
contracted out city services in 59 different areas).
</P>
<P>
   But he brushes aside the praise. After all, from April, when the
full impact of the 1996 welfare-to-work legislation is felt,
``We'll have to find jobs for 35,000-40,000 mothers. You add these
to the pool and you have a significant problem: 50,000, 60,000,
70,000 looking for jobs that basically don't exist.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite so, because _ despite some intensive remedial work by
private-sector employers such as the Crown Cork &AMP; Seal packaging
company _ most of these job-seekers will have precious few
educational skills, and certainly not the ones that will attract
Kelley and Garnier.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would love to have the powers to run the city's
schools that his counterpart, Richard Daley, has in Chicago,
insisting on benchmark standards and putting an end to the
automatic moving of students up a grade each year; but only if the
state legislature gives him money, too.
</P>
<P>
   That might add up to $300 million, and meanwhile each
schoolchild in the city will get $2,000 less spent on him than a
child in the suburbs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could this change? The pessimists argue that for all its
construction boom (William Penn's statue, once setting a limit to
any building's height, became a relative dwarf more than a decade
ago), Philadelphia is still a laggard, slowed down by a history of
outdated habits and infrastructure that does not apply to sunbelt
cities such as Atlanta or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When a business-promotion association, Greater Philadelphia
First, recently drew up a nationwide ``income-opportunity index''
(relating average wages to living costs), Philadelphia came a
dispiriting 43rd out of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rendell, who is full of bright ideas for channelling
federal tax incentives the city's way, can sound despondent: ``I
have a great frustration, because no matter how hard we work, we're
just staying even.''
</P>
<P>
   But staying even is surely better than going backwards. And if
getting more money is a matter of political persuasion, perhaps
Philadelphia will be better off than most.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in the summer of next year, as the presidential
election looms, Rendell's Philadelphia will play host to the
Republicans' national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to some millennium tourism and perhaps W.C. Fields's
epitaph for himself _ ``I'd rather be in Philadelphia'' _ will not
sound quite so mocking after all. &QL;

   ALTUS, ARK. _ As every oenophile knows, Bill Clinton did not
serve Californian wine at his inauguration. He served Altus
Spumante, which comes from St. Mary's Mountain on the southern
slopes of the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   The winery there, in the northwest corner of Arkansas, is the
oldest and largest in the south-central United States.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas was the first Southern state to produce wine and grape
juice commercially, and it still ranks eighth in the country's
grape production.
</P>
<P>
   Four big wineries, with a total storage capacity of 1.2 million
gallons (4.5 million litres), are located there. The state's 12,800
acres (5,180 hectares) of vineyards are so precious that the
federal government in 1984 declared the land an American
Viticultural Area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the help of new machines developed by researchers at
the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, Arkansas may start to
give better-known wine-producing regions such as California serious
competition.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of experimenting, Justin Morris, a
researcher, and Tommy Oldridge, a farmer, have created a technology
that mechanizes all aspects of growing grapes from shoot- and
fruit-thinning to training up trellises, leaf removal, pruning and
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Different grape species have distinctive growth patterns that
require particular sorts of trellis, and the Morris-Oldridge system
has been perfected for the 12 main combinations of grape species
and trellises.
</P>
<P>
   Italian inventors have come close to doing this, but their work
has involved wine grapes only. The Morris-Oldridge system can be
used for both wine and juice grapes, though not for table grapes,
which require more careful handling.
</P>
<P>
   Many vineyard tasks can be handled by machines, but this
invention is unique because it involves one machine with detachable
parts _ rather like a vacuum cleaner with attachments _ that can be
fitted on to a tractor frame. It is also unique in the number of
trellis types it can handle, including the ``lyre'' trellis, which
is U-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   At present, French-American hybrid vineyards are usually thinned
and pruned by hand to ensure a steady fruit load and a consistently
good grape. This takes 25 worker-hours for every acre. If the
Morris-Oldridge machine comes into commercial use, an acre could be
pruned in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the inventors must get their American and
international patents; and the University of Arkansas, which is
recognized as having one of the best viticulture and oenology
programs east of the Rockies, must find manufacturers for the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   This may take three years. Once the technology is
commercialized, the university_ which employs Morris and is
responsible for the patent work _ will keep 50 percent of the first
$200,000 of royalties and 65 percent of any additional revenue. The
inventors will split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The invention will no doubt help wineries around the world.
Whether it will help Arkansas's own wine industry depends a lot on
Arkansas itself.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature had high hopes for its wine industry in
the 1980s. In 1983, Clinton _ then the state's fun-loving young
governor _ established the Arkansas Wine Producers Council to
promote wine-making and research.
</P>
<P>
   But, although the council was meant to get financing by law, no
money has ever gone in _ or out, for that matter. And Arkansans
wanting to pick up a bottle of wine at a grocery store need not
bother to look for one; the state banned wine sales in such stores
in 1981. &QL;

TCU, FRANCHIONE AGREE ON SEVEN-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 COACH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU and football coach Dennis Franchione
have agreed to a new seven-year contract worth up to $7.3 million,
sources close to the negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   TCU officials have called a news conference for Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's deal will pay him from $700,000 to $900,000 a
season for seven seasons, including incentives for bowl berths,
player graduation rates and conference championships, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   His new contract provides for a $1 million bonus if TCU wins a
national championship. It also includes raises for all of his
assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   TCU Athletic Director Eric Hyman offered no comment last night,
other than to say, ``Look for a major announcement (today) as far
as TCU athletics'' is concerned. Franchione was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Franchione secured a clause that allows him to
leave without penalty for any of four schools: Notre Dame, Texas,
Texas A&AMP;M and Arizona State. TCU, meanwhile, negotiated a stiff
buyout clause as a deterrent for programs looking to raid Fort
Worth when a coaching position opens.
</P>
<P>
   TCU recently finished its first season under Franchione,
improving from 1-10 in 1997 to 7-5, including a 28-19 upset of
Southern California in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione had five years remaining on his previous contract
that paid him approximately $450,000 a season.
</P>
<P>
   TCU officials had been looking for ways to keep Franchione as
the Horned Frogs coach since the Sun Bowl victory, including a plan
to renegotiate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione and Hyman had numerous discussions before an initial
offer was made eight days ago. Negotiations slowed while Franchione
attended a coaches conference in Nashville, Tenn., last week, but
sources said that all sticking points except for a few minor
details, including specifics of the buyout clause, had been worked
out going into this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   TCU waited to announce Franchione's new contract to allow time
for trustees to be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione was repeatedly mentioned as a possible candidate when
jobs opened up at Oklahoma and Colorado after the 1998 season. Iowa
contacted Franchione about interviewing for its football post after
Hayden Fry stepped down, but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   Trustee Malcolm Louden said he hopes that Franchione's new
contract will serve as a sign of the coach's commitment to TCU and
the university's commitment to building a nationally prominent
athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal would seem to put Franchione on a level comparable
with some other high-profile coaches. At Texas, coach Mack Brown
recently signed a 10-year deal increasing his compensation package
to $850,000 a year. Kentucky coach Hal Mumme also signed a contract
extension recently, boosting his salary from $450,000 to $800,000
annually.
</P>
<P>
   And Franchione's contract comes at a crucial time for TCU. The
Horned Frogs are attempting to establish themselves as important
players in Division I athletics before an expected round of
conference realignments begins. TCU has already taken some steps,
including approval in November of $8 million in athletic facilities
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will occur, at least officially, Monday afternoon.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Milken, the junk-bond king who once earned
$500 million in a single year, is now building one of the world's
biggest education companies, Knowledge Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm that strikes fear into
managers the world over, also owns an education company called
KinderCare.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street firms, analysts have taken to issuing breathless
reports making such assertions as ``the education industry is
undergoing a paradigm shift toward privatization and
rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is everybody suddenly so excited? Because of the parallels
they see between education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, health care was mostly stuck in the
public and voluntary sectors. Today it is a multibillion dollar,
largely private, industry.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of rich people _ not just Milken and Henry Kravis, but
also Warren Buffett, Paul Allen, John Doerr and Sam Zell _ are
betting that education is moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Companies from a range of conventional industries are investing
in the business, including Sun, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Sony,
Harcourt General and the Washington Post group.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that the country spends a total of $635
billion a year on education _ more than it devotes to pensions or
defense _ and predicts that spending per pupil will rise by 40
percent over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies currently have only 13 percent of the market _
mostly in the area of training, and most of them mom-and-pop
companies, ripe for consolidation. But International Data
Corporation, a consultancy, reckons that this share will expand to
25 percent over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the new flood of private money is not going into
private schools, which educate just over 10 percent of America's
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s there was much enthusiasm for private
schools. In 1991 Christopher Whittle, a media entrepreneur, and
Benno Schmidt, a former president of Yale University, founded the
Edison Project, with plans to create a chain of 1,000 for-profit
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools have proved unwelcoming territory. Most
existing ones are impossible to buy because they are run by
charitable boards or controlled by the Catholic Church; and their
endowments, which subsidize fees, make them hard to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   So the new education companies are concentrating instead on
lower-hanging fruit. Supplementary services _ mainly testing,
coaching, training and pre-school education _ are one boom area.
</P>
<P>
   As the income gap between high-school and university graduates
grows, so does parents' determination to get their children into
college. And new research on intellectual development, which
stresses the importance of a child's first three years, is also
leading to a craze for ``smart'' kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Systems, a Baltimore-based company founded by
two university dropouts, is the market leader. Testing is its most
profitable business, but it also sells tuition and training. It
thrives on synergies between different areas of education: when a
student flunks a test, its coaching arm can offer to help sort out
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan is also venturing into what could become its biggest
market by far: public education. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's public schools are increasingly frustrating parents
and falling behind international standards. America spends more of
its GDP on education than most countries, yet it gets mediocre
results.
</P>
<P>
   Children in Asia and Europe often trounce their American
counterparts in standardized scholastic tests. More than 40 percent
of American ten-year-olds cannot pass a basic reading test; as many
as 42 million adults are functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this dismal performance is that close to
half the $6,500 spent on each child is eaten up by
``non-instructional services'' _ mostly administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now the barriers between public and private sectors are eroding,
allowing entrepreneurs into the state system. The 1,128 (and
growing) ``charter schools'' are free to experiment with private

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Milken, the junk-bond king who once earned
$500 million in a single year, is now building one of the world's
biggest education companies, Knowledge Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm that strikes fear into
managers the world over, also owns an education company called
KinderCare.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street firms, analysts have taken to issuing breathless
reports making such assertions as ``the education industry is
undergoing a paradigm shift toward privatization and
rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is everybody suddenly so excited? Because of the parallels
they see between education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, health care was mostly stuck in the
public and voluntary sectors. Today it is a multibillion dollar,
largely private, industry.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of rich people _ not just Milken and Henry Kravis, but
also Warren Buffett, Paul Allen, John Doerr and Sam Zell _ are
betting that education is moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Companies from a range of conventional industries are investing
in the business, including Sun, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Sony,
Harcourt General and the Washington Post group.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that the country spends a total of $635
billion a year on education _ more than it devotes to pensions or
defense _ and predicts that spending per pupil will rise by 40
percent over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies currently have only 13 percent of the market _
mostly in the area of training, and most of them mom-and-pop
companies, ripe for consolidation. But International Data
Corporation, a consultancy, reckons that this share will expand to
25 percent over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the new flood of private money is not going into
private schools, which educate just over 10 percent of America's
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s there was much enthusiasm for private
schools. In 1991 Christopher Whittle, a media entrepreneur, and
Benno Schmidt, a former president of Yale University, founded the
Edison Project, with plans to create a chain of 1,000 for-profit
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools have proved unwelcoming territory. Most
existing ones are impossible to buy because they are run by
charitable boards or controlled by the Catholic Church; and their
endowments, which subsidize fees, make them hard to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   So the new education companies are concentrating instead on
lower-hanging fruit. Supplementary services _ mainly testing,
coaching, training and pre-school education _ are one boom area.
</P>
<P>
   As the income gap between high-school and university graduates
grows, so does parents' determination to get their children into
college. And new research on intellectual development, which
stresses the importance of a child's first three years, is also
leading to a craze for ``smart'' kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Systems, a Baltimore-based company founded by
two university dropouts, is the market leader. Testing is its most
profitable business, but it also sells tuition and training. It
thrives on synergies between different areas of education: when a
student flunks a test, its coaching arm can offer to help sort out
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan is also venturing into what could become its biggest
market by far: public education. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's public schools are increasingly frustrating parents
and falling behind international standards. America spends more of
its GDP on education than most countries, yet it gets mediocre
results.
</P>
<P>
   Children in Asia and Europe often trounce their American
counterparts in standardized scholastic tests. More than 40 percent
of American ten-year-olds cannot pass a basic reading test; as many
as 42 million adults are functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this dismal performance is that close to
half the $6,500 spent on each child is eaten up by
``non-instructional services'' _ mostly administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now the barriers between public and private sectors are eroding,
allowing entrepreneurs into the state system. The 1,128 (and
growing) ``charter schools'' are free to experiment with private
management without losing public money.
</P>
<P>
   Some school boards that have contracted out peripheral services
have been so impressed by the results that they are starting to
apply the principle to teaching itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan has won contracts to provide remedial teaching for
disadvantaged children in 17 states, including 13 schools in

front. Milken is convinced that the ``human-capital'' market is as
ripe for revolution as was Wall Street in the 1980s; and he wants
to provide a cradle-to-grave service.
</P>
<P>
   In just 30 months he and his partners _ his brother Lowell and
Larry Ellison, boss of Oracle _ have put together an empire with
annual revenues of more than $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>

   DELHI _ Stepping out of the smog and chaos of Gurgaon, a
commercial outpost of Delhi, and into GE Capital's ``international
services'' division is like crossing several time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The cubicles are techno-anonymous, not Indian drab. The faces
and dress are Indian, but the lingo is American: GE's bright
twentysomethings talk of mortgages as fluently as if they were
scouting for picket-fenced property themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The voices at the other end of the telephones are American, too,
explaining how credit-card accounts will be brought up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes India intrudes. The lights go out when the local
supply fails, but the computers keep glowing and within seconds
they flicker back on again. GE has three generators to ensure they
do.
</P>
<P>
   This is all part of what a local business magazine calls India's
``hottest business opportunity,'' a belated chance to match China's
splash on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   The product is not toys or trainers but information. It usually
originates in America and Europe, is beamed or shipped to India to
be chopped, reconciled, responded to or corrected, and is then
beamed back again.
</P>
<P>
   Remote services may be a market in which India can beat the
world. It has a vast population, rock-bottom wages and a good grasp
of English. At present, some 25,000 Indians are employed in remote
services, reckons the National Association of Software and Service
Companies (NASSCOM).
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey, a consultancy, thinks that number will rise to 1
million-3 million people within the next ten years. ``We're on the
cusp of something major,'' says McKinsey's remote-services guru,
Anil Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   Software showed the way. India has been writing and debugging
code for the world for over a decade, and it is now busy fighting
the millennium-bug menace.
</P>
<P>
   Software exports are worth $2.7 billion a year. Remote services
_ using software rather than writing it _ could some day make that
seem small change.
</P>
<P>
   The work ranges from typing in telephone-directory entries to
conducting basic research, and everything in between. It is mostly
stuff that is too routine for expensive western workers, who could
be serving customers directly; but not so repetitive that machines
can do it.
</P>
<P>
   Western companies with big back offices are setting up
operations in India, or hiring Indian-based firms to do the work
for them.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways's two-year-old World Network Services, based in
Mumbai, handles an array of back-office jobs for its parent and
other airlines, including dealing with errors that pop up in
automatic reservation systems and keeping track of frequent-flier
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Selectronic, a two-year-old firm in Delhi, plucks doctors'
dictation from a toll-free number, transcribes the recordings and
sends the results back as text to an American HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Although they serve so many different industries, such firms
have a lot in common. Their growth rates are startling: BA's
operation has grown to 750 in two years and it is hiring 800 more
workers for a new office in Pune. GE grew from 50 to 700 employees
during 1998 and is adding workers at a rate of 100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural fusion is another common feature. Since these companies
are outposts of American or British firms and adhere to their
standards, they must master not only unfamiliar terms but also the
mind-set behind them.
</P>
<P>
   At Selectronic, a six-month training course in American medical
terminology is supplemented with group viewings of the television
programs, ``Chicago Hope'' and ``ER,'' accompanied by take-out
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways the atmosphere remains resolutely Indian. These
data-workers are not rootless part-timers, as their American
equivalents might be. Many expect their employers to treat them
like family members, providing transport to and from work, company
cricket games and jobs for life. Indian law makes it hard to do
anything less.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all worthwhile is India's cheap, high-quality
labor. Although half the population is illiterate, India's
universities produce roughly 2 million degree-holders every year,
most of whom have some facility in English.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those employed in the remote-services business would be
deemed overqualified in the West. A certified public accountant
working on account reconciliation costs GE $15,000-20,000 a year.
In America, a less qualified worker doing the same job would cost
up to three times as much. Pramod Bhasin, head of GE Capital's
Indian operation, expects to save his employer some $10 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the software business, India's other world-class
industry, remote services do not employ only the highly educated.
Selectronic recruits from its lower-middle-class Delhi
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Its employees may speak English less fluently than GE's, but
Selectronic compensates with rigorous training and a checking
process that vets every one of the 1.3 million lines of
transcription the company produces monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Back-office work makes up the bulk of the business, but remote
services range beyond that. Bechtel, an American company, has a
team of engineers in Gurgaon working on construction projects
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Delhi is the home of McKinsey's ``knowledge center,'' which does
research for the rest of the far-flung company. Pfizer and
Quintiles, two American health-care firms, find India's crowded
hospitals ideal venues for conducting cheap trials of new drugs
(strictly to international ethical standards, they insist).
</P>
<P>
   Decision Support International distributes financial data,
telephone books and college catalogues to tiny, independent data
factories across Delhi and Madras, where they are fed into
computers and rearranged into new products for sale by its mostly
American customers.
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey reckons this business will be worth $50 billion by
2010. What could stop this happening? The price of telecoms,
several times American and European levels. Unless rates come down,
India will lose out on call centers, a business that is expected to
grow fast.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is stifling bureaucracy and regulation, especially
laws that make it hard to sack workers. A number of firms have
failed because their work forces became bloated and inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Automation also looks a threat, but may prove an opportunity.
The more information that is collected by machines, the more errors
creep in that need human intervention. BA found that customers were
offended by machine-generated letters. Now it customizes them in
India.
</P>
<P>
   The government knows it is on to a good thing. Last July it said
it would exempt remote services' export earnings from corporate
tax, putting the business on the same footing as software.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's best hope is a big effort by the government to
free it from the regulations that killed manufacturing exports at
birth. &QL;

A DEFENSE OF TIES BY A MAN WHO LOVES THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently no one but me is man enough to defend the necktie,
which recently has taken enormous and utterly unwarranted abuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you read or heard about the asinine display put on some
weeks back by Prince Claus of the Netherlands. In the midst of a
speech, he ripped off his navy blue necktie and hurled it at the
feet of his wife, Queen Beatrix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A snake around my neck,'' he is said to have growled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then various media outlets _ following, naturally, instead
of leading _ have run stories about men freeing themselves from
these alleged nooses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's all ridiculous. The necktie, or cravat, as some are
wont to call it, is in fact a wonderful and endlessly fascinating _
if seemingly functionless _ piece of clothing. I say seemingly
functionless because, in fact, it has several important functions
that men (a category in which I include myself, despite all the
nasty _ and sometimes true _ things said about the species) would
be foolish to abandon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know all this because ties are my vice. I own hundreds of
them, and each one reminds me of some important part of my life.
For instance, the flowery blue, gray, pink and burgundy tie I have
on as I type these mortal words was given to me years ago for
Father's Day. The little tag inside the small end says it was made
in the U.S.A. of 100 percent Italian silk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's one good thing about ties right there. They're very
educational. For instance, the flowers on my tie today appear to be
pansies. And that has caused me to look up the information that
pansies are members of the Viola species and of the Violaceae
family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if you ask your Web search engines to tell you about silk
and Italy, why, the fascinating information is almost endless. For
instance, did you know about the silkworm plague that devastated
the silk industry in both Italy and France starting in 1854? And
did you know the Italian _ but not the French _ silk industry
recovered? Which explains the label on my tie, no doubt. Cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, before I got bumper-carred off to Italy there, I started
to tell you that one of the important things the now-maligned tie
does is to tell you a great deal about its wearer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is the man daring but only within reason? Is he completely wild?
Is he simply an old fuddy-duddy? Is he color blind? You can almost
immediately answer those questions simply by looking at a man's tie
in relation to the rest of his clothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without the tell-tale tie, you might have to spend days, weeks
or months determining all that, by which time the guy may have
fleeced you or convinced you to invest in some wildly speculative
venture like frozen octopus bellies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the knot is revealing. Is it neat and gently tight and of
an appropriate size? Now THERE'S a man who may be worth knowing. By
contrast, is the knot simply a huge wad at the throat, sloppy and
much too large for the collar? (See Sam Donaldson.) There's a man
with no sense of proportion, a man convinced of his own greatness
and possibly even his own immortality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is he inordinately attracted to one color and is it a hue that
makes you want to hurl? (See David Letterman's relentless
collection of green ties.) Such a man will always insist on his own
way, even if that way is stupid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does he now and then wear _ and tie _ a bow tie? Ah, there is a
man sure of himself, insightful and considerate. Hire or marry such
a man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does he rip off his tie in public and denounce it? Force such a
man to abdicate. He cannot be trusted with power. Tie him up in a
corner. Use his own tie. The world will be a better place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

   A STONE OF THE HEART
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Grimes. Southern Methodist University, $12.95. An
overweight 14-year-old boy, starved for affection and trying to
stay afloat in a dysfunctional Irish-American household in Queens
in 1961, seeks refuge in Roger Maris' pursuit of the home-run
record. In 1990 our reviewer, Hilma Wolitzer, called this a
``compact and affecting first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND THE OVAL OFFICE: GETTING REELECTED AGAINST ALL ODDS
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Morris. Renaissance, $16.95. President Clinton's former
adviser tracks the arc of his own career, giving plenty of
attention to the mechanics of polling and policy-making, as well as
the overwhelming influence of money and television in presidential
politics. This curious artifact has been updated with a new
introduction and the weekly briefing papers given to the White
House by the author and other political consultants during the 1996
campaign (and later subpoenaed by the Justice Department). Morris
``has written an account that future historians of the Clinton
Presidency will not be able to ignore,'' James B. Stewart wrote
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEALING
</P>
<P>
   By Gayl Jones. Beacon, $12. Narrated by a faith healer and
former rock star manager, this funny novel leans on free
association to explore the power of faith to banish violence and
paranoia. Last year in these pages, Valerie Sayers praised the
``gradual building of connections and insights that culminates in a
giddy outpouring of language.''
</P>
<P>
   A PRAYER FOR THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   By Buzz Bissinger. Vintage, $15. A journalist with extraordinary
access tells the inside story of Philadelphia's remarkable mayor,
Ed Rendell, whose drive and honesty helped restore hope and fiscal
soundness to a city on the edge of collapse. Last year our
reviewer, Robert Fishman, said this ``full-scale portrait of a
struggling metropolis ... brings to mind such classics of urban
reportage and analysis as J. Anthony Lukas' `Common Ground.' '' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI, by Joan Didion (Vintage International, $12), is a more
impressionistic account of an American city, dwelling on the Cuban
exile community and the shadowy links between the Bay of Pigs
disaster and events like Watergate and the Kennedy assassination.
``The world Miss Didion describes in beautifully evocative prose is
... a world of menace and elliptical connections,'' James Chace
wrote here in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE: ASPECTS OF AN AMERICAN CITY, by
Warren Leslie (Southern Methodist University, $14.95), was first
published after President Kennedy's murder and seeks to explain a
city whose mix of extreme conservatism, religious expression and
political excess made it a place where nasty things were bound to
happen. This study, which includes a new foreword and preface, ``is
a good deal more than a revealing, a valuable and a careful book,''
George Fuermann said here in 1964. ``It is also a courageous one.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERON NOVEL
</P>
<P>
   By Toms Eloy Martinez. Translated by Helen Lane. Vintage
International, $14. This Argentine novel imagines the life of the
strongman Juan Peron, particularly his 18 years in exile and his
ill-fated return to power in 1973. The book ``is a brilliant image
of a national psychosis,'' Jay Cantor wrote here in 1988. TALES
FROM THE BLUE ARCHIVES, by Lawrence Thornton (Bantam, $13.95), is
the last of three dream-driven novels by the author revolving
around Argentina's ``dirty war.'' It focuses on a woman's search
for her grandsons, who were among the ``disappeared,'' and on what
happens when she finally finds them. The tale ''blends the mundane
violence of recent Latin American politics with the high tragedy of
Elizabethan drama,'' Robert Houston wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   COUNT ME OUT
</P>
<P>
   By Russell James. Foul Play/Norton, $10. When one of the robbers
of an armored car takes off with all the loot, the mastermind of
the heist tries to track him down through the crook's ex-boxer
brother and his 8-year-old daughter. In 1997 our reviewer, Marilyn
Stasio, admired this British mystery for ``the depth, as well as
the darkness'' of its insights.
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY OF JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Gioia. Oxford University, $15.95. This concise,
accessible overview covers jazz from its roots in slavery through
jazz-rock fusion and beyond. In 1997 our reviewer, Peter Keepnews,
said that despite its occasional omissions and lapses, ``the book
is peppered with pithy and thoughtful observations.''
</P>
<P>
   TRESPASSING: MY SOJOURN IN THE HALLS OF PRIVILEGE
</P>
<P>
   By Gwendolyn M. Parker. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $11. A
well-off black lawyer tells how she rode the fast track to success
in corporate America, and how the pressures of racial tokenism
finally caused her to hop off. In these pages in 1997, Deborah E.
McDowell called this an ``engagingly written and fluidly paced''
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   HOME AND AWAY
</P>
<P>
   By Joanne Meschery. University of California, $13.95. During the
Gulf War, a California woman struggles to balance her growing
political awareness with a troubled marriage and other personal
crises. The novel ``manages to deal sensitively with serious
issues,'' Constance Decker Thompson wrote here in 1994.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Screeners at airport security checkpoints miss
weapons that undercover testers hide under their clothes, or they
notice them but do nothing. Ticket agents forget to ask if
passengers are carrying packages from strangers, or fail to react
properly if the answer is yes. Airport employees don't single out
passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or
otherwise act suspiciously. Ground crews leave airplanes unlocked
and unattended, giving intruders an opportunity to plant a weapon
or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Airport security can leave passengers feeling insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines pass most of these tests, Federal Aviation
Administration officials say, intercepting hundreds of weapons each
year. Potential terrorists face a high likelihood of detection. But
it is hard for outsiders to determine how well the FAA and the
airlines are doing. Last week the agency gave The New York Times
reports on 71 security violations at USAir, now US Airways.
Concerned about the airport failure rate, the Transportation
Department's inspector general is testing security arrangements and
its report is expected to go to Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts wonder why the system works at all, especially at
the level of screeners, most of whom are hired at minimal wages by
security companies trying to maximize the chance of getting the
contract from the airlines, which are responsible for the security
at their check-in desks, gates and terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same money, or more money, you can go over to Pizza
Hut or McDonald's in the same airport, and maybe get better
benefits, and get a free lunch out of it,'' said a federal official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. And a job in fast food has few
worrisome responsibilities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy job turnover _ often well over 100 percent in a year _
also has its effects. At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1995, an
FAA agent with a weapon strapped to the small of his back set off a
metal detector. The screener used a hand wand.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation showed that the screener, who was on only his
third shift, had not completed training; he didn't realize that
when the agent spread his arms, his jacket stood away from his
back, shielding the gun from detection.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a screener at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport failed to detect a weapon smuggled in by
another agent in 1995, and USAir asked for leniency because the
screener had been on the job four years. That, said the airline in
a letter to the FAA, constituted ``extensive experience (in terms
of screener turnover).'' In this context, four years is a lengthy
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint, ``the ability of people to find things on the
X-ray screen is shockingly low,'' said Dr. Michael Cantor, a
psychologist formerly employed at Argenbright, one of the nation's
largest airport security contractors. Some people are
detail-oriented and are very good at spotting guns or bombs. Others
have other useful traits, he said, being ``highly extroverted'' and
willing to challenge people who are often of higher social status.
</P>
<P>
   ``But supervisors are not savvy,'' Dr. Cantor said. ``They don't
do a division of labor.'' Workers rotate between viewing the X-ray
screen and the other checkpoint jobs. Cantor developed a quick test
to find detail-oriented people but could not persuade the FAA to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   People are, in fact, the weak spot in the system. Airlines and
the FAA are installing more and more high-tech machines to scan
bags, but the airlines do not always send the bags through.
Mechanics, baggage handlers and others often fail to wear required
identification, or fail to challenge persons not wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, experts say, to stay vigilant about a threat that is
intermittent at best. It's like looking through a haystack that
might have a needle in it. The FAA is even considering a checkpoint
system that would periodically show an X-ray image of a bag with a
gun in it, just to keep screeners on their toes.

passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or
otherwise act suspiciously. Ground crews leave airplanes unlocked
and unattended, giving intruders an opportunity to plant a weapon
or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Airport security can leave passengers feeling insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines pass most of these tests, Federal Aviation
Administration officials say, intercepting hundreds of weapons each
year. Potential terrorists face a high likelihood of detection. But
it is hard for outsiders to determine how well the FAA and the
airlines are doing. Last week the agency gave The New York Times
reports on 71 security violations at USAir, now US Airways.
Concerned about the airport failure rate, the Transportation
Department's inspector general is testing security arrangements and
its report is expected to go to Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts wonder why the system works at all, especially at
the level of screeners, most of whom are hired at minimal wages by
security companies trying to maximize the chance of getting the
contract from the airlines, which are responsible for the security
at their check-in desks, gates and terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same money, or more money, you can go over to Pizza
Hut or McDonald's in the same airport, and maybe get better
benefits, and get a free lunch out of it,'' said a federal official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. And a job in fast food has few
worrisome responsibilities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy job turnover _ often well over 100 percent in a year _
also has its effects. At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1995, an
FAA agent with a weapon strapped to the small of his back set off a
metal detector. The screener used a hand wand.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation showed that the screener, who was on only his
third shift, had not completed training; he didn't realize that
when the agent spread his arms, his jacket stood away from his
back, shielding the gun from detection.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a screener at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport failed to detect a weapon smuggled in by
another agent in 1995, and USAir asked for leniency because the
screener had been on the job four years. That, said the airline in
a letter to the FAA, constituted ``extensive experience (in terms
of screener turnover).'' In this context, four years is a lengthy
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint, ``the ability of people to find things on the
X-ray screen is shockingly low,'' said Dr. Michael Cantor, a
psychologist formerly employed at Argenbright, one of the nation's
largest airport security contractors. Some people are
detail-oriented and are very good at spotting guns or bombs. Others
have other useful traits, he said, being ``highly extroverted'' and
willing to challenge people who are often of higher social status.
</P>
<P>
   ``But supervisors are not savvy,'' Dr. Cantor said. ``They don't
do a division of labor.'' Workers rotate between viewing the X-ray
screen and the other checkpoint jobs. Cantor developed a quick test
to find detail-oriented people but could not persuade the FAA to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   People are, in fact, the weak spot in the system. Airlines and
the FAA are installing more and more high-tech machines to scan
bags, but the airlines do not always send the bags through.
Mechanics, baggage handlers and others often fail to wear required
identification, or fail to challenge persons not wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, experts say, to stay vigilant about a threat that is
intermittent at best. It's like looking through a haystack that
might have a needle in it. The FAA is even considering a checkpoint
system that would periodically show an X-ray image of a bag with a
gun in it, just to keep screeners on their toes.

   HOLLYWOOD _ Let's face it. It's hard to live on $10 million or
$20 million a year here.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at all those poor movie stars. Underpaid and
overworked, stars like Bruce and Julia and Harrison and the two
Toms barely earn enough to stay afloat. So who can blame them when
they demand that studios pay their nanny bills while they're making
a movie or hire, in some cases, full-time masseuses,
acupuncturists, nutritionists and yoga instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the latest fad,'' one studio publicist said.
``Whatever the latest fad, that becomes the latest `ask.' Now we're
all holistic. They've got to have candles in the dressing room,
special smells.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are also the latest fad. Life is tough enough for them
without asking them to sit with other first-class passengers in
United's Red Carpet Lounge waiting for their flight to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   The actor recently insisted on flying on a private jet to
Houston for a screening by director Terrence Malick of his newest
film, ``The Thin Red Line,'' in which Penn is one of the stars.
Executives at 20th Century Fox said the actor had hardly promoted
the film _ ``He gave us two hours after two weeks of negotiation,''
one Fox executive said. Why give him a private plane?
</P>
<P>
   But Penn fought back. After all, he prides himself on being a
working-class kind of actor. He was depicted in a recent article in
The New York Times Magazine as driving around the country in an
Oldsmobile 88, stopping off in small-town motels.
</P>
<P>
   It would be appropriate, then, if Penn flew cabin class, but the
actor has such a hectic schedule, with all that driving, that
there's only one answer. A private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's rejection so upset Penn that he wrote the following
letter, portions of which appeared in Variety last week. He sent it
to an array of Fox and Phoenix Pictures executives as well as his
manager and ``God Almighty,'' who has not been seen in Hollywood
for a long time.

<P>
   To whom it may or may not concern at 20th Century Fox, et al.
(in hope that those copied will spread the word to those
deserving):
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this scratchpad communique may well be as much to
amuse you or inform you. Clearly, its less than humble writer has
found grounds for amusement in its content.
</P>
<P>
   In my continuing effort to support our shared entity, ``The Thin
Red Line,'' I have yet again run into another of the endless
bureaucratic hurdles that your company relentlessly plants in my
path. As a result of Terry Malick's invitation, I made plans to
join Terry in supporting the film's screening, and ultimately its
profile in Houston. As I have two movies, two children and (as each
woman is at least two people) two wives presently in distribution,
my schedule is rather hectic. I therefore requested that Mr.
Murdoch's gigantic corporation might be so generous (with the money
they've earned exploiting the pain and suffering of myself and my
peers in their tabloids) as to supply me with a private jet to
travel to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The response was a clear NO.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were cited: 1) The $40,000 cost. 2) Policy. As to
number 1, we at my tiny little San Francisco office went ahead and
priced the cost of such a jet ourselves. In fact, it came to
$16,000, which we had offered would be divided by two, as Fine Line
Pictures had already committed to pay half (I would do an interview
on behalf of ``Hurlyburly'' while I was there). Next we priced the
commercial fare somewhere in the area of $2,000. The final cost
differential to Mr. Murdoch's pool-heating expenses A WHOPPING
$6,000 which, against the price cut I offered in my deal to act in
this movie, seemed equivalent to the fair market price of ((a
vulgar reference to Murdoch)). Next comes policy, the number 2
reason cited us in denial of our request. Evidently this is a word
prized by Murdoch's company as I ran into it before when Malick
requested that I be given an opportunity to view a videotape of the
movie prior to his locking the print. I think we all know what a
shameful little dance went on there, with wasted time, wasted money
in the name of a policy. Has anyone at 20th Century Fox considered
that it might not be my policy to do 7-figure favors for
multi-national corporate interests as I did when I took the salary
you paid me on ``The Thin Red Line''?
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is . . . our policies collide. Good luck with the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I know you guys don't remember what the inside of a
commercial airline terminal looks like, but if you send me a
picture of your jets, I'll send you a picture of the door at the
Red Carpet Room. Wish I could've been in Houston. It's a beautiful
movie and I'd like to have helped spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. If my name is unfamiliar to you, you can check your
computers under Movie Buff. I believe they consider me to be
someone with a career.

<P>
   Public opinion surveys show that most Americans want to know, in
a systematic way, how well their children and their children's
teachers are doing in school. So many states have been scrambling
to impose new layers of standardized tests on students, as well as
on prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond giving politicians a chance to wave the new test
booklets as trophies in front of their constituents, it isn't
always clear what these tests really tell us.
</P>
<P>
   In New York last week, more than 200,000 fourth-graders spent
about an hour a day for three days sitting for what experts
consider to be one of the most exhaustive reading exams ever given
to 9-year-olds. They answered multiple-choice questions, as their
predecessors did, but also took notes to analyze an African folk
tale about kindness and then wrote several essays. The test was
based on passages they read or their teachers read to them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the jitters it set off, the state's new reading test
and tests elsewhere raise questions about the difficulties of
placing a yardstick against the wide range of development of
students so young _ and about whether their ability to deconstruct
a fable, for example, is an appropriate benchmark and predictor of
future success.
</P>
<P>
   How much the state will learn was cast into further doubt when
an apparent oversight was discovered: the test contained reading
material that tens of thousands of students probably studied in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the measure of teachers has proven to be equally
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, 3 out of 10 teaching applicants in Massachusetts
failed a new four-hour reading and writing exam _ a test devised
after a decade of mounting political pressure. But some of the
skills the applicants were required to demonstrate had little to do
with teaching, including taking extended dictation _ with spelling,
punctuation and capitalization fair game _ from a writing sample
read to them from the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitfalls in the Massachusetts teacher test, other teacher
tests and many student testing programs is that policy makers are
loading more weight onto these tests than any human contrivance can
bear,'' said Professor Walter Haney, a senior research associate at
the Center for the Study of Testing at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young children, trying to hold students to a common test
standard ignores much that has been learned about the variability
of human development,'' Haney said. ``For teachers, trying to test
teachers' basic skills as a way of improving teaching in the
classroom ignores considerable research that suggests that
incompetence among teachers derives not from lack of knowledge or
skill but from lack of care and effort. That's very hard to test.''
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Iowa and Nebraska administers statewide exams
to students, with 46 states testing those in fourth grade and
lower, according to a recent survey by Education Week and the Pew
Charitable Trusts. And 42 states give some standardized form of
basic skills test to incoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the student tests help states identify failing schools,
New York City is among a number of districts and states considering
whether to go a step further and use standardized test scores, even
among students as young as 9, as at least one factor in promoting
them to the next grade and judging teacher performance.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have installed new tests in recent years,
including New York, Florida and Louisiana, are often following up
their issuance of statewide performance and achievement standards.
At the behest of parents wanting to know what the states think
children should know, 40 states have adopted such standards in
English, math, science and social studies. But the annual survey by
Education Week, closely read in academic circles, criticizes many
of these standards as vague.
</P>
<P>
   New York _ which asks fourth graders to ``correctly use and
spell words learned in all their areas of study'' _ received some
of the highest marks from Education Week for its standards, and for
the direction for the new fourth grade test.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Ryan, who teaches fourth grade in Brooklyn, said she
thought the state, working with the national test publisher, CTB
McGraw Hill, had come closer than any strictly multiple-choice exam
to approximating what she does in class. The test asks students to
craft paragraphs in response to such questions as ``Which lesson
does the folk tale teach best?''
</P>
<P>
   But with spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation all
counting, Roz Sacharoff, who teaches fourth grade in Queens, said
she worried whether her students were ``proficient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity underscores the range in student abilities, said
Dr. James Comer, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale
University Child Study Center and a longtime education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great variation among children of that age _ 8, 9, 10
_ in their performance,'' Comer said. ``There is literature that
shows that many kids catch up by the time they are in sixth,
seventh and eighth grades and score as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing them early can affect their sense of personal adequacy
and efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said for prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, has praised the Massachusetts test, which he helped
write, as fair. The Federalist Papers excerpt, he said, was read
aloud three times, and slowly. But Haney said the test was hastily
assembled with no clearly demonstrated link to classroom
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is among those states trying to find a different way to
size up teaching applicants beyond the basic skills test that it
gives. It believes it has found it; the state now asks
teachers-in-training to design a short course for their students
and then write a test to assess their students' growth.
</P>
<P>
   A state panel determined that a standardized test to measure the
students in each teacher's class would be impossible, since each
class would be at a different stage. The panel decided, after much
gnashing of teeth, that the teachers-in-training were in the best
position to find a way to evaluate their students. And that was a
refreshing throwback, said Del Schalock, a professor in the
teaching research division at Western Oregon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as far as from a standardized achievement test that you
can get,'' he said.

spell words learned in all their areas of study'' _ received some
of the highest marks from Education Week for its standards, and for
the direction for the new fourth grade test.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Ryan, who teaches fourth grade in Brooklyn, said she
thought the state, working with the national test publisher, CTB
McGraw Hill, had come closer than any strictly multiple-choice exam
to approximating what she does in class. The test asks students to
craft paragraphs in response to such questions as ``Which lesson
does the folk tale teach best?''
</P>
<P>
   But with spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation all
counting, Roz Sacharoff, who teaches fourth grade in Queens, said
she worried whether her students were ``proficient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity underscores the range in student abilities, said
Dr. James Comer, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale
University Child Study Center and a longtime education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great variation among children of that age _ 8, 9, 10
_ in their performance,'' Comer said. ``There is literature that
shows that many kids catch up by the time they are in sixth,
seventh and eighth grades and score as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing them early can affect their sense of personal adequacy
and efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said for prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, has praised the Massachusetts test, which he helped
write, as fair. The Federalist Papers excerpt, he said, was read
aloud three times, and slowly. But Haney said the test was hastily
assembled with no clearly demonstrated link to classroom
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is among those states trying to find a different way to
size up teaching applicants beyond the basic skills test that it
gives. It believes it has found it; the state now asks
teachers-in-training to design a short course for their students
and then write a test to assess their students' growth.
</P>
<P>
   A state panel determined that a standardized test to measure the
students in each teacher's class would be impossible, since each
class would be at a different stage. The panel decided, after much
gnashing of teeth, that the teachers-in-training were in the best
position to find a way to evaluate their students. And that was a
refreshing throwback, said Del Schalock, a professor in the
teaching research division at Western Oregon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as far as from a standardized achievement test that you
can get,'' he said.

AS THE WORLD TAKES A NEW LOOK, IT'S THE SAME OLD CUBA

<P>
   MIAMI _ As he traveled from one end of Cuba to another a year
ago, often with Fidel Castro at his side or sitting attentively in
the audience, Pope John Paul II had one overriding message. In its
most succinct form it was that Cuba ``needs to open herself to the
world, and the world needs to draw closer to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the world has heeded the pontiff's directive, often
using his words as justification; even the United States took a few
modest steps in that direction on Jan. 5, making it somewhat easier
for Americans to send money and food to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and the Cuban Communist Party, on the other hand, have
largely ignored the first half of the papal exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Castro marked the 40th anniversary of his
seizure of power with a speech in which he defiantly maintained
that ``the revolution has just begun.'' Under him, Cuba's
human-rights record remains dismal. Economic reforms like those
carried out by China are stalled too; this promises only additional
austerity for the average Cuban, and it has made the country less
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's visit, Castro freed more than 300 people held
in Cuban jails, and at the time optimists suggested that the move
might be the start of a relaxation. But as is so often the case
when Castro is involved, there was less to the action than met the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those released were common criminals, not political
prisoners. And many, human rights groups say, were freed on
condition they leave Cuba, a procedure the authorities often apply
against dissidents after a spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 18 months after they were arrested on charges of
sedition, Cuba's most prominent political prisoners remain in jail,
still awaiting trial and refused habeas corpus. Felix Bonne, Rene
Gomez Manzano, Vladimiro Roca and Marta Beatriz Roque, leaders of
the Internal Dissidence Working Group, were jailed after publishing
a document titled ``The Homeland Belongs to Us All,'' in which they
urged Castro and the Communist Party to allow ``an independent and
impartial legal system that would protect the liberties and rights
of the individual and the practice of political pluralism.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, who were released after having been held on trumped-up
charges, could face jail again, since Cuba's legal system continues
to lack even the most elemental guarantees of due process and no
effort is being made to provide such protections. Hector Palacios
Ruiz, for instance, had been imprisoned for possessing ``enemy
propaganda.'' His crime was to attempt to distribute copies of a
declaration Castro signed at a Latin American summit meeting,
promising steps toward full representative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see any will, sign or political gesture showing that
the Cuban authorities are willing to move forward to make some
serious progress,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of
Human Rights Watch in the Americas. ``The harassment against
dissidents, human rights activists or anyone else attempting to
exercise the most basic rights of association and expression
continues exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the area of religious freedom, where some progress has
taken place, significant restrictions remain. Castro's decision to
allow the celebration of Christmas was treated by the
state-controlled press as an act of revolutionary generosity. But
such gains for religion result from case-by-case negotiations, not
a blanket recognition of a right to worship freely. Parish priests
find many local authorities still unwilling to allow processions on
the feast days of saints.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the government offered much latitude for the incipient
private sector that the Clinton administration said its new
measures are intended to help. In 1996, more than 200,000 people
were officially listed as ``self-employed,'' and government
officials were suggesting that hundreds of thousands more would be
encouraged to take that course.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, the number of people working for themselves
with the official approval of the government has declined
substantially, perhaps by nearly a quarter, and some occupations
that were formerly approved for free enterprise have now been
proscribed. Confiscatory tax policies have been used to drive out
of business many of those who were beginning to compete with the
state, like owners of small private restaurants called paladares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've let everything play out, but they have not added any
new openings,'' said Philip Peters, author of ``Islands of
Enterprise,'' a study of the Cuban private sector. ``Certainly,
there is no interest in letting it expand, at least not
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with control helps explain the strongly negative
reaction to the Clinton administration's limited initiative. Jose
Luis Rodriguez, the minister of the economy, initially dismissed
the moves as ``crumbs,'' as if to deny their significance.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricardo Alarcon, head of the rubber-stamp parliament and
Castro's favorite mouthpiece on relations with the United States,
later described the measures as a ``subversive and
counterrevolutionary'' attempt to destabilize the Cuban government
by going around it _ ``a way of manufacturing traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the oration Castro delivered in Santiago on Jan. 1 to
mark his 40 years in power, Cubans have no choice but to look
forward to more of the same. Of Cuba's 11 million people, 7 million
have been born since 1959, Castro proudly pointed out in the
speech. But they are led, as he also noted, by someone ``who
dresses the same, who thinks the same, who dreams the same'' today
as he did when he came down from the Sierra Maestra.''

   For some people, life without Michael Jordan is unthinkable. But
although Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls and the game of
basketball last week, there's still a Michael Jordan of
snowboarding. And a Michael Jordan of bull riding. Even a Michael
Jordan of real-life bulls.
</P>
<P>
   No sport is too obscure to have its legions of coaches, fans,
opponents, writers and publicists ready to crown a king. In sports,
there's only one king: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Terje Haakenson, a Norwegian, executes moves on a snowboard that
nobody had ever seen before, so he's dubbed the Michael Jordan of
snowboarding _ in every interview and article on him. The
Australian batsman Steve Waugh wins championships everywhere he
plays. That makes him the Michael Jordan of cricket. Doubt it?
Check out his news clippings. Jorge Campos isn't necessarily the
world's best soccer player, but he can't go anywhere in his country
without being recognized. To his publicist, that makes him the
Michael Jordan of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work with every sports. Olympic gold gave the
freestyle skier Jonny Moseley so much cachet that he doesn't need
anybody else's famous name.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jordan isn't always Jordan. The last time he retired, to
play baseball, the Chicago Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, called
him the Babe Ruth of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a guide to the Jordans still at work. Meet the Michael
Jordan of . . .
</P>
<P>
   THREE-CUSHION BILLIARDS:
</P>
<P>
   Sang Chun Lee
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: Bob Graswich, a columnist for The Sacramento Bee,
who said Lee was like Jordan, only better, after watching the
Korean win last year's U.S. Billiards Association championship. Lee
has been unable to shake the moniker since, although Graswich
freely admits, ``I bet he doesn't know who Michael Jordan is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephemeral Jordanesque quality: Lee, who plays in a tuxedo, is
the master of swank on the billiard circuit, which might be
sartorially an even tougher crowd than the world of hoops. They say
he's got ice water in his veins, too.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: With nine consecutive national championships
under his belt, Lee has consistency down pat; his specialty is
executing impossible carom shots, which involve mathematical
formulas and precision to a millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   RODEO BULLS:
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: The Terry Bradshaw of football, Terry Bradshaw, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: Bo's utter dominance on the rodeo circuit
amounted to being ridden for the full 8 seconds just 7 times in 135
attempts. (``Those were his off days,'' said his owner, Carolyn
Andrews.)
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Just as Jordan specialized in long-range,
fourth-quarter daggers to the heart, Bodacious performs an
acrobatic maneuver with his horns known as ``checking the oil,''
best described as near-disembowelment and guarded against by
would-be busters wearing bulletproof vests and catcher's masks.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors: Even M.J. might learn a lesson in active retirement
from Bodacious, who lumbered from his arena over three years ago
but now can be found on belt buckles, videos and engraved silver
lids for snuff boxes. He's also around _ in essence _ in about
1,000 vials of semen that are sold each year at $300 each. And he
makes appearances (behind a double fence) at about 25 rodeos a
year. He's to appear on Feb. 9 on the Fox television network's
``Guinness World Records: Primetime'' as the ``meanest, baddest
bull in rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   RODEO RIDING:
</P>
<P>
   Ty Murray
</P>
<P>
   Inherited title from: Tuff Hedeman, a bull-riding hall-of-famer
who was almost destroyed by _ you guessed it _ Bodacious. Hedeman
had been dubbed Jordan by an admiring public, due to his dominance.
When he retired, he gave Murray, as heir to his crown, the moniker
as well. Murray had previously been known as ``Puddin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: More money and titles than any bull rider in
history, a feat Murray attributes to two Jordanesque traits, ``guts
and endurance.'' Murray also holds seven world titles for best
all-around cowboy, another record, and a testament to his
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   SPELLING BEES:
</P>
<P>
   Jody-Anne Maxwell
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: Jamaica's Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Spelled chiaroscurist; defeated 248 competitors at
last May's Scripps-Howard national spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: What was Chicago before Jordan? The home of
Al Capone? O'Neil Hamilton, the embassy's director of information,
is hailing Maxwell, 12, as the ``first chance the country has had
to put itself on the map in something academic or intellectual.''
He hopes Maxwell might replace, say, Bob Marley in peoples' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she get a parade when she went home, but in the
United States, where she competed as a candidate sponsored by a
Jamaican stationery company, Maxwell's booked all summer as an
inspirational speaker at youth clubs, the YMCA and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW DOGS:
</P>
<P>
   Champion Toledobe's Serenghetti
</P>
<P>
   Jordan with paws: Playing to the crowd and pouring it on when
the stakes are high have earned her the nickname from competitors
and spectators alike, says the Doberman pinscher's handler and
spokesman, Andy Linton. She's considered one to beat at next
month's huge Westminster show. Linton also guarantees a better
vertical leap than anyone wearing No. 23 (Jordan's number with the
Chicago Bulls).
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Freebaiting, in which the dog stands stockstill on
her own while a judge inspects her physique, is a specialty. So is
an uncanny ability to put on her game face just as the cameras zoom
in.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSIONAL LACROSSE:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gait, of the National Lacrosse League's Baltimore Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: John Tucker, Thunder head coach, during the
National Lacrosse League finals last year, which Baltimore lost to
the Philadelphia Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: Work ethic, moves and resiliency. With 474
points in 75 career games, Gait (also called Gator) has been his
league's most valuable player four years running and is widely
credited with revolutionizing the sport. Tucker makes the
comparison because Gait ``does things no one else can do, and he's
big when the game's on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: The ``Air Gait,'' created at Syracuse University,
involves leaping from the 18-foot crease around the net and
reaching from behind and over the net and goalie to slam in the
ball for a point.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning in action: Gait's identical twin, Paul, plays forward
the Syracuse Smash and is statistically second banana by a hair's
breadth. The two will meet Feb. 5 in Syracuse, N.Y.

had been dubbed Jordan by an admiring public, due to his dominance.
When he retired, he gave Murray, as heir to his crown, the moniker
as well. Murray had previously been known as ``Puddin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: More money and titles than any bull rider in
history, a feat Murray attributes to two Jordanesque traits, ``guts
and endurance.'' Murray also holds seven world titles for best
all-around cowboy, another record, and a testament to his
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   SPELLING BEES:
</P>
<P>
   Jody-Anne Maxwell
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: Jamaica's Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Spelled chiaroscurist; defeated 248 competitors at
last May's Scripps-Howard national spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: What was Chicago before Jordan? The home of
Al Capone? O'Neil Hamilton, the embassy's director of information,
is hailing Maxwell, 12, as the ``first chance the country has had
to put itself on the map in something academic or intellectual.''
He hopes Maxwell might replace, say, Bob Marley in peoples' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she get a parade when she went home, but in the
United States, where she competed as a candidate sponsored by a
Jamaican stationery company, Maxwell's booked all summer as an
inspirational speaker at youth clubs, the YMCA and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW DOGS:
</P>
<P>
   Champion Toledobe's Serenghetti
</P>
<P>
   Jordan with paws: Playing to the crowd and pouring it on when
the stakes are high have earned her the nickname from competitors
and spectators alike, says the Doberman pinscher's handler and
spokesman, Andy Linton. She's considered one to beat at next
month's huge Westminster show. Linton also guarantees a better
vertical leap than anyone wearing No. 23 (Jordan's number with the
Chicago Bulls).
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Freebaiting, in which the dog stands stockstill on
her own while a judge inspects her physique, is a specialty. So is
an uncanny ability to put on her game face just as the cameras zoom
in.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSIONAL LACROSSE:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gait, of the National Lacrosse League's Baltimore Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: John Tucker, Thunder head coach, during the
National Lacrosse League finals last year, which Baltimore lost to
the Philadelphia Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: Work ethic, moves and resiliency. With 474
points in 75 career games, Gait (also called Gator) has been his
league's most valuable player four years running and is widely
credited with revolutionizing the sport. Tucker makes the
comparison because Gait ``does things no one else can do, and he's
big when the game's on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: The ``Air Gait,'' created at Syracuse University,
involves leaping from the 18-foot crease around the net and
reaching from behind and over the net and goalie to slam in the
ball for a point.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning in action: Gait's identical twin, Paul, plays forward
the Syracuse Smash and is statistically second banana by a hair's
breadth. The two will meet Feb. 5 in Syracuse, N.Y.

<P>
   As the global economy spawns more mergers of American and
foreign companies, inequities in the pay of top executives quickly
become apparent. In the spirit of compromise that marks a new
marriage, the lower-paid officers see their pay rise to the levels
of their better-paid colleagues _ almost always the Americans _ and
American-style capitalism claims a little more foreign turf.
</P>
<P>
   The American way of compensating top executives _ with
opportunity for tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied
to a rising stock price _ certainly pays better. Some experts view
American-style pay as a vitamin that can jump-start the performance
of sluggish economies abroad. But others see it as a virus that
spreads greed and excess.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies are joining the experiment. When
Daimler-Benz announced in May that it would acquire Chrysler Corp.,
Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp was earning much less than Robert
Eaton, his counterpart at Chrysler, a substantially smaller
company. Last week, Daimler-Benz announced a new system for paying
its top 250 executives: About 25 percent to 30 percent of their
compensation would be fixed and the rest would be in performance
bonuses and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are grappling with the issue. Last year,
Bertelsmann, the German publisher, acquired Random House; Amoco
agreed to a takeover by British Petroleum; Deutsche Bank made a
deal to buy Bankers Trust, and Scottish Power agreed to buy
Pacificorp.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign buyers generally have little choice but to adopt
American ways of compensating all their top executives. Key
executives from each of the merging companies expect to get roughly
the same pay. Chrysler executives, for example, would quickly start
job-hunting around Detroit if they were forced to take a cut.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the richer executive payroll for foreign companies
is the price of entry for joining the U.S. economy, where
Daimler-Benz and others presumably expect to get better returns
than if they had invested elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   These simple economic explanations certainly help foreign
executives deflect suggestions that they may be motivated to merge
with an American partner to help boost their own pay. But many
consultants who advise companies on compensation matters say that
many foreign executives are uneasy about the shift, even though
they may benefit personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is movement, but there is resistance as well,'' said
Robert Freedman, a compensation expert at Towers Perrin, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of American-style pay packages for top executives say
they are a big reason the U.S. economy and the stock market have
been so vibrant this decade. Executive pay is high, they typically
concede. But chief executives in the United States, like
professional athletes, generally have short careers. And talented
executives, they argue, can often add so much value to a company
that their outlandish pay, in the grand scheme of things, amounts
to a small tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay your management with stock-based incentives, they
will be very motivated to do everything they can to get it right,''
said Ira Kay, the head of the global compensation practice at
Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   An implicit message in this model, however, is that an honest
day's pay for an honest day's work is not enough to get executives
to do their best; they have to have a gold carrot dangling in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many companies, in their filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, justify high compensation for top officers
with that argument. For example, McDonald's Corp.'s executive
compensation program, according to a recent filing, ``has been
designed to attract, energize, reward and retain superior talent.''
If the pay packages were any smaller, this language suggests, the
executives would somehow be less energized, and more willing to
bolt for a higher-paying competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some public companies have tried a different way. Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
the ice cream company, and Herman Miller, a maker of office
furniture, used to say that there should be a limit to the gap
between the highest- and lowest-paid workers (at the ice cream
company, it was 7 times higher back in 1994; at Herman Miller, it
was 20 times higher in 1996). But they have since tossed out these
rules and joined the bidding war for executive talent.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the American business superstar, which has delivered
hundreds of millions of dollars to professional managers (who, in
some cases, send the tab for personal financial planning advice
back to their company), has historically offended the sensibilities
of people in many foreign countries, where the best and the
brightest pursued careers in fields other than business.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, executive pay has moved further toward
the American system than most other countries. A study of the 20
largest companies in the United States and Britain by William M.
Mercer, a consulting firm, found, among other things, that the base
salaries of the top American executives were 38 percent higher,
bonuses were more than five times higher and the value of their
stock options was incomparably higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of widespread public unease about the levels of
pay in the U.K.,'' said Tony Groom, a principal in Mercer's
executive compensation practice. Business, after all, has not
historically been considered a particularly high calling there.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University, for example, only recently built a business
school, over objections from many quarters that the quest for an
M.B.A. was not a legitimate scholarly pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why executive pay is lower in other
countries. Careers and performance, for example, tend to be
measured over a much longer term than at American companies. Stock
options that last 10 years are called long-term incentives in the
United States; many foreign companies use a decade to measure
short-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   There is also less jockeying for pay raises outside the United
States. James Hatch, a partner at Arthur Andersen, recounts the
story of a U.S. office of a Japanese company, where the American
secretaries and support staff found that their Japanese bosses were
soft touches for tales of personal financial hardship. Pretty soon,
Hatch said, many of the workers were getting salaries two and three
times those of workers in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   On a global scale, the marketplace for executives remains quite
skewed. But even with pay rising for foreign executives, it seems
unlikely that it will catch up to American levels, which are
setting new records every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of closing the gap is laughable,'' said Graef
Crystal, editor of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on executive
compensation. ``When you're 200 laps behind and driving a
supercharged Audi, how do you catch up with an American car with
5,000 horsepower?''

<P>
   IMPEACH-HOWLONG?-REVIEW (Washington) _ Whether they want to see
President Clinton driven from office or they have completely tuned
out the Senate trial, most Americans agree on one thing: they want
it to be over. But the dissection of the the Lewinsky affair will
continue at least as long as the Senate trial grinds on and maybe a
lot longer than that. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   FLYNT-BARR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Porn publisher Larry Flynt has
shown that he can get the mainstream media to give him a platform
in exposing the sexual misconduct of conservative Republicans. But
it is also clear that, unless the target of his attacks responds
and thus makes news himself, self-appointed newsmakers like Flynt
can't necessarily keep the press' attention very long. His
accusations against Rep. Bob Barr received relatively little news
coverage. By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   FIDGETING-CALORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Old-fashioned fidgeting _
tapping your pencil against a conference table in a make-or-break
meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing on the phone, pacing back
and forth behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy. That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic
study that sought to explain why some people can eat anything and
everything and not gain an ounce, while others bulk up with every
swallow. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-SECURITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Airport security can
leave passengers feeling insecure. Checkpoint screeners miss
weapons that undercover testers hide under their clothes, or they
notice them but do nothing. Ticket agents forget to ask if
passengers are carrying packages from strangers, or fail to react
properly if the answer is yes. Airport employees don't single out
passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or
otherwise act suspiciously. Ground crews leave airplanes unlocked
and unattended, giving intruders an opportunity to plant a weapon
or a bomb. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDIZED-TESTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Standardized reading tests
in New York and other states raise questions about the difficulties
of placing a yardstick against the wide range of development of
students so young _ and about whether their ability to deconstruct
a fable, which was included in the New York test, is an appropriate
benchmark and predictor of future success. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-ANALOGIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Not every sports star can be
called another Michael Jordan. There's no Michael Jordan of golf
because there's a Tiger Woods of golf. Olympic gold gave freestyle
skier Jonny Moseley so much cachet that he doesn't need anybody
else's famous name. So here's a guide to Jordans still at work.
Meet the Michael Jordan of ... By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   TRAFICANT-SPEECHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rep. James Traficant,
D-Ohio, is a pro-labor, pro-school prayer ex-county sheriff
congressman who has turned the House's traditional one-minute
speech into a personal trademark and art form. A look at some of
his mini-addresses.
</P>

   DEAD-MAN-WHINING-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ A look into a heated
dispute between actor Sean Penn and 20th Century Fox over the use
of a corporate jet. By Bernard Weinraub.

   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-LEGACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Brazil has been attracting
treasure hunters of all stripes for centuries. From the Portuguese
who colonized it beginning in the 16th century to the Wall St.
money managers who made it a darling of emerging-market investors
in the 1990s, Brazil's economic promise is a perennial lure. But,
as Brazilians like to joke, theirs is the country of the future _
and always will be. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   EXEC-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the global economy spawns more
mergers between American and foreign companies, discrepancies in
the pay of top executives from each country quickly become
apparent. Then the pay of key officers of the merging companies
typically rises to the higher denominator, and American-style
capitalism claims a little more foreign turf. But is the American
way of compensating top executives _ with opportunity for
tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied to a rising
stock price _ better? By Adam Bryant. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM-REVIEW (Washington) _ The United Nations Special
Commission, charged with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war,
became an international intelligence service for the new world
order. It was the first of its kind _ and, it now seems, maybe the
last. For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged
the enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom
could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its
main supplier of spycraft: the United States. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-REVIEW (Miami) _ One year after Pope John Paul II visited
Cuba and urged the island nation to open itself up to freedom and
to the outside world, the Cuban government has made little progress
in improving its record on human rights, religious freedom and
economic reforms. By Larry Rohter.

   AIRPORT-SECURITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Airport security can
leave passengers feeling insecure. Checkpoint screeners miss
weapons that undercover testers hide under their clothes, or they
notice them but do nothing. Ticket agents forget to ask if
passengers are carrying packages from strangers, or fail to react
properly if the answer is yes. Airport employees don't single out
passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or
otherwise act suspiciously. Ground crews leave airplanes unlocked
and unattended, giving intruders an opportunity to plant a weapon
or a bomb. By Matthew L. Wald.

   STANDARDIZED-TESTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Standardized reading tests

benchmark and predictor of future success. By Jacques Steinberg.

else's famous name. So here's a guide to Jordans still at work.

   WASHINGTON _ Whether they want to see President Clinton driven
from office or whether they have completely tuned out the Senate
impeachment trial, Americans, on the first anniversary of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, do agree on one thing: They want it to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has called the
matter ``the most investigated sexual relationship in all of human
history.'' But when the end will come for the investigation of
Clinton's liaison with the former White House intern depends on the
definition of end.
</P>
<P>
   The dissection of the Lewinsky affair will continue at least as
long as the Senate trial grinds on _ no one is sure how long that
will be _ and probably a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   There are three criminal cases pending involving peripheral
figures in the Clinton scandals: Webster Hubbell, Susan McDougal
and Julie Hiatt Steele. Three more investigative bodies are looking
into aspects of the Lewinsky case. And even that is not necessarily
the end. If Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr believes anyone lied
during the Senate trial, he could seek more indictments.
</P>
<P>
   All this from what began nearly five years ago as an inquiry
into Clinton's involvement in a real-estate deal in 1978, the year
Clinton was first elected governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of voters want censure and a quick
end to the proceedings. More than 60 percent of voters in most
recent polls oppose removing the President from office. Most of
all, they are tired of the Lewinsky issue and want Congress to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent CNN/USA Today poll, voters ranked the impeachment
trial 10th in a list of issues to which Congress should give
priority in 1999, with only 16 percent citing it as an important
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest outcome of the unpredictable Senate trial is still
that the president will not be forced from office, but will face
some form of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his staff are watching the trial closely. If, as part
of a censure deal, the president admits that he lied under oath _
something White House advisers say is unlikely _ he could be
criminally prosecuted for perjury. Although indictment of Clinton
has been considered unlikely until after he leaves office, one of
Starr's legal advisers, law professor Ronald Rotunda, believes that
nothing in the Constitution bars the indictment of a sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for the Independent Counsel's
Office, would not comment on any indictment speculation, including
a report in December by CBS that Starr had not ruled out a deal
that would free the president of future criminal liability if,
during censure negotiations, he admitted perjury. The report was
attributed to anonymous friends of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, during a breakfast with reporters at a Washington
hotel, Bakaly said he expected the Independent Counsel's Office to
be in business for two more years. Now he says he has given up
predicting when the office will finish its business.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the investigation has a life of its own. The only
person who could remove Starr is Attorney General Janet Reno, and
that is all but unthinkable, for political reasons. And even if she
did remove him _ or if he resigned _ the work of the office would
continue until all trials and appeals were completed and final
reports written on all matters under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office is seeking to conclude the investigative phase and
matters it was assigned to by the special division as quickly as
possible, and then complete any prosecutions that arise from
that,'' Bakaly said last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr has stayed offstage since his marathon testimony
before the House Judiciary Committee in November, he has hardly
vanished from the scene. And the president is not the only one
still in Starr's line of sight. If the Senate calls witnesses,
Starr's staff will review their testimony to see if it square with
what they told his grand jury. And if witnesses veer too far from
what they told the grand jury last year, they, too, could face
perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who became a cooperating witness for Starr's
office, could find her immunity agreement revoked if she is called
before the Senate and tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, the opening day of the president's impeachment trial,
Starr's office sent out a stark reminder that it is still up and
running by indicting Ms. Steele, one of the peripheral figures in
the Lewinsky investigation. Ms. Steele's prosecution will provide
yet another occasion for the president's sexual conduct to be
deconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ms. Steele is to be arraigned in federal court in
Alexandria, Va., on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
arising from the Kathleen Willey tentacle of the Lewinsky
investigation. This tentacle sprouted when Starr began
investigating whether Clinton was truthful about his relationship
with Ms. Willey, a former White House volunteer who says the
president groped her, and whether there had been unlawful attempts
to influence her testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case. Ms. Steele, a confidante of Ms. Willey, has said Ms. Willey
asked her to falsely confirm her allegations about the White House
grope. Ms. Steele's lawyer said the charges against her were
politically timed and without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the case against Ms. Steele was filed when it was
ready and the timing had nothing to do with the beginning of
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the trial of Ms. McDougal, scheduled to begin
March 8 in Little Rock. A former Arkansas business associate of
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ms. McDougal faces
charges of criminal contempt for refusing to answer Starr's
questions about the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, the former associate attorney general who was indicted
for a third time by Starr last year, is to be tried on fraud and
false statement charges in June in Washington. Meanwhile, Starr is
awaiting a decision on his appeal of a tax case against Hubbell
that was dismissed by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   These cases could provide problems for Clinton, especially in
the unlikely event that either Ms. McDougal or Hubbell decides to
cooperate with Starr. Ms. McDougal has loudly accused Starr's
office of mistreating her and has said she knows of no criminal
conduct by the Clintons. And Hubbell warned that Starr's
prosecutors ``can indict my dog, they can indict my cat, but I'm
not going to lie about the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still underway is an inquiry ordered last fall by Norma Holloway
Johnson, a federal judge in Washington, into whether Starr
improperly leaked confidential information about his investigation
to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two open investigations involving Linda Tripp,
Ms. Lewinsky's former friend whose taping of their telephone
conversations set off the inquiry a year ago. A Maryland prosecutor
is looking into whether she violated that state's wiretapping law,
and Starr's office is examining her tape recordings to determine
whether any were doctored.
</P>
<P>
   And administrative business remains, including the writing of
final reports on other lines of Starr's investigations of the
Clintons: the Whitewater real estate deal, which was his original
mandate, the firings of the White House travel staff and the White
House's improper gathering of FBI files. In those matters, Starr
told the House Judiciary Committee, he did not find evidence of
impeachable offenses or criminal wrongdoing by Clinton. Finally,
Bakaly added, it will take time to close down the Independent
Counsel's Office, which has been investigating the president for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all the appeals.

<P>
   ``Facts are the enemy of truth,'' says poor, pure-hearted Don
Quixote in ``Man of La Mancha,'' the musical based on Cervantes'
classic novel.
</P>
<P>
   A friend recently gave Rep. Henry Hyde, the House Judiciary
chairman, the original Broadway cast recording of that show, and
when in odd moments he listens to its hummable tunes about the
Spanish Inquisition, he also hears Quixote sing: ``Heathens and
wizards and serpents of sin, all your dastardly doings are past.
For a holy endeavor is now to begin and virtue shall triumph at
last!''
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``The Impossible Dream,'' theme song of the virtuous
but doomed, the president's chief prosecutor in the Senate also
gets a dose of such relevant numbers as ``A Little Gossip,'' and
``I'm Only Thinking of Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, America is divided over whether Hyde is now
appearing in the role of the romantic, persecuted Quixote, or the
pitiless fellow inmate who shoves a looking glass in the deluded
hero's face and shouts: ``Look in the mirror of reality and behold
things as they truly are. Drown in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones clearly isn't his Dulcinea, the victimized barmaid
in whom Quixote sees only virtue; on ABC's ``Nightline,'' Hyde
referred to her sexual harassment suit against the president as a
``petty matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps when Quixote wonders if facts really are the enemy
of truth, he means that everything depends on what the meaning of
``facts'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Leigh, who wrote the music for the show, said he doesn't
like either the president or his prosecutor for the part. But when
he read that Hyde was a fan, he said, ``After one loud guffaw I
thought, well, if it helps him turn back into Dr. Jekyll, then I'm
glad.''

   WASHINGTON _ Throughout this murderous century, diplomats and
dreamers have envisioned a world in which nations would transcend
their boundaries, dispel their differences and band together to
preserve peace against dictators and despots.
</P>
<P>
   This vision of world federation helped create the United
Nations. And it engendered the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, known as Unscom, became an international
intelligence service for the new world order. It was the first of
its kind _ and, it now seems, maybe the last.
</P>
<P>
   For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged the
enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom
could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its
main supplier of spycraft: the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 weapons inspectors from around the world served
Unscom over seven years, spying on Iraq, surveying its military and
industrial plants, trying to do what smart bombs could not: destroy
nuclear, biological, chemical and missile programs hidden by Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, intelligence can achieve victory without war. But
espionage is a uniquely national enterprise. While nations may
share interests, spy services rarely do. ``There are friendly
states, but no friendly intelligence services,'' notes a spokesman
for Russia's foreign intelligence agency. When spies from two
countries shake hands, they are often trying to pick one another's
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   When the going got tough for Unscom, it sought U.S. spy
technology. U.S. intelligence gladly provided it but would not
share it with the world. The more secretive Unscom's work became,
the less open it could be with its member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If secret information is open to all member states, it won't
work,'' said Gordon Oehler, former director of the CIA's
Nonproliferation Center. ``If you let in the French, the Chinese,
the Russians _ that would kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for international cooperation. In March the special
commission adopted a U.S. eavesdropping system so secret that only
a handful of Americans, British, Australians and New Zealanders had
full access to it.
</P>
<P>
   This, understandably, led to tensions, notably between the
Americans on one side and the Russians, the Chinese and the French
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission began as a unique experiment. It was
assembled quickly after the 1991 gulf war, when Iraq was shattered
and powerless and the world seemed united in the determination to
disarm that country. It assumed unconditional power to do its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought together communities _ intelligence, military,
non-proliferation _ from around the world, and it brought new
thinking about how to do inspections,'' said David Albright,
president of the Institute for Science and International Security,
who served as a nuclear-weapons inspector in Iraq. Its leaders
thought they could disarm Iraq in no time _ ``possibly as little as
a year,'' its chairman, Richard Butler, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Butler conceded, ``it has taken eight years, and the job
is still not completely finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1995 did the inspectors understand that Iraq had an
extraordinary system to hide its secret weapons programs. Now three
more years have gone by trying to pierce that shield. And as it
turned out, the secret weapons _ the foundation of Saddam's power,
the ace in the hole with which he might someday trump the world _
were hidden by the same soldiers and spies whose duty it is to make
sure that the Iraqi dictator dies peacefully in bed. That made
piercing the Iraqi veil far more difficult than anyone had
expected, and prompted the Americans to roll out the particularly
sophisticated and sensitive equipment that yielded a a product they
were reluctant to share too widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is a sovereign nation, and there are limits to what you
can do if that nation wants to hide things from you,'' Oehler said.
``The best you can do is make it very painful for them if they
won't go along.'' Iraq has endured great pain _ including perhaps
$150 billion in lost oil revenues _ to defy disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is you can't disarm a country unless you're willing
to occupy it and forbid them the trappings of a sovereign nation,
such as a military force and the right to built that force,''
Oehler said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been willing to conquer Iraq in the name of world
peace. And America's French and Russian partners on the Security
Council are increasingly eager to resume business with Baghdad,
which owes them billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now the international coalition assembled by President George
Bush for the gulf war has dwindled to two nations: the United
States and Britain. Their four-day attack on Iraq in December was
``the first time in history that a nation has gone to war to stop
the spread of weapons of mass destruction,'' said Joseph
Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it failed, said Scott Ritter, the former marine who
resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he called a lack of
U.S. support. His accusations have helped raise suspicions that the
Americans used information supposedly gathered for Unscom to
precisely target Iraqi units closely linked to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was a final blow with which ``the U.S. killed
Unscom,'' Ritter said. ``The U.S. brought its own credibility and
objectivity into question. And the U.S. lost a lot of its moral
authority to lead on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Unscom is banished from Iraq and bloodied by international
infighting. The United States is back to taking potshots at Iraq,
playing Globocop, a role that alienates it from much of the rest of
the world. America's allies in the region are fed up with Saddam,
but their patience for U.S. bombing raids is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Butler bravely hopes for a new and improved Unscom. But now the
French and the Russians are proposing lifting the oil embargo on
Iraq in exchange for a new system of overseeing Iraqi weaponry _
and the Russians want to abolish the special commission altogether.
The United States is against those proposals. In any case, Iraq
will not submit to more inspections unless it is freed entirely
from the eight-year-old economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in international intelligence is over. No one
knows how a new arms control regime can be installed in Iraq. And
no one knows how much more pain Iraq is willing to endure to hide
its secret cache.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the eighth anniversary of the launching of the gulf
war, Iraq's chances of rebuilding a secret arsenal look good. The
future for world federations devoted to disarmament looks bleak.

   Clinton Is Advised Not to Free Pollard  &QL;

<P>
   Last fall, President Clinton came under pressure from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to free Jonathan Pollard from the
life sentence he is serving for spying for Israel. The president's
key national security advisers now appear unanimous in urging the
president to keep him locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there is no

Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Pollard severely damaged U.S. national security.

   A New Look At the Right to Move
</P>
<P>
   The federal welfare revision of 1996 was notable for ending the
concept of welfare as an entitlement, but a less noticed provision
was perhaps even more radical. By letting states pay lower benefits
to newcomers than to long-term residents, Congress challenged a
long-held assumption about U.S. citizenship: that people can move
from state to state without being relegated to second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   California's two-tier welfare program, which holds newcomers for
the first year to the benefits they would have received in their
home states, has now been challenged before the Supreme Court, and
the justices were not buying the state's argument that this was a
minimal, cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper values were clearly at stake. It was the ``genius'' of
the American system, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, that
``people can pick their states, but the states can't pick their
people.''

at first seemed to have the makings of an Israeli Watergate. But it

convention securing slots for his allies on the party slate. Prime

party, where Moshe Arens, a former ally and mentor, announced that

   Olympic Scandal Fallout
</P>
<P>
   Last Thanksgiving, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini was
letting slip to reporters that members of the International Olympic
Committee were encouraging her to run for a third term, perhaps
allowing her to preside over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. But
only two months later, the Olympic Committee is imploding over
reports that Salt Lake got the games by bribing members with land
deals, tuition payments, free surgical operations and contributions
to political campaigns and charities.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mayor Corradini has announced she will not run for
re-election this year. Three days before she took that step, the
top leadership of the Olympic Committee resigned, and reporters had
begun to ask the Mayor what she knew about Salt Lake's methods of
winning the selection process.

   Perhaps eyeing higher office, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has roamed from California to New Hampshire touting his
record of cleaning up New York. Now Giuliani is trying to spread
something else around the country: surplus city garbage. New Jersey
balked at his plan to ship trash there, and Virginia wants to block
New York waste.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor declared that in return for cultural and financial
benefits generated by the city, the rest of the nation has an
obligation to dispose of Gotham's garbage. He even warned of suing.
While his Solutions America political committee is promoting the
mayor nationally, his trash talk ruffled two prominent Republicans,
Govs. James Gilmore of Virginia and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.

   A Harsh Strategy For Breast Cancer  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For women with a high risk of breast cancer, a report published
last week offered hope, but at a cruel price. Removing both breasts
while they are still healthy reduces the risk of getting breast
cancer by 90 percent, according to a study of 639 women who had the
surgery from 1960 to 1993 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cautioned that the findings should not be used to
put pressure on patients to take such desperate measures. But women
who wanted the surgery in hopes of preventing breast cancer _ many
of whom had seen mothers and sisters die of the disease _ said
doctors were overly reluctant to recommend the procedure, or, in
some cases, even to talk about it.

   Princeton Gets the Shivers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University president Harold Shapiro suggested ending
the Nude Olympics, an annual tradition in which sophomores run
naked through a campus courtyard at midnight after the first big
snowfall. The problem: Many of the streakers use liquor to numb
their modesty before the cold numbs everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Running drunk and naked in circles around a frozen courtyard can
be perilous. After 350 students participated in this year's run,
five were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and four more were
treated at the university's health center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply not willing to wait until a student dies to take
preventive action,'' Shapiro wrote in a letter to The Daily
Princetonian, the student newspaper.

   Princeton Gets the Shivers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University president Harold Shapiro suggested ending
the Nude Olympics, an annual tradition in which sophomores run
naked through a campus courtyard at midnight after the first big
snowfall. The problem: Many of the streakers use liquor to numb
their modesty before the cold numbs everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Running drunk and naked in circles around a frozen courtyard can
be perilous. After 350 students participated in this year's run,
five were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and four more were
treated at the university's health center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply not willing to wait until a student dies to take
preventive action,'' Shapiro wrote in a letter to The Daily
Princetonian, the student newspaper.

<P>
   People just tuning in to Washington over the past year of sex,
pizza and judicial racing stripes could be forgiven for wondering:
Is government usually this diverting?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's all in the eye of the beholder. But don't decide
for yourself until after you've sampled the one-minute House floor
speeches of Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One-minute addresses are a House tradition, affording members
the opportunity at the beginning of the day to hold forth briefly
on any topic they wish _ yielding a sound bite and added verbiage
for the Congressional Record regardless of whether anybody present
is paying much attention. The speeches will resume shortly when the
new Congress takes up normal business.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, rest assured that Traficant will rise to be
recognized. Over his more than 11 years in the House, the
pro-labor, pro-school-prayer ex-county sheriff has turned the short
address into his trademark, a verbal blunderbuss loaded with
inanities to blast what he sees as Washington's absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   Usually he punctuates his remarks with a request to be ``beamed
up,'' a la ``Star Trek,'' to someplace where there's more
intelligent life. Here are excerpts.

   On the Economy
</P>
<P>
   Let us tell it like it is: When you hold this economy to your
nosey, this economy does not smell so rosy. If there is any
consolation to the American workers, I never heard of anyone in
America committing suicide by jumping out of a basement window. I
yield back all of the propaganda on this great economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 10, 1997
</P>
<P>
   On Nike's Asian Factories
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, I say it is time for the American consumers to tell
Nike to take a hikey and buy some American shoes before, so help me
God, we are all working in some sweatshop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aug. 2, 1996
</P>
<P>
   On NAFTA
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the White House says Nafta ((the North American
Free Trade Agreement))is creating new and exciting jobs. I did some
research on those jobs: zipper trimmer, brassiere tender, jelly
roller, bosom presser, chicken sexer, sanitary napkin specialist
and a pantyhose crotch closer machine operator. That is what I call
exciting jobs, Mr. Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 13, 1997
</P>
<P>
   On Regulation
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the Lord's prayer is 66 words, the Gettysburg
Address is 286 words, the Declaration of Independence is 1,322
words. U.S. regulations on the sale of cabbage _ that is right,
cabbage _ is 27,000 words. Now, if that is not enough to give Hulk
Hogan's dictionary a hernia, check this out. Regulatory red tape in
America costs taxpayers $400 billion every year, over $4,000 each
year, every year, year in, year out, for every family. Beam me up.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 29, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Foreign Policy
</P>
<P>
   Let us check this out: China gets $60 billion in MFN
((most-favored-nation status)) from Uncle Sam. Russia gets $15
billion in foreign aid from Uncle Sam. In exchange, Uncle Sam gets
nuclear missiles pointed at our cities, two tape decks and three
cases of vodka. Beam me up. I say our national security brain trust
needs a proctologist on staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ April 1, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On China
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is time to tell it like it is. When it
comes to China, we have gone from ``Speak softly and carry a big
stick'' to ``Take the fifth and carry a toothpick.'' Beam me up.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 22, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Reinventing Government
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the vice president said America needs to reinvent
government. To find out why, the GAO called the RTC, the ITC and
the PMS. They did not know.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO. then called the DOD, the DOT and the DDT. They did not
know. The GAO then called the CIA, the DIA, the EPA and the IUD.
They did not know. Then they asked the OMB to find out. The OMB
created a whole new program called the Government Analysis Service,
known as GAS.
</P>
<P>
   _ By Sept. 3, 1993
</P>
<P>
   On God
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, a new report says only 7 percent of scientists
believe in God. That is right. And the reason they gave was that
the scientists were ``super smart.'' Unbelievable. Most of these
absent-minded professors cannot find the toilet. Mr. Speaker, I
have one question for these wise guys to constipate over: How can
some thing come from no thing?
</P>
<P>
   And while they digest that, Mr. Speaker, let us tell it like it
is. Put these super-cerebral master debaters in some foxhole with
bombs bursting all around them, and I guarantee they will not be
praying to Frankenstein. Beam me up here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aug. 3, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Space Toilets
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, space. The final frontier. The search for new life,
new civilizations and now new toilets. That is right: NASA has a
$30 million space toilet. You strap yourself in and 12
high-pressure air jets aid your relief. ... Mr. Speaker, I say is
time to call out the Roto-Rooter man. ... Beam me up, Scottie,
nature is calling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 23, 1993
</P>
<P>
   On Russia's President
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, in 1993, Boris Yeltsin fell off a stage in Germany.
In 1994, Boris could not get off his plane in Ireland. In 1996
Boris came up missing for seven consecutive days, unexplained,
before an election. In 1997, he forgot about a meeting with Vice
President Al Gore. Yesterday, he fired his entire Cabinet. The
White House says they are monitoring it. ...
</P>
<P>
   I say monitor this. Boris Yeltsin does not need monitors. Boris
Yeltsin needs Alcoholics Anonymous. I say let us save our foreign
aid and let us sent some counselors over to take care of this guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ March 24, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Flag Desecration
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, in many cities and towns across America it is
illegal to kiss in public. It is illegal in some places to ride a
skateboard. It is illegal to burn trash or leaves. It is illegal to
yodel or sing in public and it is illegal, Mr. Speaker, to tamper
with a mailbox. However, in America, it is completely legal to burn
the flag, completely legal to desecrate the flag. It is even legal,
Mr. Speaker, to urinate on Old Glory. In the words of a Russian
comedian, ``America _ What a country.''
</P>
<P>
   _ June 7, 1995
</P>
<P>
   On Belching Cows
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, talking about garbage, the EPA is spending $210,000
to study cow belching and its effects on global warming. Here is
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Cows will wear backpacks and have hoses connected to their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, Mr. Speaker, what happens if the backpack is so tight
and instead of an oral emission, Elsie goes 7.0 on the Richter
scale? Will the president declare a garbage emergency ...? Or how
about maybe appoint a Congressional Bovine Burp Task Force. Or
maybe the EPA will require _ think about it _ scrubbers on udders,
bag hoses on nostrils. I think we ought to take a cattle prod to
the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sept. 26, 1991
</P>
<P>
   On Radioactive Beagles
</P>
<P>
   Madam Speaker ((Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., filling in as
speaker)), the remains of 800 beagles and 1,700 tons of their
radioactive urine and feces will be buried at a nuclear site in the
State of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The dead dogs have been in freezers since 1950. They were part
of a study to assess the damage of radioactive fallout. The study
is now conclusive: Radioactive fallout is fatal, and canines
subject thereto died. But the point is, Madam Speaker, the funeral
is going to cost $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, are they going to ship the bodies by limo? Are they
going to have gold tombstones for every hound?
</P>
<P>
   With 37 million people in America without health insurance, 9
million people unemployed, I would like to say that our government
is spending $22 million to erect a giant fire hydrant as a
mausoleum to dead beagles.
</P>
<P>
   I think that says it all, Madam Speaker: America's domestic
priorities have gone to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oct. 9, 1991
</P>
<P>
   On the Government Shutdown
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, something does not add up. . . . Experts say,
``Don't worry, America. If the federal government shuts down, only
nonessential workers will be furloughed.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Now the dictionary says nonessential means not necessary. Now,
if that is the case, did anyone around here ever stop to think that
if Congress did not borrow money to hire nonessential workers,
Congress would not have to borrow more money to pay nonessential
workers and Congress would not have to shut down?
</P>
<P>
   Beam me up, Mr. Speaker. Maybe, just maybe, the Congress of the
United States is a little nonessential.

SIT DOWN. NO, STAND UP. HAVE WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to get someone struggling to lose those
all-important 20 pounds lathered up into a frenzy, but come to
think of it, a frenzy may be just what the doctor ordered.
Old-fashioned fidgeting _ tapping your pencil against a conference
table in a make-or-break meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing
on the telephone, pacing back and forth until you wear a hole in
the carpet behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic study,
which fed 16 people 1,000 extra calories a day for eight weeks and
then told them to simply lounge around, have a good time _ and,
most of all, refrain from strenuous exercise. The researchers
wanted an answer to a question that has been voiced with equal
parts anger and green-eyed envy by anyone who has discovered that
last year's suits do not fit this year's dimensions: Why can some
people eat anything and everything and not gain an ounce, while
others bulk up with every swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised to find that some people _ the
fortunate ones, they said _ work off the extra calories by
fidgeting (``nonexercise activity thermogenesis,'' nutritionists
call it).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the notion that something as painless as ordinary
movements _ a tensing of a muscle here, a run to the lavatory there
_ can lead to weight loss (or at least weight control) will open
new horizons for the billion-dollar diet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York and spokesperson for Weight
Watchers, may face competition if Roadrunner (the hero of the Wile
E. Coyote cartoons) starts doing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores, too, can profit by clearing away some of those
no-pain, no-gain books for the blockbuster literature of fidgeting.
``There's an opportunity here for me to become a fidget guru,''
said Lewis Grossberger, author of ``The Non-Runner's Book''
(Collier, 1978). ``I'm going to write a best-selling health book
called `Fidget Your Way to Health' and tell you how to lose weight,
improve muscle tone and your sex life by fidgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that fidgeting is good may also force a
fundamental change in family dynamics _ after all, parents will no
longer have to tell their children to stop fidgeting at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, too, can stop worrying about acting like worrywarts
because of the health benefits. (Here things get confusing, though.
If they stop worrying, they might gain weight.) How many calories
does a shifty-eyed person use glowering at everybody in sight? Is
that how Richard M. Nixon kept fit during the dark days of
Watergate? Perhaps indoorsy types can skip the gym in favor of a
couple of practice golf swings during everyday conversations _ who
knew Johnny Carson had figured out the secret to a flat stomach?
</P>
<P>
   But isn't fidgeting just another name for nervous energy?
Apparently so. ``Let's be real,'' said Annette Hastings, director
of nutrition at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. ``If you are the
kind of person who moves around a lot, you're going to have higher
calorie needs. This is plain old common sense. Surprise,
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some researchers say there is food for serious thought in
the fidgeting findings. Karen Miller-Kovach, the lead scientist for
Weight Watchers International, said fidgeting ``seems to be a
personal characteristic that may have some hereditary links, but it
doesn't seem to be a habit that you can form.''
</P>
<P>

SIT DOWN. NO, STAND UP. HAVE WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to get someone struggling to lose those
all-important 20 pounds lathered up into a frenzy, but come to
think of it, a frenzy may be just what the doctor ordered.
Old-fashioned fidgeting _ tapping your pencil against a conference
table in a make-or-break meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing
on the telephone, pacing back and forth until you wear a hole in
the carpet behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic study,
which fed 16 people 1,000 extra calories a day for eight weeks and
then told them to simply lounge around, have a good time _ and,
most of all, refrain from strenuous exercise. The researchers
wanted an answer to a question that has been voiced with equal
parts anger and green-eyed envy by anyone who has discovered that
last year's suits do not fit this year's dimensions: Why can some
people eat anything and everything and not gain an ounce, while
others bulk up with every swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised to find that some people _ the
fortunate ones, they said _ work off the extra calories by
fidgeting (``nonexercise activity thermogenesis,'' nutritionists
call it).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the notion that something as painless as ordinary
movements _ a tensing of a muscle here, a run to the lavatory there
_ can lead to weight loss (or at least weight control) will open
new horizons for the billion-dollar diet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York and spokesperson for Weight
Watchers, may face competition if Roadrunner (the hero of the Wile
E. Coyote cartoons) starts doing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores, too, can profit by clearing away some of those
no-pain, no-gain books for the blockbuster literature of fidgeting.
``There's an opportunity here for me to become a fidget guru,''
said Lewis Grossberger, author of ``The Non-Runner's Book''
(Collier, 1978). ``I'm going to write a best-selling health book
called `Fidget Your Way to Health' and tell you how to lose weight,
improve muscle tone and your sex life by fidgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that fidgeting is good may also force a
fundamental change in family dynamics _ after all, parents will no
longer have to tell their children to stop fidgeting at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, too, can stop worrying about acting like worrywarts
because of the health benefits. (Here things get confusing, though.
If they stop worrying, they might gain weight.) How many calories
does a shifty-eyed person use glowering at everybody in sight? Is
that how Richard M. Nixon kept fit during the dark days of
Watergate? Perhaps indoorsy types can skip the gym in favor of a
couple of practice golf swings during everyday conversations _ who
knew Johnny Carson had figured out the secret to a flat stomach?
</P>
<P>
   But isn't fidgeting just another name for nervous energy?
Apparently so. ``Let's be real,'' said Annette Hastings, director
of nutrition at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. ``If you are the
kind of person who moves around a lot, you're going to have higher
calorie needs. This is plain old common sense. Surprise,
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some researchers say there is food for serious thought in
the fidgeting findings. Karen Miller-Kovach, the lead scientist for
Weight Watchers International, said fidgeting ``seems to be a
personal characteristic that may have some hereditary links, but it
doesn't seem to be a habit that you can form.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, like charisma or sex appeal, you either have it
or you don't. ``It's pretty much unconscious or subconscious
movements, even down to the people with nervous tics,'' she said.
``That all takes energy to make those muscles contract.''
</P>

SEPARATING NEWS FROM SLEAZE IN THE AGE OF FLYNT
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old metaphysical question asks what happens if a tree falls
in a forest with no one around. Does it make a sound?
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version of the question is: If a tree falls in a
forest, is it news? Does it become news only if Geraldo Rivera,
Larry King, Sam Donaldson, Matt Drudge, eight talk radio shows,
five World Wide Web sites, four newspapers, three cable channels,
two wire services and a late-night talk-show host take notice?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to be less metaphorical, can Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler magazine, get the press to give him a platform for his
campaign of offering cash to anyone who can expose the sexual
transgressions of a politician seeking to remove President Clinton
from office?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's coverage of Flynt's latest revelations showed that
yes, he can get attention. But it also showed that, unless the
target of his attacks responds, making news himself, self-appointed
newsmakers like Flynt can't necessarily keep the press' attention
very long. His accusations against one of the managers of the
impeachment trial, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., flowed through the cable
news programs leaving barely a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Flynt appeared on the CNBC program ``Rivera Live''
to report that Barr had refused to answer questions during a
divorce proceeding a dozen years ago about his relationship with
the woman who would become his third wife. Copies of the divorce
papers were given to the host, Rivera, who displayed them on
camera. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz denounced Flynt's campaign
and those who would use public figures' sexual transgressions
against them. The Rev. Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority
denounced sin and urged Dershowitz to stop hating people. About 1.3
million households tuned in, about 80 percent more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Then C-Span, which had planned to carry Flynt's subsequent press
conference live, backed off, fearing the Hustler publisher might
make charges that could get C-Span sued.
</P>
<P>
   And while dozens of reporters crowded into Flynt's office _ the
pornographer had, after all, forced the resignation of the House
speaker-elect, Bob Livingston, in December _ the leading American
wire service, the Associated Press, made only a glancing reference
to Flynt's accusations, at the end of its daily wrap-up of
impeachment news.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a dozen or more newspapers ran a more detailed
account distributed by the Reuters news service. The Washington
Post was the only major newspaper to use a stand-alone article by a
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with, say, the news of Michael Jordan's retirement
from basketball, the Flynt news was hardly prominent. The publisher
repeated his charges on the ABC program ``Good Morning America''
and on ``CBS This Morning''; CNN spent part of the day discussing
it, but, aside from Barr's terse refusal to comment on his private
life, Flynt got little reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filtering through the public consciousness and
made little noise. By Tuesday night, Flynt was complaining on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' ``I think Barr's going to get away with it
when he doesn't deserve to.'' On Wednesday, Flynt was on the ABC
News program ``20/20''; its audience size was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the filters that once kept such news from the American
public are easy to bypass. It is now conventional wisdom that the
Internet, talk radio and late-night comics provide a conduit
through which half-baked news, gossip and innuendo flow to the
public. Now new kinds of grass-roots editing seems to be evolving.
When people hear purportedly scandalous news that doesn't meet
their criteria of newsworthiness, they don't react. Since the whole
rationale for putting out scandalous news is the potential for
public and political reaction, no reaction means no story.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, the generation that is learning to invest
its own retirement money is now doing more editing of its own news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more is expected of the public and the viewers,'' Frank
Sesno, CNN's Washington bureau chief said in an interview. ``They
get more information _ they are inundated with information. There
is much more responsibility on their shoulders to figure out real
from fabricated information, or talk-show hype from journalistic
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Larry Flynt, Sesno said: ``Whether anybody likes
it or not, he has injected himself into this very ugly public
discussion. Ignoring him is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and much of the
public respectfully disagreed. Alan L. Murray, the Journal's
Washington bureau chief, said he was content to be in ``a race to
be last'' with sexual revelations about public figures. The Journal
published a brief item Friday describing the revelations and saying
they had little impact on Barr's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York Times,
sent no reporter to the Flynt press conference. ``This is the only
area of news where I can't imagine wanting to be first,'' he said.
When it comes to covering the sex lives of public figures, he
added, ``I need not just an excuse to do it. I need to be deprived
of my last excuse not to do it.'' The Times made a passing
reference to allegations about Barr's ``past'' in its impeachment
coverage Thursday.

</P>
<P>
   That raises the question, however, of articles like the one you
are reading at this moment, which provide a convenient framework to
inform readers and viewers about how information is passing through
the body politic. They also, inevitably, pass on information deemed
unworthy of publication in its own right, and so are widely derided
as back-door ways to give the respectable press a cover for passing
on disreputable information.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of forswearing all mention of rumor may be leaving
the rumor unchecked, or forgoing the chance to help readers
evaluate the information that comes their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Catch-22,'' said Doyle McManus, Washington bureau
chief of The Los Angeles Times, which printed Flynt's accusations
at the end of a long article about impeachment developments. ``By
reporting the rumor you give it greater currency. By not reporting
it, we have a feeling that we may not be serving our readers fully.
Part of the function of the mainstream media is to sort out,
verify, test and grade the flood of data we are all subjected to,
and to give some order to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ignore that large category of data that is called `the
buzz,' '' he added, ``then arguably we're not performing the
service we promised to.'' The solution for his publication, he
said, ``is to investigate the buzz or the accusation or the rumor,
and to find a way to put them in context. Which often means that
there will be a two or three or longer day delay between The
National Star and The Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star, a supermarket tabloid, was the midwife of a more
salacious, false rumor the week before Flynt's news conference. For
a week, thanks to its report _ given front-page play by The New
York Post _ late-night comics like NBC's Jay Leno were making jokes
about a tale that the president had an illegitimate child. Three of
the four newspapers that gave the rumor any ink _ The New York
Post, The Boston Herald and The Washington Times _ are no fans of
Clinton. The Daily News of New York debunked it in a science
article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Leno, with his audience of 6 million homes, who gave
the bogus report its greatest reach by using it in his monologue
two weeks ago. Leno says, ``I don't consider myself a news source
at all.'' And if he makes a mistake, he said, ``I don't mind
apologizing.'' Which is what he did during last week's monologues,
three times over.

<P>
   _ ``The Girl From Ipanema''
</P>
<P>
   Like the sensual strains of that old bossa nova tune, Brazil
enchants. And it has been attracting treasure hunters of all
stripes for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   From the Portuguese who colonized Brazil between 1500 and 1822
to the Wall Street money managers who made the country a darling of
emerging-market investors during the last several years, Brazil's
economic promise is a perennial lure. But, as Brazilians like to
joke, theirs is the country of the future _ and always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's most recent bid for economic stardom ended in
disappointment last week. Wednesday, the country devalued its
currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central
bank president, as it continues to struggle with excessive debt,
sky-high interest rates and fiscal austerity measures mandated by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Brazil became the latest victim of the global
financial contagion that broke out in Southeast Asia about 18
months ago and spread to Russia last summer. As was the case when
those economies went into a tailspin, Brazil's travails touched off
international concern about whether its problems will spread to
Argentina and Mexico and ultimately damage the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Brazil's stock market, showing the
effervescence of a bottle of champagne, had bubbled back up again.
Even so, this huge, resource-rich country, which shares a border
with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador, never
quite seems to realize the gilded dreams imposed upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest for El Dorado has been a feature of Brazilian life
ever since it was controlled as a colony by Portugal,'' said Larry
Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research
group in Washington. ``Every generation there are miraculous
expectations for the Brazilian economy. Brazil's financial barons
have shared these dreams, but they haven't been based on economic
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil is home to the world's eighth-largest economy,
it is hobbled by widespread poverty and unequal distribution of
wealth. And Brazilians, long accustomed to government corruption,
typically expect little from the grand economic schemes launched
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration trumpeted
Brazil as the next great superpower, huge state projects sponsored
by the World Bank and others were seen as one way for Brazil to tap
its hidden riches. For example, the Trans-Amazonian Highway,
stretching from coast to jungle, was built to exploit the wealth of
the interior. But it was rammed through without regard for its
impact on the rain forest or the indigenous population. And those
Brazilians who migrated to the interior on the highway found
largely useless tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such huge miscues, Brazil enjoyed relatively robust
economic growth from about 1965 to 1980, when oil price shocks and
the Latin America debt crisis helped bring an end to Brazil's
flirtation with superpower status. Foreign investment shriveled and
the Brazilian government continued to run up huge debts as
inflation spiraled out of control, soaring as high as 2,400 percent
in 1993, according to Jeffrey Schott, a specialist in international
trade at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation strangling the economy, the newest method for
realizing Brazil's economic promise was unveiled in 1994, when the
government effectively pegged the real to the dollar. The idea was
to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on the money supply.
Tight money, government cutbacks and open markets, of course,
constitute the miracle cure being peddled all over the world by
American politicians and financiers. But while inflation has been
brought under control in Brazil, some economists see another ill
that has been overlooked time and again _ wealth inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of economic experimentation, much of Brazil
remains desperately poor. The wealthiest 10 percent of Brazilians
receive about 48 percent of the country's income, according to the
World Bank, while the poorest 10 percent receive less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazil has tied its weak domestic economy to exports and
fickle overseas investors _ a dangerous dependence in a world in
which financial crises are quick to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has changed a great deal superficially, but for the
poor, who represent the bulk of the population, life has changed
very little,'' said Gillette Hall, an economist at the University
of Oregon in Eugene. ``Economic liberalization for Brazil, as for
many other developing countries, has meant an increasing dependence
on world export markets and international capital flows. That in
turn has left it prey to the vagaries of the global economy, which
are now coming home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil found itself in a corner last fall after the Russian
economy collapsed. Investors fled Brazil and speculators took aim
at the real. Brazil raised interest rates to defend its currency,
choking domestic growth and causing its foreign exchange reserves
to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil hopes that letting the real fall against the dollar will
boost exports and bring interest rates down. The flip side of this
strategy is that Brazilian borrowers owing dollar-denominated loans
will find it more expensive to pay off debts, raising the specter
of messy defaults.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, Brazil's vaunted economic promise is as it has
always been. Elusive.

 UNDATED: coverage Thursday.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question, however, of articles like the one you
are reading at this moment, which provide a convenient framework to
inform readers and viewers about how information is passing through
the body politic. They also, inevitably, pass on information deemed
unworthy of publication in its own right, and so are widely derided
as back-door ways to give the respectable press a cover for passing
on disreputable information.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of forswearing all mention of rumor may be leaving
the rumor unchecked, or forgoing the chance to help readers
evaluate the information that comes their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Catch-22,'' said Doyle McManus, Washington bureau
chief of The Los Angeles Times, which printed Flynt's accusations
at the end of a long article about impeachment developments. ``By
reporting the rumor you give it greater currency. By not reporting
it, we have a feeling that we may not be serving our readers fully.
Part of the function of the mainstream media is to sort out,
verify, test and grade the flood of data we are all subjected to,
and to give some order to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ignore that large category of data that is called `the
buzz,' '' he added, ``then arguably we're not performing the
service we promised to.'' The solution for his publication, he
said, ``is to investigate the buzz or the accusation or the rumor,
and to find a way to put them in context. Which often means that
there will be a two or three or longer day delay between The
National Star and The Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star, a supermarket tabloid, was the midwife of a more
salacious, false rumor the week before Flynt's news conference. For
a week, thanks to its report _ given front-page play by The New
York Post _ late-night comics like NBC's Jay Leno were making jokes
about a tale that the president had an illegitimate child. Three of
the four newspapers that gave the rumor any ink _ The New York
Post, The Boston Herald and The Washington Times _ are no fans of
Clinton. The Daily News of New York debunked it in a science
article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Leno, with his audience of 6 million homes, who gave
the bogus report its greatest reach by using it in his monologue
two weeks ago. Leno says, ``I don't consider myself a news source
at all.'' And if he makes a mistake, he said, ``I don't mind
apologizing.'' Which is what he did during last week's monologues,
three times over.

<P>
   _ ``The Girl From Ipanema''
</P>
<P>
   Like the sensual strains of that old bossa nova tune, Brazil
enchants. And it has been attracting treasure hunters of all
stripes for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   From the Portuguese who colonized Brazil between 1500 and 1822
to the Wall Street money managers who made the country a darling of
emerging-market investors during the last several years, Brazil's
economic promise is a perennial lure. But, as Brazilians like to
joke, theirs is the country of the future _ and always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's most recent bid for economic stardom ended in
disappointment last week. Wednesday, the country devalued its
currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central
bank president, as it continues to struggle with excessive debt,
sky-high interest rates and fiscal austerity measures mandated by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Brazil became the latest victim of the global
financial contagion that broke out in Southeast Asia about 18
months ago and spread to Russia last summer. As was the case when
those economies went into a tailspin, Brazil's travails touched off
international concern about whether its problems will spread to
Argentina and Mexico and ultimately damage the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Brazil's stock market, showing the
effervescence of a bottle of champagne, had bubbled back up again.
Even so, this huge, resource-rich country, which shares a border
with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador, never
quite seems to realize the gilded dreams imposed upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest for El Dorado has been a feature of Brazilian life
ever since it was controlled as a colony by Portugal,'' said Larry
Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research
group in Washington. ``Every generation there are miraculous
expectations for the Brazilian economy. Brazil's financial barons
have shared these dreams, but they haven't been based on economic
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil is home to the world's eighth-largest economy,
it is hobbled by widespread poverty and unequal distribution of
wealth. And Brazilians, long accustomed to government corruption,
typically expect little from the grand economic schemes launched
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration trumpeted
Brazil as the next great superpower, huge state projects sponsored
by the World Bank and others were seen as one way for Brazil to tap
its hidden riches. For example, the Trans-Amazonian Highway,
stretching from coast to jungle, was built to exploit the wealth of
the interior. But it was rammed through without regard for its
impact on the rain forest or the indigenous population. And those
Brazilians who migrated to the interior on the highway found
largely useless tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such huge miscues, Brazil enjoyed relatively robust
economic growth from about 1965 to 1980, when oil price shocks and
the Latin America debt crisis helped bring an end to Brazil's
flirtation with superpower status. Foreign investment shriveled and
the Brazilian government continued to run up huge debts as
inflation spiraled out of control, soaring as high as 2,400 percent
in 1993, according to Jeffrey Schott, a specialist in international
trade at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation strangling the economy, the newest method for
realizing Brazil's economic promise was unveiled in 1994, when the
government effectively pegged the real to the dollar. The idea was
to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on the money supply.
Tight money, government cutbacks and open markets, of course,
constitute the miracle cure being peddled all over the world by
American politicians and financiers. But while inflation has been
brought under control in Brazil, some economists see another ill
that has been overlooked time and again _ wealth inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of economic experimentation, much of Brazil
remains desperately poor. The wealthiest 10 percent of Brazilians
receive about 48 percent of the country's income, according to the
World Bank, while the poorest 10 percent receive less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazil has tied its weak domestic economy to exports and
fickle overseas investors _ a dangerous dependence in a world in
which financial crises are quick to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has changed a great deal superficially, but for the
poor, who represent the bulk of the population, life has changed
very little,'' said Gillette Hall, an economist at the University
of Oregon in Eugene. ``Economic liberalization for Brazil, as for
many other developing countries, has meant an increasing dependence
on world export markets and international capital flows. That in
turn has left it prey to the vagaries of the global economy, which
are now coming home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil found itself in a corner last fall after the Russian
economy collapsed. Investors fled Brazil and speculators took aim
at the real. Brazil raised interest rates to defend its currency,
choking domestic growth and causing its foreign exchange reserves
to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil hopes that letting the real fall against the dollar will
boost exports and bring interest rates down. The flip side of this
strategy is that Brazilian borrowers owing dollar-denominated loans
will find it more expensive to pay off debts, raising the specter
of messy defaults.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, Brazil's vaunted economic promise is as it has
always been. Elusive.

NEW INTERNET CENSORSHIP LAW WILL FAIL, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress passed another unconstitutional piece of legislation
last year and attached it as a rider to the 40-pound, 4,000-page
Omnibus Appropriations Bill. When President Clinton signed the bill
into law in October, the Internet censorship act became law, too _
bad law.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, members of Congress ignored the First Amendment's
proscription: ``Congress shall make no law ... abridging the
freedom of speech,'' and passed the Child Online Protection Act
(COPA). The law contains the same constitutional problems that were
found in the Communications Decency Act, which was struck down by a
unanimous vote of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the guise of protecting children from online smut, Congress
created a new federal crime. Anyone who knowingly makes material
that is ``harmful to minors'' available on the World Wide Web for
commercial purposes can be fined $50,000 and spend up to six months
in jail _ for each violation. Worse, a person can be fined $50,000
for each day that such material was made available.
</P>
<P>
   According to COPA, ``The term `minor' means any person under 17
years of age.'' And the term ``commercial purposes'' is broad
enough to include anyone using the Internet to gather or post
information while conducting research that might lead to
publication.
</P>
<P>
   COPA defines ``harmful to minors'' as any material that is
obscene, which is already illegal. However, ``harmful to minors''
also includes 1) material that the average person would find
appeals to a minor's prurient interest; 2) depicts sex acts in a
manner that is patently offensive to minors; and 3) ``taken as a
whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value for minors.'' All three conditions must be met before
material can be considered ``harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with First Amendment case law will recognize this
three-prong test as a variation on the Miller test from the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in Miller vs. California (1973). The
courts use the Miller test to determine whether a book, movie,
video or other material is obscene.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here, however, is that an adult must guess what is
patently offensive to a minor and what would appeal to a minor's
prurient interest and what would lack serious literary value for a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   For most 15-year-old boys, almost any material that hints at
sex, even bra ads in the Sears catalogue, would appeal to their
prurient interest. And one could argue that it would be nearly
impossible to find sexual material that would be patently offensive
to boys that age.
</P>
<P>
   Would special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report, which details
the sex acts that Clinton and Monica Lewinsky allegedly committed,
be harmful to minors? Would Starr's report have political value for
a 16-year-old? Probably. But what about an 8-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress considered the report important enough to post on
the World Wide Web _ and rightfully so. Whether or not the public
agrees with Starr's allegations or the manner in which they were
described, the report is politically and historically significant
as part of the Republican Party's attempt to remove a Democratic
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the problem, then _ should law-abiding citizens only
post material on the Internet that would not offend or ``harm'' an
8-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely where COPA falls short. Speech that is
appropriate for adults, like a discussion of rapes in prison or
genital mutilation, may not be appropriate for young children _
nevertheless, the Internet cannot be limited to what is only
appropriate for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court's 1997 decision concerning the
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act, Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote: ``In order to deny minors access to potentially
harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of
speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to
address to one another. That burden on adult speech is unacceptable
if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in
achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to
serve.'' The high court has made this exact point in numerous cases
before 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Assistant Attorney General L. Anthony Sutin of the U.S.
Department of Justice sent a letter to the House Committee on
Commerce to spell out the department's objections to COPA. Sutin
wrote that attempting to enforce the provisions of the act would
divert ``investigative and prosecutorial resources that the
Department currently invests in combating traffickers of hard-core
pornography, in thwarting child predators, and in prosecuting
large-scale and multi district commercial distributors of obscene
materials.'' Sutin also noted that COPA has serious constitutional
flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It's axiomatic that when a law attempts to restrict
constitutionally protected speech based upon its content, the law
violates the First Amendment. Somehow, members of Congress fail to
understand this nation's long and honorable freedom of speech
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   COPA sweeps too broadly and too vaguely to be constitutional.
And it does not take the least restrictive means to achieve its
worthy goal of protecting children from speech they might find
shocking or disturbing _ and that is reason enough to toss this act
into the junk-pile of history.
</P>
<P>
   The act requires anyone who has a Web site that contains sexual
material to verify the age of those who wants to view the site. Age
verification technologies are prohibitively expensive. The
requirement would shut down many, if not most, educational Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union and 16 other plaintiffs
challenged COPA the day after it was signed into law. Judge Lowell
A. Reed Jr. of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia granted a
temporary restraining order that prohibits enforcement of the act
until Feb. 1. The judge noted that it is likely the ACLU would
prevail on the merits of some of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   If this case reaches the Supreme Court, we can expect the law to
be overturned with a finality that will strengthen free speech law
as it applies to the Internet. And that result will be well worth
the time and resources spent defending our First Amendment rights.

SWIFT ON CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What about  &UR; CENSURE &LR; ? in the weeks after House impeachment of
the President,  &UR; censure &LR;  promptly rented space in the halfway house
between Senate conviction and acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Because this column's pristine purpose is to elucidate, not to
calumniate, let's pull the politicized word out by its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin  &UR; censura &LR;  means ``an assessment, a judgment, a
reprimand.'' The title  &UR; censor &LR;  was given to magistrates in ancient
Rome who supervised public morals and drew up the register, or
 &UR; census &LR; , of citizens. (Enumerating them one by one, of course, not
using statistical sampling, although the related  &UR; censere &LR;  means
``to estimate.'' But back to pristine purpose.) That Latin word for
``judge'' shot off in two directions in English.
</P>
<P>
   One branch led to  &UR; censor &LR; , as the judgment ``to delete or
suppress expression objectionable to those in authority.'' John
Bellenden, in his translation of Livy's history of Rome, observed
in 1533, ``In this yere began the office of  &UR; censouris &LR; ,'' and
 &UR; tsouris &LR;  (Yiddish for ``trouble'') is what writers have been given
ever since. Shakespeare picked it up in ``Coriolanus,'' having
Junius Brutus recall Coriolanus' ancestor as ``twice being
 &UR; Censor &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The other branch led to  &UR; censure &LR; . That noun's early meaning of
``opinion'' soon gave way to ``condemnation,'' the sense we use
today. ``Duke Robert justly  &UR; censured &LR;  stood,'' went a 1596
historical poem by Michael Drayton, ``For Disobedience and
Unnaturall Pride.'' (The Duke of Normandy's full name was Robert
Short-Thigh. The surname was quickly discarded by descendants.)
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare understood the meaning of both branches of
 &UR; censura &LR; . In ``Measure for Measure,'' he had Duke Vincentio opine
that holders of high office cannot escape unfairly harsh criticism
in this life: ``No might nor greatness in mortality/Can  &UR; censure &LR; 
scape; back-wounding calumny/The whitest virtue strikes. What king
so strong/Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?'' White
House aides might consider these words for placement in a stone
carving over the entrance to the Clinton Library.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the satirist Jonathan Swift, in his 1726
``Gulliver's Travels,'' had a Lilliputian tell the captured
Gulliver, a giant they considered to be threatening their state,
``The council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a  &UR; censure &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The verb form paralleled the noun's meaning. Today, the verb  &UR; to
censure &LR;  means ``formally to find fault; to pronounce adverse
judgment; to lay blame; to condemn as wrong.'' In general use, it
need carry no penalty or other punishment.
</P>
<P>
   BLUENOSES
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were single,'' wrote the Times columnist Anthony Lewis
about some snooping into a relationship, ``so the most prurient
 &UR; bluenose &LR;  could not have objected.'' And in David Shaw's book
``The Pleasure Police,'' the media reporter provided the subtitle
``How  &UR; Bluenose &LR;  Busybodies and Lily-Livered Alarmists Are Taking
All the Fun Out of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The color  &UR; blue &LR;  has long been associated with sex and
profanity. In 1864, John Hotten's slang dictionary had this entry:
`` &UR; Blue &LR; , said of talk that is smutty or indecent,'' and the
slanguist John Farmer noted in 1890 that  &UR; to make the air blue &LR; 
meant ``to curse; to swear; to use profane language.'' A century
before, laws enforcing public morality were christened  &UR; blue laws &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But whence  &UR; bluenose &LR; ? That word was used by Washington Irving
in 1809 about a New England cheese, and in 1836 by Thomas
Haliburton, Canadian creator of Sam Slick, the Clockmaker, to
describe natives of Nova Scotia. (One theory: It's cold up there,
and noses can turn  &UR; blue &LR; . Another: Fishermen would rub their noses
on their wet  &UR; blue &LR;  sweaters, picking up the dye.) The word was
also applied to a purplish potato and a shellfish known to that
area. In 1858, Oliver Wendell Holmes spoofed the term with
``ceruleo-nasal'' (from the Latin  &UR; caerule &LR; , ``deep blue''), in
reference to a Canadian provincial character working on the
trans-Atlantic submarine cable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blue-nose &LR;  was later used to derogate Scottish Presbyterians,
but gained a happier connotation as the name of a speedy fishing
schooner that Canadian yachtsmen still revere, and appeared in 1937
on that nation's 10-cent piece.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Demon Rum. The word was used by friends of John
Barleycorn to sneer at temperance forces inveighing against the
users of alcohol. The OED cites a 1927 usage during the rise of
Prohibition: ``a lot of  &UR; blue noses &LR;  on the Board.'' In that year,
hard-drinking newspapermen who frequented Lipton's saloon in New
York City, near The New York Times building, then on Nassau Street,
referred to the prohibitionists' `` &UR; Blue-Nozzle &LR;  Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Etymology now has a great tool in cybersearching. I don't
personally indulge, but my research assistant, Kathleen Miller _
with the help of JSTOR, a zingy database that includes obscure
academic publications _ found a reference to  &UR; bluenose &LR;  in a 1990
article by David Jaffee in The William and Mary Quarterly. That led
to an early-19th-century Farmer's Almanack, in which Robert B.
Thomas made up a character, ``Tom  &UR; Bluenose &LR; ,'' along with a
saloonkeeper, ``Toddy Stick,'' to deliver the message of
temperance. (This makes me feel like the madman who contributed
citations to the OED's Sir James Murray.)
</P>
<P>
   The sense of  &UR; bluenose &LR;  we seek goes beyond the temperance
movement to mean ``one who is excessively puritanical; a moralizing
snoop.'' Merriam-Webster has the earliest dictionary citation, from
the 1903 Frank Norris novel, ``The Pit'': ``I was vegetating there
at Barrington, among those wretched old  &UR; blue-noses &LR; .'' Today it
has become an attack on all moralists, whether sincere defenders of
moral principles or the hypocritical hounds: Its meaning is now
``disapproving busybodies.''

 Includes a color slide of Kenneth Branagh with Helena Bonham Carter
in a scene from ``The Theory of Flight.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You've heard about Kenneth Branagh's allegedly boundless
ambition, his stage triumphs, his epic Shakespearian films, his
sensational divorce from Emma Thompson and his relationship with
Helena Bonham Carter. Could there be anything more to be heard?
 &HT;    How about his life of crime?
 &HT;    The time: winter 1969. The place: a poverty-stricken
neighborhood in war-riven Belfast, Northern Ireland. Enter young
Ken Branagh.
 &HT;    ``The streets were going crazy and people started breaking into
this supermarket,'' the actor recalls. ``The whole place was in an
uproar, and I was gripped by the hysteria.''
 &HT;    Branagh ran in and swiped a package of soap powder.
 &HT;    ``I took it home as a trophy for my mother,'' he says. ``Before
I could say a syllable, I got a smack on the head and was dragged
by the ear amid a mob of rioting people. I had to put the soap back
on the shelf.''
 &HT;    Don't worry, that was long ago. And the soap in his suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel is safe _ since that day, Branagh
hasn't stolen anything but scenes.
 &HT;    Some of those scenes occur in his latest film, Paul Greengrass'
``The Theory of Flight,'' which co-stars Bonham Carter and opens
nationwide Jan. 22. Branagh plays an eccentric artist who, while
trying to build his own flying machine, finds himself the caretaker
to a young woman who, despite being crippled by Lou Gehrig's
disease, is determined to lose her virginity.
 &HT;    It's the latest entry in a barrage from the previously
slow-paced Branagh, including Robert Altman's ``The Gingerbread
Man'' (1998), Woody Allen's ``Celebrity'' (1998) and, opening July
3, a rare big-studio role in ``The Wild, Wild West.''
 &HT;    ``The Theory of Flight'' is by far the smallest in scale of his
recent spate, and Branagh was attracted to it in part by the chance
to work with Bonham Carter for the first time since they met while
co-starring in ``Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'' (1994).
 &HT;    ``Doing this film wasn't just about working with Helena,'' he
adds quickly. ``I admired the writing enormously and admired the
director. Essentially for me, it's all about what's on the page. If
I feel a strong connection, then that is my bedrock.''
 &HT;    Not that Bonham Carter's presence hurt.
 &HT;    ``Of course that was nice,'' Branagh says with a laugh, ``but I
didn't look at our chemistry. It was all about the chemistry
between the characters.
 &HT;    ``Chemistry is such a strange thing. You just feel it,'' he
adds. ``When I audition with actors, there are some people who just
walk into a room and you know you will have it with them, whatever
it is. A compelling, charismatic personal quality sadly has nothing
to do with it _ it really is in the way this person talks or reads
for the part.''
 &HT;    Branagh's most successful performances have come in films which
he also directed _ ``Henry V'' (1989), ``Dead Again'' (1991),
``Peter's Friends'' (1992), ``Much Ado About Nothing'' (1993),
``Hamlet'' (1997) _ but he says he didn't feel awkward acting for
another director.
 &HT;    ``The enjoyment of just acting and having one thing to worry
about was delicious,'' he says. ``I just had to keep my mind
occupied with how I could convey the facets of this troubled,
funny, passionate and slightly crazy man.''
 &HT;    He was never tempted to offer directing suggestions, Branagh
adds.
 &HT;    ``It only occurs to me to direct if I must,'' he says. ``If the
subject matter compels me to the point where I can't do anything
about it but direct, then I step behind the camera.
 &HT;    ``It's like being a painter,'' he adds. ``Sometimes you have to
paint. When I direct, I will notice that something has been
bubbling away at me for two or three years until I must find the
form to tell it.''
 &HT;    Despite his roots in an Irish tobacco-factory town, Branagh is
the first to admit that his rise to fame was meteoric.
 &HT;    ``I hear actors talk about the hard times,'' he says, ``but I am
loath to complain abut anything. I think I've had a very pleasant,
privileged time.
 &HT;    ``My notion of hard times would make many people laugh.''
 &HT;    Actually, his worst moments came after he achieved stardom.
 &HT;    ``I would say that my toughest time was in the wake of making
`Henry V' (1989),'' the actor says. ``I felt I arrived at a
position in the business where there was a level of attention that
I had not remotely anticipated.
 &HT;    ``The years that followed were hard,'' he says. ``It's not like
it was any kind of burning tragedy for me, but I found it difficult
to adjust myself to what seemed to be expected of me. Honestly, I
did not feel myself worthy of the attention or the praise that was
lavished on me.''
 &HT;    It wasn't all praise. The London tabloids had a field day when
Branagh and Thompson, the young ``first couple'' of English acting,
divorced.
 &HT;    ``I guess I don't feel like I was victimized,'' Branagh says,
``but there were some slings and arrows thrown. I was thrown a bit,
and it took awhile to adjust. I had to keep reminding myself that
this was just a tiny and passing phenomenon.''
 &HT;    Do the tabloids still spy on him?
 &HT;    ``Not that I know of,'' he says cautiously, ``but perhaps they
still do. I'm not terribly worried _ I'm convinced that, even if
they were, nobody who reads those things really gives a damn about
me. People are not waking up this morning in this fine land of
yours wondering what I'm up to. It's just as simple as that.
 &HT;    ``I mean, you've got Leo and about 9 million people in front of
me. They're waking up wondering what's going on with them.''
 &HT;    In the wake of unsought notoriety, and with his string of hits
emphatically broken by the failure of ``Frankenstein,'' what's left
for Branagh is the craft of acting. A graduate of the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Arts in London, he went on to become a member of the
Royal Shakespeare Company and the director of his own troupe, the
Renaissance Theater Company.
 &HT;    It was through that group that he met Thompson, and the two rose
to fame together in ``Henry V,'' ``Dead Again,'' ``Peter's
Friends,'' ``Much Ado About Nothing'' (1993) and a television
production of John Osborne's ``Look Back in Anger'' (1993).
 &HT;    Then came ``Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,'' for which
director/star Branagh received precious little critical praise in
either capacity and meager rewards at the box office.
 &HT;    ``I've learned you move on,'' he says. ``You do the best job you
can. I don't think in terms of failure or success _ the success is
if you're happy with the work the moment you say `Cheerio' to it.''
 &HT;    Next up for Branagh is his latest Shakespeare adaptation, a
musical version of ``Love's Labour's Lost'' in which he will
co-star with Alicia Silverstone and Nathan Lane, among others.
 &HT;    ``There's a spectacular dance number,'' he says
enthusiastically. ``The piece also contains this fantastic charm,
sweetness and a great deal of melancholy.''
 &HT;    Branagh concedes that the songs have him a little nervous.
 &HT;    ``I've never done a musical before,'' he says. ``So in the last
few weeks I've been meeting with choreographers. I have to decide
the tempo and sketch out the numbers. I could spend six months
talking about these matters.
 &HT;    ``I've got a shot of panic now,'' the actor admits. ``And then
you take a deep breath and realize that it will all come together.
Each day is a baby step closer to my goal.''

FROM CUBE TO TUBE: SCOTT ADAMS TAKES `DILBERT' OUT OF HIS CUBICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of cartoonist Scott Adams at his drawing
board. 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The carcasses of failed TV shows, plays and movies based on
comic strips and comic books litter the entertainment highway. The
films ``Popeye'' (1980) and ``Howard the Duck'' (1986), the stage
musical ``Doonesbury'' and the television sitcom ``Hazel'' spring
instantly _ and painfully _ to mind.
 &HT;    Yet here comes ``Dilbert,'' debuting Jan. 25 on UPN. Based on
Scott Adams' comic strip about a profoundly overburdened engineer
trapped in his microscopic cubicle, the series features Daniel
Stern as the title character's voice, with Larry Miller as his
tactless Pointy-Haired Boss and Susan Griffin and Gordon Hunt as
his co-workers, the high-strung Alice and the lazy Wally. Back
home, Jackie Hoffman is his busybody Dilmom and Chris Elliott
voices his smart-aleck pooch, Dogbert.
 &HT;    ``It seemed like an obvious idea to all involved,'' Adams says.
``When a cartoon is successful you always think about how to expand
it, and TV is the obvious way to go.''
 &HT;    But will Dilbert _ whose empire already encompasses 1,900
newspapers, four hardcover business books, a dozen reprint
collections, a heavily visited website and more than 100 licensed
products, from CD-ROM games to magnets, ties to training videos _
cut it on television?
 &HT;    ``It's just a matter of good writing,'' the 41-year-old Adams
says by telephone from his home in Danville, Calif. ``I'm not sure
how to define that, other than to say we're trying hard to avoid
all the normal cliches people can see on every other show.
 &HT;    ``Every sitcom, every season, has at least one major episode in
which a major character has a conflict about whether or not they
may be gay,'' he says. ``We won't do that episode.
 &HT;    ``Being a cartoon, we can go places and do stuff you can't do on
a sitcom,'' Adams adds. ``We can change our scenery, bend reality
and violate physics. So we'll take advantage of that.''
 &HT;    Along with Larry Charles of ``Seinfeld'' fame, Adams serves as
executive producer of ``Dilbert.'' He co-wrote the pilot episode,
``The Name,'' and will help write subsequent half-hours as well.
 &HT;    Adams also oversaw the progression of the animation, in order to
ensure character consistency and the proper backgrounds and color
schemes.
 &HT;    ``I can't say I felt at home with the writing,'' he admits,
``because I clearly could not have sat down and written a script
from beginning to end without lots of other people being involved.
I might develop that skill at some point, but it felt to me like
wading into unfamiliar territory.
 &HT;    ``It was fun, though,'' the cartoonist adds. ``I was comfortable
any time I was writing dialogue, but trying to hold in my head an
entire 21-minute story with several subplots is tough.''
 &HT;    A few episodes had been written by the time the actors had been
cast. Once he had the tapes, however, Adams says it made a major
difference.
 &HT;    ``That changed how I wrote,'' he says. ``At this point, when I
write dialogue, I hear the actors' voices. In particular, I hear
Larry Miller when I'm writing the Boss.
 &HT;    ``Oddly enough, I do not hear voices when I write the strip.''
 &HT;    It's been just over a decade since Dilbert first heaved a sigh
of frustration. Bored by his job at Pacific Bell, Adams began
scribbling cartoons in 1988, and one thing led to another.
 &HT;    Adams fine-tuned several strips and shopped them around until
United Features Syndicate agreed to distribute ``Dilbert.'' By
1989, the strip was running in 50 newspapers.
 &HT;    Even then, Adams held onto his day job, drawing his strip early
in the morning before leaving for work. He didn't leave until 1995.
 &HT;    Leaving Pacific Bell gave him pause, Adams acknowledges. He
wondered if ``Dilbert'' might lose its edge once he was out of the
day-to-day workplace politics that had furnished his inspiration.
 &HT;    ``You always worry about that kind of thing,'' he says, ``but,
like so many things you worry about in life, it turned out to be
the opposite of what you imagined.
 &HT;    ``In reality, when I went to the office, I was usually in a
little closed room with two or three people I knew pretty well,''
he recalls. ``So my work life was not very rich with experience.
Being free of that, being able to look through e-mail and broaden
my horizons a little, I probably have a richer pool to draw from at
this point.''
 &HT;    So now Adams devotes his full energies to ``Dilbert'' in all its
myriad incarnations.
 &HT;    ``I imagined it all could happen,'' Adams says, stressing the
second word. ``If you'd put a gun to my head and said, `You must
bet your life that it will happen,' I'd have bet against it.
 &HT;    ``But I'm so eternally optimistic that I always imagine I'll be
changing the world, winning the lottery and learning to levitate my
body with pure thought,'' he says, laughing. ``So I kind of live in
this artificial world of extreme optimism.
 &HT;    ``The most bizarre aspect of it being a reality is that I always
have something to talk about with strangers,'' he adds. ``I'm
naturally shy, but now you can put me in any social context and
I'll automatically have something somebody else wants to talk
about, which makes it easier for me to talk.
 &HT;    ``Totally by accident, I solved the biggest social problem in my
life.''
 &HT;    Now Adams is being asked to solve UPN's problems. The
long-fledgling network counts only ``Star Trek: Voyager'' and
``Moesha'' as bona-fide hits, and is bleeding affiliates and
viewers to its fellow upstart, the WB network.
 &HT;    Some industry watchers speculate that UPN's survival depends on
``Dilbert,'' but Adams refuses to put that kind of pressure on
himself or the show.
 &HT;    ``Clearly, in my opinion, `Dilbert' is not UPN's last, great
hope,'' he says. ``They have very deep pockets, and I think they're
in it for the long haul.
 &HT;    ``Secondly, that seems more like their problem than mine,'' the
cartoonist says. ``My world goes up to but not beyond making a good
cartoon for TV. After that, it becomes an external thing for me
whether or not `Dilbert' changes UPN's fortunes.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I hope it does,'' he adds hastily. ``I want it to,
because I like the people there, and I want them to be successful.
But my responsibility ends at making a good product.''
 &HT;    But even if it succeeds, is there such a thing as too much
``Dilbert?''
 &HT;    ``You worry about how much is out there,'' Adams admits, ``but
if you compare `Dilbert's' exposure to, let's say, `Garfield,'
`Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,' `Barney' or `The Simpsons' in its
first year or two, it really doesn't approach that level.
 &HT;    ``Usually, the ones that get exposed to death are child-oriented
properties,'' he adds. ``The ones that can endure a little longer
tend to be ones that reach into adulthood. Mickey Mouse is
well-managed. `Peanuts' is growing like crazy, in Japan in
particular.
 &HT;    ``So you can last 40 years in this business, if you don't rub it
in people's faces.''
 &HT;    Not that he's thinking 30 years down the road.
 &HT;    ``I intentionally don't plan far in advance,'' Adams says.
``I'll almost certainly do `Dilbert' for five more years. Beyond
that, who knows?
 &HT;    ```Dilbert' is a painless thing to do,'' he adds. ``It's easier
for me to imagine me doing it than not doing it, if people still
want to see it. It's a job. It's not enjoyment, like laying at the
beach is enjoyment, but I'm the kind of person who needs to be
working to feel useful.
 &HT;    ``And, as jobs go, it doesn't get any better than this.''

 Includes a color slide of country singer Charley Pride. 
 By JERRY ARMOR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Country singers love to sing about the hardships they've faced,
and more than a few can sing almost as sad a song offstage. The
road to success is a rocky one, they say, and they had to surmount
a lot of obstacles to reach the big time.
 &HT;    Some of them could do with spending a few minutes with Charley
Pride. Virtually none of today's performers has had to contend with
the social and cultural barriers that confronted country music's
greatest black entertainer.
 &HT;    Pride never set out to be a pioneer. He became acquainted with
country music listening to his father's Philco radio in their home
in Sledge, Miss. As the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts filled the
sharecropper's house each weekend, Pride came to know and love the
likes of Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams.
 &HT;    Even then, it seemed strange. Many of Pride's family and friends
wondered why a black youngster should be so enchanted with white
folks' music.
 &HT;    Those questions multiplied when Pride acquired a Sears &AMP; Roebuck
guitar, bought with money he'd earned in the cotton fields, and
began to perform that music.
 &HT;    ``Folks were not necessarily angry at me for singing the whites'
music,'' Pride hastens to add. ``It was more curiosity than
anything else, the uniqueness of it _ they were baffled.
 &HT;    ``It's not like they wanted to beat me up or anything,'' he
says. ``It was like, `How come you look like us but sound like
them?' And for the whites, it was `How come you sound like us but
look like them?'''
 &HT;    In the South of Pride's youth, it wasn't only in music that
lines were drawn. Racial segregation was at its height, and every
aspect of life was more complicated for a black youth.
 &HT;    ``You and I could be talking on the street and decide to go into
the drugstore to get a soda,'' Pride tells a white interviewer.
``But we would have to go in through separate doors and sit on
separate sides of the counter. The waiter would serve you, and then
he would turn and serve me.
 &HT;    ``We would be sitting there talking to each other, watching the
same television, yet there was still this barrier between us.''
 &HT;    By the late 1950s, Pride was a confirmed devotee of country
music, but not necessarily a professional. The industry offered
precious few opportunities for a black singer, and Pride _ always a
gifted athlete _ decided that his way to a better life was through
baseball.
 &HT;    A pitcher and outfielder, he began playing in semipro leagues in
the South and later in Montana, soon catching the eye of
major-league scouts. He kept singing, but merely as a diversion.
 &HT;    In 1961 the young man got his shot at the majors, getting an
opportunity with the newly formed California Angels. The music
industry unknowingly got lucky, however, when a nagging injury cut
his sports career short.
 &HT;    ``I had a 90-plus-mile-per-hour fastball,'' Pride recalls. ``But
I had cracked my elbow and tried to come back too soon. The muscles
just never developed. They sent me packing with a tuna-fish
sandwich and an orange.''
 &HT;    So music became his career and baseball the diversion. Even
today he keeps his hand in, occasionally working out with the Texas
Rangers.
 &HT;    ``For a 60-year-old,'' he adds, ``I can still hit the ball
pretty good.''
 &HT;    After being released by the Angels Pride returned to Montana,
where he had a regular job with a mining company. He began singing
in area bars and clubs, where several established artists heard him
and encouraged him to try his hand in Nashville. A contract with
RCA followed, and Pride was on his way.
 &HT;    ``'Most everyone I came into contact with was supportive,'' he
recalls. ``I'm sure there were skeptics, but no one would admit it.
 &HT;    ``But there were certainly some that were behind me from the
beginning, like Red Sovine,'' he adds. ``His son Roger and I are
still good friends _ he knows what his dad meant to me. And there
were others like Ernest Tubb, Buck Owens, Marty Robbins and Mel
Tillis. I could go on and on.''
 &HT;    It wasn't always easy. When he was introduced to an unsuspecting
white audience, he says, a noticeable hush often fell over the
crowd. But it didn't take long for Pride's self-deprecating humor
and warmth _ plus his musical talent _ to win them over. A
truckload of awards, membership in the Grand Ole Opry and 32 No. 1
hits attest to his enduring appeal.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, while a few black country singers have followed in
his footsteps, Pride remains a rarity in an overwhelmingly white
industry.
 &HT;    ``It's like asking why there haven't been any more black
senators or a black president,'' he says. ``I don't think there's
one specific reason. Our society has always been into `ya'll, them
and us.' And that's brought with it years and years of neglect and
being told, `You keep yours and I'll keep mine.'
 &HT;    ``There are too many people still going along with that way of
thinking _ `ya'll, them and us,''' Pride says. ``I've got grandkids
still having to deal with it. What bothers me is that we're still
talking about the same problem, but the problem's still there.
 &HT;    ``I succeeded because I was able to slide around that system of
neglect and being left out.''
 &HT;    Today, Pride says, he's struggling with a different, more subtle
type of discrimination. He and other country-music veterans are
finding themselves pushed aside in favor of younger,
radio-friendly, video-active artists.
 &HT;    ``The moguls have this idea now of throwing 25 artists against
the wall to see if two stick,'' the singer says bluntly. ``But I'm
not going to prostitute myself just to sell a few records.
 &HT;    ``I was still selling when the industry shoved artists like me,
Waylon and Dolly off the labels,'' he says. ``But I think the
pendulum is swinging. I think the moguls are in a quagmire right
now and don't know what to do.
 &HT;    ``I'm going to watch and see how it plays itself out, and I'll
still be here if it swings back around.''
 &HT;    Pride is far from idle, he adds quickly. He performs regularly,
even if he has no current record contract.
 &HT;    ``I'm doing the same thing I've been doing for years,'' he says.
``We'll be going to England, France and Ireland. I've got dates in
Maryland, Texas, North Dakota, Georgia and Iowa. There are places
all over America that are waiting for me to come back. I wish I
could play one show in every state for those fans that I've
neglected.
 &HT;    ``I'm not recording anything new right now,'' he admits, ``but
my management people are talking about it. I feel bad about not
having any new material out there right now _ I've got four
generations of fans that would like to hear something new from
Charley Pride.''
 &HT;    Now, however, Pride seems less inclined to fight the industry
head-on. Secure in his place in musical history, he won't let the
1990s get him down.
 &HT;    ``I'm not trying to compete anymore,'' he says. ``I just want to
do the best I can, do some living of my own and enjoy life. I want
to have the best of both worlds, if I can.
 &HT;    ``The Lord's still blessing me and I can still sing, and if it's
meant to be, it will happen.''

GETTING OFF THE NANNY TRACK: FRAN DRESCHER ON LIFE AFTER `THE
NANNY'

 Includes a color slide of Fran Drescher with Charles Shaughnessy in
a scene from ``The Nanny.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look up the word ``chutzpah'' in the Hollywood lexicon, and
you're sure to find a photo of Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   Get past that trademark voice _ an attribute she delicately
refers to as a ``nasal nuance,'' though it's more akin to a sack
full of feuding tomcats _ and the carefully cultivated ditziness,
and you'll discover the sharpness and savvy of a corporate
barracuda.
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed ``Jewish neurotic/control freak'' leaves
nothing to chance. Serving as star, executive producer and
occasional director of her six-season hit, while also personally
overseeing everything from publicity photos to script rewrites,
Drescher has not only parlayed her larger-than-life persona into
CBS' longest-running sitcom, but also expanded it into a hit film _
``The Beautician and the Beast'' (1996) _ and her best-selling book
``Enter Whining'' (Regan Books, 1996), not to mention a sizable
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   She's also smart enough to know that it's best to quit while
you're ahead. On Jan. 8, Drescher caught everyone, including her
own network, off guard by telling ``Entertainment Tonight'' that
she had decided to pull the plug at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always stayed too long at the fair my whole life,'' she
said, ``and I'm not going to do that with `The Nanny.'''
</P>
<P>
   Drescher may have erred in the past, but if so it was always the
result of excessive enthusiasm, not lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you throw yourself into life, you always come back with
gold,'' she wrote in her book.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grab-the-bull-by-the-horns attitude that has served her
well since her high-school days in Queens, N.Y. At age 17, while
working as head fryer at the local Chicken Jamboree, she shelled
out 15 hard-earned bucks to enter herself in the Miss New York
Teen-ager competition.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed at being only first runner-up, she was convinced by
her mother that coming in second still made her a winner. Yes, she
agreed, and began calling talent representatives, promoting herself
as ``Fran Drescher, the winner of the Miss New York Teen-ager
pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be everybody's tactic of choice, but it worked. She
got herself an agent and, not long afterward, landed her first
speaking role, a bit part in ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   When the day came to shoot her scene, star John Travolta
announced that he was too tired and depressed to work. But the
determined Drescher refused to let Hollywood histrionics interfere
with her career development. Marching over to Travolta, the
neophyte actress suggested that he smarten up and start behaving
like a professional.
</P>
<P>
   He did. She followed him onto the set, uttered her one line _
``Are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?'' _ and
gave him a playful pat on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A string of larger parts in less memorable films _ ``American
Hot Wax'' (1978), ``Gorp'' (1980), ``Doctor Detroit'' (1983) _
followed, prompting one magazine writer to refer to her as ``the
actress you can't forget in movies you can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The future finally brightened in 1984, when the pivotal role of
music promoter Bobbi Fleckman in Rob Reiner's small-budget cult
classic ``This Is Spinal Tap'' gained her a modest degree of
attention. It led first to a pass from Warren Beatty _ she said no
thanks, she reports _ and ultimately to a more bankable offer from
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Cast opposite Twiggy and Julie Hagerty, Drescher found herself
on the network's 1991 prime-time schedule as one of the
``Princesses.'' The series lasted less than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Her show may have bombed, but the actress's plucky determination
continued unabated. Cornering CBS president Jeff Sagansky on a
trans-Atlantic flight, she convinced him to let her and Peter
Jacobson, her husband and one-time high-school sweetheart, shape a
sitcom more in tune with her unique comic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Voila _ 18 months later, ``The Nanny'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Six subsequent years as America's favorite ``gefilte fish out of
water'' hasn't dampened Drescher's enthusiasm, but it has made her
wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest rule about show business,'' she says, ``is that
there are no rules. You can be the most talented person in the
world and never get arrested, or you can be the biggest lox and
become a huge star. It doesn't correlate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to medical school and you're an excellent doctor,''
Drescher adds, ``you'll probably work very successfully. But you
can go to Yale and study to be an actor and speak the King's
English and never get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the more you know and the more you do
within the industry, the more options and choices you have,'' she
concludes. ``Consequently, now that I have the good fortune of a
hit series, within that realm I'm a director, a producer, a writer
and an actress. And so, when the time comes for `The Nanny' to go
away, I'll have options to do things behind the camera as well as
in front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in the works are another high-profile film, a second
volume of memoirs _ ``Still Whining,'' naturally _ and a
development deal with MTV for a comedy series to be called ``The
Daytrippers.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Nanny'' has remained her core business, and despite
declining ratings that may have hastened her decision to end the
show, the actress insists that she has no regrets about having
violated one of the cardinal rules of television sitcoms: Don't
change anything.
</P>
<P>
   Altering a well-established show's dynamics with a marriage or a
baby usually rings the death knell _ just ask the folks at ``Murphy
Brown'' or ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drescher took the lead in pushing to do exactly that,
incorporating both a wedding _ at the end of the past season her
character married her boss, wealthy Broadway producer Maxwell
Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) _ and a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were countless discussions about whether or not we
should do this,'' she admits. ``The character is a bit of a sex
symbol, and me getting bigger than a house doesn't somehow go part
and parcel with that. But, just like everything else, we're taking
a leap into the unknown. It kicks us into a whole other place.''
</P>
<P>
   Drescher does, however, concede that the pressure of maintaining
the series has taken a personal toll. Though Jacobson is still
involved with the show, in October 1995 the couple separated after
17 years of marriage and, despite various attempts at
reconciliation, the split now seems permanent.
</P>
<P>
   These days, her companion of choice is Chester _ or, as she
calls him, ``Chest-ah Dresch-ah'' _ an orange Pomeranian that she
purchased as a pup more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most pampered pet in Hollywood, Chester goes
everywhere Drescher does and travels with his own luggage _ a
gourmet-takeout bag stuffed with toys, snacks and a chilled bottle
of Evian.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?,'' the actress says with a shrug. ``I totally
indulge him.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be unattached, Drescher adds, but celebrity-spotters
shouldn't waste time looking for her at the Hollywood hot spots on
her rare days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I rarely get out of bed,'' she says. ``I have a
massage Saturday morning, and then usually I'm dead all day. I
always have writing to do, so if I can I work out of my bed,
spending hours and hours making very concrete notes and fixes for
the script. Then I get reflexology, and sometimes I turn the phones
off for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, I'm out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, there's nobody sharing those sheets except Chester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got news for you,'' she says. ``Ever since Peter and I
separated, Chester's got his side of the bed and I've got my side.
All this dog wants is that I should have his puppies _ he totally
thinks that he's my husband now.''

SENATE'S BAN ON PHOTOGRA PHY IS DISSERV ICE TO READERS, HISTORY  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE JAN. 17 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine an historic event occurring _ only the second
time such a thing took place in the nation's history _ and there
being no way to photograph it.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what's happening in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bars photographers from its chambers. This means that
during President Clinton's impeachment trial, photographers are
allowed only outside the main entrance to the Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are visuals available from television recordings made
inside the chamber. But adapting those images to print is difficult
and results in such poor technical quality that the readers of
newspapers and magazines are at a distinct disadvantage in
reviewing the proceedings and the conduct of their elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the matter of posterity. Video is one way of
recording history. Still photography is another. Still photos are
easier to view, requiring no equipment or special settings to
peruse. Given the gravity of the proceeding, senators have a
responsibility to ensure maximum documentation of the historic
event.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents argue that opening the chamber to photography
will be disruptive and distract from the business at hand. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Technical advances allow
photography from the gallery with available light and extremely
quiet equipment. Plus, many news organizations are capable of
providing a pool photographer _ a single photographer whose work is
then pooled and shared with participating news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The House allowed still photographers in its chambers for its
proceedings, and the photographers produced an important
documentary record of the impeachment debate and vote last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many organizations _ including the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, the Associated Press and the Standing Committee of Press
Photographers _ have urged Sens. Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell, Tom
Daschle and Christopher Dodd to permit the Senate proceedings to be
photographed.
</P>
<P>
   We urge you, newspaper and magazine readers, to do the same.
It's your interests that are at stake. &QL;

SALT: THE NECESSARY INGREDIENT OF WINTER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Optional chart follows.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Consider salt, that lowly crystal.
</P>
<P>
   It once was precious: The word ``salary'' derives from
``salarium,'' the Latin word referring to money given to Roman
soldiers to purchase salt.
</P>
<P>
   These days common salt (chemical name sodium chloride, symbol
NaCl) is, well, common: Sprinkled from shakers, spun by the ton
from the stern of salting trucks, used to cure leather and to
season the meat from which the hide was skinned.
</P>
<P>
   A necessary component in blood, salt also is used to keep the
contents of our traffic arteries flowing. Similarly, just as too
much salt in a diet causes health problems, excess sodium chloride
outside is harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the side of your car, wainscotted with road salt.
</P>
<P>
   Look at your carpets, at that pale perimeter adding
circumference daily from footwear puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Look at your pet, busily licking its paws before trotting to the
water bowl to soothe a salt-scorched tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Salt is destructive. But it is a necessary nuisance. The
alternative? Roads that resemble bobsled chutes. Slick sidewalks
and whoops, off to central casting goes another fractured wrist,
hip, noggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't like to see the level of (salt) usage that we
have now,'' said Willard Bruce, commissioner of the Department of
General Services in Albany, a snowy upstate New York city that
spends $250,000 a year on road and sidewalk salt alone, about a
quarter of its snow-removal budget. During an average winter, the
area uses 100,000 tons of salt to tame the snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce said, ``We're a city, a population of people who
travel by foot. We don't have an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt keeps us going in the winter. But we needn't suffer its
ravages passively.
</P>
<P>
   For homeowners, other ice-melt compounds less corrosive than and
superior in performance to sodium chloride are available to scatter
on sidewalks and driveways. Different types of salt _ potassium or
calcium chlorides _ cost too much to use on roads but are ideal for
smaller jobs: They work faster and at lower temperatures than
common salt. And nitrogen fertilizer, or urea, won't harm grass,
plants or concrete the way salts do. Its downside: slow melting
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Urea is the suggested method of attack on walkways, around
flowerbeds and on driveway edges, said Ken Carnes, the
commercial-landscape nursery agent for Cornell Cooperative
Extension of Albany County. Salts of all kinds seep into the soil
and compete with plant roots for moisture, whereas fertilizer soaks
into the ground and helps plants and grasses immediately. Only
several days of strong spring rains will help leach salts from the
earth, Carnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Salts thrown from snowblowers also damage evergreen trees and
bushes, Carnes said, by extracting moisture from their needles. His
suggestion: urea again, or a secure winter cloak of burlap for pine
bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Salt similarly sucks the suppleness from leather shoes, which
can suffer permanent damage if salt residue isn't removed daily.
Regular cleaning and treatment with protective oils is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward preventing salt damage to rugs and carpets
is an entryway rubber mat and a strict rule against walking onto
rugs with snow- and slush-coated boots, said Jim Hennesey, owner of
Carpetmaster Carpet Cleaning in Cohoes, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acid nature of salts can permanently bleed and bleach
carpeting,'' Hennesey said. Blot up any trailed-in snowmelt, he
suggests, and vacuum thoroughly once the spot dries. A steam or
hot-water-extraction cleaning of carpets once or twice a winter
will fully flush any remaining salts or their oils.
</P>
<P>
   Salts irritate and can cause sores on pet paws, said Dr. Jane
Farrell, a veterinarian at Animal Health Center in nearby Clifton
Park. That's more of a problem with dogs, who walk on sidewalks and
roads with owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock salt is known to cause inflammation in between the toes
and the pads,'' Farrell said. ``One of the signs is that the dog
starts to lick its feet excessively, and sometimes if it's really
bad they will limp.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell advised a thorough paw rinse when the dog returns
indoors or, if the pooch will tolerate them, dog booties.
</P>
<P>
   There are no snow booties for cars. Drive a car in the snow and
it soon will wear a chloride coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to see salt on the roads and cars getting dirty,''
said Tom Hoffman Jr., whose family owns 16 carwashes in the Albany
area. Winter is the company's busiest season, Hoffman said, and
customers especially appreciate Hoffman Car Wash's ``bottom blast''

<P>
   Among the popular ice-melt products available in hardware,
grocery and home-care stores:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sodium chloride (rock salt). Characteristics: The same stuff
as table salt but less refined; like all salts, melts ice and/or
lowers the freezing point of water; good down to about 5
Fahrenheit. Pluses: Cheap, effective, widely available. Minuses:
Corrosive; catalyst for vehicular rust; harms shoes, plants, grass,
evergreens, pet paws, concrete; doesn't work in extreme cold.
Price: About $5 per 50-pound bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calcium chloride. Characteristics: Available in pellet and
flake forms; concentrated, meaning less needed per application;
some blends good down to 15 or 20 below zero. Pluses: Fastest
melter, less likely to be tracked into homes and cars, less
corrosive than salt. Minuses: Expensive, more corrosive when pure
than in blends. Price: About $15-$20 for 50 pounds, depending on
type and blend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potassium chloride. Characteristics: Usually found in blends
with sodium chloride and/or other chemicals; faster than salt but
slower than pure calcium chloride; good for down to just below
zero. Pluses: In pure form is safest for all surfaces; less
corrosive than salt. Minuses: More expensive than salt; slower than
calcium chloride. Price: $12 to $15 for 50 pounds, depending on
blend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nitrogen fertilizer (urea). Characteristic: Not a salt, so
won't harm vegetation; good down to just above zero. Pluses:
Cheaper than calcium and potassium chlorides; fertilizes lawns,
flower beds as soaks into soil; doesn't harm walkways; less residue
to be tracked in. Minuses: Works more slowly than salts; more
needed per application than salts; will damage shoes, rugs, pet
paws. Price: About $10 for 40 pounds.

GOOD SAMARITANS: AS RARE AS HEINOUS CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reports of violent crime are down all over
America with murder at its lowest level in 31 years. All the law
and order agencies who keep statistics swear the decline is real.
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel safer? Find yourself relaxing with your kids in the
car? Taking solitary walks at night? Trusting strangers more? Why
is the reality of a safer America so hard to accept?
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about this ever since my friend Bernie Ward,
a radio host in San Francisco, called to ask my opinion about a
recent encounter he had. Driving home from work after 1 a.m., he
stopped at a red light where a man was standing in the street,
screaming for help because someone had stolen his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if the light had turned, I'd have driven on,'' Bernie
said. ``But I was stuck, and I made eye contact. The guy was
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie not only stopped, he let the man get in his car, and gave
short chase when they saw the stolen vehicle a few blocks away.
After the thief ditched them, Bernie waited while the man called
the cops and gave them a report. Then he taxied the carless guy to
his house a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie's wife (and mother of their four children) was furious
that he'd put himself in such a dangerous position. About 95
percent of Bernie's weeknight audience _ he shared the story on the
air _ sided with his wife. Even his Sunday morning ``Godtalk''
listeners, typically a kinder, gentler bunch, overwhelmingly agreed
he shouldn't have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of flabbergasted,'' Bernie said. ``Is the Good
Samaritan dead?''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is, no. But he and she are so deep in hiding, they
might as well be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is because people today are harder-hearted than they
were when Jesus spoke of a Samaritan who put aside sworn enmities
and carried a battered Jew to safety. Much more likely, the
potential Good Samaritans of 1999 are simply paralyzed with fear _
irrational fear, based on perception, not reality.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago while I was home in Indiana, I walked into a
Sam's Club, the members-only offspring of Wal-Mart. On display in a
clear plastic case near the entrance of the store was a lightweight
bullet-proof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a police exhibit? No. It was a coming attraction for the
store's shelves. As the printed material in the case explained, a
bullet-proof vest was the ultimate protection for today's smart and
concerned American.
</P>
<P>
   I looked around at the housewives in sweatsuits, the
overall-clad farmers, the jeans-and-T-shirted college kids, and I
wondered: What kind of society produces small town, hard-working
Hoosiers who believe they need a bullet-proof vest to survive life?
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not exclusively our fault, we news media types
bear much responsibility for this sorry phenomenon. As much as any
force, we help scare Good Samaritans into hiding. Every day on the
front page and on the nightly news, we deluge folks, not with the
accounts of millions who made it home safely, but with murders,
rapes, kidnappings and mega rip-offs.
</P>
<P>
   These horrors are rarities; that is why they are ``news.'' But,
somewhere along the way _ likely with the glut of
all-news-all-the-time _ people stopped perceiving of them as rare.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie first told me his story, I had many of the same
reactions his wife and listeners had. But as we talked, something
dawned on me: Bernie recounted the story, not from a hospital bed
or posthumously via dramatic 911 tape, but from the peace of his
living room. Nothing bad had happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Was this just because he was ``lucky''? Or was it because the
odds of getting killed, injured or badly suckered _ even when you
help a stranger late at night on a city street _ are still mighty
low?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget all the crud we report for a minute,'' I told Bernie.
``How many people do you personally know who got killed, hurt or
ripped off because they stopped to help someone in trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie thought. I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' he finally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me either.''

FOUR CURES FOR CABIN FEVER
</HEADLINE>
  By LORI B. MURRAY 
 c.1999 Lori B. Murray 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time February arrives, the holidays are long gone, and
midwinter blues are center stage. It's time to get creative about
your leisure time with the kids -- before cabin fever gets the best
of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ BUILD A BACKYARD ICE RINK
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're lucky enough to have a pond nearby, it may not be
safe for skating. Build your own fun with a backyard ice rink.
Invite the neighborhood kids and serve hot chocolate to warm little
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   1. Locate some level ground. Build a frame using lumber that is
1'' thick and 10'' high. Stake the frame on the outside so that
when the ice expands, your frame won't be knocked over.
</P>
<P>
   2. Build your frame on a warm day when the ground is still soft.
</P>
<P>
   3. Material for the inside of the rink should not be put in
place until it gets cold. It should be in one piece, without seams,
and it cannot be taped together. Either Visqueen (8 millimeter
thickness) or Permalon white plastic work well as a liner and can
be found at building supply stores. Don't use dark colors since
they absorb sunlight, making it harder to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carefully place the plastic sheeting inside your frame,
butted completely against the wall or frame. When you add water,
you will need to adjust the plastic so that it fits snugly but does
not pull.
</P>
<P>
   5. Use furring strips to hold the plastic in place over the top
of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   6. Keep leaves off the ice. Flood the ice nightly to smooth it
out after use and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   7. Add lighting for night skating if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   _ BAKE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Whether you bake basic bread or quick, sweet bread, there's
nothing more satisfying than the smell of fresh bread baking in the
oven on a winter day. Don't be shy about making a loaf from
scratch; kids like to get their hands gooey and watch the dough
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Try the following kid-friendly books for bread recipes and tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bake Bread!'' (J.B. Lippincott Co., 1976); ``Knead It! Punch
It! Bake It! -- Make Your Own Bread'' (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1981);
``Let's Bake Bread!'' (Lerner Publications Co., 1973); ``Betty
Crocker's Breads'' (Western Publishing Co., 1974); ``The
Breadbasket Cookbook'' (Walker Books Limited, 1982).
</P>
<P>
   _ HAVE AN INDOOR PICNIC
</P>
<P>
   Get out the picnic basket, spread the tablecloth on the floor,
and build a fire in the fireplace. All you need now is some great
picnic food to complete the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a simple menu:
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Whole Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf Salad (easy and fun for kids to make)
</P>
<P>
   Banana Cupcakes
</P>
<P>
   _ CAMP IN
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's too cold to camp in the snow, but an indoor camp-out
in the family room by the fireplace sounds inviting. Pull out the
sleeping bags, hoist the tent, roast some marshmallows, and tell
campfire stories or sing songs. You won't have any stars to gaze
at, but the flames in the fire will do.

WHEN CHILDREN LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By LYNNE S. DUMAS 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bonjour,'' sang out the 4- and 5-year-olds as they trooped
into the pre-kindergarten French class at New York City's Trevor
Day School. After greeting their teacher, Matt Dexter, the children
settled down and joined him in a game: They thumped their thighs,
clapped their hands, and as the teacher pointed to a body part,
called out its name in French: ``Le nez, la tete, les yeux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est bon!'' praised Dexter. The kids beamed with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign language classes like this one not only help kids gain
language skills but also help them build self-esteem, thinking
skills, math ability and an appreciation of different cultures. And
children are best able to absorb a second language when they are
under 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language comes easily to very young children,'' says Nancy
Rhodes, executive secretary of the National Network for Early
Language Learning in Washington, DC. ``At birth, they begin to
learn their parents' language because they hear it all the time.
Very young children can pick up a second language just as easily by
hearing it singing songs in it and using it in their play,'' Rhodes
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' growing understanding of the brain helps explain why
young children can learn languages so effortlessly. ``From infancy
to age 6 or 7, there is a great deal of neurogenesis -- the
development of new connections -- going on in the brain,'' explains
Dr. George Bush, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, who specializes in brain mapping. ``A child's brain
is shaped by his experiences -- what he sees, hears and touches,''
says Bush. ``When it's exposed to the sounds of a second language,
the brain of a young child will actually grow connections that make
a new language easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Around age 12, the brain not only begins to slow in its ability
to develop those connections but starts to prune away any that
aren't being used, Bush explains. Thus children who don't start
learning a second language until later in life will often have a
more difficult time doing so because their brain may not have
developed the necessary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids learn a second language early on, say as toddlers,
they tend to manage both their native and second language from the
same location in the brain,'' says Joy Hirsch, a professor of
neuroscience at Cornell University Medical College in New York
City. ``Kids who learn later -- as teenagers, for example -- seem
to manage their second language from a different and separate
location in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch hypothesizes that ``older children may have a harder time
because their brain has to do extra work to create additional space
for the second language. And they must do this at a time when the
brain is becoming less facile at generating new connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely due to parents' clamoring, a fast-growing number of
elementary schools are offering second-language training to their
youngest learners. According to the Center for Applied linguistics
in Washington, DC, the number of elementary schools holding foreign
language classes climbed almost 10 percent between 1996 and 1997,
to 31 percent. That means more than 4 million elementary school
students are learning a foreign language in school before the age
of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, New
Jersey, North Carolina and Oklahoma -- have instituted a
second-language requirement for all children in elementary school.
And Delaware, Florida, and Hawaii are considering a variety of ways
to increase foreign language offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that learning a foreign language actually
enhances children's overall mental development. A study of 13,200
third- through fifth-graders at tending public schools in Louisiana
was revealing: It demonstrated that regard less of race, gender or
academic level, kids taking foreign language classes did better in
the English language arts section of the Louisiana Basic Skills
Tests than students who were not studying a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
   Math scores of children studying a second language improve, too.
Carol Saunders, a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
examined test scores of third-graders in 18 Georgia grade schools
and found that kids who had had foreign language instruction since
kindergarten did significantly better in the math section of the
Iowa Tests of Basic Skills than students with no foreign language
training.
</P>
<P>
   When given foreign language instruction by age 3 or 4, children
are able to speak like a native in their second language. As a
rule, says Donna Linton, director of the foreign language program
at Trevor Day School, ``the younger the children are, the better
their accent will be, especially if they've had some foreign
language training before learning to read English. That's because
the system of sounds they learn in English interferes with the one
they need for a foreign language. Once they've developed and
concretized formal reading and English language skills, their
accent in another language will never be quite as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring a native accent comes as a natural extension of
growing up in a bilingual family. But making sure your child is at
ease with more than one language takes a great deal of patience
even in a bilingual family, says Cristina Villalon-Kartheiser of
New York City, who has spoken only Spanish to her daughters, Katie,
6, and Annie, 4, from the moment they were born. The girls' father
speaks to them in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very committed,'' says Villalon-Kartheiser.
``Whichever language one parent chooses to speak, he or she needs
to maintain it all the time so that the child doesn't feel that
either language spoken at home is less important in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   What if neither parent is bilingual? Try to make sure that your
child has continual exposure to a native speaker of a language
other than English, such as a grandparent or babysitter, suggests
Villalon- Kartheiser. You can also read stories to your child that
incorporate foreign words into English text, such as ``Rosita's
Calico Cat'' by Emily Thompson. Cassettes or CDs of Spanish songs,
such as De Colores by JoseLuis Orozco, as well as videotapes in
other languages, are especially helpful to parents who don't speak
a second language themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Or try creating a picture dictionary with your child in a second
language, using drawings or magazine cutouts to illustrate each
word. You can also take a family trip to another country; immersing
your child in another language is beneficial even for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   School-based immersion programs, in which children spend part or
all of the school day learning in a second language are another
option, albeit harder to find. The goal of immersion programs is to
enable a child to speak a second language fluently in a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura is a foreign language immersion Montessori School
in Oak Park, Ill. Seven classes -- five with children ages 3 to 6
and two with ages 6 to 9 -- bathe students in the sounds of either
Japanese or Spanish. Classes, or ``communities'' as they are called
at the school, consist of about 20 students each. ``If you walked
into our Japanese community, you would see what you see in other
Montessori schools -- kids exploring puzzles and toys, working on
art projects, even learning practical tasks like using a broom or
setting a table,'' says Michael Rosanova, the school's director.
But what you'd hear is very different. For instance, the two
teachers of Japanese, who are native speakers, speak only in
Japanese to their young students. When they write, it is also in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Children can respond in English if I they like, but as time goes
on, they, too, begin to speak only Japanese in the classroom. ``If
a child starts with us at age 3, it might take 8 to 10 months for
her to produce a second language spontaneously,'' says Dr.
Rosanova. ``But that's OK; the important thing is that she's
learning the language. At what point she becomes fluent varies
widely from child to child.''
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura children also teach each other. ``The other day,''
says Rosanova, ``a 5-year-old girl explained in Japanese to a newly
arrived 3-year-old Classmate: ``This water is pouring. It's pouring
from one pitcher to another. Would you like to try it?''' Such
interaction between children is at the heart of Montessori's
immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hieber's 4-year-old son, Liam, has gone to InterCultura
since he was almost 3. ``Why did I choose immersion? I felt it was
the most effective way for him to learn. He learns everything else
so rapidly, why not another language?'' she says. Hieber, who lives
in Chicago, was concerned that if Liam heard English spoken at home
and Japaneseat school, he would get confused. But experience
allayed her fears. ``He moves easily from one language to the
other,'' she says. ``He speaks to me and his father in English
because he knows that's what we speak. In school, where everyone
speaks Japanese, he speaks Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-esteem is one more byproduct of early foreign language
instruction. ``Young children feel good about having this new
competency,'' says Linton. Lynn Fantom, mother of Luisa Sperry, 6,
of New York City, says that her daughter finds it particularly fun
to teach her mother Spanish words she doesn't know. ``She's as
proud as can be that she knows something I don't,'' says Fantom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to show lots of interest and enthusiasm about other
languages in order to encourage their child's learning. ``Attitude
has a lot to do with it,'' notes Marcia Rosenbusch, director of the
foreign language resource center at Iowa State University in Ames.
``If your child says a new word in a second language -- whether he
learned it at school, from you, or from a grandparent -- get
excited, make a fuss,'' Rosenbusch urges. ``It not only encourages
development of a second language but also helps children feel good
about themselves.''

FAT-BLASTERS FOR MIDDLE-AGED METABOLISMS
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIA CALIFANO 
 c.1998 McCall's 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunate but true: Starting around age 25, a woman's
metabolism declines by about 5 percent every decade; by age 55
you're likely to have twice as much body fat as you had when you
were 20.
</P>
<P>
   But read on: ``We now know that getting older doesn't have to go
hand in hand with getting fatter,'' says Labros S. Sidossis, an
associate professor of nutrition and the director of the
obesity-research program at the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston. ``With the right diet and exercise habits a woman can
avoid any significant gains in body fat as she ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the latest tips to keep off the pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to graze.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing (that is, having smaller, more frequent meals) may help
you burn fat more effectively. A recent study of 16 women found
that those over age 60 burned 30 percent less fat after eating a
large meal of 1,000 calories than did women in their 20s; that
means the older diners stored more of the calories as body fat. But
both groups burned fat with equal efficiency after eating a smaller
meal (500 calories) and a 250-calorie snack.
</P>
<P>
   While more research is needed to know why older women store more
fat and at what age this begins, you may want to play it safe. Try
eating three or four lighter meals (around 400 to 500 calories
each) instead of consuming most of your calories in one or two
sittings, recommends study director Susan B. Roberts, an associate
professor of nutrition and psychiatry at the USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk at least four hours a week -- and no less.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the key to staying lean for life, according to a
recent study by the American Cancer Society. Researchers tracked
the eating and exercise habits of more than 44,000 middle-aged
women for 10 years; those who engaged in four or more hours of
walking every week were less likely to put on pounds than were
their sedentary peers, regardless of diet.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't cheat. The study found that walking less than four
hours weekly didn't help the women stay slim. To rack up that much
pavement or treadmill time, go for a 35-minute walk every single
day, or walk for 48 minutes five times a week. (Of course, check
with your doctor before starting any exercise plan.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for high intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that doing aerobics and/or calisthenics for
four or more hours per week reduced a woman's risk of putting on
pounds at the waistline by 72 percent; jogging or running for one
to three hours per week lowered a woman's odds for this by about 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in an experiment at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis, women and men in their 60s who went from
being couch potatoes to doing endurance exercises (like jogging or
cycling) for three hours a week lost up to 1 l/2 inches from their
tummies after nine to 12 months -- without dieting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat lots of veggies.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Cancer Society study, women who consumed at
least 19 servings of vegetables a week were significantly less
likely to gain weight as they got older than those who ate
relatively few or no veggies -- regardless of total calorie intake.
To get 19 servings per week, aim for three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Easy produce boosts: At lunch have a salad, vegetable soup or a
sandwich stuffed with sprouts, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. Sip
tomato or vegetable juice in the afternoon. At dinner add grated,
shredded or chopped vegetables (like zucchini, spinach and carrots)
to pasta sauce, meat loaf, rice or mashed potatoes. Keep a bowl of
baby carrots, celery and red-pepper slices in the fridge for a
handy snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muscle your way up to a faster metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   A pound of muscle burns about 35 calories a day, while fat uses
a measly two. But starting in their mid-20s, men and women lose
about a half pound of muscle every year, says Wayne Westcott,
fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it's not hard to recoup your losses at any age with
strength training. For instance, when researchers at Tufts
University put 12 men and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s on a
three-times-weekly strength-building program, in just three months
the subjects gained enough muscle to burn an extra 109 calories a
day; over the course of a year, that adds up to 11 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   To get these benefits, do 25 minutes of toning exercises for the
upper and lower body (by using free weights, flexible bands or
resistance machines or by doing calisthenics) two to three times a
week. Again, check with your doctor first; then call your local
YMCA or pick up a good instruction book -- like ``Strong Women Stay
Slim, by Miriam E. Nelson (Bantam, 1998) -- to find out how to get
started.

<P>
   SNEAKY WAYS TO SLASH 100 CALORIES
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight really does get harder as you get older; after age
25 your metabolism burns up to 100 fewer calories a day with each
passing decade. Luckily, it's easy to make up the deficit, notes
Leslie Bonci, assistant director of nutrition at the Center for
Digestive Health at Pittsburgh's Allegheny General Hospital. These
small steps will help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half cup (or a half fist) less pasta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Order coleslaw made with vinaigrette instead of choosing
potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute 4 ounces of juice combined with 6 ounces of seltzer
for a 10-ounce bottle of fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enjoy a slice of angel-food cake as an alternative to a glazed
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have half a large bagel rather than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put only one slice of bacon on your BLT, not three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half scoop of ice cream with a half scoop of sorbet,
cutting back from a full scoop of high calorie ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for a 3-ounce scoop of tuna salad on your sandwich in lieu
of the usual 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dip chips into salsa rather than guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for a wine spritzer (half wine and half seltzer) in place
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a small, not medium, order of french fries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Splurge on filet mignon as opposed to a T-bone steak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Munch a handful of pretzel nuggets instead of a handful of
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opt for hot-air-popped popcorn; steer clear of microwaved
buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have one less tablespoon of butter or margarine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for mustard instead of mayo on your sandwich.

  Includes three color photos of dancers Suzie Hardt and Phil Jensen
at the Sapphire Ballroom in San Francisco. They are avaialble via
e-mail in JPEG format. Call Joe Applegate at 212-499-3342.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzie Hardt rushes into San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, all
adrenaline, anticipation and loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   She has slathered sunless tanning lotion on her legs, twisted
her black hair into a bun, swapped her glasses for contact lenses
and waged a 35-minute battle to glue false lashes over her brown
eyes. Any other day this no-fuss anthropology graduate wouldn't
even bother with mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after maneuvering her Toyota through a rush-hour
bottleneck, she's left with only minutes to complete her Cinderella
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing on a sequined gown and making hurried fixes in the
mirror of the ladies' changing room, Hardt breathlessly shoots down
the hall, onto the ballroom floor and into the arms of partner Phil
Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Baroque ballroom is decked out like a wedding reception.
Tiny cocktail tables dressed up with red and white centerpieces,
mixed drinks served up at a wet bar. Electric blue icicles shimmer
down a wall and couples, immaculately moussed, manicured, coiffed
and outfitted like Barbie and Ken at the prom, mill around in a
filmy swirl of rhinestones, tails and chiffon, nervously waiting
for their numbers to be called.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the glamor and sometimes garish glitz, the Sapphire
Ball, one of many ballroom dance championships held around the
country, is serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the room, vendors peddle the required gear:
$3,000 gowns, $100 pairs of shoes, hairpieces, falsies, even
on-the-spot massages.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as basketball with feathers, baseball with a
cummerbund, track in heels. When Jensen and Hardt take to the floor
it's with the focus and drive of athletes. They dance not for
romance, but to win.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is not a singular obsession. According to the
International Dancesport Federation, some 1.5 million couples
around the world, from Australia to Germany, from Canada to Japan,
are redefining social dancing into the new ``sport'' of competitive
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt is a 27-year-old office worker with a boyfriend; Jensen's
a single, 23-year-old engineer for Hewlett-Packard. Off the floor
they are almost social strangers, but Phil and Suzie need each
other. They both have it bad for ballroom. And in ballroom, you
can't do it alone. Finding the right partner, many dancers joke,
can be harder than finding a mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both over 6 feet tall, we're both under 40 years old and
we're both obsessive dancers,'' Hardt says of their strictly
ballroom alliance, forged, so to speak, across a crowded room at a
dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   Those caught up in the sequined magic maintain that it's a
high-aerobic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do one round of a professional dance competition, five
dances of a minute and a half, is like running at full speed for 10
minutes. You have to be in really good shape to do this. If you're
good at it and putting effort into it, you're sweaty,'' says
Christine Rinne-Flores, who co-owns Stars Ballroom in Novato,
Calif., a place where competitive dancers converge for private and
group lessons, weekly parties and special events that are part of
the colorful ballroom community.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the International Olympic Committee
recognized the federation as the official governing body overseeing
the fledgling sport, a first milestone on the road to the Olympics.
Boosters have hired a high-powered agency to promote the image and
increase the profile of competitive dancing, a fusion of spectacle
and sport seen to outsiders mainly through the quirky, half-mocking
lens of movies like Australia's ``Strictly Ballroom,'' Japan's
``Shall We Dance'' and last summer's ``Dance With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of lobbying, negotiating and politicking, both with
Olympic officials and within their own ranks, remain ahead. Key,
some observers say, is getting major TV exposure of ballroom.
That's already happening in countries like Germany, where
dancesport can be front page news.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the main TV exposure has been on PBS,
which airs the annual Ohio Star Ball the weekend before
Thanksgiving. But ballroom got a major network break recently when
NBC broadcast the International Dancesport Championships, with
Broadway diva Debbie Allen as hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance sport now. It's totally international, all over
the world. It's in Taiwan, in Japan, Norway, Denmark, England,''
says Rhona Pick, whose Pick School in San Francisco has been
training dancers since 1963. She believes ballroom will easily
cross the Olympic hurdle because of its worldwide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as exciting, definitely, as ice dancing, if not more,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest dancers could ever expect to go for the gold
however, is 2008, and to make even that deadline, the Federation
will have to convince Olympic officials by 2003 to accept ballroom
onto the program.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much locks even young, hungry dancers like Jensen
and Hardt out of an Olympic dream. But even without the big,
14-karat gold carrot to shoot for, the ballroom dance scene thrives
within its own intricate, arcane web of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just happiest when I'm dancing. When I look back
in my life, all my happiest moments have been spent dancing,'' says
Hardt, struggling to explain the compulsion to dance six days a
week, sweating through some 12 hours of practice and lessons, both
group and private.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt pares her living costs down to the barest essentials,
sharing a house with five roommates. ``I basically don't spent
money on anything except for dancing,'' she admits. ``I don't have
any payments on my car and my rent is pretty cheap. I never buy new
clothes. I just go to yard sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many novices, her two ball gowns are hand-me-downs, one a
black-and-white formal that set its first owner back $1,700. She
similarly lucked into her dance shoes when a shoe store, going out
of business, donated its remaining stock to Rice University, where
Hardt competed on the ballroom team. The 2-1/2-inch-heeled slippers
are a little loose, and Hardt, hours before the Sapphire Ball,
found herself gluing on elastic straps. Having shoes fly off during
a fox trot is one of the hazards of competition, along with the
occasional collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not going to be too tacky,'' she giggled. ``But I
haven't got any other shoes for competition. They're really
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sports, which can be measured by tangibles like
speed or distance, ballroom is highly subjective. Judges have only
a minute and a half to size up a floor full of couples, all in
motion, for form, technique and some inexplicable charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge is paid to give their first impression. We're not here
to study them. Sometimes it's just the way they walk on the floor,
and make you look at them, or look at them longer,'' says Enrique
Ramon from Houston, Texas, one of the network of professional
judges who ride the circuit. Ramon says in the '60s, when he was
first competing, there were only three to four major competitions
in the United States. Now there are that many in any given weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to get better, to best themselves, to out-dance
everyone on the floor can become consuming. Hardt vows to enter
every competition she can and someday take it all the way, which in
the world of ballroom is the ultimate championships in Blackpool,
England.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sapphire, she and Jensen make it to the finals in both
categories of competition they enter, and waltz away with a
second-place trophy in the pre-novice division, edging out seven
other couples, and place a respectable fourth in the higher novice
division. But they're more disappointed than elated about what
looks, to an observer, like a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dance my best,'' Hardt says, looking stricken when
she comes off the floor, fighting tears behind the forest of
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, whose mother and brother and sister have come to watch,
is only a little less defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have danced better,'' he adds. ``I got off on my
timing but then we did fairly decent in the rest of it. But we
don't know that many dance steps and it was a little ahead of our
level. We do have a ways to go.''

THE PURRRFECT LINE OF FURNITURE FOR FURRY FRIENDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Almost any cat owner will tell you that their
tabby is used to being pampered and is accustomed to the finer
things in life _ from gourmet cat food to a soft place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't allow kitty in bed with you, don't fret. You
can go furniture shopping instead. A trip to most pet stores will
put you in touch with a fun line of bedding for your feline.
</P>
<P>
   There are kitty hammocks starting at around $20. The hammocks
feature a padded plush washable pad that is connected to a metal
form. The suspended bed never gets lumpy or disheveled and the
slight movement is supposed to lull kitty to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   There also are soft sculptures for cats to sleep in, such as a
colorful stuffed fish for $29.99. The bed entrance is through the
large opening of the fish's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Doskocil Manufacturing of Arlington, Texas, makes a
line of Kat Furniture from Petmate of neutral-colored durable
plastic pieces with plush bedding, designed for various rooms of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the TV bed for $54.99 for the family room, or the sock
drawer bed and armchair bed in the bedroom. The $69.99 armchair
also could fit in the living room or the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to worry if kitty exercises its claws on this
line of furniture; the chair and sock drawer come with large sisal
scratch surfaces. In addition, replaceable interactive toys (some
filled with catnip) are built into each piece.
</P>
<P>
   The company is making a set of bunk beds to add to its line of
Kat Furniture, which won the top three awards for best new cat
product of 1998 at the recent American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association trade show in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Some assembly with a screwdriver is necessary for Kat Furniture,
which can be found at some pet supply stores.

I GOT THAT OL' MS. PAC-MAN FEVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One of my first jobs out of college was editing a
weekly newspaper in California's ``Silicon Valley.'' It was fun
putting out the ``Cupertino Courier,'' but I was a little too
efficient and found myself with lots of free time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I never told the boss! Instead, I'd join a couple
other guys who edited other weekly newspapers owned by the same
newspaper chain and we'd all sneak across the parking lot to a
nearby convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal: The Ms. Pac-Man machine!
</P>
<P>
   I hate to admit this _ especially in print _ but we used to
spend about an hour a day pumping quarters into that stupid
machine, which stood in the store's front window and exposed us to
numerous odd looks from productive members of society.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't care. We were Ms. Pac-Man addicts. We lived for the
chance to guide Ms. Pac-Man through her maze, gobbling dots and the
four monsters. My friend, Steve, actually developed a sore wrist
from using the joystick too much.
</P>
<P>
   I know. It all sounds very pathetic. But it was fun. And we were
young and crazy.
</P>
<P>
   So what's my excuse now?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Twenty years later, I find myself playing Ms. Pac-Man
again. This time it's on my home computer using Microsoft's Revenge
of Arcade. The $25 CD-ROM package comes with Ms. Pac-Man and other
ancient arcade games such as Rally-X and Mappy.
</P>
<P>
   I've had it for a few weeks now, and signs of my old addiction
are reappearing. Sometimes I sneak in to our spare room to play a
quick game. And I've even created a desktop shortcut so I can
launch Ms. Pac-Man without delay!
</P>
<P>
   There's something about those old arcade games that I can't
explain. Some of them never interested me. But some of them, not
just Ms. Pac-Man, are fun enough that I'd rather play one of them
instead of a new 3D adventure game.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well. I consider myself lucky _ not because I can now play
Ms. Pac-Man without needing quarters, but because my wife has yet
to voice an observation I know she's made: Playing Ms. Pac-Man is
one heck of a sorry way to use a Pentium II computer! &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Macintosh news to use &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the recent Macworld Expo/San Francisco '99 trade show,
Apple unveiled a number of new computer models, including Power Mac
G3s and iMacs that come in assorted colors, not just the original
translucent blue.
</P>
<P>
   PC-makers have taken notice of the iMac's popularity, which has
been credited with turning Apple back to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (For a more detailed look at the new iMacs, check out Gene
Steinberg's column on Arizona Central at
www.azcentral.com/computing/news/mac/steinberg.shtml.)
</P>
<P>
   A prediction for 1999: By year's end, look for PC-makers to
offer PC versions of the iMac _ colorful and sculpted
IBM-compatible machines that will make the old beige boxes look,
well, like old beige boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of iMacs, Apple Computer has finally eased up on its
pricing. For several months, no matter where you looked to buy, an
iMac was going to cost you $1,299. Period. Now, retailers are free
to price according to demand. Initially, the cost of the all-in-one
machine dropped to about $999. But the last time I checked, some
online retailers were offering iMacs for $979.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MP3 to the rescue! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I discussed the popular MP3 format for music
files. The technology has taken over music sites all over the Web,
offering computer users the ability to download near CD-quality
music in just minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've heard from several readers who have had trouble
downloading the necessary software to play MP3 files. Apparently,
many download sites have been too busy to handle all the download
requests.
</P>
<P>
   The download problem seems to have affected Macintosh users a
bit more severely, perhaps because Mac users tend to be more active
online than PC users. So, if you're a Mac user looking for a copy
of the MP3 player MacAmp, check out www.macamp.com. If that site is
busy, check a mirror site at
ftp://mirror.doit.wisc.edu/mirrors/apple/macamp/.
</P>
<P>
   If you love MP3 but want to play the files with something other
than WinAmp or Mac-Amp, a reader named Ron suggests you try
Sonique, an MP3 player for your PC made by Night55 Inc. You can try
Sonique at www.sonique.com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sources tell me that the Diamond Rio, a Walkman-like
player that can hold up to 60 minutes of MP3 music files, will in
the future be able to play music files in other formats as well.
Some readers were wondering about that, as they've discovered that
MP3 isn't the only data-compression format being used on music
files.
</P>
<P>
   And did I say MP3 would be big? That prediction is holding true,
at least for now. An IDG.net reporter covering the recent Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas reported that MP3 was on everybody's
mind. Samsung Electronics, for example, announced it will roll out
its own MP3 devices under the name Yepp. The devices don't have the
memory of Diamond's Rio, but are smaller, about the size of a
credit card. It seems as though the MP3 cat is out of the bag,
regardless of how strongly the recording industry opposes it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Don't worry. Be happy! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, here we are in the final year before the dreaded Y2K bug
attacks. As you know, it's supposed to hit at midnight Jan. 1. What
say we all spend the night sitting in a cornfield somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, OK. Dumb idea. While we're thinking of what else to do, here
is some of the latest Y2K news:
</P>
<P>
   - From the I-Guess-This-Was-Bound-To-Happen Department:
``Wired'' magazine recently reported that Y2K blacklists are
starting to crop up. Yep. Companies that have solved their Y2K
problems don't want to mess with businesses that haven't solved
their Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired'' reported that banks have started assigning customers
with low-, medium- or high-risk ratings. Even Federal Express has
gotten into the act, branding primary business partners with the
colors green, yellow or red depending on how much work they've done
toward solving their Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired'' pointed out that some federal guidelines actually
require such ``leper lists'' be created as part of ``appropriate
risk control.''
</P>
<P>
   - Don't let the federal government's involvement in the ``leper
lists'' fool you. Uncle Sam is as far behind in solving its Y2K
problems as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a reassuring quote from Joel Willemssen of the General
Accounting Office:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the government agencies will not be done on time,'' he
recently told CNN. ``There will be some failures. Right now as a
country we do not know where we stand on water, power and
telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog! That cornfield is starting to sound better and better!
</P>
<P>
   - And if Y2K isn't enough for you to worry about, the ``New York
Times'' reports that there's a time-related glitch that will rear
its ugly head in certain Windows applications April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bug, which Microsoft has owned up to, will cause programs to
behave as if it was an hour earlier than the correct time shown by
internal Windows 95, 98 and NT clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the bug is supposed to correct itself a
week later on April 8, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   So, start planning now. You'll be able to wander in to work an
hour late for an entire week in 2001. If the boss complains, you
can blame your home PC! &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vast right-wing conspiracies ain't what they
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   When we of Bill Clinton's generation were kids, we watched
military-takeover movies like ``Seven Days in May'' and later
became very paranoid about who was shooting the nation's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   We never thought we'd live to see right-wingers try to overthrow
a president by boring the population into submission.
</P>
<P>
   How many of you listened to all of the Republican ``impeachment
trial managers'' cite the same evidence against President Clinton
over and over again?
</P>
<P>
   How many of you were electrified by the constantly repeated
high-flown verbiage about Clinton's low acts and misdemeanors,
words like ``perjurious,'' ``egregious'' and ``web of deceit''?
</P>
<P>
   How many of you snapped your fingers and said, ``I get it now.
He's a liar. It isn't about sex. It's about perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but approximately zero Americans stayed tuned through the
dullest attempted coup in history. Exactly zero changed their minds
about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, boring the populace into passivity isn't just a
Republican tactic, although they seem to have perfected it.
</P>
<P>
   Inflicting boredom is how both parties keep the citizenry out of
politics, leaving democracy in the hands of reliable fanatics,
advertising geniuses and rich special interests.
</P>
<P>
   At newspapers, where some of us feel obliged to witness history
even at its most tedious, we stayed awake by having contests based
on the trial managers.
</P>
<P>
   Worst comb-over: Steve Chabot. The immobile camera was a
comb-over cam, installed at a very unflattering but appropriate
angle _ looking down on the trial managers.
</P>
<P>
   Worst folksy opening: Bill McCollum's golly-geeing about his awe
at God and nature when he saw the snow and geese outside the
Capitol. Apparently, the geese were attracted by all the honking
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Best mispronunciation: McCollum pronouncing ``genitalia'' as
``genitillia.'' He was talking about something all too famillia.
</P>
<P>
   Best saying: Ed Bryant's comment, ``In Tennessee, we have a
saying for situations like that. It's `That dog won't hunt.''' We
have a saying in California: ``Totally bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   Best title for a chart: ``The Seven Pillars of Obstruction'' _
just like T.E. Lawrence's book ``The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,'' but
without the wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Worst disease metaphor: Bob Barr's call to excise ``insidious
cancers that eat at the heart of our system of justice so they
might not fester as a gaping wound, poisoning our system of justice
and future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Off with his head and the pointy white hat he probably wears on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic moment. Hell, only dramatic moment: Sen. Tom
Harkin stood up just before Barr could end Friday's presentations
and, in words that actually said something, objected to the trial
managers referring to senators as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   I fell out of my chair. The senators apparently all woke up or
dropped their hidden Agatha Christie novels.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin listed the ways in which senators are different from
jurors, left Barr with nothing better than his mixed disease
metaphor, and captured the evening news for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with trying to bore the populace into submission is
that one interesting interruption blows the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't really blow the whole thing. It just
temporarily took the windiness out of the prosecution's sails. Who
cares if senators are called jurors? Is it yet another exercise in
applied semantics by a Democrat? Well, yes. But it also was a
living demonstration that impeachment really is political, as
Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   It also was an assertion by a senator that no upstarts from the
House could call him a mere juror. Chief Justice William Rehnquist
of the Supreme Court sustained Harkin's objection, and suddenly
Rehnquist was no longer a dignified prop in the Republicans'
droning production.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin made a carefully calculated guerrilla attack on the House
Republicans' slow-moving impeachment train, perhaps even risking
imprisonment, and suddenly we were in a world of spin _ not that
many Americans were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame you. I feel like I've been trampled by stampeding
mice. Do the Republicans really think they can destroy Clinton with
their constant squeaks of ``perjurious'' and ``genitillia''?
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing was just to convince the Senate to call
witnesses, specifically the two most familiar with the genitillia
in question.
</P>
<P>
   If the case against Clinton is so open-and-shut, as the
impeachment managers kept saying, why do they need witnesses? They
just want to drag Monica and Bill into the Senate and titillate the
nation into understanding how awful the president is.
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans should find some dirty sites on the Internet
and leave the rest of us alone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, fair's fair. Now the Democrats will have their chance
to bore the nation into passive pulp, and I have full faith they're
up to the job.

NEW BALANCE: SURPRISINGLY, IT'S A LA MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Alysson Saada has a black pair, a red pair, and a gray
pair, effectively covering her footware needs. No surprise in this
fashion-setting metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   But the real shock is this: Her shoe of choice is an
original-style New Balance sneaker, known around Boston, where the
company is based, as a more pedestrian, comfort-oriented selection,
prescribed by podiatrists and worshiped by marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are very popular,'' said Saada, a Parisian teenager
who teethed on glossy sartorial publications.
</P>
<P>
   The retro-looking sneakers, however, are not just a youth fad.
</P>
<P>
   At Les Galleries Lafayette, an ornate, designer-clothing
department store here, men's New Balance in camel-colored suede are
on display in the Trends section, along with space-age luggage,
rubber vases, fold-up motor scooters, and other sharp design ideas.
The price: 650 francs. That's more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   In a minimalist but casual restaurant, a New Balance stick out
from under a waitress's long white apron. A man on a cell phone
outside the Hugo Boss shop dons a pair to match his black pinstripe
pants.
</P>
<P>
   And window displays across the city show the sneakers next to
cashmere sweaters and stylish slacks.
</P>
<P>
   New Balance executives trace the fad to the spring of 1997, when
designer Lucien Pellat-Finet used the funky-colored sneakers in his
runway fashion show here. He chose the company's oldest
``heritage'' styles, known as numbers 576 and 572, which have not
changed much since they were first rolled out, except for the new
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a performance-oriented company, rather than
fashion-oriented,'' said Ariane Kjellquist, a New Balance
spokeswoman. ``We were just trying to do something a little
different with it. We weren't changing the components. The fashion
market decided it was fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   A rainbow line was introduced in Europe so as not to interfere
with the company's deftly cultivated image in the United States as
a serious running shoe. But New York retailers picked up on the
trend and began illegally importing the shoes, selling them for
$150.
</P>
<P>
   So New Balance coalesced and introduced the line back home
beginning in August in four colors: orange, sky blue, lime green,
and red. In October, another shipment came to America in teal,
wheat field (mustard), and deep purple. They cost about $110 here,
mostly sold in upscale department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Tommy Hilfiger and even the august fashion house Hermes
are knocking off the look _ Hermes in gold lame.
</P>
<P>
   Sneakers have been part of street fashion for years, especially
in the 1990s, and especially dominated by Nike Inc. That company,
based in Beaverton, Ore., is in turmoil because of an economic
slowdown in Asia, sluggish sales in the United States, and a poor
performance in Europe, according to financial analysts who follow
the footware giant.
</P>
<P>
   One can see the shift toward a ``fresher'' footwear look on the
streets of Paris, even if they are the same old sneakers New
Balance has been making since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Saada, in her gray New Balance, and her friend Fiona Alliel, in
a black pair constructed of nylon and suede, strutted comfortably
on a recent day not far from the upscale Place Vendome. They left
their dusty Nikes in the back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one pair of Nikes,'' Alliel said. ``But these are
more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Saada, looking down at her feet: ``It's fashion a la mode,
of the moment. Nike is passe. Voila!''

WHAT'S UP WITH THE MOON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The moon has been up to some unusual behavior recently,
prompting question from several readers, including J.B in Groton,
Mass., and C.C., who didn't provide a hometown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two full moons this month and again in March on the
same dates (the 2d and the 31st), but no full moon at all in
February. That last happened in 1915, and it won't happen again
until 2018.
</P>
<P>
   February last lacked a full moon in 1961; it won't again until
2018.
</P>
<P>
   December's full moon fell on the first day of winter; that last
occurred in 1980, and it will happen again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The moon takes an average of 29 1/2 days to orbit the Earth. But
the lengths of our months _ 28 to 31 days _ don't precisely match
the moon's cycle. So each phase of the moon occurs 12.3683 times
per year. That's why over the years oddities like this one occur.
</P>
<P>
   The instant the moon passes the sun it's known as the
astronomical new moon. If the moon passes directly in front of the
sun it causes a solar eclipse, but usually it passes just above or
below and rises and sets almost at the same time, abandoning the
night sky
</P>
<P>
   A week later, we see half a moon, what astronomers call the
first quarter moon. One week later, with the sun and moon on
opposite sides of Earth, the whole moon is glowing and is view most
of the night. That's the full moon. The last quarter moon occurs a
week later. The tiny crescent moon phase occurs a day or two on
each side of the new moon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is our atmosphere so different from that of Venus, which
is 90 times thicker than ours?
</P>
<P>
   D.T., Rockport (Mass.) High School
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In one way, carbon dioxide-breathing plants would be very
happy on Venus. The atmosphere there is 96 percent CO2. Compare
that with our atmosphere, which is a third of 1 percent CO2.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all that carbon dioxide creates other conditions on
Venus, the second planet from the sun, that plants would not be
happy about. Like a surface temperature of 860 degrees Fahrenheit,
caused by the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide; it traps solar
radiation before it can bounce off the planet's surface and back
out into space. In fact, though Venus is twice as far from the sun
as Mercury, it's surface is much hotter. Don't put lead in a
spaceship to Venus. It would melt!
</P>
<P>
   The different composition of the Venusian atmosphere creates a
surface pressure 90 times greater than sea level air pressure on
Earth. Standing on the surface there would be equivalent to being
about 3,000 feet down in the ocean here.
</P>
<P>
   Earth and Venus are made of the same basic minerals, they're
close in size and mass, and are thought to have similar seismic,
volcanic and tectonic activity. The reason the atmosheres are so
different is, in a word, life. On Earth, biological processes
gobble up carbon dioxide as it erodes out of minerals and enters
the atmosphere. The ocean's plants are a huge `sink' for CO2, for
example. So are terrestrial flora. But on Venus, when CO2 goes up,
it stays up.

IRELAND CHANGING _ FOR BETTER OR BITTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ What does it say about Ireland when they'll bulldoze a
house James Joyce lived in and yet spend $5 million on a
contemporary artwork that no one seems to like?
</P>
<P>
   It says, in short, that Ireland has changed and, as Yeats once
put it, changed utterly.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's booming economy has wrought some wonderful things,
none better than that most young Irish people are no longer forced
to leave their homeland to make a living. And in a country where 45
percent of the population is under 25, and which has scattered
generations across the world since the potato blight of 1845, that
is no small change.
</P>
<P>
   But prosperity has some unwelcome byproducts as well: more
crime, traffic gridlock, a growing gap between rich and poor, and
spiraling housing prices that make it nearly impossible for
first-time buyers to find a home within an hour's drive of Dublin,
where a third of the country's 3.6 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps the most profound effect this new prosperity has had
on Irish society is the consensus that anything new is inherently
better than anything old, that something big and bold is
intrinsically preferable to something smaller or subdued. That
mentality led to Joyce's onetime home on Millbourne Avenue _ the
one in ``Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man'' _ being torn down
against only the isolated howls of Joycean scholars. And it is the
same mentality that proposes putting up a 300-foot stainless-steel
pole at the end of O'Connell Street to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Irish have been poor but comforted by
knowing they were among the most literate people on the planet. Now
prosperity seems to be steamrolling over things the Irish once held
sacred, such as literary heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Recent European Union studies found that the Irish are spending
the bulk of their new disposable income on gourmet food and
alcohol, as fine wine makes inroads against the durable Irish
favorite, the dark and mysterious stout, usually Guinness. Another
study found that many of the trendy Dublin restaurants have noise
levels that could damage the hearing of those working in them.
</P>
<P>
   But while some, such as the Dublin writer Hugo Hamilton,
complain that prosperity is turning Ireland into a bland,
homogenous place where art is being squeezed out by the cult of
celebrity, others say Ireland is undergoing an artistic renaissance
not seen since the turn of the century, when Yeats, O'Casey, Wilde,
Shaw, Synge, and others helped define what it was to be Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel Fitzsimons, the London-based Irishwoman who just won the
prestigious Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award, says the economic boom
is being matched by a cultural boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, it is cool to be Irish,'' Fitzsimons says. ``We are
no longer the barmen and waitresses of the world. It's culture, not
boozing, that is flourishing again in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Helena Kennedy, who recently became the first woman to head the
British Council, Britain's biggest cultural organization, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nations going through periods of dramatic change often have a
surge of creativity,'' says Kennedy, a Scot whose grandmother was
Irish. Kennedy believes the Irish are at the height of their
cultural influence internationally, from U2, the singing group, to
Seamus Heaney, the Nobel poet, to Martin McDonagh, the young
playwright whose ``Beauty Queen of Lenane'' won four Tony awards on
Broadway last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland lets its artists live tax-free, and it is one of the few
nations that puts its writers on its currency. But even that will
end in three years as the euro replaces the Irish pound, a telling
development because Irish culture is increasingly becoming a hybrid
of ancient Celtic and modern European influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riverdance,'' the phenomenally successful dance show, was
actually the outgrowth of a segment staged for the Eurovision song
contest, part of the EU's attempt to promote the notion that there
is something approaching a common European culture. ``Riverdance''
has exposed Irish dance to millions who would otherwise never have
seen it. But is it truly a modern version of traditional Irish
stepdancing? Or is it, and its progeny, ``Lord of the Dance,'' just
a sexualized version of Irish dance that uses great athleticism and
skimpy outfits to market something deemed unwatchable by someone
not Irish?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Corrs authentically mixing traditional music with their
catchy pop tunes, or is it, as some critics claim, a faux,
patronizing Irishness?
</P>
<P>
   There are some who believe the critics take themselves too
seriously. Geoffrey Keating, the Irish government's cultural
attache in London, believes Irish culture has never been more
accessible nor a more accurate reflection of a people who claim a
diaspora of 70 million around the world, including 40 million
Irish-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Irish used to be this narrow test that was
exclusionary,'' Keating says. ``Now it's inclusive, it reflects the
diversity of what it means to be Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Change is everywhere in Ireland. Galway is the fastest-growing
city in Europe, its narrow streets clogged with young people and
hip shops. The rural countryside, its haunting beauty an
inspiration to generations of writers and visual artists, is
increasingly becoming dotted with vacation homes, some of them used
only a few days or few weeks of the year. In the past, most homes
in the lush fields of West Cork or the moonlike landscape of
Connemara belonged to rich foreigners. Now, the countryside is
being spoiled by noveau riche natives, many of whom have built
large, ostentatious second homes for the generous tax break
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the change in the countryside, nowhere is the change
more pronounced than in Dublin. Bewley's Oriental Cafe, a fixture
on Grafton Street, the city's main shopping area, recently had a
face lift that some traditionalists abhor, lamenting that a Dublin
institution has been transformed into something resembling one of
the ubiquitous new cosmopolitan cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional pub, so central to Dublin's character, is
gradually being replaced by European-style cafes with sleek lines,
plateglass windows and, despite only infrequent sunshine, alfresco
seating. The European ethos of these places is just the opposite of
the traditional pub, which values privacy, its snugs offering a
quiet, secluded corner to nurse a pint and peruse a newspaper. In
the new cafes, the object is to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Bailey, a Duke Street pub where Anthony Cronin famously
described the last pints imbibed by Brendan Behan before the writer
drank himself to death, has been gutted and turned into something
unrecognizable to someone who remembers its narrow hallways and
dark corners. Gone are the nooks and crannies where Cronin recalled
that final meeting in his classic memoir of the mid-20th-century
Dublin literary renaissance, ``Dead As Doornails.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that, as for Cronin, places like The Bailey hold too
many bad memories to be thought of fondly. And so they, like
Joyce's house, get torn down or rehabilitated beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Modern, chic hotels have opened all over Dublin, from The
Clarence, owned by U2 and the only place where rock stars deign to
stay, to The Merrion, where rooms go for more than $400 a night, a
price that only a few years ago would have been laughed at. These
days, it's hard to get a room at either hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all their sophistication and minimalist design,
none of these new boutique hotels has the charm, or the feel, of
Dublin about them, of the old Shelbourne on St. Stephen's Green.
</P>
<P>
   Not that young people, who, after all, make up about half the
population and whose pocketbooks are fueling all this change, seem
overly concerned about any of this. They see themselves as
Europeans as much as Irish. If Dublin is starting to look like any
other continental capital, with more cafes than pubs, who cares? If
Irish-owned businesses are being bought out by British
conglomerates, who not only are making the shopping areas of
Ireland's capital look like any other mid-sized provincial English
city but also are taking the profits out of the country, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The attitudes producing this remarkable change in Ireland are
either evidence of extraordinary confidence in or breathtaking
disregard for one's identity. As with anything in Ireland, you can
find articulate, passionate arguments for either conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish theater, meanwhile, seems to be getting the mix a bit
better than the dizzying proliferation of bars, restaurants, and
hotels. The Abbey, the national theater, and especially the smaller
Peacock, downstairs from the Abbey, will stage young Irish writers
as often as they will dust off the masters. The Druid in Galway is
among the most dynamic companies in the world. Its productions of
McDonagh's plays, including ``Beauty Queen of Lenane,'' have set
the standard for Irish drama that can still draw on universal
themes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Dubliners of all generations and political
persuasions seem to agree on, however, is the proposed millennium
pole: They are not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Dubs have a quirky sense of humor; the 300-foot spike planned
for the end of the city's main promenade is already known here as
``The Pin in the Bin'' and ``The Spire in the Mire.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeats had it right. Ireland has changed, changed utterly. But it
has taken nearly a century for his observation about violent
nationalism to be applied to the national culture. It is both
wonderful and awful.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible beauty, indeed.

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN HACK IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telecommuting seems like a great gig, often touted as the
biggest advance for employees since the 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   Working at home, one avoids the grind of rush-hour traffic, not
to mention the distractions of the office. Want to skip your
shower? Wear sweatpants instead of a suit? Go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 9 million Americans telecommute _ or telework, as
it is sometimes called. Their number, while hard to pin down
precisely, is increasing by more than 10 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   But also growing is evidence that working from home is not as
liberating as one might think, and that the flexibility it offers
does not, in the end, do much to empower the worker. And it has
other, less tangible drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Richard Sennett points to the writings of
18th-century French philosopher Denis Diderot to argue that routine
_ the kind found in the human interaction and daily rituals of the
workplace _ helps builds character and long-term commitments. At
the end of the 20th century, not only is job stability
disappearing, but so too may be the office as a valuable touchstone
in our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Sennett says, those who telecommute can end up facing
greater surveillance at home than they do at work.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting ``arouses great anxiety among employers, who fear
losing control over their absent workers and suspect that those who
stay at home will abuse their freedom,'' Sennett writes in
``Corrosion of Character,'' his new book. ``As a result, a host of
controls have come into being to regulate the actual work processes
of those who are absent from the office. People may be required to
phone in to the office regularly, or intranet controls may be used
to monitor the absent worker; e-mail is often opened by
supervisors.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are more obvious pressures for many telecommuters, say
sociologists and those who work at home.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, telecommuting means that you are never truly off
the job. When Julie Schneider, who works for Check Point Software
from her Raleigh, N.C., home, hears the phone ring in her office,
she feels compelled to answer it _ even after hours. It's a problem
shared by telecommuters everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   With organizational loyalty low and the risk of being downsized
high, many workers feel increased pressure to produce, produce,
produce, and that is especially true of telecommuters, says
Christene Nippert-Eng, an Illinois Institute of Technology
sociologist who is finishing a book, ``Transition to
Telecommuting.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to produce more is a common trap for telecommuters,
says Roberta Fox, a management consultant with Deloitte and Touche.
At first, Fox says, home-based workers are excited and feel
liberated. They enjoy not having to face traffic, and the novelty
of working at home. With fewer distractions, they get more work
done.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of accomplishment, however, gives way to the
teleworkaholic syndrome, Fox says. Because they are producing more,
and may view telecommuting as a perk, they feel they have to always
do more work in order to justify their situation. That leads to
burnout and resentment. ``Some people really get quite extreme, and
you have to say `These are your hours of work. Do not exceed them,'
'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, working at home can be isolating in
the extreme. Workers discover that contact with the FedEx delivery
person and the mailman is not enough, and often reevaluate why they
want to telecommute. For them to succeed, they need to reach out to
the company, go into the office, have lunch with bosses and
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, in an effort to save on overhead, may
not have room for telecommuters to return, says Nippert-Eng. Or if
they do, it is in a very impersonal way that sends a clear message
to the worker that their work, or their position, is not highly
valued by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a phenomenon called `hot desking' or `hoteling,'
where there are generic desks that can be used for the day, but you
can't stick up a photograph or write on the blotter,'' Nippert-Eng
says.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, telecommuting arrangements are for a set amount of
time. For example, a parent may work at home so that his or her
teenager is not a latchkey child for the last two years before
heading off to college. Or the telecommuting may involve one
specific project, and when it is complete, the worker returns to
the office on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Nippert-Eng says that her research indicates a large number
of telecommuting efforts end prematurely. As recently as 1995, the
rate of failures was about 50 percent; now, with more planning
taking place before telecommuting begins, her research indicates
only about 20 percent fail.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for ending a telecommuting arrangement early are
varied. It could be that workers do not get the support they need
from employers, or from the family, or do not have the discipline
and self-motivation they need to work alone. Even though it may
look like home, it can be like working in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting, says Nippert-Eng, also raises troubling questions
about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work at a humane company and are terminated, they will
probably have a security guard escort you to your desk, let you
collect your belongings, and escort you out of the building. If
they are not humane, they may just mail it to you within a few
weeks,'' she says. But what happens if you are telecommuting and
the company wants its information and equipment out of your house?
``Do they put a yellow police `Do not cross' ribbon around your
house?'' Nippert-Eng wonders. ``Do they have the right to go
through everything in your hard drive?''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, however, increasingly allow _ or even encourage
_ telecommuting because it saves them money. Not only is the office
overhead lower, telecommuting attracts high-quality, valued workers
who might otherwise choose to go to another company. And it can
boost efficiency, if done right. After all, says Nippert-Eng, ``the
office is a terrible place to do office work; it is full of
distractions and interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some studies that show productivity rises if
telecommuting is done for one or two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the management consultant, says that telecommuting's
negative aspects are worst if it's done full time. She has examined
the productivity of workers in several companies who have
telecommuted and found that external workers (people in sales and
consulting) had huge productivity increases in day one and day two,
and by day three, their productivity was still above what it had
been in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Internal workers (people in accounting, purchasing, and
information resources) saw increases in productivity on days one
and two, but on day three, productivity was lower at home than it
would have been in the office. Fox was not able to explain the
results but said they were consistent in studies at different
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That comes as no surprise to either Nippert-Eng or Gordon. ``In
terms of planning work, it is very easy to do one day, or even two
from a remote site, but it becomes geometrically harder for days
three and four,'' said Gil Gordon, a New Jersey-based telecommuting
consultant and editor of a telecommuting newsletter. ``You need
files that might be at the office and you need interaction. Even
good telecommuters are not hermits.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schneider, the hardest thing about telecommuting is the loss
of social interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get to talk to anyone around the water cooler or the
printer'' she says. ``I am a social person and I was climbing the
walls.'' Her solution was to create conference calls with other
company telecommuters in other regions. ``For the first five
minutes, while you are waiting for everyone to join in, you can
talk about family and friends.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``The Rescuers'' _ Back when the Disney Studio was
searching for its identity, it released a series of spineless
animated movies. This is one of them. Nicely drawn and carefully
constructed, the barnyard tale lacks villainy _ the one element
that keeps animated children's films from being boring. (One
consumer note: Disney has recalled thousands of copies of the video
because the image of a nude woman was inserted at some point along
the production line. Parents should make suitable inquiries before
purchasing a copy.)

performance by Angela Bassett, and some intelligent writing, gives
this reversal of the usual romantic pairing its energy.

NOT WISE TO LOAD UP ON SECTOR FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 40, earning $40,000 a year. My employer does not offer a
retirement or savings plan. I have the following IRA accounts:
$24,000 in Fidelity Asset Manager Growth fund, $26,500 in Fidelity
Utilities fund, $27,500 in Fidelity Contrafund, $8,500 in Fidelity
Europe fund, and $20,000 in Fidelity Convertible Securities fund. I
also have $5,000 in a taxable account in Fidelity Disciplined
Equity fund. I have been contributing $50 a month to the retirement
accounts, and hope to increase that level to $100 this year. What
do you think of these funds, and where should I add new money? What
do you estimate I will have in 25 years?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., Fort Worth &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To tell the truth I'm not particularly wild about your fund
selections. For one thing, your portfolio seems to me to be too
conservative for a 25-year investment time frame; for another, it
seems to me to lack a distinct core position.
</P>
<P>
   You have three sizable holdings -- Asset Manager Growth,
Utilities, and Convertible Securities -- which are to varying
degrees too closely tied to the bond markets rather than stocks.
While Asset Manager Growth leans in the right direction, it remains
a balanced fund, and it holds nearly 28 percent of its assets in
cash and bonds, as of the last report from Morningstar Mutual
Funds. Both Utilities and Convertible Securities are funds which
focus their investments on dividend yields, accordingly sacrificing
a good deal of potential for capital appreciation. That leaves you
with the Contrafund and Europe positions, representing only 38.5
percent of the IRA portfolio, which are concentrating entirely on
growth. I suspect you came up with this array because you're
fundamentally pretty conservative, so I won't suggest you eliminate
these income-oriented funds entirely. But I do suggest you boost
the Contrafund position to $50,750 -- obtaining the funds by
cutting the positions in Utilities and Convertible securities in
half.
</P>
<P>
   For new investments, I'd suggest further diversification,
building a small position in Fidelity Select Health Care, another
in Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock, and maybe a third in the Small-Cap
Selector fund. (If you're second-guessing me by looking to the
Morningstar reports and see the below-average rating for Small-Cap
Selector, you should consider that the rating reflects the
downtrodden small-cap sector as much as the results of this fund.)
Finally, I think I'd move the holding in Fidelity Disciplined
Equity fund. The goal of this fund is to surpass the results of the
Standard and Poor's Index 500 using a selected portfolio that
tracks the industrial sectors of the index, but not all the stocks.
This strategy has relied in large part on a computer analysis of
the 500 stocks. It seemed to work nicely for the first six full
years of the fund's existence, from 1989 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But it has missed the mark ever since. If you compare five-year
results of the fund to those of Fidelity Spartan Market Index,
which simply seeks to track the S&AMP;P 500, you'll see average annual
gains of 18.71 percent for Diversified Equity, compared to 22.62
percent for Market Index. One- year and three-year figures show
even bigger variances, both times in favor of Market Index.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes -- where might you end up in 25 years? I think if you
adopt my suggestions it would be fair to assume 9.5 percent average
annual total returns from the portfolio. With your $100 monthly
contributions, that would take you to $1,066,595. If you want to
stick with the more cautious kind of portfolio you have now, you'll
probably sleep better, but in exchange for those extra winks you
should reduce the growth assumption to 8 percent average returns.
Thus the 25-year projection would fall to $765,519.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I need to roll over $16,000 I have in a former employer's
401(k) account, and I'm at a loss as to where to put it. I
currently have about $70,000 invested in an IRA that's in Vanguard
Specialized Health Care fund, and have another $10,000 in a
Vanguard Wellington fund IRA account. I'm a 47-year-old single
woman with a new job at $63,000 a year. I have started to save 10
percent of my salary in a 401(k) plan, with the investments evenly
divided among Merrill Lynch High-Income bond fund, Fidelity
Puritan, Vanguard Index 500, and Fidelity Contrafund. Am I on the
right track at all? I've been told that I shouldn't have the bulk
of my retirement money in a sector fund, but this one has been very
good to me. Should I dump the $16,000 there or diversify? I am
considering Vanguard's U.S. Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   A.K., Haverhill, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well whatever you do, don't buy still more of the health care
fund. I have long been an enthusiastic supported of Vanguard
Specialized Health Care -- but I also suggest it only as a fairly
small percentage of a long-term portfolio. It's now nearly 73
percent of your total retirement savings, and that's a mighty heavy
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Because I really like this fund, my first instinct was to
suggest that you simply let the Health Care position remain as it
is, waiting for the rest of the portfolio to grow to the point that
the Health Care position represents a more appropriate allocation
-- say 25 percent at most. But the numbers just don't work. If you
maintained current-level portfolio contributions until age 65, the
pool would grow to $819,400, presuming average 10 percent annual
portfolio growth. But even if the health care fund only matched
that growth and you bought no more shares, at age 65 the health
care position would still be 47.5 percent of the portfolio -- and
since it's reasonable to assume that the volatile but rewarding
health care sector will outperform the equity market in general
during those 18 years, the chances are that the percentage would be
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Investing is a discipline, and investing for retirement is a
very serious discipline. I suggest you sit down in front of a
mirror and ask yourself whether you want to bet your retirement
security that all of the generations of financial advisors who have
recommended diversity, and who have recommended that sector plays
be held to a minor percentage of a retirement portfolio, are wrong.
I hope you come up with the right answer -- and then cut your
Vanguard Health Care position in half -- which still leaves it at
36 percent of your entire retirement accounts. I would then leave
that account alone, buying no further shares until the portfolio
reaches a point where the Health Care position falls below 25
percent; at that point, I'd only buy enough to maintain the 25
percent maximum allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard U.S. Growth is a solid fund; added to Fidelity
Contrafund and Vanguard Index 500, these positions could be treated
as the ``core'' of your retirement portfolio. I'd not only put the
$16,000 from the old 401(k) in one of these three funds (as a
rollover IRA), but I would allocate $32,000 from the sale of Health
Care shares to these positions, bringing that ``core'' up to 50
percent of the portfolio. I suggest you then take the final $3,000
to start a position that represents still further diversification
-- either with Vanguard's Small-Cap Index or its International
Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am over age 66 and work full time. I have worked all my
life and am self-supporting. A few weeks ago a letter appeared in
your column from a woman aged 40, who said her plans involved
working until age 70. From my own experience I wonder if people
realize how difficult this is. You may be in good health, but the
body is tired physically and mentally, and if you commute into the
city this is an added burden. For these reasons, I don't think this
is something people should count on, or earnings they should depend
on. If they can do it, more power to them.
</P>
<P>
   N.S., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You've said it very nicely: that people should begin their
retirement planning early enough so that they at least will have
the option of retiring at a traditional age, if not earlier.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are some people who not only have the stamina and
appetite to work beyond age 65 or thereabouts, but who would simply
go nuts if they suddenly found themselves with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But your point is very well taken: People should provide
themselves with enough financial security that retiring at a
traditional age will be an open option. And yes _ I should have
mentioned that to the lady.

SPRINKLE FLESHES OUT HYPOCRISY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annie Sprinkle will be at the Coolidge Corner Theater Tuesday
through Thursday in ``Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn Reel to
Real,'' in which she chronicles her 25-year metamorphosis from shy
young girl to porno actress to performance artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pornography is a big part of our culture, even if we don't
want to admit it,'' said Sprinkle from Provincetown, Mass., where
she was visiting a friend. Pornography is increasingly mainstream,
she said, its influence is apparent in subtle and not-so-subtle
ways: ``Look at Madonna, the Spice Girls, so many others. And
lingerie. When I first started in porn in the early `70's, you
couldn't find sexy lingerie. Now you go into Macy's and there are
racks and racks of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to Kenneth Starr's painstaking
investigation of the White House sex scandal, pornography is now
mainstream daily news. ``I'm just so amazed by Larry Flynt,''
Sprinkle said, echoing the sentiments of a nation. ``Here's our
most radical pornographer now wielding all this political power.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the scandal all about sex? Sprinkle doesn't think so. ``I
think the truth is more important than anything,'' she said. ``If
he lied under oath, then he should go. I believe in people telling
the truth. Even politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a such a good chance to be open about it. Instead he
chose to lie, to cover up. I feel really bad for the women
involved. Chelsea and Hilary, and Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying about sex is reprehensible to Sprinkle, a self-described
sexual revolutionary who, in her own outrageous way, has spent her
adult life battling sexual hypocrisy. Sprinkle's body of work is
the sort of stuff that gives Jesse Helms and his ilk the vapors.
Much of what she does and what she's done can't be described here.
Suffice it to say there are very few areas of sexuality that
Sprinkle has not explored _ and been photographed or filmed
exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Her Brookline, Mass. appearance is sponsored by the women's
erotic boutique The Grand Opening. The performance piece includes
film clips from every stage of her career: `. . . my kinky phase,
my art phase, my spiritual phase. . . . It tells my story but it
also says a lot about sex in our society. It's funny. It's not
supposed to be erotic, although if people want to see it that way,
it's fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   She described her current phase as being a wise woman, ``kind of
the Shirley MacLaine of porn.'' She teaches workshops in erotic
massage and spriritual aspects of sexuality, among other subjects.
``I'm really a very spiritual person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiography, ``Post-Porn Modernist,'' she writes that
originally she was Ellen Steinberg, a name that ``just didn't sound
sexy enough to me.'' She describes how she came to change that
name: ``I was lying on my bed and I heard a voice whisper, clear as
a bell, `Annie Sprinkle.''' Later she discovered a grave in
Baltimore of an Annie Sprinkle who died in 1861, at age 17. ``I
believe that it was her spirit that whispered her name in my ear
and that she now lives vicariously through me,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Sprinkle was inducted into the porn industry's Hall of
Fame in Las Vegas. It was an honor she never expected because she
was always ``a fringe figure in the porno world, a radical, a
feminist.'' Her induction came about because so many young women
are now influential in porno filmmaking. ``Girl power,'' she
said.``My biggest fans are women in their 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle lived in Provincetown for a year and a half, but moved
back to California 15 months ago. She now lives in Sausalito, on a
houseboat she calls her mermaid sanctuary. ``I miss Provincetown,''
she said. ``It's so beautiful. But it's definitely more
conservative.''

PAULA JONES GETS HER DAY IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Much of the argument for the conviction of Bill
Clinton presented to the Senate by the Republican managers of the
case rested on the premise that the president's actions interfered
with Paula Corbin Jones' ability to have her day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Republican managers, for the benefit of the
Senate and the television audience, painted a portrait of Jones, a
former Arkansas state clerical worker, as a waif, beset in the
storm by the power of the presidency seeking to deny her rights.
</P>
<P>
   Reciting the indictment constructed by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, the prosecutors alleged that because Clinton
perjured himself before the grand jury and in his deposition in the
Jones suit against him, Jones was blocked from getting justice.
</P>
<P>
   It was a line of attack to stir the compassion and indignation
of a public so far unconvinced by feverish Republican attempts to
evict Clinton from the presidency. However, it was troubled by a
fatal flaw. In court, Jones had, in fact, received full hearing and
thorough justice, irrespective of the allegations now before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy in their attempt to use the Jones case was one fact
that the Republican managers somehow overlooked. It was that the
Jones suit was summarily dismissed in federal court because it
lacked merit four and half months before Clinton was summoned to
testify before the grand jury by Starr. Therefore, logically,
anything he said to the grand jury could not have had bearing on
the case already thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Clinton is accused of perjuring himself over his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But that would not have affected
the court decision. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled
that Jones had suffered no damage, in her job or in her person,
even if her version of the encounter with Clinton, when he was the
governor of Arkansas, was correct. The judge ruled: ``Whether other
women may have been subjected to workplace harassment, and whether
such evidence has allegedly been suppressed, does not change the
fact that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she has a
case worthy of submitting to a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   In their zeal to make their case, the Republican managers
neglected to be governed by the action of the House of
Representatives, which specifically voted down a proposed article
of impeachment on Clinton having committed perjury in the Jones
case. The prosecutors nevertheless repeatedly shifted their perjury
accusations from the Jones hearing to the grand jury and back.
</P>
<P>
   In an actual court of law, presumably the judge would have
instructed them to stick to the terms of the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before the Senate trial began, before the House voted
the articles of impeachment, the president agreed to pay Jones
$850,000 to make the case go away four years after it had begun.
But he did not issue an apology, which Jones had been fierce about
receiving in order to restore what she considered her good name.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the president acknowledge any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   So with $850,000 enlarging the pockets of Jones and her lawyers,
she seemed to have done rather well for someone with a legal
argument that had been found to be without merit.
</P>
<P>
   It is useful to recall the key events that led up to it, because
they illustrate the political machinations and ulterior motives
that underpin what is happening today.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she encountered Clinton in a Little Rock hotel room
in 1991, to which she had been summoned by the governor by a state
trooper. Once in the room, she said he exposed himself and proposed
oral sex. She said she declined and left the hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas state trooper testified that she did not seem
unhappy from her encounter with the governor and earlier that day
had suggested to the trooper that she would be glad to become the
governor's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He also said she later discussed with him how much money she
might make from the incident. One of her sisters also said Jones
was interested in getting money out of it.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993, a right-wing magazine, the American Spectator,
published an article on Arkansas Troopergate, recalling the hotel
incident and identifying the woman only by her first name, Paula.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after the publication of that account, and
three years after the incident allegedly occurred and just before
the statute of limitations was to run out, Jones announced her suit
under the sponsorship of conservative groups. She complained her
reputation had been sullied, but she did not sue the conservative
magazine. She chose to go after Clinton, who had not said one
public word about the event.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives made the case into a cause, set about using it to
raise funds and exploited it as a political weapon against the
person who had long been their arch enemy: Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Clinton did not own up to his consensual affair
with Monica Lewinsky in his Jones case deposition, which history
should have taught him would have been the best way out of his
troubles no matter the embarrassment and pain it would have caused.
He lied to the American people, his staff and his family.
</P>
<P>
   All came out anyway, and no one was spared, least of all the
American people, now suffering through an unwarranted assault on
the presidency itself.
</P>

   But whatever else is yet to befall Clinton, and despite the
manipulations of the Republican prosecutors, Jones did get to have
her day in court.

TEN WHO'VE LED THEIR COUNTRY WITH A STRONG, FEMALE HAND

<P>
   Poor old U.S.A. Here we are playing catch-up again.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole hints at a bid for the White House and it throws
the pundits into a frenzy: ``Are Americans ready for a female
president?'' Many a Sunday-morning news show will no doubt debate
the question into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of the world yawns. From an international
perspective, female heads of state are old hat. There are currently
24 living women who are or have been presidents or prime ministers,
according to the Council of Women World Leaders, and don't count on
that number shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen has governed the modern countries of Canada, Haiti,
Bolivia, Rwanda, Norway, Burundi and Bangladesh, to name a few, and
female leaders include some of the most influential and admired
figures of the 20th century: Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir and Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder of this not-so-new phenomenon, we've compiled a
list of 10 women who ruled the world _ or parts of it, at least.
Liddy Dole might do well to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   1. BENAZIR BHUTTO, born 1953
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Pakistan, 1988-1990 and 1993-1996
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Educated at Harvard and Oxford, Bhutto is
the eldest child of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, president and then prime
minister of Pakistan from 1971 to 1977. After the elder Bhutto's
government was overthrown and he was hanged, Benazir became her
political party's most powerful voice. Her opposition to the new
military government landed her in jail, although eventually she was
allowed to leave Pakistan for London. In 1986, hundreds of
thousands of Pakistanis celebrated her return to the country. Two
years later,
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto, at age 35, became the first woman to rule a modern
Islamic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Having spent time in the United States and England,
Bhutto knew how to deal with the Western press, one of her
strengths on the international stage. ``Her foreign persona was a
really powerful one,'' said Laura Liswood, co-founder of the
Council of Women World Leaders. Bhutto also established women's
police stations, where women could report rape. During both of her
rocky governments, Bhutto faced charges of corruption and abuse of
power. In September, Swiss authorities handed over to Pakistani
officials evidence that Bhutto may have laundered money and taken
kickbacks while in office. The fiery Bhutto denies the charges and
continues to be an outspoken critic of the current Pakistani
government.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Now 45, Bhutto is the mother of three. Despite
her international prominence, she is acutely aware of her place as
a woman in a Muslim society. ``I must always maintain a certain
degree of formality,'' she has said. ``For instance, I have to be
accompanied by a proper chaperone, I must be careful how I talk to
people, I can't develop the same kind of camaraderie that exists
among men.''
</P>
<P>
   2. GOLDA MEIR, born 1898
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Israel, 1969-1974
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Meir was 8 when her father, a carpenter,
moved the family from the Ukraine to Milwaukee. As a young woman
she became drawn to Zionism and moved to Palestine with her
husband, Morris Meyerson, in 1921. Through positions with the
Israel Labor Federation and World Zionist Organization, Meir drew
recognition as a powerful political force. She was elected to the
Knesset in 1949, appointed minister of labor that same year and
then minister of foreign affairs in 1956. In 1969, after the sudden
death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, party officials chose Meir,
then 70, as the fourth prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Meir took a hard line toward the Arab world. Her
government refused to stop building settlements in the occupied
Palestinian territories and rejected a peace agreement with Arab
states. But she encouraged emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and
strengthened Israeli ties with the United States. Meir resigned as
prime minister in 1974, in the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur
War, in which Arab attacks caught the country by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: A chain-smoker who rejected makeup, Meir ranked
fourth on the list of women most admired by Americans in a 1969
poll. David Ben-Gurion once called her ``the only man in my
Cabinet.'' Meir had two children and was, by several accounts, an
accomplished cook.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ China should not mourn the loss of Michael Jordan.
After all, it has Yao Ming. At 18, Yao is already playing
basketball head and shoulders _ maybe even half a torso _ above
most other players in China.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he is 7-foot-5.
</P>
<P>
   Yao plays in the Chinese Basketball Association, which draws 130
million television viewers _ as many as watch the Super Bowl _ for
regular season games. Fans of what has become China's most popular
sport are pinning their hopes on the mobile, muscular star of the
Shanghai Sharks to become the first Chinese player to join the
National Basketball Association. And in the new China, there may be
a better chance of that than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Already considered one of the three best professional centers in
China, the high school senior attended Nike's All-America Camp in
Indianapolis last summer, where he ranked second among 40 top high
school centers.
</P>
<P>
   But American college coaches who have called his mother and
approached his managers so far have gotten nowhere. Fame and
fortune may beckon, but the Chinese system dictates that Yao
belongs to his team, his league, and ultimately, his country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rules and values are changing here, perhaps faster in
Shanghai than anywhere else. And Yao's dilemma _ to serve his
country or himself _ illustrates that evolution. To leave China for
big money and better competition would once have been denounced as
unpatriotic and capitalistic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Yao's managers speak almost in passing of duty to the
communist nation. Their bigger concern is the bottom line: How much
money will they be able to get for him when the time comes?
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pop culture has embraced almost everything American,
particularly basketball. NBA games air several times a week on
cable, and the marketing opportunities of a Chinese player in the
NBA would be tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Yao says he is not interested in money and declined to reveal
how much he currently earns. But a team manager says his salary,
like other rookie Chinese players, is $61 a month. That is
supplemented by bonuses from the club, tournament hosts, and the
national team, for which Yao also plays. Even so, the total,
together with free dormitory food and housing, can't approach even
the lowest salaries in the NBA, which are around $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   To play abroad, Yao would need approval from his club, the CBA,
and government authorities, says Yu Xiao Miao, vice general manager
of Shanghai Oriental Television Basketball Club, known to millions
as the Shanghai Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the municipal government of Shanghai is very open-minded,
so they'd never hold him back,'' said Yu. ``And for our club, it's
a commercial decision. He's under contract and we'd like to train
him more. The better he is, the better price we can sell him for.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not that simple. Years of schooling in duty to his
nation and a sense of obligation to the club that has housed and
fed him for the last four years tug at Yao. The amount of food he
has eaten as a teenager would have impoverished his parents, one of
his managers jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about it, but I think it would not be
difficult for me to decide,'' Yao said this week in a rare
interview, when asked whether he would play in the United States if
given the chance. ``If my boss thinks it's good for my development,
I would go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao is on the sidelines now, his size 18 left foot broken and
wrapped in a gigantic cast clad with a sock his mother knitted to
keep him warm in the unheated gym.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if forced to choose between playing in
America or on the Chinese Olympic team, he smiled gently and
skirted the question with a finesse far beyond his age. ``Isn't it
too early to ask that question?''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed again, Yao turned philosophical. ``Whatever you decide,
you lose something,'' he said. ``If I stay in China, I lose the
opportunity to go to the NBA. But if I go to the NBA, I lose the
chance to serve my country. And my country is the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Wayman Strickland, 28, the only American on the Sharks,
said Yao can serve his nation beyond playing for the national team.
The mere chance to become the first Chinese player in the NBA,
Strickland said, would be ``a big deal for China.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent. In 1997, Zheng Haixia, a 6-foot-8 veteran
of China's women's Olympic team, joined the Women's National
Basketball Association in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland believes Yao would be one of the top three picks if
he entered the NBA draft. ``He's got the ability to run up and down
the court, a nice touch, and good basic skills,'' said Strickland.
``Combine that with being almost 7-foot-5, and you've got
tremendous potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Americans couldn't contemplate why he wouldn't just
leave, go to university for a year and then the NBA,'' added
Strickland, a San Francisco native. ``But he'd be leaving
everything. If he went without permission, he couldn't even contact
his family. Here it's family and duty first . . . It's a huge
cultural difference. Everything is a group decision _ you go
through the system and you do what's best for the group, not the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely protected by his team and parents, Yao seems unaffected
by his fame and spends his free time reading Chinese history and
playing computer games on his Sony Playstation. He has been living
in a government sports dormitory since he was 14, when he began
playing for the Shanghai junior team. He became a professional last
season, but still attends school three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Yao started playing basketball at age 9, influenced by his
mother, who is 6-foot-3 and his father, who is 6-foot-7. Both both
played for China's national teams in the 1970s. His favorite player
is Houston Rockets star Hakeem Olajuwon, for his speed and moves.
He admires the Larry Bird-era Boston Celtics for ``creating a new
era in history,'' but politely said the current Celtics are ``not
as good as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao plays basketball for four hours a day and studies for two
hours, in addition to his classes and weekend visits to his
parents. He doesn't have a girlfriend _ ``I don't have time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the Sharks vice general manager, said, ``Although Yao Ming
is a very good person, he is not yet a member of the Communist
Youth League. But he actually plays a far more important role on
the team than the Communist Youth League members.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu added, ``He also knows our team needs him and he needs to
develop the basics. If he goes to America now, he might just be
sitting on a cold bench.''

   3. ISABEL PERON, born 1931
</P>
<P>
   President of Argentina, 1974-1976, not to be confused with Eva
Peron, a k a Evita, the popular demagogue and second wife of Gen.
Juan Peron.
</P>
<P>
   Political background: The third wife of Juan Peron, Isabel Peron
met her future husband in the mid-1950s while working as a dancer.
Gen. Peron recently had been ousted as the ruler of Argentina, and
she became his personal secretary, settling with him in Madrid.
They were married in 1961 when he was 65 and she was 30. Through
several diplomatic visits to Argentina, Isabel paved the way for
her husband's triumphant return in 1973, when he was re-elected
president and she assumed the vice presidency. Less than a year
later, Juan Peron died of heart failure, and Isabel came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Like Evita before her, Isabel championed the causes
of Argentine women, but could not overcome the economic and
political strife in her country. Her government imposed martial law
and saw inflation rise to 200 percent, which led to crippling union
strikes. A military junta overthrew her regime in 1976, and she
eventually went into exile in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Isabel Peron is said to have believed in
astrology and enjoy fencing. Unlike Evita, she was shy and often
compared negatively with her husband's second wife. A 1973 profile
in Time magazine commented that she sometimes appeared ``as if she
had been laminated in plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   4. CORAZON AQUINO, born 1933
</P>
<P>
   President of the Philippines, 1986-1992
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Aquino was born to a wealthy family with
political ties and schooled at convents in the United States. She
married Benigno Aquino in 1954, raised five children and watched
her husband's political career take off. When Ferdinand Marcos
declared martial law in 1972, he jailed his political nemesis,
Benigno, for nearly eight years before allowing the Aquinos to flee
to the United States. In 1983, Benigno returned to the Philippines
and was gunned down at the Manila Airport; Corazon vowed to
continue his work, and in 1986 forced Marcos into exile in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: During her tumultuous tenure, Aquino restored some
civil rights and released political prisoners, while her government
survived at least seven coup attempts. Her presidency inspired a
renaissance in the arts in her country and renewed international
economic interest in the Philippines, although critics said she
didn't advance the country economically as much as she might have.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: The petite Aquino, 65, is a devout Roman
Catholic who found the Marcos' opulent presidential palace
uncomfortably extravagant and set up an office in the guest house
of her more modest home.
</P>
<P>
   5. MARGARET THATCHER, born 1925
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Great Britain, 1979-1990
</P>
<P>
   Political background: With an eye to his daughter's political
future, the lower-middle-class father of Margaret Thatcher paid for
his daughter to take extra lessons in the classics and Latin. At
Oxford, she studied chemistry and became involved in Conservative
Party politics. After marrying, giving birth to twins and
practicing law, she ran for Parliament in a wealthy suburb of
London and held the seat from 1959 to 1992. In 1975, she took the
reins of the Conservative Party, and four years later was elected
prime minister on a platform of abolishing the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Thatcherism, the prime minister's major contribution
to political science, not only encompassed her policies but her
style. ``Under her forceful, if sometimes strident, leadership, the
Conservatives accomplished what no previous British government in
the postwar period had done: They emasculated the unions,
denationalized important industries, curbed inflation and swelled
the ranks of the middle class,'' according to Current Biography
Yearbook. Meanwhile, unemployment soared and the gap between the
haves and have-nots grew.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Since her resignation, Baroness Thatcher has
written her memoirs and continues to weigh in on matters of state.
She recently came out against the extradition of Chilean Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and, as of December, was still the
fourth-most-admired woman by Americans, according to a Gallup Poll,
right after No. 3, Elizabeth Dole.

   6. MARY EUGENIA CHARLES, born 1919
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 1980 to 1995
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Charles was born in 1919 on the eastern
Caribbean island of Dominica and received her bachelor's degree
from the University of Toronto and her law degree from the London
School of Economics and Political Science in the 1940s. She
returned to Dominica, becoming the first female lawyer on the
island. Her involvement in politics culminated in election to the
House of Assembly in 1975, as leader of the opposition Freedom
Party (the country achieved independence from Britain in 1978).
Charles' harsh criticism of the Labor Party government was
partially responsible for the resignation of Prime Minister Patrick
John, whom she succeeded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Dominica was a founding member of the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States in 1981. In 1983, Charles requested that
the United States send troops to another OECS member nation,
Grenada, to thwart an overthrow of that country's government by
leftist extremists. The invasion drew criticism from the United
Nations. A forceful presence, Charles is nicknamed the Iron Lady of
the Caribbean. Her detractors claimed Charles, a fiscal
conservative, ran the country too much like a business, with little
regard for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: She was the granddaughter of a former slave, and
Charles' father was a successful fruit exporter who lived to be
107. In 1994, she told an interviewer that the person she admired
most in the world was Golda Meir.
</P>
<P>
   7. VIGDIS FINNBOGADOTTIR, born 1930
</P>
<P>
   President of Iceland, 1980 to 1996
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Finnbogadottir studied drama and
literature at the Sorbonne in France and in 1972 was appointed
director of the Reykjavik Theater Company. She hosted a television
series on drama and lectured on Icelandic culture before becoming
the chairwoman of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Affairs in
1978. At the time, women's issues were coming to the fore, and
colleagues persuaded Finnbogadottir to make a run for the
presidency. She won her first four-year term, beating four male
opponents, in 1980. She ran unopposed in 1984 and in 1992; in 1988
she won the presidency with 92 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Although the presidency in Iceland is more a
ceremonial role than a political one, Finnbogadottir has championed
numerous causes including Icelandic culture and reforestation. She
founded the Save the Children Association of Iceland and in 1995
was the keynote speaker at the UN Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: In 1972, Finnbogadottir became a single parent
after adopting a baby girl. She remains a national icon since
leaving office, and is now co-founder of the Council of Women World
Leaders based at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   8. MARY ROBINSON, born 1944
</P>
<P>
   President of Ireland, 1990 to 1997
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Robinson's activism evolved at a young
age: While at an exclusive Catholic boarding school, Robinson
petitioned for the right to read the Protestant Irish Times. She
graduated from Harvard Law School in 1968 and became the first
woman to be a faculty member at Trinity College Dublin, where she
began working to improve the lives of women through the law. She
fought for the right of women to sit on juries, for laws protecting
illegitimate children and for gay rights. Upon her election to the
Senate in 1969 (she was only 25 years old), she introduced a bill
to legalize contraceptives. In 1989, she resigned from the Senate,
only to accept the Labor party's nomination as its presidential
candidate the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: As in Iceland, the Irish presidency is a largely
symbolic post. But Robinson's victory seemed ``to symbolize
Ireland's desire for genuine change, given her stands on such
charged issues as abortion and reproductive rights, which have been
anathema to other Irish leaders. ... Mary Robinson has indeed used
her title to promote tolerance, compassion and national debate,''
according to ``A Rising Public Voice: Women in Politics
Worldwide,'' edited by Alida Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Upon her entry into politics, Robinson was
derided for what some considered a lackluster personal appearance.
When she became president, she underwent an image makeover.
Robinson resigned the presidency in September 1997 to become United
Nations human rights commissioner. She was succeeded as president
by Mary McAleese.

   9. VIOLETA CHAMORRO, born 1929
</P>
<P>
   President of Nicaragua, 1990-1997
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Born into a wealthy, landowning family,
Chamorro was schooled in San Antonio and Virginia. Back in
Nicaragua, she married Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, an activist against
the Somoza dictatorship and scion of the family that owned the
liberal La Prensa newspaper. His articles consistently landed him
in jail. Pedro was ultimately assassinated by the right-wing
dictatorship in 1978, and Violeta took over the newspaper. When the
Somoza government fled, Daniel Ortega's Sandinista party became the
dominant political force, and Chamorro became an outspoken
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Her political defeat of Ortega ended 10 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Chamorro's presidency faced significant challenges,
including rising unemployment, strikes and continued fighting
between Sandinista militants and rebellious contras. Her most vocal
critic was Sen. Jesse Helms, who accused her of selling out to the
Sandinistas and who threatened to withhold financial aid to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Chamorro ``was very symbolic of the unity of
Nicaragua,'' said Liswood, of the Council of Women World Leaders.
``She had four children, two Sandinistas and two contras.''
Chamorro's autobiography, titled ``Dreams of the Heart,'' received
generally favorable reviews in the United States when it was
published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   10. INDIRA GANDHI, born 1917
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of India, 1966 to 1977 and 1980 to 1984
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Indira Gandhi, the only child of
Jawaharlal Nehru _ India's first prime minister, from 1947 to 1964
_ was enmeshed in Indian politics from her earliest years. Although
she was not related to India's spiritual leader Mohandas Gandhi, he
was close to her father and encouraged her involvement in the
resistance movement against British rule. Because her mother had
died in 1936, Gandhi became India's ``first lady'' during her
father's government, accompanying him on trips and gaining a
prominent political reputation. In 1959, one year before the death
of her husband, Feroze Gandhi, she was elected president of the
Congress Party, the second-highest political position in the
country. When Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru's
successor, died in 1966, Gandhi was elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: In the early 70s, Gandhi was said to be perhaps the
most popular leader in the world, although her term was not so
rosy. Under Gandhi, India exploded its first nuclear device.
Although she promised to abolish poverty, she was also beholden to
the rich for her power base. In the mid-'70s, Gandhi limited
personal freedoms and began jailing political rivals. In response,
she was voted out of office in 1977, but regained power in 1979.
When her son and heir-designate, Sanjay, died in a plane crash, she
began grooming son Rajiv as her successor. In 1984, after ordering
a violent raid on a Sikh temple, she was assassinated by two of her

AIR SURVEY CITES TOXICITY; EPA SHELVES DATA RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans increase their risk of cancer practically every time
they draw a breath in the great outdoors, according to a
groundbreaking federal project that finds there is almost no place
in the United States to escape toxic chemicals in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency found that virtually every
American inhaled slightly unsafe levels of at least eight
chemicals, and 20 million faced at least a 1-in-10,000 lifetime
risk of getting cancer as a result in 1990, the most recent data
available for the agency's Cumulative Exposure Project.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA last month abruptly shelved plans to release
community-level results from the project after the US Conference of
Mayors and some state officials objected that the 1990 air
pollution data do not reflect progress in the fight against air
pollution in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in states such as Vermont that already
aggressively monitor chemicals in the air say the EPA findings
remain broadly accurate  &UR; today &LR; , leading environmentalists to
suspect that critics are most nervous about the political impact of
a report on pervasive toxic chemical pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will be surprised by the relatively high level of
health risk associated with air toxics in their area,'' said Bill
Pease, a toxicologist at the New York-based Environmental Defense
Fund who obtained the EPA results under the Freedom of Information
Act. ``There are a lot of activities we engage in on a daily basis
and don't think they have a toxic consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA project marks the first time that researchers have
estimated Americans' exposure to scores of toxic chemicals released
by industry, automobiles, and businesses such as dry cleaners.
Unlike most air pollution studies, which focus on a handful of
regulated chemicals such as lead and ozone, the EPA looked at 148
less well understood chemicals, such as formaldehyde, that few
communities regularly monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1990 data on pollution releases, the most recent
statistics available when the project began in 1994, EPA
researchers estimated chemical concentrations for all 60,803 US
Census tracts, each representing 4,000 to 5,000 people. The
researchers then compared the chemical levels against the amount
that would cause cancer or other illnesses in at least one person
out of a million over a 70-year lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely see such valuable data sets coming out of US EPA.
This is a gold mine,'' said Pease, who has started analyzing the
voluminous EPA data.
</P>
<P>
   The results, a summary of which is posted on the EPA's Internet
home page _ www.epa.gov:80/Oppecumm _ suggest a remarkably
widespread pollution problem. Virtually every census tract had
elevated levels of at least eight chemicals that can cause cancer
or other illnesses, with an average of 14 elevated chemicals per
tract.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if all pollution stopped  &UR; tomorrow &LR; , EPA
researchers found, Americans would still breathe worrisome levels
of eight chemicals because of past pollution as well as natural
sources. For example, chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, a
now-banned dry-cleaning fluid that can cause cancer, remain in the
air for decades after they are released.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon tetrachloride ``is so persistent it has enveloped the
globe,'' said Dick Valentinetti, director of the air quality
program in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, potentially toxic levels of these chemicals are
present throughout the country: Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,
benzene, chloroform, ethylene dibromide, ethylene dichloride,
formaldehyde, and methyl chloride.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials were ready to put their exposure data on their
home page last month, including estimated chemical levels by census
tract, when agency sources say a complaint from the US Conference
of Mayors gave the EPA second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarty, assistant executive director for the mayors'
group, said the toxic air emissions review is based on data that
are too old and too dependent on computer projections to be
reliable, making them open to abuse. He said real estate brokers
could wrongly steer home buyers away from ``contaminated''
neighborhoods, while urban development projects could be undercut
by false fears of poor air quality.
</P>
<P>
   He said the EPA should wait for newer 1996 air emissions data,
expected later this year, that may show the air is getting cleaner.
The data could then be fed into the EPA researchers' computer model
to estimate Americans' exposure levels, a process that EPA sources
say would take until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to go out the first time on 1990 data.
That's not a good starting point,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, EPA officials indefinitely shelved plans to release
the project's findings while they reviewed them. Now, they say they
plan to release the census tract information to those who request
it, but they say the 1990 study was intended simply to test its
computer models.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA strongly cautions that the results of this modeling
exercise alone should not be used to draw real-world conclusions
about current local conditions,'' said EPA associate administrator
Loretta M. Ucelli, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's authors as well as some state officials were
angered at the EPA's seeming retreat, arguing that the change was
unnecessary and harmful to a health issue that often takes a back
seat to more high-profile pollution problems such as smog and acid
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a modeling exercise, but it is the best we have and the
data has been extensively reviewed and reviewed and re-reviewed''
by outside experts, said a co-author of the air pollution report,
Rachel Morello-Frosch, who is now at the University of
California-Berkeley's School of Public Health. ``It doesn't get
much better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Morello-Frosch conceded that numerous initiatives may have cut
toxic chemical emissions since 1990 _ states have reduced the
benzene in gasoline and required fume-trapping hoods on gas pumps,
for example _ but she warned ``it's not necessarily a good
assumption to assume everything has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where the state has been monitoring concentrations
of many toxic air emissions for five years, state officials said
the EPA report remains basically accurate  &UR; today &LR; , and the state
has detected one elevated chemical, methylene chloride, that the
Cumulative Exposure Project did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though EPA is kind of distancing itself from the results of
this report . . . they've got a very clear message they should be
sending that there are some toxics issues out there,'' said
Valentinetti.
</P>
<P>
   According to the data, the issues are quite grave in many parts
of the country. EPA found that in 10 percent of the census tracts
residents face at least a 1-in-10,000 risk of getting cancer just
from breathing toxic chemicals. Though the risk seems relatively
small _ the lifetime risk of dying from smoking a pack of
cigarettes a day is one in seven _ it translates into at least
2,000 extra cancers a year in the high-exposure communities alone.
</P>
<P>
   And the automobile emerges as one of the main villains, carrying
contamination to even the most rural parts of America. Three auto
exhaust chemicals _ benzene, formaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene _ were
present in potentially cancer-causing concentrations in 90 percent
of all census tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy surrounding public release of the
Cumulative Exposure Project report, Massachusetts officials say
they are benefiting from the detailed exposure data, which EPA has
already shared with many states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points out areas where we need to improve,'' said state
Department of Environmental Protection deputy director Nancy
Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   She said Massachusetts had taken strong steps to cut toxic
chemical pollution in recent years, but the EPA report showed that
more needs to be done, especially regarding cars. ``We all love to
drive our cars and sometimes we don't want to think about what it
does to the air,'' Seidman said.

MONEY AT ISSUE IN DALLAS WOMAN'S SUIT AGAINST SINGER KIRK FRANKLIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, Kirk Franklin and Metroplex choir God's
Property owned gospel music, and looked to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, 28, was already a multimillion-selling gospel
superstar by 1997, when the debut CD by God's Property _ formed by
Dallasite Linda Searight in 1992 after what she calls a ``vision
from God'' _ was released by B-Rite Records, the sister company of
GospoCentric Records, Franklin's label.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's Property From Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation,'' which
Franklin had produced, written songs for and performed on, quickly
ascended to the top of the gospel charts. By summer, the flagship
video, ``Stomp,'' was in heavy rotation on MTV, and GP was the
hottest name in gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Within just over a year, though, it would all fall to ashes, a
heap of accusations and counteraccusations. Now Searight and
Franklin (who was just nominated for a Grammy for song of the year)
face off through legal papers and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Searight filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles, naming
GospoCentric President Vicki Mack Lataillade; B-Rite President (and
Vicki Mack's husband) Claude Lataillade; Franklin; his production
company, Fo Yo Soul; and Interscope Records, which owns part of
both labels.
</P>
<P>
   She is asking for $70 million in royalties and potential
earnings, claiming that Franklin and Vicki Mack Lataillade
conspired to usurp her power and authority within the choir and
poisoned her relationship with its members by telling them that she
withheld money from concerts. (Seventeen choir members and
employees were named in the suit but later dropped.)
</P>
<P>
   Searight also asserts that Lataillade (pronounced
``lah-tay-ODD'') and Franklin pressured her into signing an unfair
contract with B-Rite, one which guarantees that no matter how much
money the CD makes, she will forever be in debt for advances and
promotional costs.
</P>
<P>
   She and GP manager Thomas Hall say they've never made any money
from the CD, which has now sold nearly 3 million copies. Statements
from B-Rite claim that she's in debt to the label for
$2,149,548.87.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems unbelievable,'' said Searight, 50. ``It's hard
to conceive of accomplishing what we've accomplished and not having
made anything from it. It just seems unbelievable and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   B-Rite fired back in November, suing Searight for breach of
contract and asking that members who have left the group be allowed
to record for the label. Supposedly, many members had left because
of what the suit called ``misguided, dictatorial, secretive, unfair
and unreasonable conduct'' on Searight's part.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also asks for an accounting of the money Searight has
made from selling merchandise at GP shows.
</P>
<P>
   No court date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who lives in Arlington, Texas, asked to be dropped
from the Searight lawsuit. His lawyer, Peter Haviland, says he was
only named in the suit because of his name recognition. U.S.
District Judge Dean D. Pregerson denied the request in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the facts are presented to the court, Linda Searight's
claims will dry up and evaporate like mist under a hot morning
sun,'' Haviland said. ``The lawsuit is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE SUITS SAY
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle really breaks down into two main contentions,
the first concerning the contract that Searight signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The contention over the contract is about the pressures that
supposedly led Searight to sign it, more than its content. She and
Hall claim that they were told by Lataillade and Franklin that if
they didn't sign the contract, there were plenty of other groups
that would be happy to, and GP would lose its golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asked if I'd signed by Kirk,'' said Searight.
``There was an urgency to get going on the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Channing Johnson, legal counsel for both GospoCentric and
B-Rite, says no pressure was put on Searight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second main contention is over Searight's handling of the
choir, and how many people have left.
</P>
<P>
   The countersuit paints Searight as a woman who wanted to
exercise too much control over the choir and wouldn't stay in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Searight says Lataillade and Franklin constantly undermined her
authority, although both she and Hall said the specifics would have
to wait for the courtroom. But she did say that not being able to
appear in the ``Stomp'' video undermined her authority in the group
and upset her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's her problem,'' said Johnson. ``We didn't want her in
the video. She's not the artist. She delivered the choir. She's an
intermediary.''
</P>
<P>
   The breaking point seems to have been the night of the Billboard
Music Awards in December 1997. Searight claims that Lataillade and
Franklin accused her, in front of the group, of withholding money
from them.
</P>
<P>
   She also says Lataillade, who is black, said she didn't want
Searight accepting awards for GP and called her an ``old, fat,
black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't deny the statements were made (''well, I'm not
sure `old' was used,'' he said with a chuckle) but says they were
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a statement made about Linda getting up there,'' he
said. ``She (Lataillade) wanted the group up there. The statement
(about withheld money) was a simple statement of truth, not
pointing the finger. Remember who the contract is with. Any
compensation we would pay, we'd pay through Linda, and she has an
obligation to pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that the contract is ``standard'' for the industry
and that Searight has never asked for an audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get behind any of our numbers any time she wants to,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After December 1997, Johnson says, GospoCentric gave members
money ``because they were broke. They were complaining about not
having any money and, more important, not knowing how much they
should or should not have from those performances.''
</P>
<P>
   And over time, Johnson says, ``25 to 28'' members of God's
Property, a little less than half, have left, unhappy with how
Searight ran GP and/or with their financial situations.
</P>
<P>
   Totally inaccurate, says Searight. While some members have gone
on extended leaves or moved due to school or job situations, nobody
has resigned from God's Property ``as a result of this situation.''
And she's forced nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is ludicrous,'' she said. ``Ask him (Johnson)
to provide proof of who has left. I'd love to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Searight's God's Property (which she says includes 55
members) continues to perform. Yes, she says, merchandise with
God's Property's name on it (baseball caps, T-shirts, posters and
more) has been sold at some concerts, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that there are plans for B-Rite to put out a God's
Property CD sometime in the future _ if Franklin signs on. The
group, he says, will include members who have left Searight's
group.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYBODY LOSES
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there are only two facets of the case that both
sides can agree on. One is that not putting out a GP CD for so long
is costing the group valuable momentum and will no doubt hurt
future sales. The other is that an out-of-court settlement is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Searight says she has not spoken to Kirk Franklin in some
time, but that if she saw him tomorrow in the mall, she'd want to
talk to him, and she hopes he feels the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'd still be cordial with each other,'' she said.
``He used to call me `Mother Searight.' We've never had a problem
speaking with each other. This is business.''

ANTI-PREJUDICE GROUP ADOPTS A MORE INCLUSIVE NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's best-known organizations for fighting
religious prejudice, the National Conference of Christians and
Jews, has changed its name.
</P>
<P>
   The new name, the National Conference for Community and Justice,
will better reflect the religious and racial diversity of America,
said Emily Trantham, executive director of the Fort Worth chapter
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a new name, but we have the same mission,'' said
Trantham. ``We are still trying to promote understanding and
respect among religious groups.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the organization will still have the same
initials: NCCJ.
</P>
<P>
   Trantham said the growing religious diversity in America that
includes world religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism was
one factor in the name change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name had become a barrier, because some people felt left
out,'' she said. ``If there is one word the NCCJ stands for, it is
`inclusion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1927, the NCCJ has expanded from its
original focus on building interfaith understanding to also
nurturing interracial and intercultural understanding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Conference of Christians and Jews was founded,
the Ku Klux Klan was spreading hatred against Jews. Also,
anti-Catholic sentiment was present in the country. Al Smith was
maligned for his Catholic faith during his unsuccessful campaign
for the U.S. presidency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A ``Trios'' program was developed in the early years of the
local organization, in which a Catholic, a Protestant and a Jew
would go into public schools and discuss their beliefs, Trantham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the local group sponsors many projects aimed at increasing
religious, racial and cultural understanding. It honors local
individuals who fight prejudice at a Brotherhood-Sisterhood Banquet
each spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Muslim-Jewish-Christian dialogue was held at
University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the local NCCJ sponsors an ``Anytown Texas'' project in
which high-school students participate in intercultural and
interracial workshops. The local group recently completed its
annual seminarians conference at Laity Lodge near Kerrville in
Central Texas. Students from Protestant and Catholic seminaries in
Texas and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles discussed
differences in their faiths.

LAWYERS SEE GOP RISKS IN CALLING WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When courtroom experts hear the GOP drumbeat for
witnesses to bolster their impeachment case against President
Clinton, they frequently recall this adage: Be careful of what you
ask for, because you might get it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that most lawyers think the Republican strategy is
wrong. Indeed, they generally agree that calling witnesses, which
Democrats on the whole oppose, probably constitutes the House
prosecutors' sole chance of winning their case for ousting Clinton.
At the same time, they believe it is a high-risk gamble that has at
least as much chance of backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because three of the major players whose
testimony is sure to be sought _ Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., and Betty Currie _ seem at least as likely as not to
try to fashion their comments to favor the president. All three
underwent bruising examinations from the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, and his team of attorneys, so most observers
doubt there is much damaging information left to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am firmly of the view that the testimony of all of these
witnesses is, on balance, going to help the president,'' said Bruce
Yannet, a New York lawyer who worked for special prosecutor
Lawrence E. Walsh during the Iran-Contra investigation. ``They've
never been questioned by anyone remotely friendly to the president
before, so all the bad stuff's already out there. All that's left
is the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Many defense attorneys, former prosecutors, and legal scholars
agreed with that assessment. And some said the risk being taken by
House managers transcends a defeat on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that a majority of voters, already weary of the
long-running impeachment drama and opposed to congressional action
against Clinton from the start, would demonstrate their disapproval
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the biggest danger is to the Republican Party,''
said Norman Zalkind, a defense lawyer in Boston who nevertheless
said he thought the GOP's pursuit of witnesses was a solid
strategic decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they really come up with something big from one of
these witnesses, people outside the beltway are going to say: `Why
are you extending this? What are you doing?' I think it could be a
disaster for them,'' Zalkind said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton's Republican critics also could be
vindicated, and presumably could score big electoral points, if
they use witnesses to demonstrate that the president deserves to
lose his job because he committed perjury and executed an illegal,
elaborate scheme to obstruct justice. And, as outlined in the Starr
report and in the House prosecutors' presentation last week, all
three of the key witnesses have given testimony that casts the
president in an unfavorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a former federal prosecutor, said he believes
the gamble is worthwhile because it will pay off. In particular, he
said careful questioning of Lewinsky, Currie, and Jordan _ even if
it does not produce any bombshells _ could vividly demonstrate that
Clinton repeatedly tried to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he asserted, the president tried to silence
witnesses in a civil trial by giving gifts to Lewinsky and
arranging for Jordan to find her a job, and influence the testimony
of others by trying to reshape Currie's memories about events
surrounding his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there can always be a surprise,'' diGenova added. ``Could
it be one that rebounds against the prosecution? Sure. But it could
also demolish the president, which is why neither he nor the
Democrats want to call witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prosecutors may be taking less of a risk than it might
initially appear if they win their effort to secure live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Before any witnesses would testify on the Senate floor,
depositions would be taken _ as they are in most civil and criminal
cases _ so House lawyers and the president's attorneys could
determine what the potential witnesses have to say. Since the
Senate has agreed it will vote on approving the appearance of
witnesses, the GOP majority presumably could keep Lewinsky, Currie,
Jordan, or anyone else from testifying if their accounts don't
further the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican senators might decide against live testimony
because of the risks, according to the legal analysts. They agreed
that Lewinsky, because of her emotional involvement with the
president, presented a particularly nettlesome choice for senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be like a tornado hitting the Senate floor,'' Yannet
said. ``It's totally unpredictable who will be left standing after
she finishes testifying.''

A CHANCE FOR TRUTH  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL WILL APPEAR IN THE JAN. 19 ARIZONA REPUBLIC)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Tonight President Clinton will talk to a nation that
has grown weary of the sex scandal undermining his presidency but
seems still smitten by the man and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   That contradiction is reflected in the surreal scene that is the
stage for Bill Clinton's State of the Union address. Already
impeached by the House and standing trial in the Senate, Clinton
will address a joint session of lawmakers _ men and women who also
happen to be his accusers and his jurors _ as well as a public to
whom he has lied.
</P>
<P>
   As bizarre as it will be, tonight is an opportunity for Clinton
to make some amends, and to spotlight policy priorities for 1999.
For the moment, he can draw strength from the knowledge that the
Senate lacks the votes to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Though that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's poll numbers remain obscenely high, reflecting a
roaring economy and a nation without soldiers dying in rice paddies
or desert sands. Depending on the survey, about 60 percent of
Americans want him to stay in office and 87 percent say he's doing
a good job _ this despite the fact that eight of 10 Americans
believe Clinton lied to the grand jury and more than half say they
don't respect him as a person. His support is like the Rio Grande _
a mile wide and an inch deep.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to tonight, Clinton said he'd not address
the ongoing impeachment trial during his speech. ``I think the
American people have heard about that quite extensively over the
last year,'' he said. ``My instinct is that I should do their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   We think that would be a mistake. The character of the man is
every bit as important as a foreign or domestic policy initiative,
and Clinton owes the country something more than indolence and
continued ducking of responsibility for his behavior. The office of
the presidency has been despoiled by Clinton's sordid behavior and
his lack of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an overly partisan House backfired against
Republicans. Confidence in our elected officials is at a historic
low.
</P>
<P>
   How should the president proceed tonight?
</P>
<P>
   We offer three suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   1. Talk about the impeachment, briefly and honestly. Try a
little candor, stir in a bit of humility. Accept responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   2. Be brief. We don't need to hear a 75-minute laundry list of
past accomplishments and new initiatives _ many of which have been
leaked in recent days and many of which you are too weakened as a
chief executive to push through.
</P>
<P>
   3. Single out the most important of your proposals for emphasis.
Rescuing Social Security. Keeping the military strong. Putting more
cops on the street. Making long-term health care affordable for
families. Helping communities to set aside open space. Better
education for our children.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these proposals addresses a need. They matter. These are
real life issues that confront Americans, and the people want to
hear what their impeached president has to say. &QL;

AMERICA'S CHRONIC CARE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like anyone who has lived more than 76 years, Leonard Rallo has
accumulated many identities: decorated World War II pilot,
businessman, husband, father, grandfather, dogged survivor of a
stroke that left him paralyzed on the right side. But right now,
Rallo feels mostly like a casualty of Uncle Sam's decision to
retrench on paying for home care help.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't ask for much. ``I need someone to help me get out of
bed in the morning, take a shower, and get dressed,'' Rallo says in
the labored speech he has struggled hard to regain after the
stroke. ``And I need to have someone put me to bed at night. I
can't do that myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither can Anne Rallo, his wife of 52 years, because Leonard
weighs about 200 pounds, and she has a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Until last September, Medicare paid for a health aide who
enabled Rallo to function at home. But strict new limits on
Medicare payments for home care _ part of a drive to balance the
federal budget and curb perceived abuses by home care providers _
have forced home care agencies to slash patients from their
rosters, reserving help for only the most medically needy.
</P>
<P>
   Rallo is one of nearly 9,000 Bay State elders kicked out of
Medicare's home care program in the past year. That in turn forces
states that pay for home care for some residents to put strict
limits on how many cases they take on and how much care they
provide.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, ``refugees'' from Medicare have driven up
state home-care caseloads 3 1/2 times faster than projected, and
the average cost-per-case is capped at $199.60 a month on average,
or $6.65 a day _ enough to buy about a half-hour of care. But the
Rallos don't even qualify for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for 50 years, paid my taxes, and never asked for
anything,'' he laments. ``Now I need some help, and there's none to
be had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winchester, Mass. couple painfully illustrate the biggest
gap in America's health care system: the lack of a mechanism to pay
for the long-term care that many elders will need at one time or
another. Analysts see no hope of filling that gap in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's ambition to do something about it has shrunk
radically over the past five years, even as its wealth has
ballooned. When President Clinton floated his ill-fated national
health plan in 1994, it included a mechanism to fund long-term care
in the home and community day-care programs (but not nursing homes)
at a projected cost of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a long-term care plan proposed by Clinton this
month would spend a mere $1 billion a year, most of that in a
$1,000 tax refund that would benefit the six out of 10 elders who
have enough income to pay taxes. That would cover about six weeks
of the modest assistance the Rallos need.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, recently enacted Medicare cuts will trim $20 billion
a year from the coverage of other medical needs _ about 10 percent
of the giant program's budget _ leaving elders with less money to
pay for home care on their own. Medicare covers very little home
care, a fact that comes as a shock to many elders who think the
program will help keep them out of the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of offering people a refund on their income taxes to
help pay for long-term care ``is warmed-over many times,'' says Al
Norman of the Massachusetts Home Care Alliance. ``Tax credits help
the wrong people, and there's a lot of red tape involved. It's just
throwing a bone to family caregivers while Congress undercuts
Medicare home health coverage, with White House approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with Norman on tax credits but are more positive
overall about the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It excludes the poor and some of the moderate- and
lower-income people you'd probably want to start with,'' says
Joshua M. Weiner of the Urban Institute. ``But at least it gets
long-term care on the agenda. Most people interested in aging
issues have been frustrated that we've completely ignored long-term
care in this debate we're having on Social Security and Medicare.
It's the third vital component of retirement security and the part
we're least equipped to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $1,000 tax credit, the Clinton plan has three
other components.
</P>
<P>
   --It would leverage federal employees' purchasing power to boost
the growth of private long-term care insurance. If the government
negotiated a premium discount with insurers, Clinton hopes 300,000
government workers would opt to buy such coverage, and corporations
might get interested in offering similar employee-pays-all group
policies.
</P>
<P>
   --The plan would grant states $125 million a year to set up
programs to counsel 250,000 elders and families on long-term care
issues, help them gain access to whatever help is available, and
pay for some ``respite care'' so family caregivers can get out of
the house occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   --The government would mount a $10 million campaign to inform
Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries that the program will not pay
for most long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   That last provision may seem odd _ spending tax dollars to tell
people what Medicare does not cover. But some see a hidden
political purpose: pushing people to buy private long-term care
insurance, stirring up support for a federal program _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's setting the stage for the Gore Administration to
take on long-term care as the next big issues,'' says Robert
Friedland of the National Academy on an Aging Society.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal passes _ a possibility, observers say, since
many of the ideas come from congressional Republicans _ it will
focus unprecedented attention on a type of insurance that most
Americans know little about, and understand less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term care insurance is a very complicated product _ much
worse than auto insurance,'' says Norman, the Massachusetts home
care advocate. ``It's poorly perceived, poorly understood, its
benefits are not clear, and it's fairly expensive. And by the way,
if you have a preexisting condition, you're probably not going to
be able to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to William Kozera, a 74-year-old Hadley
man. A broker tried to sell coverage to his wife Gladys, who
counsels other elders about Medicare and other coverage issues. But
the insurer refused to cover William because of his health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't appeal to me that I would be covered but my husband
wasn't,'' Gladys Kozera says.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care insurance covers a portion of the cost of home
care and nursing home care _ say, $100 toward the daily cost of a
nursing home stay _ and typically kicks in after the subscriber has
paid out-of-pocket for up to a year of care. Coverage can be
unlimited, or it can end after two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing among plans is daunting; one trade group estimates
there are 3,000 variations. Brokers in many states don't have any
special training or certification.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that people should beware of pitches for
inexpensive long-term care policies _ those costing $100 to $400 a
year for people who sign up in their 50s, 60s, and 60s. They don't
cover much, the benefits don't keep pace with inflation, and
subscribers won't get any of their premium money back if they
decide to let the policy lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Good coverage costs plenty, and the price rises rapidly with
age-of-signup: typically $1,700 a year for a 50-year-old, $2,400
for a 60-year-old, $7,400 for a 70-year-old. Clearly, it makes
sense to lock in a rate at a young age _ but that's when people are
paying for children's college and saving for retirement, and the
need for long-term care seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people who have sufficient income and
assets for long-term care insurance to make sense,'' says John
Capitman of Brandeis University. ``If more people bought it, at
some point the price would begin to decline and the quality of the
benefits would increase. Until then, I tell people: Don't buy it.''

SEEING THE LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Why do human beings, and most other creatures on
this planet, have eyes that are tuned to see visible light?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``visible'' light is, by definition, what our eyes
see. But it's more than just a tautological question: Why don't we
see infrared instead, or ultraviolet, or some other segment along
the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation?
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks for decades have been offering up a standard answer to
this question, an answer with the simplicity and aptness of a
Kipling ``Just So'' story: Most of our sun's radiation is in the
form of ``visible'' light, and our eyes evolved to tune in that
range of wavelengths.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice story, but about as accurate as ``How the Camel Got
His Hump,'' says Kenneth Brecher, a professor of physics and
astronomy at Boston University. Brecher discovered the error when
he got curious about the old saw and did some fancy calculations to
test it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sun's radiation, he found, is in the infrared band,
not the visible. So, if the long-held explanation were correct, our
eyes should have evolved to see infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   Brecher presented his findings earlier this month at a meeting
of the American Astronomical Society, in a presentation titled
``Why don't we see in the infrared?''
</P>
<P>
   If we did, our world would look very different. Trees and grass
would shine brightly, skies would be dark and forbidding, and our
veins would show darkly through our skin.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared would also be a very useful kind of light to see by,
especially in dim light, because warm-blooded creatures emit a lot
of it, just as the sun does. Seeing in the infrared would be a
great way for predators to find prey _ and for the prey to see the
predator coming. So why don't our eyes work that way?
</P>
<P>
   It may be, Brecher speculates, that there is no effective
biochemical system that would allow eyes to work in the infrared,
the way the chemistry of our eyes works for visible light.
</P>
<P>
   Vision relies on molecules of a substance in the retina called
rhodopsin. Each rhodopsin molecule can absorb photons and convert
their energy into a chemical change, triggering the sensation of
vision in the brain. But, as far as Brecher has been able to
determine, there isn't a molecule around that would work the same
way with infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of different creatures do have different peak
sensitivities, Brecher says, extending through parts of the
``visible'' range (some with the ability to distinguish colors and
some without it), and in some cases _ bees, for example _ extending
into the ultraviolet. But he knows of no animals whose vision is
most sensitive in the infrared.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes do have infrared sensors that they use to help them find
warm-blooded prey, but this is not in any way a sense of vision. It
is more like a sense of smell or touch, Brecher said, giving them
only a rough indication of direction, rather than an image.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, even plants do not take advantage of the
maximum energy from the sun. Chlorophyll absorbs most of its solar
energy from the red part of the spectrum (leaving the green light
to be reflected), rather than from the infrared.
</P>
<P>
   So, Brecher speculates, perhaps there are no chemical processes
that would allow eyes, or plants, to respond toinfrared _ or, if
there are, maybe evolution failed to discover them.
</P>
<P>
   But if most of the sun's energy is in the form of infrared
light, how come nobody has noticed this before now? Shouldn't that
be a simple thing to measure?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. Many textbooks, including some recent, widely
used ones, repeat the old explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abell's Exploration of the Universe,'' a college astronomy
text whose most recent edition was published in 1995, says: ``It is
surely no coincidence, but rather a consequence of evolutionary
adaptation, that human eyes are most sensitive to electromagnetic
radiation at those wavelengths at which the sun puts out the most
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy arose from a subtlety in how the calculations to
determine the sun's peak output are done, Brecher found.
</P>
<P>
   The different kinds of light, and all the rest of the spectrum
of electromagnetic radiation that includes radio waves, x-rays, and
gamma rays, as well as visible, ultraviolet and infrared light, are
essentially all the same thing _ although physicists have a hard
time pinning down exactly what that thing is.
</P>
<P>
   All these forms of electromagnetic radiation can be thought of
as waves, vibrating with a certain wavelength (the distance from
the peak of one wave to the next). Or they can be thought of as
particles, known as photons, which are described by their frequency
_ a number that is inversely proportional to the wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two ways of measuring light are interchangeable,
nobody worried much about which way the light was being measured.
It's much easier to measure directly the wavelength of light than
its frequency, however, so that's how scientists tend to do it.
</P>
<P>
   But, in this case, Brecher found, the way you measure it really
does make a difference. When computed using wavelength, the sun's
peak emission is indeed in the visible range, somewhere in the
green part of the spectrum. But when computed using frequency, the
peak comes out where it really belongs, out in the infrared.
</P>
<P>
   How could this be? Part of the problem is in the way the peaks
are figured, in one case averaging the output per unit of
wavelength, in the other case per unit of frequency. Because the
units themselves change as you move along the spectrum, the size of
the ``bins'' in which emission is being counted changes.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if you were counting how many tennis balls could be
piled up into boxes, but the boxes were different sizes. It would
take more balls to fill wider boxes than to fill a narrow box to
the same height.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a wider range of wavelengths, it takes more
photons to bring the peak up to the same height; plotting the sun's
emissions this way distorts the result.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Brecher found, frequency really is the correct way
to do the measurement. While light can be thought of as either
waves or particles, depending on the circumstances, in this case it
makes more sense to think of particles. That's because the way the
eye responds depends on the number of photons that strike the
retina.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like so much scientific mumbo-jumbo, but scientists
who listened to Brecher explain his conclusions at the astronomy
meeting agreed that he indeed had seen the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's saying there is perfectly logical,'' said Charles
Townes, a Nobel laureate in physics and professor at the University
of California, Berkeley. ``Our eye detects quanta,'' that is, units
of radiation, or photons. ``His argument on wavelength versus
frequency is completely valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Townes added that since the old explanation was wrong and it
turns out we don't take advantage of the sun's greatest output,
that leaves open the question of why our eyes evolved the way they
did. ``We don't know enough about evolution to know for sure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sun's peak radiation is not the only part of the puzzle. For
instance, what we often see is not direct sunlight, but light
filtered through clouds. And that light has a different peak.
</P>
<P>
   On a cloudy day, the light we see by is much more blue. So
perhaps our eyes evolved as a compromise among the different kinds
of light we are exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer is, it is clear that the standard
explanation is wrong. Now we just have to wait for all the
textbooks to catch up.

THE ANTI-SEMITISM THE WEST IGNORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalists no longer ignore anti-Semitism in high places; this
century has made grimly clear what can happen when Jew-haters come
to power.
</P>
<P>
   In the czar's day, anti-Jewish outbursts in the Duma provoked
little comment in the West. Today they make the morning papers in
London and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When General Albert Mashakov, a Communist member of the Russian
parliament, railed against Jews last fall _ ``To the grave with all
the Yids!'' he exclaimed to one audience _ reporters on both sides
of the Atlantic took note. The Guardian described the degeneration
of the Russian left into a ``primitive, pre-revolutionary
nationalism,'' reminding its readers of the long history of
murderous Russian pogroms. The Washington Post caught Mashakov's
call for a Jewish quota and observed that Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist leader, was standing by him.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Pat Buchanan's ugly innuendo that America was
dragged into the Gulf War by Israel's ``amen corner in the United
States'' _ i.e., American Jews _ was much discussed during his
presidential campaigns. Coming on top of a long history of
defending accused Nazi war criminals and minimizing the Holocaust,
his remarks convinced many voters that he was anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism needn't even be current to be newsworthy.
Jean-Louis Roux, Quebec's lieutenant governor, resigned in disgrace
in 1996 after it was discovered that decades earlier he had worn a
swastika on his sleeve and joined demonstrations that targeted
Jewish shops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be false to say that all anti-Semitism by leading
figures draws attention in the West. For there is almost no
reporting on the dominant source of contemporary Jew-hatred: the
Arab/Muslim world. This lack of interest is perplexing since the
Arab-Israeli ``peace process'' gets covered in detail. American and
European journalists pay great attention to the Arab world's
diplomatic dealings with the Jewish state; how odd that they pay
almost none to what Arabs and Muslims actually say about Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism is peddled openly in the Arab world, crude filth
on a par with anything Der Sturmer ever printed. With this twist:
In addition to perpetuating every anti-Jewish Nazi canard and
insult, right down to illustrations that portray Jews as bearded,
big-nosed, pot-bellied demons, Arab anti-Semites also accuse Jews
of being _ Nazis!
</P>
<P>
   Consider some recent items in the Egyptian media.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in the magazine October, a state-controlled weekly,
depicts a smirking Benjamin Netanyahu relaxing as he props himself
up on two chairs _ one labeled ``USA,'' the other marked with a
swastika. In Al-Ahram, the leading Egyptian daily newspaper,
Netanyahu appears in a Nazi uniform, beating a wardrum emblazoned
with Jewish stars. Muhammad al-Sayeed, a former ambassador, writes
an article proposing a Museum of Zionist Crimes. ``The crimes of
the Jews,'' he declares, ``are worse than the crimes of the
Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism in Egypt is worth focusing on for two reasons: (1)
Egypt is the largest, and in many ways the most influential, Arab
state. (2) It has been at peace with Israel for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 Camp David treaty, Israel relinquished the Sinai
Peninsula in exchange for normalized relations. Israel kept its end
of the deal, but the Egyptians never came through. To this day
blind prejudice against Jews is routine. Egypt's trade unions
forbid contact with Israel. The Jewish state's ambassador to Egypt
is ostracized. Israeli exhibitors have been barred from the
international book fair beginning in Cairo next week. ``I, like
millions of Egyptians, can't bear anything Jewish,'' writes the
editor of Mayo, the newspaper of the ruling party. ``The Jews are a
nation famous for arrogance and fanaticism.''
</P>
<P>
   One cannot make sense of Arab-Israeli relations without taking
this naked bigotry into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews are a tribe of treaty-breakers,'' says the sheikh of
Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost university. ``The Jew is by nature
treacherous. They are the slayers of the prophets, against whom
Allah will fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient well-poisoning libel lives on in Egypt; the
government-controlled press routinely issues alarums about hospital
blood that Israelis have contaminated with AIDS. The blood libel
lives on, too. In November, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Shaab
published the details of how Jews kill Christians for religious
reasons (``The blood is gathered in a jar. These jars are brought
on Passover and Purim to the leading rabbi, who blesses the blood.
Then they mix the blood together with flour to make matzah.
Afterward, the matzah is distributed to God-fearing Jews and they
eat it with an appetite.'').
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian opinion-makers put Jews behind every misfortune. The
massacre of 60 tourists at Luxor in 1997, Al Ahram suggested, was
the doing of Jews. It asserted last fall that ``the Jews have been
behind all wars, and their goal was corruption and destruction.''
Salama Ahmed Salama, the paper's sophisticated editor, approvingly
quotes an Egyptian author: ``There is a great Jewish plot to gain
control of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is not atypical; such stuff percolates throughout the
Middle East. Even the Palestinians, Israel's current ``peace''
partners, traffic in the grossest anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Jew-hatred is a danger sign: Wherever it flourishes, barbarism
follows. There is no excuse for this oldest of bigotries. There is
no excuse for ignoring it, either.

EXAMINING RACISM, STEP BY STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was tension in the hot, Southern summer air as 60 walkers
on a pilgrimage to retrace slavery trekked through a small Alabama
town.
</P>
<P>
   With each step, there were more stares from white locals. The
multicultural group of walkers, which started out from
Massachusetts in June, was aware that the state had been a racial
battlefield during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The
walkers worried they wouldn't be accepted there.
</P>
<P>
   They were right, but the discrimination they eventually faced
didn't come from the white onlookers, but from members of a black
church. The church leaders had promised to put them up for the
night, but sent word that there was no room for ``heathens,''
recalled several walkers.
</P>
<P>
   The walkers _ Japanese Buddhist monks and Christians, both black
and white _ were all participants in an ongoing trip called the
Interfaith Pilgrimage of the Middle Passage. The chilly reception
from the black church in Alabama was just one in a series of
strange, yet enlightening, twists in their odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The trip's purpose, in theory, was to address racism in America
by tracing in reverse the treacherous route of the trans-Atlantic
slave trade through which an estimated 11 million Africans were
sold in Europe, the United States, Caribbean nations, and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But according to participants, the journey, which is scheduled
to end in South Africa in May, became something more. They say it
developed into an internal examination that forced them to confront
their own prejudices through the actions of others and compelled
them to deal with racial tensions among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions were going to impede the trip so we had a strong
incentive to work out problems,'' said Skip Schiel, a photographer
from Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, the walkers, some of them wearing long dredlocks
and others with shaved heads _ passed through Boston during an
early stage of the pilgrimage, which is designed to take them 2,400
miles on foot. Chanting and carrying African flags, they were to
walk along state roads, cross the Northeast, journey through the
Deep South, and end the American leg on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   As in the larger society the group was examining, the problems
that arose between black and white pilgrims on their journey
centered on issues of white privilege and black resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a microcosm of this society that we are trying to
change, so it has been very, very interesting and grueling _ both
emotionally and psychologically. It has been a real Middle Passsage
experience,'' said Ingrid Askew, who is black and one of the two
organizers of the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Schiel, 58, who is white, believed the walk would
give him the opportunity to witness the struggles of
African-Americans while offering support to the black walkers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he found himself resented by black female
walkers who believed that as a white man he tried to assume
leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pained me to be accused of exhibiting white privilege,'' he
said. ``So I drew back, the typical white thing to do is draw
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Soul Brown, a 38-year-old black woman from Boston's Roxbury
neighborhood, saw things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who chronicled the journey in a series of articles for
the Globe, said the trip was a sacred time for the black
participants to grapple with their ancestors' suffering as well as
to look within for their own racism.
</P>
<P>
   The only way the black walkers knew how to do this, said Brown,
was to come together, which caused white participants to feel
excluded. But those same white walkers, said Brown, wanted to see
blacks as victims, but not look at themselves as perpetrators or
beneficiaries of a racist system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was a question of why are you here? How could you
disavow your own involvement? This created a lot of tension,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But African-Americans, too, were reluctant to deal with their
own issues, such as the need to be seen as distinct from other
blacks who were not American-born, said Trinidad native Jennifer
Ire. ``This pilgrimage threw up a whole lot of mirrors for us to
look at ourselves and to look at how we live with each other,''
said Ire of New Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a point I began to ask myself,'' said Schiel `` `Why am I
going on this pilgrimage with these people to Africa?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If he felt uncomfortable during the black-led ceremonies on the
pilgrimage, then he questioned how would he feel in Ghana at the
site of the infamous slave castles.
</P>
<P>
   The numbing pain of self-evaluation was coupled with the
physical strain of walking 20 to 30 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   Askew usually traveled a few states ahead of the group to find
churches where they could sleep. Despite her efforts, there were
times the weary walkers had no idea where they would spend the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we would have a bed, sometimes we would have floor,
sometimes we would sleep on concrete, sometimes it was outside of
the church,'' said Askew.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, they would rise early to visit historical
landmarks such as a former slave shack in the back of a suburban
New York home.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until they reached the Carolinas, said Brown, that
they felt they had reached a turning point. Previously, she said
they had traveled through northern cities and suburbs, but now they
were crossing sprawling cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the South where they could witness remnants of the
civil rights movement: In Greensboro, N.C., they sat at the
Woolworth's counter where in 1960 four African-American students
staged a sit-in that proved to be one of the key moments of the
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, Ga., Ramona ``Nosapocket'' Peters, a Wampanoag Indian
from Mashpee, traced a painful segment of her own history. It was
the birthplace of her grandmother, who was part Cherokee Indian,
African-American, and white. But Peters, 47, said her grandmother,
who was very light-skinned, placed lesser value on darker-skinned
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was learned behavior and I got to see where she learned
it,'' said Peters. ``Knowing the damage internalized racism can do
to a family, I wanted to find the medicine to cure it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who calls herself a ``black Indian,'' was now able to
leave the journey, but as other walkers crossed the Georgia border
to Alabama, the theme of internal racism would come up again.
</P>
<P>
   When they entered the small town of Heflin, Ala., there were
stares and a few motorists screamed racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``pointers'' on the trip directed them with a map to the
church, say pilgrims, they believed only when they reached the
church would they be embraced. But they never got that far.
</P>
<P>
   Some later said the black church members wouldn't accept whites
or Buddhist walkers. Others believed they were afraid that such a
diverse group would stir up trouble with local whites.
</P>
<P>
   Church members who disagreed with the decision to leave the
group stranded found them an abandoned home to stay in and food.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown and other African-Americans, the reaction of the
church members forced them to realize that blacks sometimes exhibit
the same attitudes they have fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forced us to look deep within ourselves for racism,'' said
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ire: ``It was sad. It showed that some blacks had also
absorbed some of the hatred that had been thrown to them and now
they were throwing it back.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the group arrived in New Orleans, Schiel had decided
not to continue with the group to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to go,'' he said. ``But, I learned I have to be
much more sensitive about using white privilege and I thought I
knew something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 walkers remained on the pilgrimage _ most of them
black.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they couldn't find a boat to sail to Africa, but
someone loaned them one. They are now in Puerto Rico. The lack of
funds to continue is still a big problem, said Askew, who is in
Boston to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Brown left Puerto Rico last week to take a job in
television in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as a person I have grown tremendously and have seen
things I would never have gotten an opportunity to see in life,''
she said. ``But things were not always perfect. All the problems in
society with blacks and whites, all these things appeared and rose
up during the course of the pilgrimage.''

 N.H. CAMPAIGN FOR ACTIVISTS IN HIGH GEAR
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Christine Miller is a political activist with
serious credentials. She cut her teeth with Jimmy Carter in 1976.
She organized four counties for Michael Dukakis in 1988. And she
chaired this city's Democratic Party for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lists,'' Miller said, with just a trace of bravado.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Miller, and several hundred others like her around
the state, are the focus of a heated competition. Of the dozen or
so potential Democratic and Republican candidates for president,
each one needs an army of volunteers to compete in the 2000 New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates send birthday cards, visit frequently, ask for
advice, and generally try to flatter their way into these
activists' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   In return, people who decide to support a candidate actively
host coffees in their homes so their friends and neighbors can meet
the politician. They escort the candidate to political events, they
call and write to other voters, and they get out the vote on
Election Day. Many times, a New Hampshire activist can help a
politician navigate the peculiar byways and biases of the state.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the contest, most Republican players are waiting
to see who is going to run for president before they commit to any
of the candidates. The possible entry of Texas Governor George W.
Bush and former Red Cross director Elizabeth Dole has effectively
frozen the field.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, most of the state's elected officials
and party leaders have committed to Vice President Al Gore,
although there is a subtle buzz for Bill Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator. And Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry has one
grass-roots activist publicly supporting him _ Rockingham County
Democratic chairman Bill Verge.
</P>
<P>
   Organization is one of three important planks in any successful
New Hampshire presidential effort. The other two: money and a
message. A strong organization with skilled activists in each of
the state's 10 counties can give a candidate a boost in the
beginning and at the end of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the organization to make yourself credible,'' said
Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican who praises Lamar
Alexander for being far ahead of the pack in attracting prime
players. (Gregg himself is uncommitted.)
</P>
<P>
   And after obtaining initial credibility, an organization can
make the difference between winning and losing by a few hundred
votes, said Thomas D. Rath, an attorney and a major Republican
figure here.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, when there's snow and freezing rain and
it's 27 degrees and turnout is smaller than expected, you need to
have the organization to pull it out for you,'' said Rath, an
attorney who is marshaling Alexander's forces and helping to devise
his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Zeliff is just the sort of person any Republican candidate
longs to snag. Like Christine Miller, he is a party leader with
lists. He is also a lobbyist and former member of Congress from
Jackson, up in the White Mountains, and took two years off from
running his Christmas Farm Inn to help George Bush win the primary
in 1988. In 1996, Zeliff worked for Bob Dole, although the
then-Senate majority leader struggled for a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Zeliff is taking a wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who is going to be in the field at this point,''
he said. Bush has yet to arrive on the scene, though he and his
father have sent greetings through a friend. There is excitement
about Elizabeth Dole, but no phone calls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play all of it out,'' Zeliff said. ``And whoever you
pick, you want to pick a winner. And then it's nice to have your
calls returned by the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, the situation is almost completely the
opposite. Gore has locked up scores of state representatives,
senators, county commissioners, mayors, and aldermen. He's even got
the registrar of deeds in Strafford County, Leo Lessard, according
to Joe Keefe, a businessman who is the top Gore organizer in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has assembled his supporters through constant
attention, which is expected to last through Election Day. He
calls, he visits, he sends gifts of federal grants, as well as
invitations to Washington. Anyone elected to just about any office
in the state received a congratulatory phone call from Gore the day
after the election.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes he calls just to chat. That was the case back in
July 1977 with Miller, a psychotherapist and political activist.
She was home with her daughter waiting to hear from the
veterinarian to find out if a horse they wanted to buy was in good
shape.
</P>
<P>
   When the phone rang, both Miller and her daughter, Elizabeth
Miller Brown, picked up on the line. Instead of the vet, it was
Gore. When he heard about the suspenseful situation, he began to
talk to Elizabeth about horses, and asked if she had picked out a
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she just didn't know what to name him and he said,
`Well, the Pathfinder rockets are supposed to land on Mars
tomorrow. If the rocket and the horse both make it, why don't you
name it Pathfinder?' '' Miller recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter loved the idea, and now the chestnut-colored
quarterhorse is named Pathfinder.
</P>
<P>
   Up until that moment, Miller said she really did not know Gore,
other than to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just endeared to him by this charming and
down-to-earth and just person-to-person conversation he had with
our daughter,'' said Miller, who is supporting Gore along with her
husband, Michael Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gore, the other potential Democratic candidates have
little by way of organization. But a few activists are still in
play.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Demers, a Concord lobbyist, is supporting Richard A.
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader. However, most people believe
Gephardt will not run for president, and that has made Demers a
very popular man with Bradley and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Monahan is also getting a lot of attention these days. He is
a longtime supporter of Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska senator who
recently decided not to run. ``I'm a lost soul looking for a
candidate,'' said Monahan, another Concord lobbyist active in
Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has picked up most of the big names around the
state, there are stirrings here for Bradley. Lee Nyquist, a
Manchester attorney, recently hosted a meeting for people
interested in the former Knicks basketball star. About two-dozen
people have signed on, according to Bradley's staff, including
Steve DeStefano, a former candidate for the state Senate from Bow,
and Deb Merritt, a former state representative from Strafford
County.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is expected to unveil a list of supporters when he
visits the state at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kerry has made no efforts to organize in New
Hampshire while he decides whether to mount a presidential
campaign. Nevertheless, he said he does not think it is too late to
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are a lot of people in the regular chain of command spoken
for? The answer is yes,'' Kerry said. ``That means you have 100
votes; you still need 49,000 more.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is history to remember. Former Vice President Walter
Mondale racked up all the big-name political leaders here in 1984,
only to lose to Gary Hart. Bob Dole had top Republican officials on
his side, and he lost to Patrick J. Buchanan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have something to say, you can be here for 10
years and it won't matter,'' said Dave Carney, a Republican
political consultant who worked for Dole and recently returned from
Texas, where he ran the lieutenant governor's race.

NEITHER A CRISIS, NOR A TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- This is a week of anniversaries. Harry Truman
was inaugurated 50 years ago, Bill Clinton was inaugurated six
years ago and two years ago. And I celebrate the end of a year of
being Monica-free.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky-Clinton-Tripp-Starr-Hyde scandal staggered on
without my opinion throughout 1998. The reasons will, in the
judgment of peers, probably disqualify me for any position of
trust, honor or profit in the current frenzied state of American
punditry: I don't think it's a crisis and I sympathize with
arguments on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis? As Exhibit A, I submit a press release, numbered 302,
from the National Football League, headlined: ``NFL Football
Outrates Impeachment Coverage.'' On Dec, 19, while the House was
pondering impeachment, CBS coverage of the New York Jets vs. the
Buffalo Bills ``dramatically outrated'' the other networks, stuck
with the slow ground game in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis? House members, after some melodrama, survived their
date with destiny. All but 13, the impeachment managers, have moved
out of camera range.
</P>
<P>
   Any ritual that can stifle 100 senators is solemn and serious,
and therefore no waste of time. The argument that impeachment
disrupts important business is specious. Senators do not lack
information about health care, Social Security or the Brazilian
centavo. What they need is the will to decide. Sitting and thinking
quietly about a tough vote is excellent preparation for such
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis? The person who has kept the scandal from becoming a
crisis is the president himself. Were he to sit whimpering in the
White House or cowering in despair at Camp David, that would be a
crisis. But he is as chatty as ever, wonking on at the drop of a
policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to compartmentalize is admirable and real, in
vivid contrast to that of Richard Nixon. During Watergate, after
Nixon had avoided reporters for five months, he called a press
conference near his home in San Clemente. Waiting under a broiling
sun, Dan Rather of CBS asked me, ``What's the toughest
non-Watergate question you could ask him?'' My response, which
Rather recounted in his memoirs, was: ``Mr. President, what do you
do all day?'' Dan said, ``Oh no, that would be too tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is tougher than Nixon and considerably less culpable.
The conservative animus against Clinton exceeds that of the liberal
fury against Nixon. The anti-Clinton fever of the Vincent Foster
Memorial Society evokes right-wing rumors about Franklin Roosevelt
cackling maniacally in the White House after planning the attack on
Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Nutcakes form a perilously large portion of the Republican
Party's base and have polluted politics. Lying about sex is usually
trivial and hardly seems impeachable. And yet, and yet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be getting a bad deal, but he has dealt many of the
cards himself. ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky,'' the president said in a civil deposition Jan. 17. Some
lawyers have argued that Clinton need not have testified at all,
but should have defaulted the Paula Jones case. Defaulting would be
the political equivalent of taking the Fifth Amendment, other
lawyers have said. So? Was that worse than being impeached?
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's choice, which he faced again seven months
later. In a life of striving, networking and Renaissance
Weekending, he usually talked his way out of everything. Before the
federal grand jury in August, he could have amended his testimony
with something closer to the truth. Had he done so, his poll
ratings would have soared and Kenneth Starr would have packed his
bags for Malibu. Instead, he quibbled about verbs.
</P>
<P>
   To be or not to be. This scandal is neither a crisis nor a
tragedy because Clinton's problem is not animal instinct. Clinton's
tragic flaw is not sexual, but intellectual. Among the seven deadly
sins, pride outpolls lust.

TIPPER GORE HITS ALL THE RIGHT MARKS IN DARTMOUTH VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tipper Gore last week deftly tossed a dart into the bull's-eye
of a whopper of a national issue _ health care and opportunity for
the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there for the millions of Americans with deeply
personal reasons for following this topic. The vice president's
spouse has been a national leader on the issue for years and the
Clinton administration's most important in-house fighter.
</P>
<P>
   But Tipper Gore's dart also announced her presence in New
Hampshire at the outset of this pre-presidential year and made the
powerful point that Hillary Rodham Clinton is not unique but the
pathfinder in a new era.
</P>
<P>
   Since timing is everything in policy and politics, Mrs. Gore's
emergence coincided with a period of increased activity and
visibility by her husband. Al Gore and Bill Clinton, still crazy
after all these years, are at it again, previewing a slew of policy
initiatives on everything from suburban sprawl to community
policing, whose positive reception clashes with the myopia of
impeachment-fixated Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And as if that weren't enough, the activity coincides with two
important shifts in the pre-presidential landscape _ the thinning
of the Democratic Party field in a way that underlines the vice
president's current strength and the return to earth of the
Republican front-runner whom nobody knows, Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Few have noticed, but in the last few months, Gore has ceased
being the double-digit trailer in national polls and now runs even
with Bush, who does no better than another untested,
not-yet-candidate, Elizabeth Dole. And one poll from New Hampshire
even had Dole the Spouse even with Bush the Son among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The early politics is interesting, but what Tipper Gore showed
last week is how naturally the Gores can blend it with substance,
which after all is how real things happen in this country.
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth last week, she was once again the Clinton
administration's mental health policy spokesman, unveiling its
initiatives for the year. They are each breakthroughs:
</P>
<P>
   --The first-ever White House conference on mental health, which
will bring together all the varied segments of a large community
this spring to assess the current state of science, treatment, and
services and to plot the future. These gatherings are often the
catalytic precursors of major change as the Clintons' work on early
childhood development and Social Security reform has already
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   --A presidential directive to the huge federal personnel system
to come up with ways to increase job opportunities for the mentally
ill, most of whom are desparate for the chance to work. Currently,
the rules give the special opportunities to the physically disabled
and the retarded.
</P>
<P>
   --A huge proposed increase in the basic federal program that
funds services for the mentally ill that are delivered through
state governments. Over the last five years, largely thanks to Mrs.
Gore's in-house battling, the efficient use of roughly 15 percent
more money has shown how much more can be done. For next year, she
said the administration wants a 24 percent increase in the basic
block grant to nearly $360 million, the largest spike in federal
aid ever requested.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Gore put it in her speech at Dartmouth, these
initiatives are aimed at a ``vicious cycle'' that has always
characterized mental health policy.
</P>
<P>
   At its core is the disparity in treatment of and attitudes
toward the mentally as opposed to the physically ill. In the face
of science's contribution to our understanding of the biochemical
component of mental illness, even the disparate terms are absurd.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, as Mrs. Gore knows, the great goal of the
mental health community is nothing more, and nothing less, than
parity across the board. Dealing with that challenge squarely, as
she also knows, will be her next big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As with the physically disabled, mental health is a widely
organized world. That makes the political as well as the policy
implications of her work obvious. But it is also a demanding world,
and properly so. Mrs. Gore, and therefore the vice president, will
get a major boost from this world in the months ahead, precisely
because her record and her credentials are so soundly established.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in turn, is the key to understanding the current
strength of Al Gore's looming candidacy, nationally and in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, another vice president (George W. Bush's father)
made it all the way in a purely succession election. Because of his
much more passive role, he had to face near-death experiences in
the early primaries against Bob Dole and well into the fall against
Mike Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   There are no certainties in this game, but Gore's attempt is
much more solidly grounded in his record as well as his political
organization. And the extra dimension was on vivid display last
week in New Hampshire in the person of Tipper Gore.

CHINA'S HOOP PHENOM FACES CAPITALISTIC DILLEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ China should not mourn the loss of Michael Jordan.
After all, it has Yao Ming. At 18, Yao is already playing
basketball head and shoulders _ maybe even half a torso _ above
most other players in China.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he is 7-foot-5.
</P>
<P>
   Yao plays in the Chinese Basketball Association, which draws 130
million television viewers _ as many as watch the Super Bowl _ for
regular season games. Fans of what has become China's most popular
sport are pinning their hopes on the mobile, muscular star of the
Shanghai Sharks to become the first Chinese player to join the
National Basketball Association. And in the new China, there may be
a better chance of that than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Already considered one of the three best professional centers in
China, the high school senior attended Nike's All-America Camp in
Indianapolis last summer, where he ranked second among 40 top high
school centers.
</P>
<P>
   But American college coaches who have called his mother and
approached his managers so far have gotten nowhere. Fame and
fortune may beckon, but the Chinese system dictates that Yao
belongs to his team, his league, and ultimately, his country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rules and values are changing here, perhaps faster in
Shanghai than anywhere else. And Yao's dilemma _ to serve his
country or himself _ illustrates that evolution. To leave China for
big money and better competition would once have been denounced as
unpatriotic and capitalistic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Yao's managers speak almost in passing of duty to the
communist nation. Their bigger concern is the bottom line: How much
money will they be able to get for him when the time comes?
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pop culture has embraced almost everything American,
particularly basketball. NBA games air several times a week on
cable, and the marketing opportunities of a Chinese player in the
NBA would be tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Yao says he is not interested in money and declined to reveal
how much he currently earns. But a team manager says his salary,
like other rookie Chinese players, is $61 a month. That is
supplemented by bonuses from the club, tournament hosts, and the
national team, for which Yao also plays. Even so, the total,
together with free dormitory food and housing, can't approach even
the lowest salaries in the NBA, which are around $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   To play abroad, Yao would need approval from his club, the CBA,
and government authorities, says Yu Xiao Miao, vice general manager
of Shanghai Oriental Television Basketball Club, known to millions
as the Shanghai Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the municipal government of Shanghai is very open-minded,
so they'd never hold him back,'' said Yu. ``And for our club, it's
a commercial decision. He's under contract and we'd like to train
him more. The better he is, the better price we can sell him for.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not that simple. Years of schooling in duty to his
nation and a sense of obligation to the club that has housed and
fed him for the last four years tug at Yao. The amount of food he
has eaten as a teenager would have impoverished his parents, one of
his managers jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about it, but I think it would not be
difficult for me to decide,'' Yao said this week in a rare
interview, when asked whether he would play in the United States if
given the chance. ``If my boss thinks it's good for my development,
I would go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao is on the sidelines now, his size 18 left foot broken and
wrapped in a gigantic cast clad with a sock his mother knitted to
keep him warm in the unheated gym.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if forced to choose between playing in
America or on the Chinese Olympic team, he smiled gently and
skirted the question with a finesse far beyond his age. ``Isn't it
too early to ask that question?''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed again, Yao turned philosophical. ``Whatever you decide,
you lose something,'' he said. ``If I stay in China, I lose the
opportunity to go to the NBA. But if I go to the NBA, I lose the
chance to serve my country. And my country is the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Wayman Strickland, 28, the only American on the Sharks,
said Yao can serve his nation beyond playing for the national team.
The mere chance to become the first Chinese player in the NBA,
Strickland said, would be ``a big deal for China.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent. In 1997, Zheng Haixia, a 6-foot-8 veteran
of China's women's Olympic team, joined the Women's National
Basketball Association in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland believes Yao would be one of the top three picks if
he entered the NBA draft. ``He's got the ability to run up and down
the court, a nice touch, and good basic skills,'' said Strickland.
``Combine that with being almost 7-foot-5, and you've got
tremendous potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Americans couldn't contemplate why he wouldn't just
leave, go to university for a year and then the NBA,'' added
Strickland, a San Francisco native. ``But he'd be leaving
everything. If he went without permission, he couldn't even contact
his family. Here it's family and duty first . . . It's a huge
cultural difference. Everything is a group decision _ you go
through the system and you do what's best for the group, not the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely protected by his team and parents, Yao seems unaffected
by his fame and spends his free time reading Chinese history and
playing computer games on his Sony Playstation. He has been living
in a government sports dormitory since he was 14, when he began
playing for the Shanghai junior team. He became a professional last
season, but still attends school three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Yao started playing basketball at age 9, influenced by his
mother, who is 6-foot-3 and his father, who is 6-foot-7. Both both
played for China's national teams in the 1970s. His favorite player
is Houston Rockets star Hakeem Olajuwon, for his speed and moves.
He admires the Larry Bird-era Boston Celtics for ``creating a new
era in history,'' but politely said the current Celtics are ``not
as good as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao plays basketball for four hours a day and studies for two
hours, in addition to his classes and weekend visits to his
parents. He doesn't have a girlfriend _ ``I don't have time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the Sharks vice general manager, said, ``Although Yao Ming
is a very good person, he is not yet a member of the Communist
Youth League. But he actually plays a far more important role on
the team than the Communist Youth League members.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu added, ``He also knows our team needs him and he needs to
develop the basics. If he goes to America now, he might just be
sitting on a cold bench.''

FROM NOW ON, VOTES ON LABOR WILL COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As part of its aggressive new agenda for this legislative
year, the Massachusetts AFL-CIO has developed a more comprehensive
report card and tougher tests for members of the Legislature. No
longer, says state AFL-CIO President Robert Haynes, will
legislators be graded only on their voting record on labor bills.
This year, legislators will also be held accountable for other
important aspects of labor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Haynes says, ``we had labor endorsements
predicated on the legislators' voting record, and often times those
votes were not truly reflective of the legislators' actions
regarding labor.'' While some had very good voting records on
issues important to labor's agenda, ``they really didn't carry the
full agenda. For example, they were not actively involved in moving
legislation out of committee and onto the floor. We are now going
to hold legislators accountable in that area also,'' among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, a legislator votes against bringing a labor
bill out of their committee, that legislator will get a negative
mark from the AFL-CIO. Legislators will also be scored on how well
they serve labor in their communities, including the level of their
support on organizing drives to bring more workers into unions, and
their commitment toward protecting workers and working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that legislators will work to defend employees when
employers go after them,'' Haynes says. ``We also hope that they
actively support efforts for good wages and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The state AFL-CIO's more aggressive approach toward lawmakers is
its response to the number of times that bills addressing labor's
needs were left to languish in committee, including legislation to
increase the minimum wage and protect wages of construction
workers.
</P>
<P>
   While the new approach will apply broadly to both House and
Senate, it is no secret that labor advocates view House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran as the key reason important labor bills never
left committees or came to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, rather than repeat past attempts to work with
Finneran _ which routinely failed _ the AFL-CIO and other labor
groups have decided to take their agenda directly to the
legislators. Some legislators _ despite these new, tougher measures
of accountability _ support this direct approach. They, too, have
been frustrated by what they view as the House leadership's lack of
support for bills filed by organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach will be tested in the coming weeks as the
AFL-CIO launches a campaign in support of labor-friendly
legislation, new and old. Included are bills that increase the
state's minimum wage; enhance paid family and medical leave;
provide money to renovate or expand schools; ensure severance pay
for workers involved in a plant closing or relocation; improve
workers compensation benefits; and enforce stricter child labor
laws.
</P>
<P>
   To bring more public attention to these bills, the AFL-CIO said
it will organize letter drops, develop phone banks and work closely
with local clergy and community-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Other labor groups have also adopted a similar approach. In a
recent letter to state representatives, Painters &AMP; Allied Trades
District Council 35 informed the legislators of a new policy
``regarding contribution requests from House members.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the local's new policy, money that was once given to
candidates will be used instead to finance the cost of mailing to
union members their state representatives' position on labor
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The letter stresses this policy applies only to members of the
House, and not the Senate. Explaining why the focus is only on the
House, the letter's author, John Lauglin, director of political and
public relations for the Painters Council, said, ``for the very
simple reason that in the Senate, President Tom Birmingham has
allowed votes on our bills. In the House, Speaker Tom Finneran
decides for everybody else the fate of a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   While some state legislators have expressed their resentment
with the AFL-CIO's and other labor groups' aggressive new approach
toward them, others say the policy is the best way to get important
labor bills passed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of years many House members have felt
that the legislative agenda was too tightly controlled from the
top,'' said Senator Steven Tolman, a Brighton Democrat and a strong
advocate of labor who, after serving two terms in the House, was
elected this year to the Senate seat vacated by his brother,
Warren, who ran for lieutenant governor with Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is some risk involved in organized labor's new
approach to Beacon Hill, particularly in the House. Finneran, who
determines committee assigments and chairmanships, may be willing
to test his leadership strength against organized labor's strength.
Aware that some members might be wary of Finneran's power, Tolman
says in response to any such concerns, ``All you need is a desk and
a phone to do the job properly. If that is what you end up with,
you can be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators who support labor's agenda say they welcome the fact
that they will be held accountable not by the speaker, but by the
people who got them there _ organized labor, workers, and working
families.

STUDY SUGGESTS BASICS FOR E-COMMERCE SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some Web sites get a million visits a day, but
success lies in how to convert those visits into actual on-line
sales to customers who visit again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Archetype Inc. professes to have a solution. The company
recently released a study stating that sales are driven by consumer
confidence in a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is trust and maintaining an ongoing relationship
with customers,'' said Clement Mok, founder of the San
Francisco-based Web site designer. ``It's fine to get one-time
transactions. Everyone's willing to buy once. But how do you
encourage people to go back?''
</P>
<P>
   Studio Archetype's report, which was done in conjunction with
Cheskin Research Inc. of Redwood Shores, Calif., said Web sites
that have six characteristics will engender the most trust from
consumers. The six are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Solid brand-name recognition of the company or product.
</P>
<P>
   _ Easy navigation. If customers have to click too many times to
get what they need, they will likely get frustrated and not want to
call up the site again. Customers also get frustrated if they click
on links that don't exist or don't work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good customer service. Sites must state how merchandise orders
are processed, how orders will be delivered, and how customers can
return products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good presentation of information.
</P>
<P>
   _ State-of-the-art technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seals of approval. The survey found that consumers were more
apt to buy from Web sites that had the logos of security and
privacy endorsers, like VeriSign and TrustE, on their pages. Logos
for major credit card companies that have contracts with the site
also made consumers more comfortable about buying from that site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Web sites have these signs, it means they're legitimate
sites,'' said Davis Masten, a principal at Cheskin Research.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been plenty of attention on security and
privacy in Web site transactions, Masten said those issues were
part of the bigger consumer trust issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken trust to reliability,'' he said. ``It says what (a Web
site) is going to do and not misrepresent itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Studio Archetype clients have found the company's six-point
model useful.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. said Studio Archetype's
redesign of its main Web site had dramatically improved business.
</P>
<P>
   Rakesh Sapra, director of interactive marketing at UPS, said his
company's Web site _ www.ups.com _ went from tracking 100,000
orders per month in 1995 to about 1 million trackings a month due
to better site navigation and overall design.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet analysts took issue with some of the findings and
the methodology of the study by Studio Archetype and Cheskin.
</P>
<P>
   Erina DuBois, digital commerce analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San
Jose, Calif., said Web sites with seals of approval did not hold
more sway with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of consumers don't read about privacy stuff,'' she said.
In addition, DuBois said, ``Certificates, like VeriSign, are not in
wide use. Most consumers don't know what VeriSign is.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other five components outlined in the report, DuBois
said they were ``basic, 101, Web site stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But she strongly agreed that Web site customer service is going
to become more and more critical in doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know, how do I handle returns? Whom do I call
if I have a return? Is there an 800 number, e-mail, fax?'' DuBois
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many consumers don't have an easy way of returning items or
getting more information on line, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will have to be integrated at the back end,''
DuBois said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she sees e-commerce evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``'97 was like, `Hey here's my site,''' DuBois said. ``'98 was,
`Let's make it easy to buy.' '99 will be customer service. How do I
retain them? Maybe some sites will have a button you can click on
to dial customer service.''

SUSAN CHEEVER LOOKS BACK ON HER DAYS OF GIN AND ROSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
NOTE FOUND IN A BOTTLE 
My Life as a Drinker 
By Susan Cheever. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 192 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tawdriness of writers' private lives is a staple of modern
American letters, and the last decade's trends in pathography and
confessional memoir have taken the field to new levels of both
insight and prurience. If Papa Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald,
too-bright beacons in the early age of celebrity, first revealed to
us the glamorous ruin of too much drink and ego, more recent
revelations about our literary icons tend to travel the territory
of addiction, sexual abuse, and family violence. This is both the
good news and the bad, for oft-stated reasons: good because the
fields of biography and autobiography are no longer constricted by
hypocrisy or puritanical secrecy; bad because the pattern has
encouraged every pot-boiler impulse a lot of mediocre writers ever
had. The subject matter of memoir in the past century has too often
degenerated from the grand and mannered (take Robert Graves's
``Goodbye to All That,'' on the First World War, as a benchmark) to
the small and solipsistic (take Elizabeth Wurtzel's comparison of
her personal struggles to the war in Bosnia). Monica will be next:
As the memoir goes, so goes the nation.
</P>
<P>
   To its own great detriment, Susan Cheever's ``Note Found in a
Bottle: My Life as a Drinker'' belongs more to this purplish school
of au courant tell-all than to its worthy predecessors. A novelist
and the author of two previous books about her family, Cheever
helped usher in the new age of memoir with her 1984 ``Home Before
Dark.'' For all the controversy it raised about some of its
disclosures, that was a lovely story of what it was like to be John
Cheever's daughter: Daughter of the cherished chronicler of postwar
life in affluent America, where the evenings shimmered in Ossining,
N.Y., and the martinis were ice-cold, and the rages were just
another word for incalculable sorrow. We cared about ``Home Before
Dark'' because we cared about Cheever the writer _ his luminescent
prose and his labyrinthine personal struggles. When Cheever fille
followed up a few years later with ``Treetops,'' about her mother
and the extended family tree, we cared less: What with brother Ben
beginning to publish his side of the saga, the Cheevers' collective
disrepair was becoming a cottage industry. Very little in ``Note
Found in a Bottle'' entices us to care at all. And judging merely
from the size and thinness of the content herein, Cheever herself
may suspect that the river has run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Works about the ravages of self-destruction are popular for a
lot of reasons, but they only matter literarily when they have
something to offer beyond the barroom retelling of the ghastly
deed: some psychic scrutiny or stellar prose or greater context for
the author's drive toward despair. Cheever's book possesses none of
these qualities; instead, it relies upon sketchy, anecdotal
reminiscence and a minimalist tone that's supposed to be drop-dead
ironic (see how awful I was?). In post-vino veritas, but the sad
truth recounted here _ I got drunk, I got drunker, I got sober _ is
mired in solipsism and an appalling lack of reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-50s, Cheever got sober in 1991 with the help of
Alcoholics Anonymous (where her father had also found solace,
before he died in 1982). By the end of her drinking she'd been
married three times, had borne two children, had lived abroad, and
had published several books, achieving moderate success as a
writer. She'd also been hit by her first husband, had been driven
half-mad by her third, and had drunk her way through decades of
adultery, deceit, and thoughtless cruelty. She confesses that her
childhood gang used to fill the pockets of younger kids with worms
or gravel, and ``got a kick out of watching them cry for mercy.''
On one page she expresses her disdain for her first husband's
``clinging children''; on another, she recounts the time she helped
a lover send a package of dog feces through the mail to William
Styron, for a bad review he had written. How on earth are we
supposed to like this woman, or even feel sympathetic enough to
tolerate her prose?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's not the sorrows of gin and the havoc it wreaked
that present any problem here; handled well, that miserable story
could have been agonizing and ruminative. Rather, it's Cheever's
tone that's so off-putting: self-important and yet utterly void of
self-awareness. My own pity for her went belly-up when she
described her involvement in the civil rights movement in the South
in the mid-1960s, embalmed in a rich-white-girl's attitude if ever
there was one: ``The civil rights movement is now a part of
history,'' she writes ingenuously, ``but at the time it was a bunch
of us kids from Ivy League colleges, driven by a sense of justice
and a desire to be hip, taking a kind of magical mystery tour of
the third world.'' Well, yes, dear, but it was also a lot of black
people, driven by a tad more than a desire to be hip. After
sleeping and drinking her way through the voter-registration drives
in Alabama and Mississippi, Cheever flew home to New York and took
up with the first man she would marry. ``We explored each other's
bodies inch by inch as if we were discovering a hidden treasure,''
she confides. ``We drank sangria at El Faro and beer at Max's
Kansas City and martinis at the Harvard Club. I was a long, long
way from Meridian, Mississippi.'' You sure were, baby.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade, Cheever left that husband for alternating trysts
with two married men, both of whom she would eventually marry. One
was Calvin Tomkins, the New Yorker art critic and writer, with whom
she had a daughter. It is only with the birth of her first child
that one's heart begins to thaw toward Cheever _ in the moment she
gets out of the way long enough to experience ``the gift of being
able to love.'' She got it again with the birth of her son several
years later, and finally, the love seems to have won out over the
bottomless cruelties of the bottle. She was able to stop drinking,
leave her third husband, rebuild a quiet life that now has room for
dogs and children and God. ``Now I have whole minutes of peace,''
she tells us. ``Sometimes I have entire days of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   I am glad for her, but it took a painful journey over this rocky
landscape for me to find that impulse. I am less glad for some of
the people she names in this book, and for the fact of its
publication. ``Note Found in a Bottle'' is bathed in the bathos of
whiskey and the sins of the past, without ever exhibiting much
distance from either.

GLOBE CRITICS RATE FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
!!!! ``Affliction'' In a career filled with venturesome role
choices, Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career. He plays a
New Hampshire cop trying to liberate himself from the male pattern
of violence inflicted upon him by his brutish and alcoholic father
_ the latter impressively portrayed by James Coburn as human
wreckage still dangerous because he can still do damage.
Writer-director Paul Schrader has made a bleak, piercing, perfectly
pitched film of Russell Banks's novel. (R) 
 
!! ``At First Sight'' Val Kilmer is resourceful and affecting as a
blind man who never courts sympathy as he takes his chances in love
with a sighted woman. As played by Mira Sorvino, she's sympathetic,
too, partly because of the awkwardness and anxiety she expresses.
But the script (based on a true story) and the direction are more
pedestrian, diluting what could have been the film's impact.
(PG-13) 
 
!!! ``The Brandon Teena Story'' The technical roughness and
plainness of this documentary about a homophobic murder in Nebraska
in 1993 make it all the more gripping. Soft-pedaling sensationalism
and editorializing, it depicts a community destined to repeat its
hate-driven patterns of violence because _ to judge by the two men
who killed Brandon Teena so she wouldn't be able to testify aginst
them after they raped her _ denial rules there. (Unrated)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Hilary and Jackie'' The turbulent story of the late
British cellist Jacqueline du Pre, who during the '60s was
classical music's golden girl, and her less celebrated but more
stable sister, Hilary. It's a terrific sister act, thanks to Emily
Watson's bold, daring directness as Jackie, and Rachel Griffiths's
less apparent but more enduring strength in the face of her
sister's increasingly erratic lifestyle before being diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis. (R) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ! ``In Dreams'' Stupid, pointless psychological horror film,
about a woman (Annette Bening) who shares a metaphysical connection
with a serial killer (Robert Downey Jr.). So much wasted talent _
starting with writer-director Neil Jordan, whose career continues
its erratic track. (R) (Renee Graham) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Varsity Blues'' James Van Der Beek brings his patented
take on coming of age (honed weekly as dreamy Dawson on the TV show
``Dawson's Creek'') to the big screen. High-school football is the
backdrop for this sweetly familiar explication of youthful
idealism, wherein the bitterly ambitious adults are taken to task
by the righteously innocent adolescents. Of course, they're not so
innocent that they don't habitually undress, guzzle beer, and swipe
patrol cars. But it's all in the name of small-town Texas fun. (R)

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Backstage before a performance of the musical
``Ragtime'' here, the usual bustle prevails _ but there's also a
jovial spirit, a sort of cheerful chaos. The wardrobe folks whistle
merrily as they comb fresh curls out of wig after wig. Technicians
chatter amiably as they breeze through narrow halls. The holiday
season is in full swing in this city at the foot of Mount Rainier,
and snow is falling ever so gently on the clean, efficient downtown
streets. The actors call out greetings as they arrive and share
plans to attend a post-performance latke party being thrown by
Theresa Tova, the self-proclaimed ``Jewish diva'' of the cast, who
plays the charismatic revolutionary Emma Goldman in the epic show.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another routine day on the road for the 100-member
cast and crew of the touring production. Another day, another city,
another show.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also something miraculous about this workaday scene.
The tour, which began in April, was abruptly shut down in
mid-November by the embattled producing company Livent Inc., only
to be resurrected just as abruptly two days later by the Pace
Theatrical Group. For a few fleeting days in between those
announcements, it looked as if the tour would never make it to
Seattle _ or to Boston, where ``Ragtime'' opens a long-awaited
10-week run at the Colonial Theatre on Wednesday. So despite the
business-as-usual atmosphere backstage, this tour has been anything
but routine. It's been quite a journey.
</P>
<P>
   RAGTIME, Page L4 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It began a little more than a year ago in New York, when
rehearsals began with director Frank Galati. ``Ragtime'' _ based on
the novel by E. L. Doctorow, with a book by Terrence McNally and a
score by Stephen Flaherty _ tells the story of three families set
against the backdrop of American society in 1906; it touches on
themes of racism, feminism, immigration, and, of course, the
American dream. Back in the beginning, some folks who signed on for
the tour were drawn to this particular story for personal as well
as professional reasons. There was Tova, the daughter of Polish
Holocaust survivors who had her surname changed by immigration
officials when her family immigrated to North America in the 1950s.
There was Alton Fitzgerald White, who didn't have to do much
research for the role of Coalhouse Walker Jr. because he knows all
too well what it's like to walk through life as a black man in a
racist society. There was general manager Tom Domenici, a
second-generation American whose Italian-born grandmother worked in
a sweatshop until she was well into her 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime'' was a story they knew well, and they were eager to
tell it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where prosperity meets greed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This tale, after all, is a quintessential American drama, about
the promise of prosperity colliding with the reality of intolerance
and greed. At the end of this century, it provides an opportunity
to look back to the century's beginnings, to try to understand
where we have been and where we are going. And the view isn't
always pretty. ``The world seems to dash our hopes hour by hour,''
Galati says, ``but the story itself is both a way in and a way out.
My job is trying to connect audiences with stories, the same way
you go to a therapist or a friend to tell the story that hurts in
order to be healed. That was Freud's whole idea. Tell me, what did
you dream? How did it hurt? In the telling of the story, there is
something curative. People walk who were unable to walk. Hearts are
mended where they were broken. That's what the national
storytelling impulse is all about.'' One of the last numbers of the
show, in fact, is a song called ``Make Them Hear You,'' a rousing,
idealistic call to repeat tales of injustice, of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   So from the very beginning, Galati inspired the actors to do
just that _ make audiences hear their message out on the road. The
first stop was Washington, D.C., where the show opened last April.
And it was there, early in the tour, that the relevance of the show
hit hard one fine spring day.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this scenario. The ``Ragtime'' cast is performing for
an audience including the president and the vice president. It's a
big night, and White is bursting with anticipation. He, after all,
sings that final rousing ballad; he has the last bow. And so he
sets off for the theater, a well-dressed black man standing on a
street corner in Dupont Circle, a tony Washington neighborhood. He
puts his hand up for a cab. Zip. One goes by. Zip, another cab
passes. Fourteen taxis fly by before one finally stops, getting him
to the theater in barely enough time. He breathes deep, performs
the show, gets a standing ovation, does the meet-and-greet with the
president, basks in the applause. And then he steps outside the
theater _ and again he can't get a cab. Incensed, he walks the mile
or so back to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen every day, and I'm lucky I can use that in
the show,'' White recalls. ``I mean, there I am in the nation's
capital and I can't get a taxi to or from the theater. I can use
that. Other black men, I don't know what they do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   White left the show after the Seattle engagement to star in the
production still running on Broadway, but his replacement in the
road company, Lawrence Hamilton, tells similar tales. ``You know
what? I'm a 1999 Coalhouse Walker Jr.,'' Hamilton says. ``I feel it
every day. There are times I can't get a cab. It doesn't matter
what you do. You can make $10,000 a week. So what? This'' _ he
touches the skin on his arm _ ``is what matters. But if I can
change one producer's mind, one fellow in South Boston, one
cabdriver who won't take me to Roxbury, then I've done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the tour, which went from Washington to
Denver and Minneapolis and then Seattle, the cast was acutely aware
of news events that mirrored the themes of the show. ``Look what we
deal with,'' says Michael Rupert, who plays the Latvian immigrant
Tateh. ``We saw a black man dragged behind a pickup truck in
Jasper, Texas. We saw a young man beaten to death and left dying on
a fence in Wyoming. The middle class has shrunk and disappeared.
The division between the rich and poor is getting wider. And here
we are at the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, one of the subplots concerns Evelyn Nesbit, the
first national sex symbol, whose husband murdered the architect
Stanford White. They called it the ``crime of the century,'' but as
one character says in the play, ``It was only 1906, and there were
94 years to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Learning on the road
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons to be learned in those 94 years, and there
were lessons to be absorbed out there on the road. The company, by
all accounts, learned them together. ``This is the most spiritually
together company I've ever worked with,'' says Domenici. ``I've
done `Phantom' and `Miss Saigon' and `Riverdance,' and this is the
most loving group I've ever known.''

 SEATTLE: ... ever known.''

<P>
   So imagine how Domenici felt on the night of Nov. 17, in the
middle of the Minneapolis run. He got the word that the show was
closing: The Toronto-based Livent, which was under criminal
investigation for accounting fraud, was filing for bankruptcy and
closing the tour. (Just this week, company founders Garth Drabinsky
and Myron Gottlieb were indicted in New York on charges they
inflated corporate earnings and siphoned off $4.6 million in
kickbacks.) In retrospect, it shouldn't have come as too much of a
surprise: Theater folks have been suspicious of Livent for years.
Drabinsky has mounted lavish shows like ``Ragtime'' and the revival
of ``Showboat,'' sending them out on the road for long runs with
huge advertising campaigns. The numbers may have worked onstage,
but they didn't add up in the accounting department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Domenici was stunned. As company manager, it was his job
to deliver the news, so he gathered the cast for a meeting on the
stage a half-hour before the curtain. The show was closing in two
days, he told them. The journey was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, `I'm not finished with this part,' ''
says Rebecca Eichenberger, who plays the role of Mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had such passion for this story,'' adds Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' White concludes.
</P>
<P>
   They got through the performance, choking up during songs like
``Our Children'' and ``Make Them Hear You.'' And then, when the
initial shock work off, practicality set in. Plane reservations
were made. Folks who had sublet their apartments called friends,
pleading for a place to sleep. Agents were contacted, auditions
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Pace _ and its local producer, Jon B. Platt _
stepped in to resurrect the tour. Everyone had the option to
continue under the new management. Only three ensemble members
turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Yvon, who plays Harry Houdini, admits he was a bit naive
about the business before this tour. ``In the end, we learned that
money is the bottom line,'' he says with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The tour then moved on to Seattle, where citizens are closely
monitoring the Microsoft antitrust suit. The Doctorow novel touches
on the great industrialists and financiers of the turn of the
century _ folks like J. Pierpont Morgan, who faced antitrust suits
of his own. Morgan plays a tiny role in the musical adaptation, but
the echoes of history are eerie, especially in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intertwining stories
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The entire saga, in fact, has a contemporary pulse. A white
family lives a perfectly proper middle-class life in the upscale
suburb of New Rochelle, N.Y., but the wife discovers herself and
longs for a more meaningful existence. An African-American couple
dream of a bright future for their newborn son. A Latvian immigrant
clings to his daughter as he tries to eke out a living in this
strange, new world. One country, three groups. In the opening
prologue, the groups stand apart from one another at first,
separate but not necessarily equal. As the play proceeds, these
different stories are intertwined as cultural forces and
serendipity bring the characters together.
</P>
<P>
   Those same cultural forces persist today, and the actors
certainly bring their own life experiences and values to the roles.
Tova, for one, is the granddaughter of Old World socialists, and
her parents escaped the Warsaw Ghetto. ``It's in my bones; it's in
my blood,'' she says of her role as Emma Goldman. She says the
producers were astonished by her authentic Yiddish accent when she
auditioned, and she answered them in Yiddish. ``The translation was
`This you didn't think I could do? Who the hell do you think I am?'
'' Since then, she has become the unofficial dialect coach for the
actors playing immigrants; she's also the ``Yiddish soul of the
company,'' as well as the link to the immigrant experience. ``My
uncle worked in a factory making shoes in Lynn, Mass., and every
time I perform, I think of him walking up those seven floors to a
sweatshop in the heat of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Tom Domenici thinks of his grandmother toiling
away in a garment sweatshop called Liberty Lace; Eichenberger
thinks of her own role as a working mother. Like the character she
plays, she isn't afraid to say that she gains self-fulfillment
through the noble yet undervalued work of raising her two young
children. She brings her children on the road with her when she
can, but one night, she hadn't seen them for three weeks. ``When we
sang `Our Children,' I sobbed through the whole number, especially
the part where we sing, `Children run so fast toward the future
from the past,' '' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Darlesia Cearcy also plays a mother in the show, but her role as
Sarah has an entirely different resonance. ``Sarah represents the
young black single mother, unwed,'' Cearcy says. ``It's the same
story as today: She's the epidemic of 1999. I'm not a single
mother, but I feel so much sympathy for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her character is initially estranged from Coalhouse, the ragtime
pianist who is the baby's father, but they reunite and sing a love
song called ``Wheels of a Dream.'' And that scene, White says, is
reason enough that the show must go on. ``People aren't used to
seeing black people in love,'' he says. ``The media has us fighting
and kicking. Do you realize how powerful that scene is, when they
are sitting on that blanket and dreaming together about their son?
Wow, they're in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, the characters travel a long journey to get to that
moment, and the cast and creative team have traveled many a real
road to get to the Colonial Theatre. First there was the business
of distilling Doctorow's sweeping novel into a three-hour
production; many of the subplots, including the exploration of
sexuality and psychoanalysis, have been cut. The adaptation
maintains the glimmer of hope offered at the end of the novel, even
in the face of enormous personal loss, not to mention indignity and
injustice. But Galati, for one, says that hope is tempered by
knowledge. ``It's not a Pollyanna answer,'' he says. ``They're not
walking off into the sunset. They're walking off into the
Holocaust, to Hiroshima, to the carnage of the 20th century. And I
think that's what gives it so much emotional resonance and what
makes it leap from 1906 to 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge is what made it so difficult for the actors to
accept the short-lived cancellation of the tour; they want the
journey to continue into the next century. (Producer Platt says the
Pace tour will close after the Boston run, but will reopen in
Houston this summer.) For now, Hamilton will be happy if he changes
one person's mind, if he can get out there and make them hear his
song. (It should be pointed out that ticket prices for the show run
as high as $75, and the actors report that audiences on the road
have been primarily white.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the bigger journey, the one called life, that one never
ends. ``By the time you reach the eleventh hour, you feel like
you've been sitting in a completely different world, all your own,
experiencing your own life, understanding your own culture and
adapting to others, which is basically what this country is
supposed to be about,'' Cearcy says. ``I am on a constant journey,
each and every night. I have to remind myself on a daily basis that
it is never, never over.''

TV'S PURE POP FOR NOW PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching TV, I sometimes stumble across one of the
Spanish-language channels, where a seemingly endless soap opera is
playing itself out, an emotional novela ripe for director Pedro
Almodovar's campy treatment. She is heartsick, desperate, demeaned;
he is distant, macho, in his bathrobe. I have a vague sense of
what's going on, of the dramatic gist, of who's zooming whom. But I
can't understand the words she cries out at him, and I don't
recognize the curses he mumbles under his breath. The details are
lost to me. I am an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Are English-language viewers beginning to feel the same way
about TV shows written in their native tongue? Are many of the
jokes, the repartee, the dramatic resonances becoming like
</P>
<P>
   a foreign language to those unschooled in pop culture? More and
more, it seems, series television is relying on specific, hip
reference to carry its scripts, making repeated nods to rock music,
contemporary film, and, yes, of course, TV itself. In most cases,
the references are blended into prime time's zillions of small
moments and punch lines. On ``Jesse,'' for example, the barmaid's
boyfriend says she looks like ``the girl from the Ricola
commercial.'' On ``The Hughleys,'' Milsap scares the kids with an
imitation of Billy Bob Thornton in ``Sling Blade.'' On the new
``Providence,'' a woman with a fresh nose job complains, ``I told
you I wanted Courteney Cox, not Jennifer Aniston.'' On ``Cupid,''
Claire tells Trevor she has a vivid image of Mount Olympus: ``I saw
`Boogie Nights,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' allusions to pop culture absolutely run
rampant. They are a hallmark of the hyper-witty sitcom as much as
the fact that one of its lead characters, Will, is openly gay. You
can hardly make it through an episode without recalling an
Entertainment Weekly's worth of cool tidbits. Last fall, the series
premiere opened with a George Clooney joke, and it has been a pop
quiz ever since, with evocations of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe's latest
hairstyle, with lines like ``It's too `Stevie Nicks: The Heavy
Years,' '' and with tart mentions of MTV's ``Real World: Seattle,''
Markie Post's Lifetime movies, ``Party of Five,'' and ``Pop-Up
Video'' on VH1. About the title of an autobiographical play by
Jack, a gay character who is stereotypically queeny, Will quips:
``I guess `There's Something About Mary' was already taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In the light of the present tense, this kind of allusiveness can
seem delightfully clever or, at its most obscure, self-consciously
with-it. Neat references to little-known cable movies can be
postmodern and offer a reward for those many hours and dollars we
might have spent on brain-draining entertainment. They can also
smack of insider trading, exclusivity, and smugness, on the order
of: ``Oh, ha ha ha, you didn't see `Sling Blade'? Everybody else
did.'' They can ground cynical series like ``Lateline'' and the
late, great ``The Larry Sanders Show'' in reality, as they deploy
cameo appearances in the way other shows drop pop allusions. But a
frenzy of in-jokes can also give a show the appearance of
overlooking the majority of the country, who don't really know much
about the Beltway and open lesbian Candace Gingrich. (``There's
nothing wrong with you that the right man couldn't fix,'' G. Gordon
Liddy told her on ``Lateline.'')
</P>
<P>
   For today's networks, the pop jokes are _ what else? _
demographic tools, signals to specific viewers that say, ``This
show's for you!'' The makers of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' are saying, ``Our
viewers of choice are hip enough to know what style Michael Stipe
is working this season.'' The makers of ``Lateline'' are saying,
``Our viewers of choice are politically savvy boomers who know what
guest stars like G. Gordon Liddy represent.'' While these messages
may cause many to surf on by, the networks are no longer overly
concerned about winning a quantity of Nielsen homes. They've
narrowed their ambitions to targeted buying audiences that they can
sell to advertisers. The teen-oriented shows, which are selling
products to the desirable youth market, are particularly laden with
pop code, most notably the WB's ``Dawson's Creek,'' whose
precocious characters are almost painfully media savvy (Dawson
himself is a filmmaker who idolizes Spielberg). On these shows, the
soundtracks are straight off today's Billboard charts.
</P>
<P>
   The networks also use pop reference to plug their own shows _ a
self-serving bit of product placement that is especially evident on
NBC. From a story line built around Conan O'Brien on ``Lateline''
and the ``Friends'' nose-job bit on ``Providence'' to a ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' swipe at Eriq LaSalle's ``ER'' deadpan, the Peacock has
been fairly shameless. Not that ABC was particularly altruistic
when it shaped an episode of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' around the final
episode of NBC's ``Seinfeld.'' Let's call that approach an
extension plug _ stealing the juice from someone else's socket.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up classics
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what will all this timeliness mean in the future? Right now,
classic television shows like ``I Love Lucy,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show,'' and ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' are completely available
to 1990s viewers some 50, 40, and 30 years after they were made.
Sure, they very much remain products of their time, both in terms
of social mores and fashion trends, from Lucy and Rickie's separate
beds to Laura's Capri pants and Rhoda's crocheted hats and hanging
beads. But their line-by-line meanings are not veiled in the
contemporary codes of their day. On Nick at Night and TV Land, they
continue to speak to us in a common language that doesn't require
translation.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 years, will our TV shows require a ``Pop-Up Video''
treatment, whereby explicatory bubbles let future generations in on
our secrets? Ted Baxter's bumbling egotism is perfectly clear to us
in 1999, but will the folks in 2050 get the joke when the Baxter
figure on ``Lateline'' says ``Charlie Rose pees in the shower''?
Will they need to consult their movie databases to know what Ken
Olin on ``L.A. Doctors'' means when he says, ``I might be a father
someday; look at Clint Eastwood''? Will they get the point when, on
``Ally McBeal,'' Calista Flockhart and Lara Flynn Boyle have a
tense moment about skirt length, weight loss, and sharing a cookie?
Will culture professors be writing books on pop tribalism as seen
on turn-of-the-millennium TV?
</P>
<P>
   Not that allusiveness can never hold up over the years. When
``The Drew Carey Show'' models an entire episode on the movie ``The
Full Monty,'' or when ``Just Shoot Me'' does a fun-house-mirror
version of ``Annie Hall,'' or when ``Seinfeld'' borrows from
``Betrayal,'' the humor works without any knowledge of the
alluded-to object. If you haven't seen ``Betrayal'' _ and most
people haven't even heard of Harold Pinter's play and movie _ you
can still fully enjoy the backward-moving ``Seinfeld'' episode, and
if you have seen ``Betrayal'' then you can enjoy the episode even
more. This type of time-based script also stands on its own, more
or less, like crime-show plots that are loosely based on real-life
murder cases. Understanding is not entirely dependent on
familiarity with other entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way we live now
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Will &AMP; Grace'' raise questions about the future of
classic TV. Allusiveness doesn't appear to affect syndication, as
shows like ``Seinfeld'' thrive outside of prime time in the same
era during which they were prime-time hits. We are still close
enough to the ``Seinfeld'' heyday to understand what's funny when
Elaine doesn't like ``The English Patient,'' or whether or not
Jerry watches ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   But pop culture is bigger than ever, and it changes so rapidly
that many of today's hip references may be washed away as the
Culture of the New continues to rain down. The number of movie
releases multiplies, cable TV stations proliferate, new bands hit
the top of the charts and then disappear with increasing velocity.
Our icons are less universal, so that a joke revolving around
Courteney Cox probably doesn't have the endurance of a joke about
Joan Crawford. Much of today's TV may be dating itself, withholding
its reflection of the way we live now from future generations who
aren't prepared to refer to footnotes about the many specific
fragments of our culture. Or maybe our TV shows are looking the
future straight in the eye and saying, ``I guess you had to be
there.''

EMILY WATSON IS MAKING WAVES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Emily Watson did this, she wound up
hating herself.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than two years ago, and Watson was a spanking-new
face garnering mad attention for her film debut, ``Breaking the
Waves.'' She played Bess, an emotionally fragile and profoundly
devout young woman whose faith in God leads her to extreme measures
in hopes of healing her paralyzed husband. The film won the Grand
Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, and Watson received
best-actress nominations from the Golden Globes and the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Watson found herself in the center of an unwavering,
unwanted spotlight, as everyone wanted to know the woman behind the
stunning performance. Her life became a blur of cities and
countries, sound bites and photo sessions. She was often startled
by the sight of her own saucer-wide blue eyes staring at her from
newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely didn't know when you made a film you had to do
publicity for it, so it was all a bit of a shock,'' Watson said
recently, reflecting on her first year of living publicly. ``It
went on and on, and I felt like I had to talk about nothing but
myself for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange because I sort of came out of it hating myself
because you have to do a really big PR job on the work, and also on
yourself,'' she said with a laugh. ``You just end up sort of nutty,
d'you know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Watson may hate talking about herself, but since her film debut,
critics can't seem to say enough about her. The actress is again
receiving accolades for her latest film, ``Hilary and Jackie,'' a
drama based on the life of famed cellist Jacqueline du Pre, whose
career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, the degenerative
disease that eventually killed her. Watson's fierce performance as
Jackie has earned another Golden Globe nomination as best actress,
and the Oscar buzz (with nominations still a month away) has again
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very nice and fun,'' said Watson, 32, as she relaxed
in a fussily decorated hotel parlor on Central Park South, a
blood-red room adorned with paintings by Phyllis Diller and James
Dean. She was in New York for a few days before jetting off for
more publicity in Los Angeles. ``It's a nice bonus, but that's not
what it's all about. That's not why I became an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened Friday, also stars Rachel Griffiths,
David Morrissey, and James Frain. It was directed by Anand Tucker
and written by Frank Cottrell Boyce. It is based on the book ``A
Genius in the Family,'' by Hilary and Piers du Pre, Jacqueline's
sister and brother.
</P>
<P>
   As the title indicates, the film is more than an exploration of
Jacqueline du Pre's musical life and accomplishments. It is the
story of the tender, tragic bond she shared with her older sister,
Hilary, played by Griffiths. Both girls, raised in rural England,
were musical prodigies encouraged by their mother. Hilary was a
flutist and, for a time, was considered the more accomplished of
the two. The attention Hilary received pushed Jackie to strive for
perfection on the cello, and soon Jackie was receiving the standing
ovations, and invitations to perform on BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the film Jackie is given a rare cello by her
teacher, who tells her: ``It will give you the world, Jackie, but
you must give it yourself.'' She does, at times to devastating
effect. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Choosing a quiet life &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Jackie pursues her music, Hilary, realizing she will never
again be as good as her sister, opts for a quiet family life in the
country. The story unfolds through the eyes of each sister, at
times repeating the same scenes, like a piece of chamber music
presented with different interpretations. The sisters were rivals
as much as confidantes. Before filming began, Watson and Griffiths
spent time getting to know each other, to create a credible bond as
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sisters, they were so finely attuned to one another,'' said
Watson (who says she has a sister, but did not consciously draw on
their relationship for the film). ``I think they both felt bound to
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is also a film about the musician's art, the passions,
even obsessions, that drive genius. To prepare for her role as
Jackie, Watson studied cello for three months, something she also
did briefly as a teenager in her native London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied cello for about six months when I was 14, but gave
it up because I was very bad, and because it was very bothersome
lugging it around on the tube,'' as London's subway system is
called, Watson said. ``When I took it up again for the film, it was
really like learning it for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson learned basic cello techniques while she was in Dublin
making ``The Boxer,'' a 1997 drama starring Daniel Day-Lewis. But
it wasn't enough to learn the fingerings or the proper way to hold
a bow. Du Pre's performances were marked by her distinct body
movements, a vigorous, rhythmic sway attached to every note and
crescendo. In the film, her mother complains about the flamboyant
movements with ``all that hair flying all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   It became an integral part of du Pre's persona onstage, not
unlike the leaps Leonard Bernstein would make while conducting.
Watching hours of the cellist's filmed performances, Watson found
learning to approximate du Pre's dance with her cello one of the
most physically demanding aspects of the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a movement teacher who certainly helped me,'' she said.
``The way Jackie moved, she very much became a part of the music
itself. You don't attempt to portray a musician, let alone a
musical genuis, without trying to capture their artistic style and
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein Watson found perhaps the film's greatest challenge:
portraying an actual person. Watson has never before portrayed a
real person on screen, and she quickly understood the added
scrutiny such roles receive. The public can be very possessive of
its idols _ look at the guff endured by Ray Liotta when he played
Frank Sinatra in the recent HBO film ``The Rat Pack,'' or the
lingering snickers more than 40 years after the unathletic Anthony
Perkins portrayed Boston Red Sox pitcher Jimmy Piersall in ``Fear
Strikes Out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Watson refused to allow such expectations to hinder her
performance or the filmmakers' vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there's a responsibility to try to get as close as
you can to the person,'' she said. ``But this is a film, not a
historical document. As an actress, my first duty is to the story,
not to doing a perfect imitation.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unvarnished intensity &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Watson brings to the role is an unvarnished intensity that
has become a trademark after only three films. In his review of
``Breaking the Waves,'' critic Roger Ebert evoked the words of
Francois Truffaut regarding James Dean, saying Watson seemed to
proceed ``according to instinct instead of thought and
calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The slight-of-build Watson _ who counts Judi Dench, Steve
McQueen, and Robert De Niro among her acting influences _ hardly
seems feral up close. Quiet and soft-spoken, she won't speak just
to fill the empty spaces, and is not given to lengthy answers when
a few words will suffice. Dressed in a thick gray sweater over a
black skirt and matching ankle boots, Watson said even she doesn't
know where her vivid performances originate: ``I'm as surprised as
anyone else,'' she said. But she understands how these performances
have shaped the public's perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wasn't at the top of the list when they were
casting `There's Something About Mary' _ I probably wasn't even on
the list,'' Watson said, referring to the zany summer comedy hit
that starred Cameron Diaz. ``But I would like to change that, yeah.
I would like to do something scatological.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the future, but don't expect it for a while. She
recently completed ``Angela's Ashes,'' the screen adaptation of
Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his hardscrabble
childhood in Ireland. That film is tentatively scheduled for a fall
release. There's also ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' a drama directed by
Tim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a full, busy year for Watson, a year of doing what
she loves _ acting _ and what she doesn't love quite as much _
talking about acting, and, in particular, herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get better at it, and you learn to be a bit more
selective,'' she said. ``But when you're at the top of three days
of continuous interviews, you just don't ever think you're going to
get through it. It's better, yes, but it's still very funny to me
that people now see me as some sort of somebody.''

ACTING THEIR AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ One could easily imagine Sean Connery and Gena
Rowlands as a long-married couple.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through a doorway, Connery placed a gentle hand,
almost a caress, on the small of Rowlands's back, guiding her into
a midtown Manhattan hotel room doubling as a lion's den chock-full
of whirring tape recorders and eager reporters. As the interviews
began, the two eased into playful bickering and bantering, usually
punctuated with endearing winks and glances. Occasionally, each
fell into the particular cadence of completing the other's
sentences, reminiscent of those who have spent a lifetime breathing
each other's air.
</P>
<P>
   Connery and Rowlands seem so natural together, it's a wonder
Hollywood ever thought of putting them together.
</P>
<P>
   The two veteran actors star in ``Playing by Heart,'' an ensemble
drama about the search for meaningful and lasting love in
contemporary Los Angeles. They play Paul and Hannah, a married
couple who find their 40 years of togetherness threatened by an old
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Friday, also stars Gillian Anderson, Ellen
Burstyn, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe,
Dennis Quaid, Jon Stewart, and Madeleine Stowe. But, make no
mistake, the Connery-Rowlands relationship is really the film's
centerpiece. What makes it so extraordinary is that, unlike most
film couplings, Connery and Rowlands actually look like husband and
wife, not father and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is, of course, run by middle-aged men who have long
since abandoned the age-comparable spouse one for the lithe
20-something trophy wife or girlfriend. Hence, too many films
reflect that skewed view of the romantic world _ older actors
hooked up with much younger actresses. In recent years, there's
been Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in ``As Good as It Gets''; Clint
Eastwood and Rene Russo in ``In the Line of Fire''; Michael Douglas
and Gwyneth Paltrow in ``A Perfect Murder''; and Harrison Ford and
Anne Heche in ``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' The average age
difference between these celluloid couples is more than a
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   But Connery and Rowlands are both in their 60s. It's easy to
believe them as a couple, as a man and a woman who have endured
life's hills and valleys side by side, and still love each other
dearly. In the film, they radiate a realistic sexuality far more
palpable than the strange, unbelievable pairing of say, Douglas
(54) and Paltrow (25).
</P>
<P>
   Both actors can relate to the longevity of Paul and Hannah's
marriage. Connery has been been married to his second wife for
nearly 25 years, and Rowlands enjoyed a lengthy marriage to
actor-filmmaker, John Cassavetes, until his death in 1989. But in
promoting the film, Connery said, ``Eighty percent of the
questions'' have been about the age of the characters and the
``length of their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One person said, `Well, for me, it's very hard to understand
being married 40 years,' '' he said. ``I guess it's just something
people picked up on because it's not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands pondered his statement for a moment, then looked at
Connery quizzically. ``What's not normal?'' she interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, by way of explanation, ``I mean they don't
make movies about people that age, with those sorts of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding her co-star's point, Rowlands agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see it,'' she said, referring to couples past middle
age. ``It's kind of a shame because you have lots of people walking
around thinking that by 40 it's over, and you drop off the world
someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly why Willard Carroll, who wrote and directed the
film, wanted to create romantic roles for older actors, to
counteract the big-screen impression that love is the sole province
of those under 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a multi-character love story for a long time,
but had never been able to get a handle on what would make it
unique,'' he said. ``So I decide to deal with it from a variety of
perspectives and a broad age spectrum, from early 20s to mid-late
60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to write an older couple that had the same
passion and vitality as the younger couple I was writing,'' he
said. ``With Sean and Gena, I wanted to look at older people in a
different way where the romance hasn't died, where the love hasn't
died.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment proved inspirational to other cast members,
including Phillippe, who, with Jolie, plays a 20-something club
kids trying to find romance amid the swirl of LA nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood dismisses people over a certain age, and they tend
to forget,'' said Phillippe, 24. ``I thought it was beautiful to
see a relationship between an older couple that was still so alive
and full of passion, instead of seeing a 55-year-old guy with a
22-year-old. I just thought that was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   If only everyone had been as embracing of the film's original
title. Carroll initially called his film ``Dancing About
Architecture,'' which came from a line in the film, ``Talking about
love is like dancing about architecture.'' Sure, it was a quirky
title, but it had more character than the generic ``Playing by
Heart.'' But Carroll had no say in the change, which was ordered by
the Motion Picture Academy of America because it found the title
too similar to ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' a drama starring Meryl
Streep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that we lost `Dancing About Architecture,' but
`Playing by Heart' works just as well because it also has a musical
connotation,'' Carroll said. ``I think `Playing by Heart' was my
favorite of the alternates. Putting on my crass commercial hat, I
think `Playing by Heart' is probably a more mainstream title than
`Dancing About Architecture.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll may have been robbed of his title, but he got the cast
he wanted. He wrote the role of Hannah, the host of a successful
television cooking show, with Rowlands in mind. When she read the
script, she was ``immediately delighted, and without hesitation
said I'd love to do it,'' Rowlands recalled. Connery's interest in
the project was secured by Rowlands's participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never worked with Gena, so it was a golden opportunity,''
he said. ``We've both had a similar pattern of experiences as
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands became known for her work in such films as ``A Woman
Under the Influence,'' ``Gloria,'' and ``Faces,'' all directed by
Cassavetes. Connery, of course, made his name as Agent 007, James
Bond (and for many, the only James Bond), in six films. He won an
Oscar for his role as a wily Chicago cop in the crime drama ``The
Untouchables.''
</P>
<P>
   But the role of the loving, imperfect husband in ``Playing by
Heart'' is one Connery can relate to _ even if others see it as
something of a stretch for a man once dubbed by People the
``Sexiest Man Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A while ago I was doing an interview for this film, and
someone asked me if I thought this role was a great departure for
me,'' Connery said. ``Well, I thought about that for a moment and
said, `Well, I suppose I'm just acting my age.' ''

THE MOTHER OF ALL RECREATIONAL VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When you first see the UniCat, there is no
sensation of ``love at first sight.'' You are more apt to think:
``What the heck is that weird thing?''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this rig looks like a garbage truck in which
somebody stuck a Mercedes logo on the grill as a joke, or maybe a
giant 4-wheel-drive Brinks truck loaded with a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out this vehicle is like no other 4-wheel-drive
camper in the world _ it can go virtually anywhere, completely
self-contained for 3,000 miles. And as for that million dollars,
well, that's about what it takes to buy one; $600,000 will fetch a
stripped-down model; $1.5 million, the loaded, 6-wheel version.
</P>
<P>
   The first UniCat was sold in the United States this month, to a
rich guy in New York. And the only demonstration model in North
America is in the Cow Palace at the San Francisco Sports &AMP; Boat
Show, where it has folks gawking and talking, both astonished and
bewildered at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The UniCat is parked adjacent to three Hummers, the go-anywhere
vehicle that sets the standard worldwide for Rambo-venture. But the
UniCat is so big that Arnold Schwarzeneggar could buy one, then tow
his Hummer behind it like an RV towing a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I arranged to check it out and test drive it.
After climbing into the UniCat, the possibilities seemed unlimited,
even after just a few minutes: driving through water 4-feet deep,
over boulders 3-feet high, across fine-sand deserts, through muddy
bogs, and also making 45-degree climbs and descents in the most
remote areas of the world. That means you can deal with any kind of
terrain and go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Then once you get there, you can stay there, whether it be the
grasslands of Tanzania, Yukon tundra, Nicaraguan jungle or Golden
Gate Park. That's because the gas tanks hold 220 gallons of diesel,
enough to cover 1,700 to 3,300 miles (depending on the terrain),
and the RV compartment of this rig is custom-built as a
self-contained home, with enough water storage for about 10 days.
If you were to head out into nowhere and discover a reliable water
source to refill your tanks, you could stay out for weeks at a time
without having to resupply.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is Spartan _ even ugly. But hey, the whole thing is
ugly. After a while, it starts to look like an ugly mutt you love
more than anything in the world, because inside beats a heart of
gold that will never betray you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the key when Mercedes designed the chassis and engine,
originally as a military vehicle that is known in Rambo circles as
the ``Unimog.'' The engine is a Mercedes turbo-charged diesel mated
with an 8-speed transmission and a drive train where each 4-foot
wheel is driven independently with 30-degree axle articulation (for
crossing boulder fields).
</P>
<P>
   The RV compartment has independent hydraulic air suspensions,
separate from the cab, which allows the unit to contort through
crimped turns and angles. In first gear at full torque, it moves
about a foot per second, allowing the rig to climb across about
anything. In eighth gear, with highway tires, it will cruise at 70
mph at 15 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration, I was ready to drive it. I know a
favorite hill just north of Half Moon Bay where the road is almost
straight up, with tons of giant potholes and a few boulders and
outcrops. I opened the door to the rig, asked for the keys, and the
owner suddenly got this horrified look on her face and said,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   No? No what?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't let you drive it. I'm sorry. This is my home and I
can't let anything happen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she and her husband had taken the UniCat
across the Middle East, through Turkey and Saudi Arabia, into the
depths of Africa, then ferried to the Western Hemisphere, driven
across the Canadian wildlands and into Alaska, then down to Central
America, through El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and then south
to Argentina. Finally, it had come to the Cow Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the UniCat can handle any of that other stuff. But
apparently, it finally met its match _ San Francisco was just too
much for it.

LEGISLATURE TAKING TURN TOWARD PARTISANSHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Our state government's split personality emerged
again last week as lawmakers convened to see what they can do for
us _ and to us _ during the next five months.
</P>
<P>
   This condition started becoming obvious when Republicans started
building a significant presence in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The personality disorder, however, is not the partisanship that
has quite naturally developed as Texas has evolved into a two-party
state. It is instead the Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde treatment that public
officials from both major parties give to that partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan behavior is fashionable _ indeed, required _ in
even-numbered years, when elections are held and Republicans and
Democrats fight each other tooth, nail and campaign contribution
for legislative seats and other state offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in January of odd-numbered years, when the Republican and
Democratic winners assemble in Austin to try to govern,
partisanship suddenly becomes taboo _ or so our leaders would have
us believe.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from some of the speeches, partisanship was viewed as an
uglier concept than normal _ even for an odd-numbered year _ at the
opening of this legislative session, which occurred in the shadow
of the impeachment spectacle and all its controversial partisan
overtones in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, who was elected the Senate's
new president pro tempore, used much of his acceptance speech to
praise the Senate's bipartisan traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry, who just two months ago won a partisan
race for lieutenant governor, declared that the ``time for politics
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Party-bashing certainly wasn't invented by the current crop of
Texas leaders. The practice is as old as the party system, which is
virtually as old as our country itself.
</P>
<P>
   No less a historical prominence than George Washington even took
a swipe or two at partisan behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are
sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to
discourage and restrain it,'' the first president said in his
farewell address to the American people in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   But the father of our country was no more able to keep political
parties from developing than his political descendants in Texas or
anywhere else will be able to abolish partisan behavior.
Partisanship can be suppressed, but as long as we elect public
officials in partisan elections it will always be ready to pounce
upon the policy-making process, sometimes for the public good,
sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials, I suspect, may be less interested in
doing away with partisan behavior than they are in simply wanting
to bad-mouth it. They believe party-bashing plays well politically
because many people don't associate themselves with parties and are
turned off by political game-playing.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were many fierce fights between liberal and
conservative Democrats, Texas' state government didn't have
partisan conflict for most of this century, simply because the
Democratic Party was the only game in town. But that changed with
the growth of the Texas Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature has never organized along the partisan
lines of Congress, where the majority party holds all the key
leadership positions and largely sets the lawmaking agenda _ and
where partisanship has a hugely negative reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats didn't have to organize the Legislature in the
old days, and Republicans, at least in the House, haven't gained
enough numbers to do it now.
</P>
<P>
   There have been periodic partisan fights in Austin over
redistricting, tax policy and a few other controversies.
</P>
<P>
   But most issues before the Texas Legislature still aren't
partisan. And leaders from both parties _ including Gov. George W.
Bush, retiring Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and House Speaker Pete Laney _
have been able to forge a bipartisan working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Perry promises to continue Bullock's tradition, and the rule
requiring a two-thirds vote to pass anything out of the Senate will
help to keep partisanship in check in that chamber. And Bush, who
is eyeing a presidential race, doesn't want any major legislative
conflicts this year, partisan or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But tax vouchers for private schools, a major priority of
Perry's, could produce a partisan fight. So could Bush's and
Perry's tax cut proposals or a ``hot button'' issue, such as the
proposal to require parents to give consent or at least be notified
before their minor daughters can have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   And even if this session manages to mostly avoid partisan
fights, watch out in 2001. That will be a redistricting session,
when legislative and congressional district boundaries are redrawn
by state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' stakes will be huge, and no one will even pretend _
at least not very convincingly _ that partisanship won't be a major
factor.

DISCOVERING THOSE UNEXPECTED GEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As we formulate our vacation timetables, we usually
give priority to the ``must-see'' attractions: the Alamo in San
Antonio, the French Quarter in New Orleans, the Tower of London.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most satisfying aspects of travel is when we come
upon a place, or a happening, that takes us completely by surprise.
A secret find. Until, that is, we share our discovery with friends.
Or readers.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of my job is such that I plan almost every element of
a trip. And yet I never imagined purchasing carrot and corn soap in
tiny Roadtown, Tortola. Becoming infatuated by vintage
black-and-white photographs inside a small chapel in Natchez, Miss.
Rekindling the stagecoach era at the Wolf Creek Tavern in southern
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I sensed your grimace at the thought of carrot soap.
``Smooths dry, inflamed skin,'' read the label on the bright orange
handscreened cloth container at Roadtown's Sunny Caribbee Spice Co.
_ yes, suds and spice, what a combination _ in the British Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Corn soap? ``Helps reduce wrinkles by improving softness,
natural tautness and elasticity of the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bran soap, I learned, ``protects the skin from the adverse
effects of environmental pollution,'' Passionfruit soap is
``renowned for its healing and restorative powers.'' Lime soap
``softens and protects while stimulating the senses.'' Honey soap
is ``rich in vitamins, hormones and sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   At only $5.50, I bought a bouquet of, er, fragrances. I was
especially intrigued by chamomile soap, which ``protects the skin
from redness caused by air pollution.'' Should be ideal for
Houston. And to complement my bath, I picked up mango bath gel,
coconut shampoo and tangerine citrus splash, even though I have no
idea what health potion they possess.
</P>
<P>
   I also tucked away a half-ounce container of Voodoo perfume.
Given the label's caution that it ``captivates as it casts its
mysterious spell,'' I'm saving it for a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Caribbee offers plenty of edible spices, too. Indeed, its
herbal teas could fill an entire medicine chest: breadfruit tea for
high blood pressure, hibiscus tea for stomach disorders, lemon
grass tea for fever and flu, papaya tea for indigestion and gas,
soursop tea for insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   I also found it hard to resist Island Nutmeg Mustard, Caribbee
Curry, Hot Pepper Jelly and an Arawak Love Potion described as an
``invigorating brew'' and tucked into a wooden apothecary jar.
</P>
<P>
   Not headed to Tortola any time soon? You can explore Sunny
Caribbee _ and order your own Voodoo Perfume _ on the Internet at
www.exoticfood.com/sunnycaribbee. But do plan to visit; you'll
likely be amazed by the entire inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, many travelers will make an annual spring
pilgrimage to Natchez between March 10 and April 10, when most of
that Mississippi River city's great antebellum homes _ Longwood,
Stanton Hall, Rosalie, 31 in all _ will be showcased.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion on how to gain a deeper appreciation for
these landmarks and for the people who built them and lived along
the river. I was in Natchez not long ago as part of an excursion
aboard the River Explorer barge vessel, and thanks to a tip from an
onboard staff member I wandered into the Stratton Chapel at the
First Presbyterian Church in the center of town. What I saw _ and
the story behind this ``Natchez in Historic Photographs''
collection _ was mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   Henry C. Norman arrived in Natchez by steamboat during the
1850s. For the next 43 years, his camera captured life in and
around the city. Upon his death, Norman's son Earl assumed the same
role and continued until he died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Dr. Thomas Gandy, a Natchez physician, purchased the
collection from Earl's widow, with no inkling that it included
75,000 negatives. Gandy and his wife, Joan, devoted 35 years to
sorting through the collection, and now several hundred photographs
_ including some of the finest ever made of riverboats and river
life, haunting portraits and early glimpses of the great mansions _
are displayed in rooms adjoining the church.
</P>
<P>
   A suggested donation is only $3 per person. The chapel, at 405
State St., is open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. CST daily except Sundays, when it
opens at 1 p.m. following church services.
</P>
<P>
   Permit to me to share one other ``surprise story.'' Year before
last, while driving in southern Oregon, the co-pilot and I detoured
a quarter-mile or so off Interstate 5 into the tiny village of Wolf
Creek, about 20 miles north of Grants Pass. We paused at a rustic
lodge whose sign informed us it was the Wolf Creek Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   Striking up a conversation with an engaging waitress, we learned
that this was the oldest active travelers' inn in that part of the
United States, dating to 1883, and a celebrated stop during the
stagecoach era. We enjoyed a delightful meal, then continued our
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, I read that the Wolf Creek Tavern's
restaurant and nine lodging rooms were all but shuttered because
the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, which oversees the
establishment, couldn't find suitable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I called the Wolf Creek Tavern (541-866-2474)
expecting to hear one of those ``this number has been
disconnected'' recorded messages. Instead, a friendly voice
answered _ maybe the same waitress _ and said the one-time
stagecoach stop is thriving as never before. ``The state took over
management; all nine rooms are available for overnight stays again;
and the restaurant's open every day from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.,'' she
said. ``You'd better get back here quick; our new chef makes a
great steak and wild mushroom soup and jalapeo cornbread.''
</P>
<P>
   As I hung up the phone, I couldn't help smiling. Just as I do
when I think about carrot and corn soap on Tortola and beautiful
photographs in Natchez.

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ In the Panama Canal, ships are raised like
toys, step by step, through three sets of locks to a height of 85
feet above sea level, on their way from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels are tugged through the locks by ``mules,'' or
electric locomotives on train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Each passage requires 52 million gallons of fresh water to
equalize the water levels in these locks.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, no pumps are used, meaning that gravity is all
that pulls the swirling water from the surrounding watershed into
the locks' chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 85 years after its completion, these 50 miles of man-made
ditch are still an engineering wonder to behold, and the most
popular tourist attraction in this Ohio-sized country.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal is one of the greatest civil engineering
achievements of this century, which are often referred to as the
Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the Suez Canal, the Dneproges Dam in Ukraine, the
Alaska-Canada Highway, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State
Building, and the Eifel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this S-shaped isthmus has its share of white beaches,
dense rainforests, and colonial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But so does Panama's better-marketed neighbor to the north,
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   What Costa Rica doesn't have, of course, is the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama links North and
South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal runs northwest to southeast, utilizing locks at
both ends, an existing river and a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Panamanian government prepares to take control of
the canal and surrounding properties, a massive push has been
launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's always been a comfortable place for Americans to visit:
English is widely spoken, tap water is safe for drinking, and the
U.S. dollar is the official currency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, Panama will take
sole possession not only of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999, but also of
some 250,000 acres of land, along with seven U.S. military bases,
golf courses, movie theaters, airports and other installations
bordering the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a giant part of the Panamanian government's plans to
redevelop these properties.
</P>
<P>
   Already underway are projects to build new hotels in the
rainforests and to re-establish passenger service within two years
on the 143-year-old Panama Railway that runs alongside the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta directs the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, the agency charged with overseeing foreign investment in
the converted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 cruise ships passing through the canal every year
but none of them stop because we don't have the facilities to serve
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Panama's biggest goal is to build facilities on both the
Pacific and the Atlantic within five years that can accommodate up
to 250 cruise ships a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, for sure, the passengers on those ships will want to see
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors can see the canal at Miraflores Locks, which
offers an air-conditioned visitors center and an observation deck
where ships can be viewed as they pass through the locks.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1999, construction of a new, three-story visitors
center is due to be finished, complete with a higher observation
deck, as well as a bar, restaurant and interactive game area.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ships look like corks trying to squeeze through the
opening of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locks are only 110 feet wide and the biggest ships are 106
feet wide, so there's only two feet of clearance on either side,''
explained Jamie Robleto, a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it's easy to see why a French company employing a
small army went bankrupt trying to excavate this huge path in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The project was launched in 1882 and ended in disaster seven
years later with over 22,000 people dying from malaria and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took over the project in 1903 and finished
construction in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At Miraflores Locks, a short film in English and a team of
bilingual guides provide visitors with all sorts of canal-related
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 13,100 ships traverse the canal each
year, paying tolls based on tonnage and number of passengers
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The highest toll was $141,344, paid by the Crown Princess Cruise
Ship in 1993. The lowest toll was 36 cents, paid by Richard
Halliburton, who swam the canal in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Miraflores Locks is just minutes by car from Panama City, the
oldest Spanish settlement on the American mainland which is really
three cities rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Stone ruins are all that's left of Panama Vieja, the original
settlement burned in 1671 by pirate Henry Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is the colonial Casco Viejo, a picturesque section
of the city where white houses with ornamental iron balconies line
winding, narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the flashy, modern part of the city, where gleaming
high-rise banks and hotels dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Panama's 2.8 million people live in and around
Panama City, which sits on the Pacific side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the canal an easy visit from Panama City, but the
capital is also a good point from which to set off on day-trips to
see the wildlife in the Soberania National Park and in the
rainforest part of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which
consists of the 3,800-acre Barro Colorado Island and five adjacent
peninsulas in the man-made Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, which boasts large, unspoiled forests, a fourth of
the land has been established as national parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barletta, 357 varieties of birds have been spotted
in one day by the National Audubon Society in some parts of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has more biodiversity than even Costa Rica, it's just
that few people know about this,'' he said. ``We want to let people
know that, while the canal is the main thing, there's lots to see
here.''

 4-BY-4s MAY OFFER FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY ON ICE, SNOW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You can't miss them on the highway, where they
mostly own the left lane in icy weather, gliding along in
four-wheel-drive glory or worse, coming up full speed on your tail.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a reality even 4-by-4 drivers have to come to grips
with: When it comes to stopping, all cars are pretty much equal.
And in this icy winter, it's a reality specialists say many drivers
don't accept until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-wheel-drive enables you to go better, but not stop
better,'' said Greg Nikolas, an instructor at the Land Rover
Driving School in Manchester, Vt. ``It's not magic. It doesn't turn
a wet road into dry pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover school opened in April 1997 as a place where
drivers could learn the techniques of four-wheeling. It charges
$150 for the first hour and $100 per hour after that. This time of
year, the school, Nicholas said, gets drop-ins from people visiting
the area who are suddenly interested in learning how to use the
cars in snow, or honing their skills.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little question 4WDs take off and steer better on
slippery roads, in winter, New York Department of Motor Vehicle
statistics show, they have a higher-than-average accident rate on
roads with snow, ice or slush. Among some popular models like Jeep
Cherokees and Wranglers, Ford Explorers, Chevrolet Blazers and
Isuzu Troopers, the accident rate was about 30 percent higher than
the norm. The statistics, however, do not account for other
factors, including whether 4WD owners are more likely to go out for
a spin on days other drivers would consider too treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who feel emboldened by their 4WD abilities might want to
make sure the vehicles really work. Ken and Amy Broz of Malta,
N.Y., found this winter that their 1998 Kia Sportage couldn't even
get through a few inches of snow on their nearly flat driveway. Kia
spokesman Geno Effler said the company had found problems with a
new vacuum-assisted system that is supposed to automatically lock
the front hubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had difficulty in sub-zero temperatures getting
their car into four-wheel-drive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kia is offering owners with problems a retrofit with an older
hub system, Effler said.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers of 4WDs warn motorists to know their vehicles' limits.
Dan Clancy, a car salesman in Albany, remembers driving the first
front-wheel drive Omnis and Horizons through the snow, passing
rear-wheel drives like they were standing still. But, he said, ``I
had to realize that it isn't going to stop any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Four wheel drives feel more stable in snow not only because all
the wheels are driven, Clancy explained, but also because the front
axle spins just a little faster than the rear. So in a situation
where a two-wheel drive might swerve _ going through a slush pile
in the middle of a highway lane, for example _ a 4WD drive car is
constantly being pulled and pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clancy said, ``This may give you a false sense of
security. They think they can do anything.''

TRAVOLTA MAKES HIS CASE FOR `A CIVIL ACTION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Everything was perfect for the John Travolta interview.
</P>
<P>
   The room in the swanky Mansion on Turtle Creek was large and
comfy.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers were fresh and fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Studio representatives were on hand to smooth any problems. So
were several of the hotel staff, eager to see Travolta in person.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you hear me?'' Travolta asked over a noisy phone hook-up
hastily arranged from his private Boeing 707. ``Where are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the hotel room where we were supposed to be talking
in person that very hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, darn,'' he said, managing to sound genuinely disappointed.
Probably just good acting. And yes, he really said ``darn.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta had planned to fly into Dallas for interviews about ``A
Civil Action,'' his new film that opened recently as the top
box-office draw in the country. But Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport was socked in with fog, and he was not allowed to land. So
now he was making calls from his plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad I didn't get to Dallas because I was looking forward
to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's sad? He should see the long faces on the waitresses around
here.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Travolta didn't land in Dallas is one of four he owns.
Travolta, 44, has been a jet pilot since he was 26. He is even
qualified to fly a Boeing 707, a 189-seat, four-engine passenger
plane. Visions of a glum Travolta, sitting in the cockpit flying
the plane while balancing the telephone on his ear were tempting,
but not quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, almost,'' Travolta said with a little laugh at the
image. This time one of his private pilots was at the controls, and
Travolta was just a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was off in the wild blue yonder somewhere, it was
natural to ask why he loves flying so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, gosh, now that's a loaded question,'' Travolta said.
``Ever since I was 5 years old (living in New Jersey in the flight
path for New York's LaGuardia Airport) I've had this unusual
passion, preoccupation, desire for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved every aspect of it. I love the art of it, I love the
look of aircraft, I love the ability it takes to fly one, and I
think I like the sensation of flight, too. I like the objectivity
of seeing everything from this perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta sounded perfectly willing to go on talking about
flying, but there was still ``A Civil Action'' to discuss, so back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, based on the best-selling book by Jonathan Harr,
Travolta plays Jan Schlichtmann, a lawyer who specializes in sleazy
lawsuits. He presents himself as a concerned seeker of justice who
lies awake nights worrying about his clients. In truth, if he lies
awake nights, it's contemplating what sporty foreign car he will
buy next with the money he extorts from corporate defendants.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlichtmann is not as clever as he thinks. He bets
everything on winning a difficult case against two of the country's
big food companies. A small business connected to the companies is
polluting a stream near a small town in which several children have
died of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   A strange thing happens to Schlichtmann as he works on the case.
He gets involved. To his surprise, he has a conscience, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the usual black-and-white Hollywood morality play
(``Patch Adams'') in which everything neatly ties together in the
end, this movie sticks close to the facts. There will be no rousing
victory in which the hero is granted near-sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book had the same ending, right?'' Travolta said about the
unusual downbeat finale. ``When you make the book, unless you are
willing to change the ending ... There was always concern, but why
was the book successful?''
</P>
<P>
   If the book had not been such a big seller, and a star of
Travolta's skills and box-office success had not been willing to
tackle the lead, the movie might never have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta had his doubts when producer Joe Roth (not listed in
the film's credits) and Disney chief Michael Eisner called him
about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they had a part they really felt strongly I should
play,'' Travolta said. ``I asked why, and they said `Because we've
never seen you play anything like this, and it's a great script and
says a lot of interesting things about people and the
environment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta remained unsure after his first reading, but Eisner and
Roth persisted. So Travolta got some friends together for a group
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read it aloud. I realized that `Wow, if I can pull this
off, make it watchable ...'.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schlichtmann was, to be blunt, a jerk, a kind audiences
usually hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could make him funny to watch as an egotist, I could
solve him as a watchable character. Not a likable character, a
watchable character. That's all I think matters, is that you want
to watch him. You don't need to like him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is a drama, and Schlichtmann's change needed to be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you make a guy who is unaware of his flaws, unaware of
his insensitivity at first, have a wonderful growth?'' Travolta
said. ``He would basically have to give up his firm in order to win
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, that's a growth. He goes from an egocentric,
me, me, I, I guy, all for the buck, greed and all that, and turns
into this other guy who basically gives up everything for what he
believes in. It's an extraordinary thing. I thought, `I have never
done that before.' I'd like to see if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta found the key to making the character work by building
his change around scenes in which Schlichtmann is exposed, bit by
bit, to the personal tragedies behind the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you segue into him, realizing the lack of regard
for him, the lack of respect for his professionalism and integrity
(among the opposing lawyers and his clients), it challenges him. It
forced him to have some professional integrity and sentient
concepts as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta met Schlichtmann but did not imitate the lawyer in his
portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I really didn't grill him because I felt much more
interesting references from my 23 years of dealing with lawyers. I
saw an evolved Jan, and I understood those evolutions because I had
to do them myself in my life. I knew what it was like to give up
everything for a reason or a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to go somewhere I had never gone before in being so
cold and not understanding people's tragedy. Jan had already
resolved his own issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film's indefinite ending, Travolta is confident that
it will work for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you'd have to be almost a complete cynic or dead to
walk out of the theater and not suddenly be affected by what's
going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Travolta believe the movie might have an effect on public
policies regarding environmental issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't until I saw the movie,'' said Travolta, who had seen
the finished film the night before. ``I had only seen a rough cut
(before), to be completely honest with you. I let two months go by
and let (director) Steve Zaillian mess around with the movie and
fix it, and my God, I was so affected by it last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees, but it's got a heck of a shot at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta, who can command $15 million to $20 million plus
extensive (in Travolta's case near-legendary) perks for each film,
also has a small role in ``The Thin Red Line,'' which he did for a
token salary. He appears as a general in a scene lasting maybe two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He did the part as a favor for director Terrence Malick, who was
making his first movie in 20 years. Malick's last film, ``Days of
Heaven'' in 1978, was a critical success and became known for its
beauty. But it was not a box-office success. After it came out,
Malick, disgusted with Hollywood, retreated to Paris (he now lives
in Austin) and shunned all offers to make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   According to Travolta, much of Malick's anger at the Hollywood
system grew out of his inability to use Travolta, then a hot TV
star on ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' in ``Days of Heaven'' (Richard
Gere eventually played the role).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not let out of my (''Kotter``) contract by ABC,''
Travolta said. ``That was a real loss for Terrence Malick, and he
never got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came up with a script (for ''The Thin Red Line``) he
wanted me to be part of it in any way I could be, so I said, `Well,
whatever you want.' As a favor, I did this one small part. However,
I said, `I'm doing this for you, but don't make it look like I have
the lead in the picture. Don't bill me as a lead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Travolta understands some of Malick's need to succeed
this time around. After a meteoric rise that included three hits
(``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Grease'' and Urban Cowboy), Travolta
suffered through a long lull in the 1980s. It began with several
bad films _ ``Two of A Kind,'' ``Perfect,'' ``Staying Alive'' _ was
alleviated a bit by the success of the ``Look Who's Talking?''
comedies, but did not really end, at least in the public's mind,
until Travolta's triumphant comeback in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta doesn't argue about this lull, but he does not agree
with it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of liked it, to be honest, but I don't think I was
aware that there was one,'' he said, with a small laugh. ``You see,
not only did people do movies less in my earlier days, but studios
were entertaining certain offers all the time that I was close to
getting, so it didn't seem (to me) that I was out of the loop as
much as I kind of was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do ''Look Who's Talking?``, a big hit, and then
(director) Ronnie Howard would want me to do the fire-engine movie
(``Backdraft'') with DeNiro, but then he decided not to go with me
at the last moment. That was a big director, and I didn't feel as
much out of the loop as everyone thought I looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Say something Travolta disagrees with, and he will politely put
you straight and make a pretty convincing argument for his side.
For example, suggest that his acting skills are more appreciated
since his return, and he reminds you of his early acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget when I first started out, I had an Oscar
nomination in ''Saturday Night Fever.``
</P>
<P>
   ```Saturday Night Fever,' `Grease,' `Urban Cowboy' and
`Blow-Out' were all taken very seriously. I was (New York Times
film critic) Pauline Kael's favorite actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably taken seriously, without exaggerating, just
going by facts, as much as James Dean or (Marlon) Brando when they
first started. Except James Dean died after three films, and Brando
chose better than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do a few projects in a row where it's not up to what
they expected from you, then you start to lose a little bit of
credibility. That's what I think may have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't agree with the suggestion that he has been
working at a frenetic pace _ 12 major films in three years _ since
``Pulp Fiction'' made him hot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare me to (Tom) Hanks or Robin (Williams) or
(Bruce) Willis or any of the guys getting a lot of work, we are all
working at about the same pace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fast or moderate, Travolta will apparently stick with the pace
for the immediate future. He has already completed shooting ``The
General's Daughter,'' and will soon begin a film of Annie Proulx's
best-selling novel ``The Shipping News,'' which he will do with his
wife, Kelly Preston (``Jerry Maguire,'' ``Holy Man'').
</P>
<P>
   And he definitely plans to do a film from the best-selling
ber-science fiction novel, ``Battlefield Earth,'' written by L. Ron
Hubbard, a pulp writer who became the founder of Scientology.
Hubbard's style and plots can be generously characterized as broad,
but Travolta, who practices Scientology, is a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' he said of ``Battlefield Earth.'' ``It's
probably, if not the best, probably one of the two or three best
science-fiction books ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   And Travolta will continue to mix up his roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a conscious effort in that I like to do something next
that I have not done before,'' Travolta said. ``I like to mix up
genres so I'm never expected to do one genre. It would not be as
interesting to me as an actor. It's like you would never want to
read the same book every time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one more thing. It's obvious from the variety and types
of roles he plays, that Travolta has an almost compulsive need to
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do,'' he said. ``I live for it basically, and I
splurge on it when I can.''

PRIEST ACCUSES ARCHDIOCESE OF DEFAMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an unusual legal complaint to secular
authorities, a Roman Catholic priest has filed a lawsuit against
the archbishop of San Francisco alleging that he was defamed and
penalized for reporting suspected child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by the Rev. John Conley, whose clash with his
religious superiors occurred while he was serving as parochial
vicar of a Burlingame church, said Archbishop William Levada and
others in the archdiocese abused their authority and tried to
discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   Conley, 55, is a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, seeks
damages for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit filed by Father Conley against the archdiocese is
based on false premises and is totally without merit,'' archdiocese
spokesman Maurice Healy said last week. ``We expect it to be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a suit against a bishop, to whom diocesan priests promise
obedience, is extremely rare, church observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's walking on eggs here as a priest, you are not supposed to
take your bishop to court,'' said Tim Unsworth, author of books on
the priesthood and a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Conley's suit is based on his November 1997 discovery of a
wrestling encounter, reportedly in a darkened room, between an
underage male and the pastor of St. Catherine of Siena Catholic
Church. He reported the incident to church and law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo district attorney's office decided that evidence
did not justify filing criminal charges. But the pastor, the Rev.
James Aylward, publicly apologized for his ``foolishness and
imprudence'' in engaging in conduct forbidden by diocesan policy.
He also told parishioners that he had ``committed myself to the
care and treatment of a mental health professional in order to have
the benefit of his evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, Aylward resigned from the Burlingame
parish. He was transferred to another church.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the wrestling incident, Conley was placed on
administrative leave. He remains without official assignment and
lives at a Menlo Park retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Conley worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1972 to 1978,
serving for a time as chief of the criminal division in Detroit. He
entered St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park in 1988 and was
ordained five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, he said the archdiocese ``took numerous actions
... designed to retaliate for plaintiff's fulfilling his legal
obligation to report an incident of suspected child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Conley's situation was publicized, the
archdiocese said he was disciplined not for reporting the wrestling
incident but for public displays of anger, for insubordination and
disrespectful behavior toward his bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record of Father Conley's behavior is publicly known,''
Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit itself indicates the state of Father Conley's mind
and reveals the misplaced anger that caused him to be relieved of
his duties and asked to seek evaluation and counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley's lawyer, John Hill of Oakland, said the priest lodged
his complaint ``very reluctantly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has criticized Father Conley for causing grave
damage to the reputation of a brother priest and to the good name
of archdiocese officials,'' Hill said. ``He was doing what he was
morally and legally required to do. Rather than being condemned, he
should be held up as an example of what the church should be doing
to combat the problem of sexual improprieties.''

HUMOROUS BOOK MAKES COPING WITH 30 EASIER FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Julie Tilsner was in New York, working as an
assistant editor at Business Week magazine, when some of her female
office mates noticed she was less than her hard-charging,
high-energy self. Indeed, she was moping.
</P>
<P>
   A group of the wiser types _ ranging in age from the mid-30's on
up _ finally took Tilsner aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they knew what was happening,'' said Tilsner,
sipping tea at a coffeehouse near her apartment. ``They said, `We
know you are about to turn 30, and we want to tell you not to
worry, it just gets better from now on.' Naturally, I dismissed
them right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilsner reacted to her landmark birthday by quitting her job,
packing a backpack and joining an Israeli kibbutz, where she worked
at a rubber factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that I wanted to do manual labor,'' she said. ``I
learned how to make chicken pluckers. You never know when that
might come in handy.''
</P>
<P>
   She also went more than a little wild, but by the time she moved
to the San Francisco area, she had met her future husband, found
out that those women in her office were totally right, and come up
with the idea for her book, ``29 and Counting: A Chick's Guide to
Turning 30''; Contemporary Books; $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``29 and Counting'' is a humorous, light-hearted look at what
can actually be a traumatic subject for many. Tilsner, now 34,
figured that there were plenty of self-help books about becoming 40
or 50, but nothing on the subject that was affecting her peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get criticized for being a little flippant, but
honestly, this is meant to be funny. It's meant to tell the women
who are approaching 30 with trepidation to calm down, life really
does get better and better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its funny approach, Tilsner's book addresses the angst
women often feel about getting older.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling that now they have to act `grown-up,' that
they may not have accomplished all the things they thought they
might when they had teen-age dreams,'' Tilsner said. ``If you turn
30 and you're not married, don't have that best-selling novel out,
don't own a house, whatever it might be, there's a tendency to view
your life as a failure. I try to get women to recognize that they
might not be alone with those feelings, that they are in fact
pretty common and, most importantly, you have great times still
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of turning 30 far outweigh the drawbacks, Tilsner
said. One of the great things about being 30 is that ``you're old
enough to know better, but young enough to do it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advantages include being taken more seriously by other
adults and just plain knowing more about the ways of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about being more comfortable in your own skin,''
Tilsner said. ``You don't have to conform to someone else's
expectations of what you were supposed to have done or be doing.
Once you reach that point, everything becomes easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are better because you become more at ease with
yourself, your looks, what you want from a person. You've heard all
the lines by now so you can sort out the jerks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Tilsner lives with her husband and 2-year-old daughter,
working on a book in the same vein about parenting.

</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``a'' general news
category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor old U.S.A. Here we are playing catch-up again.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole hints at a bid for the White House and it throws
the pundits into a frenzy: ``Are Americans ready for a female
president?'' Many a Sunday-morning news show will no doubt debate
the question into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of the world yawns. From an international
perspective, female heads of state are old hat. There are currently
24 living women who are or have been presidents or prime ministers,
according to the Council of Women World Leaders, and don't count on
that number shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen has governed the modern countries of Canada, Haiti,
Bolivia, Rwanda, Norway, Burundi and Bangladesh, to name a few, and
female leaders include some of the most influential and admired
figures of the 20th century: Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir and Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder of this not-so-new phenomenon, we've compiled a
list of 10 women who ruled the world _ or parts of it, at least.
Liddy Dole might do well to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   1. BENAZIR BHUTTO, born 1953
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Pakistan, 1988-1990 and 1993-1996
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Educated at Harvard and Oxford, Bhutto is
the eldest child of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, president and then prime
minister of Pakistan from 1971 to 1977. After the elder Bhutto's
government was overthrown and he was hanged, Benazir became her
political party's most powerful voice. Her opposition to the new
military government landed her in jail, although eventually she was
allowed to leave Pakistan for London. In 1986, hundreds of
thousands of Pakistanis celebrated her return to the country. Two
years later,
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto, at age 35, became the first woman to rule a modern
Islamic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Having spent time in the United States and England,
Bhutto knew how to deal with the Western press, one of her
strengths on the international stage. ``Her foreign persona was a
really powerful one,'' said Laura Liswood, co-founder of the
Council of Women World Leaders. Bhutto also established women's
police stations, where women could report rape. During both of her
rocky governments, Bhutto faced charges of corruption and abuse of
power. In September, Swiss authorities handed over to Pakistani
officials evidence that Bhutto may have laundered money and taken
kickbacks while in office. The fiery Bhutto denies the charges and
continues to be an outspoken critic of the current Pakistani
government.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Now 45, Bhutto is the mother of three. Despite
her international prominence, she is acutely aware of her place as
a woman in a Muslim society. ``I must always maintain a certain
degree of formality,'' she has said. ``For instance, I have to be
accompanied by a proper chaperone, I must be careful how I talk to
people, I can't develop the same kind of camaraderie that exists
among men.''
</P>
<P>
   2. GOLDA MEIR, born 1898
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Israel, 1969-1974
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Meir was 8 when her father, a carpenter,
moved the family from the Ukraine to Milwaukee. As a young woman
she became drawn to Zionism and moved to Palestine with her
husband, Morris Meyerson, in 1921. Through positions with the
Israel Labor Federation and World Zionist Organization, Meir drew
recognition as a powerful political force. She was elected to the
Knesset in 1949, appointed minister of labor that same year and
then minister of foreign affairs in 1956. In 1969, after the sudden
death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, party officials chose Meir,
then 70, as the fourth prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Meir took a hard line toward the Arab world. Her
government refused to stop building settlements in the occupied
Palestinian territories and rejected a peace agreement with Arab
states. But she encouraged emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and
strengthened Israeli ties with the United States. Meir resigned as
prime minister in 1974, in the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur
War, in which Arab attacks caught the country by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: A chain-smoker who rejected makeup, Meir ranked
fourth on the list of women most admired by Americans in a 1969
poll. David Ben-Gurion once called her ``the only man in my
Cabinet.'' Meir had two children and was, by several accounts, an
accomplished cook.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   3. ISABEL PERON, born 1931
</P>
<P>
   President of Argentina, 1974-1976, not to be confused with Eva
Peron, a k a Evita, the popular demagogue and second wife of Gen.
Juan Peron.
</P>
<P>
   Political background: The third wife of Juan Peron, Isabel Peron
met her future husband in the mid-1950s while working as a dancer.
Gen. Peron recently had been ousted as the ruler of Argentina, and
she became his personal secretary, settling with him in Madrid.
They were married in 1961 when he was 65 and she was 30. Through
several diplomatic visits to Argentina, Isabel paved the way for
her husband's triumphant return in 1973, when he was re-elected
president and she assumed the vice presidency. Less than a year
later, Juan Peron died of heart failure, and Isabel came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Like Evita before her, Isabel championed the causes
of Argentine women, but could not overcome the economic and
political strife in her country. Her government imposed martial law
and saw inflation rise to 200 percent, which led to crippling union
strikes. A military junta overthrew her regime in 1976, and she
eventually went into exile in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Isabel Peron is said to have believed in
astrology and enjoy fencing. Unlike Evita, she was shy and often
compared negatively with her husband's second wife. A 1973 profile
in Time magazine commented that she sometimes appeared ``as if she
had been laminated in plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   4. CORAZON AQUINO, born 1933
</P>
<P>
   President of the Philippines, 1986-1992
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Aquino was born to a wealthy family with
political ties and schooled at convents in the United States. She
married Benigno Aquino in 1954, raised five children and watched
her husband's political career take off. When Ferdinand Marcos
declared martial law in 1972, he jailed his political nemesis,
Benigno, for nearly eight years before allowing the Aquinos to flee
to the United States. In 1983, Benigno returned to the Philippines
and was gunned down at the Manila Airport; Corazon vowed to
continue his work, and in 1986 forced Marcos into exile in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: During her tumultuous tenure, Aquino restored some
civil rights and released political prisoners, while her government
survived at least seven coup attempts. Her presidency inspired a
renaissance in the arts in her country and renewed international
economic interest in the Philippines, although critics said she
didn't advance the country economically as much as she might have.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: The petite Aquino, 65, is a devout Roman
Catholic who found the Marcos' opulent presidential palace
uncomfortably extravagant and set up an office in the guest house
of her more modest home.
</P>
<P>
   5. MARGARET THATCHER, born 1925
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of Great Britain, 1979-1990
</P>
<P>
   Political background: With an eye to his daughter's political
future, the lower-middle-class father of Margaret Thatcher paid for
his daughter to take extra lessons in the classics and Latin. At
Oxford, she studied chemistry and became involved in Conservative
Party politics. After marrying, giving birth to twins and
practicing law, she ran for Parliament in a wealthy suburb of
London and held the seat from 1959 to 1992. In 1975, she took the
reins of the Conservative Party, and four years later was elected
prime minister on a platform of abolishing the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Thatcherism, the prime minister's major contribution
to political science, not only encompassed her policies but her
style. ``Under her forceful, if sometimes strident, leadership, the
Conservatives accomplished what no previous British government in
the postwar period had done: They emasculated the unions,
denationalized important industries, curbed inflation and swelled
the ranks of the middle class,'' according to Current Biography
Yearbook. Meanwhile, unemployment soared and the gap between the
haves and have-nots grew.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Since her resignation, Baroness Thatcher has
written her memoirs and continues to weigh in on matters of state.
She recently came out against the extradition of Chilean Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and, as of December, was still the
fourth-most-admired woman by Americans, according to a Gallup Poll,
right after No. 3, Elizabeth Dole.

</P>
<P>
   6. MARY EUGENIA CHARLES, born 1919
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 1980 to 1995
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Charles was born in 1919 on the eastern
Caribbean island of Dominica and received her bachelor's degree
from the University of Toronto and her law degree from the London
School of Economics and Political Science in the 1940s. She
returned to Dominica, becoming the first female lawyer on the
island. Her involvement in politics culminated in election to the
House of Assembly in 1975, as leader of the opposition Freedom
Party (the country achieved independence from Britain in 1978).
Charles' harsh criticism of the Labor Party government was
partially responsible for the resignation of Prime Minister Patrick
John, whom she succeeded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Dominica was a founding member of the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States in 1981. In 1983, Charles requested that
the United States send troops to another OECS member nation,
Grenada, to thwart an overthrow of that country's government by
leftist extremists. The invasion drew criticism from the United
Nations. A forceful presence, Charles is nicknamed the Iron Lady of
the Caribbean. Her detractors claimed Charles, a fiscal
conservative, ran the country too much like a business, with little
regard for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: She was the granddaughter of a former slave, and
Charles' father was a successful fruit exporter who lived to be
107. In 1994, she told an interviewer that the person she admired
most in the world was Golda Meir.
</P>
<P>
   7. VIGDIS FINNBOGADOTTIR, born 1930
</P>
<P>
   President of Iceland, 1980 to 1996
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Finnbogadottir studied drama and
literature at the Sorbonne in France and in 1972 was appointed
director of the Reykjavik Theater Company. She hosted a television
series on drama and lectured on Icelandic culture before becoming
the chairwoman of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Affairs in
1978. At the time, women's issues were coming to the fore, and
colleagues persuaded Finnbogadottir to make a run for the
presidency. She won her first four-year term, beating four male
opponents, in 1980. She ran unopposed in 1984 and in 1992; in 1988
she won the presidency with 92 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Although the presidency in Iceland is more a
ceremonial role than a political one, Finnbogadottir has championed
numerous causes including Icelandic culture and reforestation. She
founded the Save the Children Association of Iceland and in 1995
was the keynote speaker at the UN Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: In 1972, Finnbogadottir became a single parent
after adopting a baby girl. She remains a national icon since
leaving office, and is now co-founder of the Council of Women World
Leaders based at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   8. MARY ROBINSON, born 1944
</P>
<P>
   President of Ireland, 1990 to 1997
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Robinson's activism evolved at a young
age: While at an exclusive Catholic boarding school, Robinson
petitioned for the right to read the Protestant Irish Times. She
graduated from Harvard Law School in 1968 and became the first
woman to be a faculty member at Trinity College Dublin, where she
began working to improve the lives of women through the law. She
fought for the right of women to sit on juries, for laws protecting
illegitimate children and for gay rights. Upon her election to the
Senate in 1969 (she was only 25 years old), she introduced a bill
to legalize contraceptives. In 1989, she resigned from the Senate,
only to accept the Labor party's nomination as its presidential
candidate the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: As in Iceland, the Irish presidency is a largely
symbolic post. But Robinson's victory seemed ``to symbolize
Ireland's desire for genuine change, given her stands on such
charged issues as abortion and reproductive rights, which have been
anathema to other Irish leaders. ... Mary Robinson has indeed used
her title to promote tolerance, compassion and national debate,''
according to ``A Rising Public Voice: Women in Politics
Worldwide,'' edited by Alida Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Upon her entry into politics, Robinson was
derided for what some considered a lackluster personal appearance.
When she became president, she underwent an image makeover.
Robinson resigned the presidency in September 1997 to become United
Nations human rights commissioner. She was succeeded as president
by Mary McAleese.

   9. VIOLETA CHAMORRO, born 1929
</P>
<P>
   President of Nicaragua, 1990-1997
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Born into a wealthy, landowning family,
Chamorro was schooled in San Antonio and Virginia. Back in
Nicaragua, she married Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, an activist against
the Somoza dictatorship and scion of the family that owned the
liberal La Prensa newspaper. His articles consistently landed him
in jail. Pedro was ultimately assassinated by the right-wing
dictatorship in 1978, and Violeta took over the newspaper. When the
Somoza government fled, Daniel Ortega's Sandinista party became the
dominant political force, and Chamorro became an outspoken
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Her political defeat of Ortega ended 10 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Chamorro's presidency faced significant challenges,
including rising unemployment, strikes and continued fighting
between Sandinista militants and rebellious contras. Her most vocal
critic was Sen. Jesse Helms, who accused her of selling out to the
Sandinistas and who threatened to withhold financial aid to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Chamorro ``was very symbolic of the unity of
Nicaragua,'' said Liswood, of the Council of Women World Leaders.
``She had four children, two Sandinistas and two contras.''
Chamorro's autobiography, titled ``Dreams of the Heart,'' received
generally favorable reviews in the United States when it was
published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   10. INDIRA GANDHI, born 1917
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister of India, 1966 to 1977 and 1980 to 1984
</P>
<P>
   Political background: Indira Gandhi, the only child of
Jawaharlal Nehru _ India's first prime minister, from 1947 to 1964
_ was enmeshed in Indian politics from her earliest years. Although
she was not related to India's spiritual leader Mohandas Gandhi, he
was close to her father and encouraged her involvement in the
resistance movement against British rule. Because her mother had
died in 1936, Gandhi became India's ``first lady'' during her
father's government, accompanying him on trips and gaining a
prominent political reputation. In 1959, one year before the death
of her husband, Feroze Gandhi, she was elected president of the
Congress Party, the second-highest political position in the
country. When Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru's
successor, died in 1966, Gandhi was elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Known for: In the early 70s, Gandhi was said to be perhaps the
most popular leader in the world, although her term was not so
rosy. Under Gandhi, India exploded its first nuclear device.
Although she promised to abolish poverty, she was also beholden to
the rich for her power base. In the mid-'70s, Gandhi limited
personal freedoms and began jailing political rivals. In response,
she was voted out of office in 1977, but regained power in 1979.
When her son and heir-designate, Sanjay, died in a plane crash, she
began grooming son Rajiv as her successor. In 1984, after ordering
a violent raid on a Sikh temple, she was assassinated by two of her
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Personal facts: Gandhi wrote in her autobiography, ``To a woman,
motherhood is the highest fulfillment,'' and the Nehru-Gandhi
dynasty continues to play a vital role in India's politics.
Although Rajiv, who followed his mother as prime minister, was
assassinated in 1991, his widow, Sonia, now chairs the opposition
Congress party.

A MILLENNIAL ANGST FOR PARTICLE PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill., Mass.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the directors of all three of the world's preeminent particle
accelerators retire this year, hopes are high that technical
advances they helped to bring about will lead to major discoveries.
But all three agree that high-energy physics is facing an uncertain
long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   And although American particle physicists will continue to do
trail-blazing research, the directors agreed, hundreds of American
scientists have already moved to European laboratories and more
will certainly follow.
</P>
<P>
   The three retiring administrators _ Dr. Burton Richter of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, or SLAC, in California; Dr.
John Peoples Jr. of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
known as Fermilab, in Illinois, and Dr. Christopher Llewellyn
Smith, a Briton, of the European Laboratory for Particle Physics,
known as CERN, near Geneva, agreed in interviews that the field
faced enormous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate prospects for particle physics seem as exciting as
ever. But the expense of building new high-energy machines runs to
billions of dollars, and the era of giant particle accelerators may
be approaching its twilight.
</P>
<P>
   Machines that smashed subatomic particles together at energies
like that of the Big Bang greatly expanded the horizons of
physicists, cosmologists and philosophers in the past few decades,
and in the near future they are likely to answer some intriguing
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: What is it that endows all matter with mass? Is
there an underlying framework in the universe that ties together
gravity with the other forces of nature? Do supposedly fundamental
particles like quarks and leptons actually have internal structure?
What is the mechanism that created more matter than antimatter in
the universal creation event, so that enough matter was left over
after the mutual annihilation to build the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Physicists hope that answers to these and other puzzles will
emerge from the handful of accelerator laboratories working at the
frontiers of physics. But the big question is whether the world's
governments are willing to spend the money for such knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Existing accelerator projects are maintaining the research
momentum in the United States. Both SLAC and Fermilab, which have
been upgrading their accelerators, are still making important
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2005, a proton accelerator with a circumference of 17
miles, the Large Hadron Collider, is to begin operating at CERN.
From then on, particle physicists agree, the center of high-energy
research will shift to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because the retiring directors have presided over a critical
period of accelerator physics, colleagues regard their passing as
bench marks.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, 67, will leave the directorship of SLAC on Aug. 31
after 15 years as chief. While in his 30s, he pioneered the
development of colliding-beam accelerators, in which opposing beams
of particles slam into each other head-on, creating showers of
debris and new particles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, using beams of electrons and antielectrons, or
positrons, Richter discovered a particle that came to be called
Psi/J. It contained two quarks possessing a previously unknown
flavor called charm. For this discovery, Richter and Dr. Samuel
C.C. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shared the
1976 Nobel Prize in Physics.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples, 66, director of Fermilab, will retire on June 30 after
28 years there, 10 as director. Peoples directed the development of
a source of antiprotons for use in the colliding beams of
Fermilab's gigantic Tevatron accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years his main concern has been building a new
main injector for the Tevatron, which will soon increase the flow
of particles in the opposing beams from a trickle to torrents. The
more particles a beam contains the greater the likelihood of
collisions with particles in the opposing beam _ collisions that
yield discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The Tevatron is the world's highest energy particle accelerator,
and when protons collide with antiprotons inside its detectors,
they do so at energies just under two trillion electronvolts. The
stupendous power of the Tevatron made possible the 1995 discovery
of the top quark _ the last of six flavors of quarks predicted by
the standard model theory of particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   The Tevatron will remain the most powerful accelerator in the
world until CERN's Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, opens. This
accelerator will be seven times more powerful than the Tevatron and
is expected to yield a flood of discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The director of CERN for the past five years, Dr. Llewellyn
Smith, 56, retired on Jan. 1, and is now the provost of University
College of London University. Among his major accomplishments was
persuading the 19 member governments and many collaborating
nations, including the United States, to pull together to build the
collider, which will cost about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already spent about that amount on its own
54-mile-circumference Superconducting Supercollider, or SSC, in
Texas when Congress canceled the project in 1993. The project's
demise marked the shift in high-energy particle physics from the
United States to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American physicists began flocking to Geneva to work on the new
collider. The Large Hadron Collider will have only a third of the
energy the SSC was designed to achieve, but from 2005 on, the LHC
will be, as one physicist put it, ``the only game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that getting the LHC going was critical, because it
came in the aftermath of the supercollider cancellation,''
Llewellyn Smith said. ``If that had failed it could have spelled
the end of our field, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, 590 American scientists and engineers _ more than
two-thirds of them refugees from the defunct American SSC _ are
working on the new European machine. The American contingent, about
15 percent of the total, is the largest in the LHC collaboration;
the next largest are the Italian group, with 467 scientists, and
the French, with 411.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples of Fermilab simultaneously served for a year presiding
over the dismantling of the embryonic SSC and dismissing hundreds
of employees while trying to find new jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
   All three directors agreed that the cost of large accelerators
that might follow Europe's LHC in the next century would be
staggering and would have to be shared among many nations. But they
called into question America's willingness to join such
collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a very bad reputation as an
international partner now,'' Richter said, ``particularly since the
fiasco over the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, an experimental fusion reactor, had the support of
the United States, Russia, Japan and Europe. About $1 billion was
spent on the project in the past decade. On Sept. 22, Bill
Richardson, the secretary of Energy, signed what his department
called ``a unilateral agreement extending United States support for
international fusion collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., who heads the House
Science Committee, announced that he would not support further
expenditures on the international reactor aside from those needed
to close down the project, which now appears to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he condemned the reactor as unacceptably
expensive and unpromising. After spending more than 10 years and $1
billion, he said, the parties had designed a fusion device that was
unaffordable. He said it was clear the device would not be build.
``The project failed and it's time to move forward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as a rude shock to America's science partners
abroad, Richter of SLAC said. ``The Japanese are really steaming
over that,'' he said. ``They look on Washington's attitude toward
international scientific collaboration as something like Lucy and
the football _ raising expectations and then yanking them away.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAC has an agreement with Japan's particle physics laboratory,
KEK, by which the two institutions will design and perhaps build a
new accelerator some 22 miles long, in which beams of electrons and
positrons, each speeding along a straight track at an energy of
about one trillion electronvolts, will collide. But Japan's
disenchantment with the United States as a collaborator is likely
to affect the project, Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   CERN's Llewellyn Smith, who enlisted the financial and
scientific cooperation of the United States, Japan, Canada, Russia,
India and Israel along with the 19 CERN members for building the
Large Hadron Collider, agreed that dealing with Washington presents
special problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly true that in the negotiations that I've been
involved in, dealing with the United States was the hardest,''
Llewellyn Smith said, even though the British and German
governments balked at the LHC budget at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the United States is that you can't tell who
decides things in Washington,'' he added. ``We foreigners are
supposed to deal with the administration, but you must deal with
the Congress or you get nowhere. So, as director of CERN, I spent a
lot of time taking a crash course in American politics and I still
don't know who makes the decisions, although I guess it's
Sensenbrenner.''

THREE MEN AND A PAINTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Art'' is the mouse that roared.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving with little fanfare, French playwright Yasmina Reza's
seemingly slight comedy about three middle-age friends who feud
over a work of modern art became one of the most enduringly
hard-to-get tickets in London and New York _ a level of popularity
that is almost unheard of these days among spoken-word plays.
</P>
<P>
   In London, it opened in 1996 with an all-star cast (Albert
Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott), changing actors every few
months and attracting return visits. The American-debut production,
which featured an unusual if talented Anglo-American cast _ Alan
Alda, Victor Garber and British actor Alfred Molina _ became an
instant Broadway hit when it opened last March. It has captured
almost every major British and American prize, including a
best-play Tony and an Olivier Award for best comedy.
</P>
<P>
   That success prompted a furious behind-the-scenes battle for
West Coast debut rights. Finally, the show's producers, including
actor Sean Connery, decided the best ``Art'' for California was the
New York version. Alda, Garber and Molina reprise their roles in
the production opening tonight at the Doolittle Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Alda plays the supercilious Marc, the eldest of the three. When
his friend, Serge (Garber), buys an artwork that consists of
nothing more than white paint on canvas, Marc can't contain his
contempt. He sees Serge's purchase as an act of aesthetic
gullibility; worse, it symbolizes a rupture in what Marc perceives
to be a mentor-student relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Their disagreement escalates into a battle that explores the
very nature and limitations of male friendship. Molina's affable
Yvan at first tries to be the referee but soon gets caught up in a
three-way struggle of ego, pride and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Alda admits to being somewhat surprised at the play's New York
reception, although he was convinced of its quality from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if American audiences would take to it the way
other audiences had, although I also didn't know at that time that
it was as big a hit around the world as it was. I thought it had
just played in Paris and London. I found out later that it had
already played in about 80 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew was that it was one of the best plays I'd ever
read. It didn't really matter to me if audiences liked it as much
as I did. I just wanted to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not completely. Many critics and observers have said
that no trio of red-blooded American guys would be caught dead
arguing about such highfalutin topics as deconstruction and the
aesthetics of modern art. Push us beyond the holy trinity of male
conversational topics _ money, women and sports _ and we're out at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Such a quirk is part of the play's essential Frenchness, but it
doesn't get in the way of Americans' enjoyment of it, Alda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, there are plenty of American men who wouldn't talk like
that. But the fact is it's written about three French guys. I think
deconstruction is an idea that even well-educated Americans would
tend to leave out of their conversation. But it would mean more to
Frenchmen, since it's a French movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber thinks ``Art's'' enduring popularity stems, in part, from
the many levels of insight and interpretation it offers. It means
different things to different people, he said. &QL;

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suspect that my most egregious lapse in healthful living is
widely shared: Knowing that I might lose my teeth in the coming
decades is not enough to get me to floss every night. I do endure
thrice-yearly periodontal cleanings and admonishments to do a
better job on a daily basis, but still that 18-inch strip of string
does not always find its proper mark before the day is done. Even
watching the misery my husband suffered in adjusting to dentures
was not enough to sustain a nightly habit of flossing.
</P>
<P>
   But I have recently learned that there is a lot more than tooth
preservation to worry about. Recent findings indicate that
periodontal disease may precipitate or aggravate health problems
elsewhere in the body. Perhaps the emerging information about the
relationship between periodontal disease and these serious, and
sometimes fatal, ailments will motivate more of us, including yours
truly, to pay more attention to the health of the gums and bone
that support our teeth.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 species of bacteria live in the human mouth, where
some can infect the gums and underlying bone that support the
teeth. Gingivitis, an infection that sometimes renders the gums
tender and susceptible to bleeding when they are irritated, is
generally the first stage of periodontitis, a disease that afflicts
millions of Americans. As many as half of high school students have
gingivitis. Gradually, as infected gums pull away from the teeth,
ever-deepening pockets form that allow the infection to spread and
eat away the underlying bone, causing teeth to loosen in their
sockets. About 15 percent of American adults have advanced
periodontitis and are in danger of losing their teeth. In fact,
most adults over 60 in this country have lost all their teeth,
primarily due to periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, recent studies show that teeth are not the only organs
endangered by this oral disease. Infections in tissues of the mouth
are easily spread into the bloodstream. Even brushing, flossing and
chewing can prompt a bodywide invasion when periodontal disease is
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of gum disease in terms of their teeth, but they
don't think about the fact that gum disease is a serious infection
that can release bacteria into the bloodstream,'' said Dr. Robert
Genco, editor of the Journal of Periodontology and professor of
oral biology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. ``The
end result could mean additional health risks for people whose
health is already affected by other diseases _ or lead to serious
complications like heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, a spurious link between periodontal disease and
rheumatoid arthritis prompted dentists to extract all of a person's
teeth in hopes of curing the arthritis. This mistaken belief
virtually halted for many decades any serious research into the
relationship between periodontitis and other diseases. But its
recent revival is yielding some frightening links to such problems
as heart disease and strokes, diabetes, pneumonia and premature
births.
</P>
<P>
   HEART DISEASE _ All other things being equal, people with
periodontal disease are one and a half to two times as likely to
suffer a fatal heart attack and nearly three times as likely to
suffer a stroke as those without this oral disease. The association
with heart disease is especially strong in people under 50. Studies
have indicated that chronic oral infections can foster the
development of clogged arteries and blood clots. Substances
produced by oral bacteria that enter the bloodstream can
precipitate a chain of reactions that result in a build-up of
arterial deposits. And several common oral bacteria can initiate
the formation of blood clots and disrupt cardiac function.
</P>
<P>
   DIABETES _ It has long been known that diabetes predisposes
people to bacterial infections, including infections of oral
tissues. But recent studies strongly indicate that periodontitis
can make diabetes worse. Diabetic patients with severe
periodontitis have greater difficulty maintaining normal blood
sugar levels, and treatment of periodontitis often results in a
reduced need for insulin. Experts now urge that periodontal
inflammation be treated and eliminated in all people with diabetes,
especially since such treatment may reduce the risk of injury to
the retina and arteries that is a common consequence of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   PNEUMONIA _ Bacterial pneumonia results when bacteria that live
in the mouth and throat are inhaled into the lungs where immune
defenses fail to wipe them out. Several agents that cause pneumonia
can thrive in infected oral tissues of people with periodontal
disease. And, other respiratory diseases, like chronic bronchitis
and emphysema, may be worsened by oral infections when the invading
bacteria are inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   PREMATURE BIRTH _ It has long been known that infections of the
pelvic organs can precipitate premature labor and the birth of
small babies. Infections lead to high levels of substances like
prostaglandin E-2 that can induce labor. There is increasing
evidence that oral infections, too, can induce premature labor.
Periodontal bacteria produce molecules that also prompt the release
of labor-inducing substances like prostaglandin. One small study
found that mothers of prematurely born small babies were seven
times more likely to have advanced periodontal disease as mothers
whose babies were normal weight at birth, even though all mothers
in the study were not otherwise at risk of having a premature baby.
What is needed is a study to determine whether treatment of
periodontal disease in pregnant women can reduce the risk of
premature birth.
</P>
<P>
   INFECTIONS _ People with artificial joints and heart valves are
at increased risk of suffering a serious infection when periodontal
bacteria enter the bloodstream. For those with artificial heart
valves, the infection can be fatal unless promptly and thoroughly
treated with antibiotics. This is why dentists routinely prescribe
antibiotics to such patients before initiating dental work.
</P>
<P>
   What You Can Do
</P>
<P>
   Of course, prevention is always the best bet. It starts with
building and protecting one's bones. This means having enough
calcium in the diet to maximize bone development before age 30,
when gradual bone loss begins. People with osteoporosis lose bone
in the mouth as well as the hips and spine, and postmenopausal
women who do not take hormone replacement have a greatly increased
risk of periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention also means establishing a routine of daily brushing
and flossing and a professional periodontal cleaning at least once
a year _ or more often, if your mouth readily forms dental plaque.
Keep in mind that early stages of periodontal disease often produce
no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Periodontology provides information
about the link between gum disease and other diseases through a
toll-free number, (800) 356-7736, and on its Web site _
www.perio.org _ where an academy periodontist will answer
questions.

<P>
   For Jill Farwell, a Los Angeles public relations executive,
pushing herself is almost as natural as breathing. So two years
ago, when she discovered a passion for competitive rowing, she went
full-throttle, training for up to two hours at a time on either an
ergometer or in a boat. But after eight months of almost-daily
workouts, her rowing pace began to slip _ not improve. ``I couldn't
understand why my body couldn't match my drive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustion became her constant companion. ``My muscles were
tired all the time. I felt like my blood was running in slow
motion,'' she recalled. One day after a particularly strenuous boat
practice she had to lie down on the dock for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Ms. Farwell consulted a naturopathic physician, who
told her she had overdone it and ordered her to stop exercising.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans put ``exercise more'' at the top of their
resolutions, but for a small group of people like Ms. Farwell,
working out too much is the real problem, according to a consensus
statement issued by the American College of Sports Medicine and the
United States Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which advises coaches and athletes to stay alert to
the symptoms of overtraining, is summarized in the January issue of
The Sports Medicine Bulletin, published by the sports medicine
college. The report appears in full on the organization's Web site
(www.acsm.org).
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of exercising too hard for too long is ``an
unexpected drop in performance that is not reversed by brief rest
periods,'' explained Dr. Jack Raglin, a kinesiologist at Indiana
University and a co-author of the report. Athletes suffering from
what is called ``the staleness syndrome'' are likely to experience
other symptoms like poor sleep, loss of appetite, upper respiratory
infections and muscle fatigue. ``Severe mood disturbances are
common, and it has been reported that more than 80 percent of stale
athletes suffer from clinical depression,'' Raglin said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of studies conducted by Dr. William Morgan of the
University of Wisconsin found that about 60 percent of elite
distance runners would experience staleness at some point in their
careers. For competitive but not elite runners, the figures are
around 33 percent. No statistics exist for staleness in more casual
athletes, but ``we've all seen it,'' Raglin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of becoming stale is related to the volume of
training,'' Raglin added. A dose-response relationship between the
hours spent working out and mood disturbances has been documented
in swimmers, speed skaters, wrestlers, rowers and runners, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very American: People think, if I work harder than anyone
else, I'll be faster than everyone,'' said Dr. Joel Stager, the
director of the human performance laboratory of Indiana University.
``But it's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts recommend periodization, a regimen that builds in
recovery time and is intended to prevent the symptoms of
overtraining. Athletes are advised to alternate two-week cycles of
hard and easier workouts, while gradually increasing the training
volume until it peaks a few weeks before a major competition. Then
the athlete tapers off, reducing the training to allow the muscles
to recover from the stress. ``If you do this perfectly, you won't
get stale,'' Raglin said.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur competitive swimmer, for instance, might swim an
average of 3,500 yards a day at peak training, then gradually taper
off three weeks before a meet to 1,000 yards a day, according to
Stager, who is the editor of The Journal of Swimming Research.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts note that few amateur athletes actually follow
this kind of regimen. A survey done by Stager at a United States
Masters Swimming meet last year found that the competitors train a
consistent distance from month to month rather than the fluctuating
amounts called for by periodization.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``the technique is more art than science,'' Raglin said.
Periodization routines that prevent staleness in one person may
cause it in another one with less tolerance for high doses of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The only known solution for the staleness syndrome is rest,
usually for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Farwell found discontinuing her workouts very difficult but
ultimately rewarding. After an eight-month break, she was strong
enough to return to her favorite sport. ``I do about one-third of
what I did before. I feel 100 percent better. My mood and energy
are up. And I haven't been sick in over a year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, of course, do not have to worry about staleness.
``It takes a special kind of mind to overtrain,'' said Buz Tarlow,
the head coach at the Southern California Boat Club in Marina Del
Rey, Calif. ``It's hard to get there. Your weekend warrior does not
see it.''

BRITAIN'S COW ILLNESS IS ISSUE IN DONATING OF BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>

 By WARREN LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientific advisory panel is asking the Food and
Drug Administration to consider a basic question: Should a past
travel itinerary help determine who is eligible to donate blood?
</P>
<P>
   The panel wants the agency to examine the possibility of barring
blood donations from people who have lived in or visited Great
Britain since 1980 because of concerns about mad cow disease. Most
reported cases of this fatal animal disease, and a human variant,
have occurred in the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   Because such a move could have a huge impact on blood collection
in the United States, the panel asked the FDA and blood supply
groups to survey donors and assess the ramifications of blocking
perhaps hundreds of thousands of current contributors from giving
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no evidence that a human version of mad cow
disease is transmitted through blood or blood products, and there
are no recorded cases of the human disease in the United States,
experts on the panel said they were concerned about the possibility
that a link between blood and the disease could arise.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of transmitting the disease through blood appears to be
very low, said a panel member, Dr. Donald S. Burke, the director of
the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University
School of Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we don't want to find ourselves in a position where
we didn't take the problem seriously and it crops up as a major
health issue 10 or 20 years later,'' Burke said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the criticism leveled at health authorities over AIDS
by those who contend the epidemic might have been mitigated if the
disease had been taken more seriously and fought more aggressively
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is
believed to be caused by infectious protein particles called
prions, perhaps with the aid of viruses or other agents. The
disease kills brain cells, leaving the organ full of holes and
resembling a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   A small percentage of people develop a similar condition,
usually late in life, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which
appears to be hereditary in many cases but sometimes occurs in
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, 34 people have come down with what is called new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which afflicts a younger
population than the traditional condition. Some scientists suspect
that the new illness is a variation of the animal disease, which
may be transferred to humans from contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last month, the agency advisory committee on
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, which is composed of
medical and veterinary experts, voted 9-6 to consider blocking
blood donations from people who had spent time in Britain in the
height of the mad cow outbreak and, therefore, may have been
exposed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the American Red Cross told the panel that
preliminary surveys of donors indicated that barring blood
donations by people who lived or traveled in Britain would reduce
the nation's blood supply by 10 percent and require recruiting as
many as one million donors.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members say that before they take up the matter again at a
meeting this spring, when they are likely to vote on a formal
recommendation to the agency, they need more information on the
impact of such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides worries about the effects on blood availability in this
country, panelists said they were concerned about the impact on
rejected donors and the perceptions they might harbor over their
individual risks of disease.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of time spent in Britain. Would a
person who passed through a British airport or someone who spent a
weekend in London be ineligible to donate blood? Or would living in
the country for several weeks or months be required?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Flutes and their kin, including whistles, ocarinas, recorders
and pipe organs, are among music's oldest and most versatile
instruments. Yet science has long had trouble understanding all but
the most elementary aspects of how they work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, researchers are starting to learn some of the
secrets. In a way, science is glimpsing the soul of a very old
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The tardiness may seem surprising. After all, the scientific
revolution has been rolling along for centuries and has made great
progress in understanding time, space, matter and life, to name a
few basics. The physics of wind instruments would seem to be passe.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the methods of science work exceedingly
well in some fields and poorly or not at all in others. There are
more mysteries than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   The new insights center on how jets, eddies and waves of air
pressure come together at the heart of such wind instruments to
form the complex vibrations heard as agreeable tones. Such
turbulence is now being photographed and parts of it modeled
mathematically with rigor. Even so, the analyses are still sketchy
and limited by gaps and approximations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These instruments seem very simple,'' said Marc-Pierre Verge,
a leader of the research. ``But from a physical point of view,
they're very complicated, much more so than the piano or violin.''
</P>
<P>
   The new insights are nonetheless plentiful enough to help music
professionals make better reproductions of old wind instruments,
such as Baroque recorders, and to invent new ones, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The advances also are aiding electronic music, including that of
synthesizers, organs, home computers, games and movies. The goal is
to make artificial tones more realistic and, in other cases, to
create sounds and instruments that have no counterpart in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, scientists can now make a virtual flute of almost
any size and shape, its tube curled or a hundred feet long. Notes
can be very low and sometimes very strange.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics giants such as Yamaha, the Japanese maker of musical
instruments, are incorporating some of the advances into products.
The research is global, with work being done in Japan, Europe and
Canada as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that the physics of flutes and similar wind
instruments is a challenging final frontier, despite the field's
long history and recent strides. Julius O. Smith III, a Stanford
University expert on music, called the theoretics of wind
instruments ``perhaps the most slippery in all of musical
acoustics.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry R. Cook, a Princeton professor of music and computer
science who works on flute simulations, said progress of late had
been ``really profound,'' especially because European studies are
illuminating what had previously been hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been scratching their heads about this stuff since
at least Pythagoras and probably before,'' Cook said. ``Aristotle
had a theory. So did lots of acoustics guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutes, whistles and kindred instruments date to humanity's
early days, when they were used in hunting, signaling, magic and
ritual. The Maya and Incas made flutes of clay that modern scholars
have found to be surprisingly complex in tone and construction.
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, wood recorders
evolved rapidly, with bores becoming tapered and tubes made of two
or more interconnecting parts. The more elaborate recorders had a
wide range of pitch, volume and color tone, allowing them to come
alive in expert hands.
</P>
<P>
   By the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, large organs in
cathedrals had many hundreds of pipes and a spectrum of tonal
characteristics. They were among the age's most complex machines,
rivaled only by clocks.
</P>
<P>
   In general, members of the family work by directing a stream of
air against a sharp edge, which causes the jet to pulsate back and
forth, creating waves of sound. The family is thus commonly known
as jet or edge winds.
</P>
<P>
   With some instruments, such as the flute, pan pipe and soda
bottle, the player's lips and skill are central to forming the flow
of air, which must be fast but even. With other edge instruments,
such as whistles, recorders and the flue pipes of organs, the
forming job is done by a smooth duct.
</P>
<P>
   For the family as a whole, experts have long known that the
basic pitch is determined by the length of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, great scientists have probed the subtleties
of such instruments, especially the origin of the sound and what
controls its tonal qualities. But the job is very hard. As Lord
Rayleigh, an English physicist, showed in 1896, the flow of one gas
or fluid past another (or of air moving through still surroundings)
is unstable, producing the kinds of swirls seen in puffs of
cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   For string instruments, the job is much easier. A plucked string
produces waves of vibrations that are easy to see, study and model
mathematically, so much so that beginning students of physics often
do such analyses to develop their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The math models are extremely good'' for string instruments,
said Smith of Stanford. But for many of the winds, he added,
``you're on thin ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the edge family's many puzzles, music scientists have
made some analytic headway in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s to the 1980s, researchers did so mainly by
simplifying the problem to its bare bones. For instance, a math
simulation of a flute would assume that the instrument had only one
dimension, length, rather than the usual three. And the analysis
would focus on the instrument's overall characteristics, rather
than the riddle of how the sounds start and evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists would often make ad hoc adjustments to get things
going. Then, by trial and error, and careful listening, they would
test how well the math and computer simulations matched the real
thing, tweaking the model to improve the sound.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Keefe, head of music for the Acoustical Society of
America, said many of these efforts were toylike and produced
relatively crude sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, progress was eventually sufficient to attract companies
that made electronic instruments. For flutes, their products had
often used recorded samples of real sounds. But the companies were
eager to tap the greater flexibility of tone, timbre and quality
that was possible if they had some insight into the real nature of
the sound's generation.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha in the early 1990s drew heavily on Stanford University
flute modelers, including Cook, who later went to Princeton. The
results showed up in such devices as the company's VL1 Virtual
Acoustic Synthesizer, which used physical modeling to create a
variety of instrument sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Flute mimicry evolved rapidly as a European research group found
a way to illuminate many details of the hidden action. The work,
overseen by Avraham Hirschberg, a physicist at the Eindhoven
University of Technology in the Netherlands, was done in concert
with IRCAM, the Institute for Research on Acoustics and Music in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To limit variables, the team zeroed in on recorderlike
instruments, which can be excited by compressed gas rather than
human blowing.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the test apparatus was an 11-inch instrument
resembling the flue pipe of an organ, its central parts made of
glass to permit viewing. For visualizations, carbon dioxide was
found to give the best contrast with surrounding air. The gas was
shot through the pipe's duct, and the resulting jets, whorls and
eddies were photographed up close.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the team was able to take a series of snapshots (and
even movies) that laid things bare, in particular how the sounds
form and develop.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, the team published a series of influential
papers based on analysis of the snapshots. And in 1995, Verge, the
team's leader, who had come from Paris to study with Hirschberg in
the Netherlands, received his Ph.D. from Eindhoven University.
</P>
<P>
   The work, Verge said in an interview, is deeply rooted in the
team's observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by looking at the pictures that we noticed many, many
things that weren't obvious at first,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the team found that much influence was exerted by
tiny vortexes _ little whirlwinds shed from the jet-edge interface
in rising number and complexity as the sound developed. Such eddies
were previously presumed to exist, and some scientists had
suggested that they were key to sound amplification.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eindhoven team, which included Benoit Fabre, from the
Musical Acoustics Laboratory of the University of Paris, found
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The vortexes actually cut the strength of the fundamental, the
root vibration that makes up the instrument's lowest note.
Moreover, the team discovered that the tiny whirls were important
in the rise of harmonics, the vibrations more rapid than the
fundamental that give an instrument much of its tone and
distinctiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the team found that vortex shedding helped trigger the
instrument's first sounds, especially when the note's onset, or
attack, as musicians call it, was fast. An initial eddy that curled
off the sharp edge into the pipe would start a pressure wave that
bounced back and forth in the tube, setting up a feedback loop and
the instrument's main vibratory state.
</P>
<P>
   The research so impressed the Acoustical Society of America, a
professional group, based in Woodbury, N.Y., that it highlighted it
last year in its annual ``World of Sound'' calendar. Splashed atop
November were eight of the Eindhoven team's photographs showing how
a note is rooted in subtle whorls and vortexes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advances, the calendar noted, just how such wind
instruments work ``is still not fully understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Verge said he and some colleagues are turning their insights
into products. In Montreal, they have set up a company, Applied
Acoustics Systems Inc. that in a few months is to release
music-making software based on physical modeling.
</P>
<P>
   Using this software on a computer, a player will be able to be
form flute, string, reed, brass and other kinds of electronic
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Verge said. ``It's like Lego. You have small
blocks and you build what you want. The only limit is your
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Verge added that that he had made virtual flutes more than 30
feet long, some with side tubes branching off in different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some very low tones,'' he said, as well as odd
harmonics.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies and products are increasingly of interest to makers
of synthesizers, organs, home computers, games and movies, all of
whom are eager for sounds that are new and more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Verge said the flute research also had many
industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
   The team's models of turbulent noise and note generation, he
said, have application to industrial design, where ventilation
systems as well as gas and water pipes often develop unwanted
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A last frontier of the field is using the new knowledge to
illuminate how wind instruments old and new are put together,
revealing strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Verge said, ``craftsmen have learned to
exploit subtle acoustical phenomena which make musical instruments
very interesting as study objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschberg, the research team's overseer and an expert in fluid
dynamics at Eindhoven University, said that, despite the increasing
pace of advance, many of those mysteries were likely to remain
unsolved for years, given the nuances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect,'' he said, ``that the details of the physical
differences between fair and excellent instruments will remain
obscure'' far into the future.

 &HT;    GOP URGES CLINTON TO ADDRESS SOCIAL SECURITY IN SPEECH
 &HT;    With UNION.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders urged President Clinton again
Monday to offer specific Social Security reform proposals in
Tuesday night's State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who chairs the House Social
Security subcommittee, asked Clinton in a letter Monday to answer
three specific questions about the nation's retirement system:
</P>
<P>
   _ How he will fix the system to provide as much protection for
``our children and grandchildren as it has for us and our
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Social Security investments in the stock market should
be managed through individual accounts or by the government
investing the program's surplus.
</P>
<P>
   _ How much of the estimated $1.5 trillion federal budget surplus
over the next 10 years will be needed to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw noted that Clinton's State of the Union message last year
set the stage for a year-long discussion of how to reform Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now time for you to fulfill your promise to the nation
and provide your specific ideas for how to get the job done,'' Shaw
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's letter echoed demands by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, that Clinton go first in offering a
detailed plan for making sure Social Security will be able to
continue paying full benefits beyond 2032, when the system's trust
fund is projected to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott sent Clinton a letter urging him to present a
detailed Social Security plan ``as soon as possible'' and offered
to hold a joint House-Senate hearing on March 1 to receive the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Because most Social Security rescue plans require sacrifices
from taxpayers or beneficiaries, both Republicans and Democrats are
eager for the other party to take the lead in suggesting remedies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official declined to comment Monday on what
Clinton will say Tuesday night about Social Security, but aides
have indicated he likely will refine his goals for saving the
program while continuing to reserve the surplus for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal which has been gathering steam within the
administration is using a portion of the budget surplus to set up
individual investment accounts outside the Social Security program.
While this would let the government test such accounts, it would
not solve Social Security's long-term solvency problem unless it
was later coupled with either a tax increase or gradual benefit
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The investment measure is expected to appeal to Republicans,
many of whom have been clamoring for individual accounts, without
alienating Democrats, who have express concern with tinkering with
the existing system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I suspect that my most egregious lapse in healthful living is
widely shared: Knowing that I might lose my teeth in the coming
decades is not enough to get me to floss every night. I do endure
thrice-yearly periodontal cleanings and admonishments to do a
better job on a daily basis, but still that 18-inch strip of string
does not always find its proper mark before the day is done. Even
watching the misery my husband suffered in adjusting to dentures
was not enough to sustain a nightly habit of flossing.
</P>
<P>
   But I have recently learned that there is a lot more than tooth
preservation to worry about. Recent findings indicate that
periodontal disease may precipitate or aggravate health problems
elsewhere in the body. Perhaps the emerging information about the
relationship between periodontal disease and these serious, and
sometimes fatal, ailments will motivate more of us, including yours
truly, to pay more attention to the health of the gums and bone
that support our teeth.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 species of bacteria live in the human mouth, where
some can infect the gums and underlying bone that support the
teeth. Gingivitis, an infection that sometimes renders the gums
tender and susceptible to bleeding when they are irritated, is
generally the first stage of periodontitis, a disease that afflicts
millions of Americans. As many as half of high school students have
gingivitis. Gradually, as infected gums pull away from the teeth,
ever-deepening pockets form that allow the infection to spread and
eat away the underlying bone, causing teeth to loosen in their
sockets. About 15 percent of American adults have advanced
periodontitis and are in danger of losing their teeth. In fact,
most adults over 60 in this country have lost all their teeth,
primarily due to periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, recent studies show that teeth are not the only organs
endangered by this oral disease. Infections in tissues of the mouth
are easily spread into the bloodstream. Even brushing, flossing and
chewing can prompt a bodywide invasion when periodontal disease is
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of gum disease in terms of their teeth, but they
don't think about the fact that gum disease is a serious infection
that can release bacteria into the bloodstream,'' said Dr. Robert
Genco, editor of the Journal of Periodontology and professor of
oral biology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. ``The
end result could mean additional health risks for people whose
health is already affected by other diseases _ or lead to serious
complications like heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, a spurious link between periodontal disease and
rheumatoid arthritis prompted dentists to extract all of a person's
teeth in hopes of curing the arthritis. This mistaken belief
virtually halted for many decades any serious research into the
relationship between periodontitis and other diseases. But its
recent revival is yielding some frightening links to such problems
as heart disease and strokes, diabetes, pneumonia and premature
births.
</P>
<P>
   HEART DISEASE _ All other things being equal, people with
periodontal disease are one and a half to two times as likely to
suffer a fatal heart attack and nearly three times as likely to
suffer a stroke as those without this oral disease. The association
with heart disease is especially strong in people under 50. Studies
have indicated that chronic oral infections can foster the
development of clogged arteries and blood clots. Substances
produced by oral bacteria that enter the bloodstream can
precipitate a chain of reactions that result in a build-up of
arterial deposits. And several common oral bacteria can initiate
the formation of blood clots and disrupt cardiac function.
</P>
<P>
   DIABETES _ It has long been known that diabetes predisposes
people to bacterial infections, including infections of oral
tissues. But recent studies strongly indicate that periodontitis
can make diabetes worse. Diabetic patients with severe
periodontitis have greater difficulty maintaining normal blood
sugar levels, and treatment of periodontitis often results in a
reduced need for insulin. Experts now urge that periodontal
inflammation be treated and eliminated in all people with diabetes,
especially since such treatment may reduce the risk of injury to
the retina and arteries that is a common consequence of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   PNEUMONIA _ Bacterial pneumonia results when bacteria that live
in the mouth and throat are inhaled into the lungs where immune
defenses fail to wipe them out. Several agents that cause pneumonia
can thrive in infected oral tissues of people with periodontal
disease. And, other respiratory diseases, like chronic bronchitis
and emphysema, may be worsened by oral infections when the invading
bacteria are inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   PREMATURE BIRTH _ It has long been known that infections of the
pelvic organs can precipitate premature labor and the birth of
small babies. Infections lead to high levels of substances like
prostaglandin E-2 that can induce labor. There is increasing
evidence that oral infections, too, can induce premature labor.
Periodontal bacteria produce molecules that also prompt the release
of labor-inducing substances like prostaglandin. One small study
found that mothers of prematurely born small babies were seven
times more likely to have advanced periodontal disease as mothers
whose babies were normal weight at birth, even though all mothers
in the study were not otherwise at risk of having a premature baby.
What is needed is a study to determine whether treatment of
periodontal disease in pregnant women can reduce the risk of
premature birth.
</P>
<P>
   INFECTIONS _ People with artificial joints and heart valves are
at increased risk of suffering a serious infection when periodontal
bacteria enter the bloodstream. For those with artificial heart
valves, the infection can be fatal unless promptly and thoroughly
treated with antibiotics. This is why dentists routinely prescribe
antibiotics to such patients before initiating dental work.
</P>
<P>
   What You Can Do
</P>
<P>
   Of course, prevention is always the best bet. It starts with
building and protecting one's bones. This means having enough
calcium in the diet to maximize bone development before age 30,
when gradual bone loss begins. People with osteoporosis lose bone
in the mouth as well as the hips and spine, and postmenopausal
women who do not take hormone replacement have a greatly increased
risk of periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention also means establishing a routine of daily brushing
and flossing and a professional periodontal cleaning at least once
a year _ or more often, if your mouth readily forms dental plaque.
Keep in mind that early stages of periodontal disease often produce
no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Periodontology provides information
about the link between gum disease and other diseases through a
toll-free number, (800) 356-7736, and on its Web site _
www.perio.org _ where an academy periodontist will answer
questions.

   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, about 200 men and women converged on
St. Luke's Church on Hudson Street for the annual Christmas carol
walk. We divided into groups, each heading into the West Village,
song sheets in hand containing all the old-time carols as well as
more newfangled fare like ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   We shrugged off our shyness as we started singing and were soon
spreading Christmas cheer. We sang for diners in an Italian
restaurant and were rewarded with a bottle of wine. We serenaded a
big town house, at which point a couple of pedestrians joined us.
Finally we sang our way down Christopher Street. At a fitness gym,
our serenade fell flat; the members were more in the mood for bench
presses than for us. Somewhat dejected, we continued.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, three stories up one building, a window flew open and
a young woman stuck her head out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sing a carol,'' she said. ``I just moved here and my
parents in Illinois are worried about New York.'' We launched into
``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen'' and looked up to see her holding a
phone receiver out the window. We sang even louder, hoping our
voices would carry up three flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' the woman shouted as we finished. ``My parents
are feeling much better. Merry Christmas.''

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   It was early morning on the 96th Street crosstown bus, so packed
that even standing room was at a premium. A group of sleepy-eyed
prep school students were spread out across the back four or five
seats, schoolbooks spread across their laps, hard at their
homework. This 50-plus-year-old teacher was feeling weaker by the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning toward the nearest teen-ager, I quietly asked if I could
have her seat, explaining that I was feeling a bit weak. She looked
up and told me her teacher would kill her if she didn't turn in
this assignment on time. I leaned down again and with a smile, told
her that I, too, was a teacher, wasn't feeling well and might kill
her first if she didn't have the decency to let me sit for a
minute. She cocked her head. ``Whatever,'' she said, and went back
to her homework.

   On a recent mall trip, Michael Sorum Rockefeller came across a
men's room towel dispenser with a sticker: ``Gambling Anonymous.
Call 1-800'' followed by the numbers. Beneath it, someone had
scrawled ``10-1 they don't answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Arceri was on a crowded car on the Long Island Rail Road
where half the passengers were standing.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman entered the train, standing behind her. A man
in front of her, also standing, suggested that a nearby male
passenger give up his seat for the elderly woman. The man brushed
off the suggestion, at which point Ms. Arceri arose and insisted
that the older woman take her seat. Then she and the man who had
made the original suggestion began discussing their astonishment at
the male passenger's refusal to give up his seat.
</P>
<P>
   At Huntington, their exchange ended as the fellow standee
prepared to get off. ``That was very kind, what you did,'' he said
and slipped something into her pocket. ``Have a drink on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The train emptied nicely. Ms. Arceri found a seat, reached in
her pocket and found a $100 bill.

   My friend Linda's mother, Sis, died after relocating to Naples.
Fla., but before her move her friends had been full of advice about
security measures for women living alone. ``Now Sis,'' one of them
advised, ``be sure to have a can of Mace in the car for your
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Sis was never a carjacking victim. But Linda had to
smile when she looked in the glove compartment not long after her
mother's funeral. There, at the ready, was the small red and white
can that McCormick spices come in _ she had followed the advice
given her. It was, indeed, a can of mace.

SETBACKS RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT CAPTIVE BREEDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.D., Minn., Calif., Ga.)   (af)  
 By MARK DERR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals,
biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican
wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's
Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated
20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to
restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became
extinct in the wild in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year biologists, who have bred from just 5
animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100
in the wild and 240 in captivity, had begun reintroducing the
wolves into the wild again. But whether they can achieve their
goal, and at what cost to the wolves, remain open questions.
</P>
<P>
   Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and
fishing, captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea
for species teetering on the edge of extinction. Zoos began to
promote themselves as latter-day Noah's Arks, capable of preserving
stable, genetically sound populations of rare animals until the
world was ready to welcome them back to a reconstructed nature, be
it a century or more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 80s, the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves,
California condors, and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order
to restore their populations through captive breeding, in
cooperation with zoos, and then return them to their native
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the
world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans
for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene
banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the World Conservation Union's captive breeding
specialist group suggested that the world's zoos could breed and
maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three
other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and
promise of reintroducing captive bred animals. The program to
restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when
officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that
had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey.
</P>
<P>
   With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in
eastern North Carolina, project leaders are seeking suitable
habitat for future releases, but blocks of more than 170,000 acres
with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient
prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, biologists estimate that there are as many as
56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and
adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater
that became extinct in the wild in 1987. And the black-footed
ferret, which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago, is
producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity, primarily
in South Dakota, Montana, and a large breeding operation in
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable.
Although they have bred well in captivity, none of the released
condors has yet reproduced in the wild, and they are particularly
sensitive to lead, which litters the landscape and is toxic to them
in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, a plague is obliterating black-tailed prairie
dogs, the black-footed ferrets' sole food source. Even without the
plague, habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development
and prairie-dog eradication programs.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gober, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist
in Pierre, S.D., said, ``I don't expect the ferret ever to be
recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered
to threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these
programs, captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a
costly, often futile exercise that does little to address the
underlying problems, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, not
to mention poaching and pollutants, that are pushing species toward
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the condor, wolf and ferret programs have already
cost more than $50 million. A five-year, $2.3 million effort
initiated by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association to establish
a captive breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros collapsed in
1993 without producing a single birth or protecting any wild
rhinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noah's Ark theory has no validity,'' said Christopher
Servheen, coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grizzly
bear recovery program and co-chairman of the World Conservation
Union's bear specialist group. ``You're not going to have more
habitat in 50 or 100 years than you do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is
wasteful of individual animals, many of which die because they do
not know how to live outside a cage. Other problems include a lack
of space and resources for preserving populations of animals
indefinitely, the development of behavioral problems in some
species, and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to
genetic abnormalities and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to breed some species, including clouded leopards, wooly
monkeys, African wild dogs, Sumatran rhinos, and the Micronesian
kingfisher, have faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captive-breeding industry creates the idea that we're
techno-fixing the problem,'' said Dale Jamieson, the Henry R. Luce
professor in the human dimensions of global change at Carleton
College in Northfield, Minn. ``In a way it's an elaborate fiction
that allows people to say, `Isn't it great, these animals are being
saved.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vast majority of programs have failed to meet
expectations. In 1994, Benjamin Beck, associate director of the
National Zoological Park in Washington, and three collaborators
found that of 145 documented reintroductions in this century
involving 115 species, only 16 (11 percent) had produced
populations that were sustaining themselves in the wild without
human assistance, and only half of those were endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Successful projects mostly involved herbivores, birds and
reptiles, including the Plains bison, Arabian oryx, bald eagle,
peregrine falcon, wood duck, and Galapagos tortoise.

DAVIS CAMPAIGN STAFF SHAPES POLICY WELL AFTER ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gray Davis, who casts
himself as a Clinton-style moderate Democrat, is following the
president's lead by keeping a close circle of consultants and
pollsters around after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the 365-days-a-year strategy,'' said Bob
Mulholland, a top strategist for the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Clinton and his aides called the ``eternal campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is hardly the first politician to use the strategy.
Presidents since John Kennedy have relied on paid political
consultants. Richard Nixon had a pollster on retainer throughout
his time in office. Big state governors, such as George Pataki of
New York and George W. Bush of Texas, have kept close ties with
their campaign consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In California, former Govs. George Deukmejian sought the advice
of consultants and Pete Wilson used pollsters to test public
response to many of his initiatives. More than 30 years ago, Ronald
Reagan relied on a kitchen cabinet of Republican lawyers and
businessman for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about Davis is he will keep his entire campaign
team intact: campaign manager, pollster and three national media
strategists. Instead of shaping Davis' campaign, the group now will
play a central role in how he governs.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, Davis' sharp-tongued campaign manager, leads the
effort. South, who has earned a reputation as the California
equivalent of James Carville, Clinton's puckish adviser, was chief
of staff when Davis was lieutenant governor and is seen as his
political confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge stakes involved here: This is our first
Democratic governor elected in 20 years and only the fourth in the
entire 20th century (in California),'' South said. ``We can't screw
this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maslin directs the governor's polling. He has worked for
three Democratic presidential campaigns and has advised Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be polling every day or every week or on every
issue,'' Maslin said. But education is one area, he said, where it
will be critical to ``find out how (the public is) responding, what
they are looking for and what their expectations are ... of his
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also will rely on the Washington media firm of Doak,
Carrier, O'Donnell &AMP; Associates. Longtime Democratic strategist
David Doak, who founded the firm, will be a top adviser, as will
Tom O'Donnell, who for eight years was chief of staff to House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Carrier, also a partner in the firm, will continue to
work on communications and fund-raising for Davis. A former top
aide to the Senate majority leader in the Wisconsin Legislature,
Carrier also handles advertising for several major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans twice-weekly conference calls as well as
occasional face-to-face meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the governor wants us to do to help him, we'll assist
in any way,'' O'Donnell said. ``We'll have ideas. Mostly we'll be
at his beck and call, to bounce ideas off of us and to talk
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   One political observer questioned the role of the consultants in
the Davis administration because the advisers are not on the public
payroll nor subject to rules about conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern would be accountability,'' said Ann Crigler,
director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at the University
of Southern California. ``I'm not sure how you go about holding
those people accountable if they are not on the public payroll and
not responsible to anyone's inquiries other than the governor's.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the details have yet to be worked out, the team will be
paid from Davis' campaign account, which held an estimated $2.5
million as of December. The group may also be paid by the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   South dismissed the concern about conflict of interest saying he
and other members of the team would avoid situations that could
embarrass the governor.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the group's best advantage was being outside of
state government. That is why South turned down a job as chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the pay is nothing,'' South said. ``Second, it
puts too many constraints on your activities. If you come to work
for the government full time, you are severely constrained in what
you can do politically, and I don't want that. I'm of more value to
Gray, frankly, on the outside. I'll have more freedom to do what
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the team members works in Sacramento. South lives in
Brentwood, Calif.; Maslin works in Oakland; Carrier lives in
Madison, Wis., and Doak and O'Donnell are based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has turned to the team largely because of its success in
the campaign _ the group helped engineer a surprise June primary
victory over two wealthy Democratic opponents, and his landslide
victory over the Republican candidate, Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each adviser had a role during the campaign: Doak edited
commercials; O'Donnell oversaw advertising and helped in debate
preparation; Carrier helped develop the fund-raising organization;
Maslin directed the polling; and South oversaw day-to-day
operations.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, the group stayed together. They worked
behind the scenes over the inaugural weekend to help write and edit
Davis' inaugural address. They also helped Davis edit and rehearse
his State of the State speech, which was written mostly by the
governor's communications staff.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the former Republican governor, was criticized for
polling on virtually every major issue. Clinton has faced the same
criticism for his use of polling data and focus groups in shaping
his policies.
</P>
<P>
   And some see a danger if Davis relies too much on polls and
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think pollsters provide a very useful function, and many of
them _ and certainly Gray's are _ very skilled and able,'' said
Steve Merksamer, a Republican lawyer and former chief of staff to
Deukmejian. ``But I think it's good for a governor, in addition to
getting political advice, to have seasoned advisers around him to
advise him about what the best policy is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every decision should be made based on what politically is
the right thing to do.''

 UNDATED: Galapagos tortoise.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the National Zoo, Beck is coordinating an international
project that is on the verge of creating a self-sustaining
population of zoo-bred golden lion tamarins in the Atlantic coastal
forests of eastern Brazil. After 14 years of reintroductions, the
project has 228 of the squirrel-sized monkeys in the wild, but
perhaps more significant to the tamarin's survival was the
Brazilian government's creation in 1974 of the Poco das Antas
Biological Reserve north of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   There the remnant wild population has recovered more
spectacularly than the released animals have adapted, so that today
it numbers well over 600.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Beck said, it is better to move wild animals into new
habitats, as was done with wolves in Yellowstone National Park and
the Bitterroot Mountains in 1995, or to concentrate widely
dispersed animals into one or two larger reserves. The wild stock
is healthier and better equipped for survival than its captive-born
kin. ``Reintroduction of captive-bred animals is the tool of choice
in only a few cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, said Donald Lindburg, head of the behavior division
of the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species at the
Zoological Society of San Diego, the most successful candidates are
those who are brought in specifically for return to the wild as
quickly as possible to prevent the development of ``behavioral
distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mammals appear to make the leap from the zoo, albeit with
considerable human assistance and sizable losses, but for the big
cats, great apes, bears, and even rhinos and elephants, familiarity
with humans and ignorance of their own culture is highly
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With chimps and some of these other animals, cultural
transmission of knowledge is vital,'' said Roger Fouts, professor
of psychology and director of the Chimpanzee and Human
Communication Institute at Central Washington University. Many of
them spend years learning how to live in their landscape and for
that reason putting a captive-bred animal in the wild is
``equivalent to dropping a contemporary human being in a remote
area in the 18th or 19th century and saying, `Let's see if you make
it,''' said Bryan G. Norton, professor of environmental public
policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   David Parsons, coordinator of the Mexican wolf recovery project,
says that the wolves released last spring ``figured out how to hunt
a whole lot earlier than I expected, but they didn't figure how to
run from people. They had learned in their pens to move 100 feet
away and stop, and that's what they seem to have done in the wild,
but that doesn't take you out of range of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the hard facts of reintroduction, Michael Hutchins,
director of conservation and science for the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association, has for several years urged member
institutions to modify ``the Noah's Ark paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reintroduction is not the primary reason for captive
breeding,'' he said. Rather, its chief purpose is to allow zoos to
maintain populations of certain ``flagship species'' _
attention-grabbing animals like rhinos, the big cats, primates,
elephants, pandas, and rare and spectacular birds _ that can be
used to raise money for conservation projects in their country of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   By Hutchins' calculations, 93 percent of the mammals and 75
percent of the birds on display in North American zoos were bred in
captivity. Those animals also provide a pool for scientific
research and a sort of living gene bank to guard against extinction
and to supplement fragmented wild populations.
</P>
<P>
   The top zoos have also spent millions of dollars in recent years
to create more naturalistic or parklike environments for their
animals. But critics argue that with no prospect of sending animals
back to the wild, there is scant justification for keeping animals
locked away, sometimes for decades, or killing them before their
time to make room for younger, more robust, or rarer specimens,
although zoo officials say culling is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-generational captive-bred animals are neither domestic nor
wild, these critics maintain. In addition to behavioral changes,
the animals may be undergoing subtle genetic alterations that make
them more adaptable to confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution of those animals is being directed by humans,
not nature,'' said Eric Dinerstein, chief scientist of the World
Wildlife Fund. ``You have to ask whether that is fair?''
</P>
<P>
   Their differences notwithstanding, proponents and opponents of
captive breeding are close to unanimous in supporting habitat
preservation and protection from human hunting and collection as
the surest way to insure the survival of endangered species. They
would also establish corridors to link highly fragmented habitats.
</P>
<P>
   With proper nurturing, many of those animals will recover,
although perhaps more slowly than if they were forced into breeding
programs.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, Hutchins said, zoos and other qualified
organizations must be prepared to pull animals from the wild and
try to restore the species' vitality in the relative security of
captive breeding operations. But in those circumstances, there
might be no more habitat, and those animals will become passengers
on an ark they cannot exit.

CHILDREN WITH CANCER FOUND WELL-ADJUSTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (js) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children being treated for cancer are far more resilient
psychologically and socially than most adults, including
oncologists, would expect. In fact, they seem to function better
socially and do as well emotionally as healthy children.
</P>
<P>
   This is what a medical team from three universities found when
they examined how well or poorly 76 children functioned while
receiving chemotherapy for a variety of cancers. The children, aged
8 to 15, all attended regular schools during the course of their
treatment. Their social, emotional and behavioral adjustment was
measured by comparing them with 76 healthy children in the same
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported this month in the journal Pediatrics
by Dr. Robert B. Noll of the department of hematology and oncology
at the University of Cincinnati and five coauthors. To avoid
prejudicing the results, teachers and students were not told the
real purpose of the study when they were asked to evaluate all the
children in each classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers rated the children with cancer as more sociable and
less disruptively aggressive than the healthy children in their
classrooms. Their peers, too, gave the children with cancer high
ratings. Rather than shunning children on chemotherapy, many of
whom had lost all their hair and were less active physically than
the healthy children, their peers rated them as being better liked
than other children.
</P>
<P>
   When the children themselves were tested for symptoms of
emotional disturbances, no differences were found between those
with cancer and the healthy children on measures of depression,
anxiety, loneliness and self-concept.
</P>
<P>
   About the only distinction between the two groups of children
lay in personal satisfaction with their current athletic ability,
which not surprisingly lagged in the cancer group, probably because
the treatment made them unusually tired.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, too, were interviewed and reported nothing unusual
about the children undergoing cancer treatment with respect to
behavioral problems, emotional well-being or social functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said their study's findings differed from
impressions gleaned from previous research perhaps because earlier
studies were small, lacked a comparison group of healthy children
and relied on only one source of information, typically the child's
mother. In addition, previous studies were usually conducted during
clinic visits or hospitalizations, rather than while the children
were participating in normal daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   The current study examined nearly every child with a diagnosis
of cancer in the Cincinnati area, excluding children with cancers
of the central nervous system, since these cancers sometimes cause
emotional and behavioral disturbances apart from the effects of
treatment or the knowledge that a person has cancer.

   &UR; Greek Fire &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was there a secret Byzantine naval weapon called Greek fire?
</P>
<P>
   A. Historians agree Greek fire existed, but debate its nature.
</P>
<P>
   In a new introduction by Bert S. Hall to the classic 1960 book
``A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder,'' by J.R. Partington
(Johns Hopkins, 1999), Kallinikos of Heliopolis gets credit for
building fire-spouting ships that defended Constantinople from the
Arabs in 678.
</P>
<P>
   Greek fire was described as a liquid that burned even on the sea
surface; it generated frightening smoke and whooshing sounds. Its
secret was apparently lost in the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for ingredients include petroleum, resin and
quicklime, plus a possible secret ingredient. Some theorized that
this was saltpeter, which would make Greek fire an important
precursor of gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   Partington, a chemist, was skeptical of theories that saltpeter
was added to unrefined petroleum that naturally seeped from the
ground, arguing that the Byzantines instead used some form of
distillation to make kerosene or gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hall, associate professor at the Institute for the
History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the University
of Toronto, says that later researchers have rejected Dr.
Partington's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One newer theory suggests that undistilled petroleum, collected
in the cooler months so that its volatile fractions were less
likely to evaporate, was kept in heated containers on board ship.
Another theory holds that the weapon was a kind of flame thrower
mixing a petroleum product with an oxidizing agent, probably
saltpeter.

JUST HOW MUCH IS THAT GIZMO IN THE TUNNEL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mass.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, with $2 billion already spent on construction of what
would have been the world's mightiest particle accelerator, the
Congress killed the project, known as the Superconducting
Supercollider, or SSC. All that remains are some buildings, a lot
of land around Waxahachie, Texas, and a section of the planned
54-mile tunnel that would have housed the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   But a small company, International Isotopes Inc., has acquired
some very expensive apparatus from the project for a song ($2.9
million), moved the machinery to its headquarters in Denton, Texas,
and will soon use it to manufacture radioactive pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its operation will help free United States
hospitals from dependence on military and foreign sources of these
vital substances.
</P>
<P>
   International Isotopes has modified an 80-foot-long linear
accelerator, or linac, built for the SSC and will use it to make a
dozen or more radioactive chemicals essential to diagnosing and
treating cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   When a proton from such an accelerator strikes the nucleus of an
atom it sometimes merges with the nucleus, changing it into a
different _ and often radioactive _ element. Depending on the
chemical nature of the new element, it can be used to target tumors
in a specific part of the body; radioactive iodine, for example,
seeks out tumors in the thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the SSC, the completed linac would have given a beam
of protons a preliminary shove of up to 70 million electronvolts
before injecting the beam into the main accelerator ring, where the
protons would have been further accelerated to 20 trillion
electronvolts. The main ring was abandoned after a small section of
its tunnel was dug. But the linac was nearly finished.
</P>
<P>
   Carl W. Seidel, president of International Isotopes, said that
his company had modified the linac to greatly increase the number
of protons in ts beam. The company expects to begin using the
linac to make the radioactive chemicals starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy has encouraged the project partly
because it will assure a reliable domestic source of short-lived
radioactive chemicals, most of which must be used within hours of
their manufacture. One such substance, fluorine-16, used to
pinpoint cancerous tissue in the brain, decays so rapidly that half
of any amount of it disappears in 110 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinicians depend partly on the production of radioactive
chemicals as byproducts of Defense Department reactors, which do
not operate continuously. Most of the shortfall must be obtained
from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors using radioactive substances for diagnosis and treatment
must obtain these materials from reactors or accelerators that are
nearby, although the longer-lived isotopes can survive short air
trips. But Seidel said his company would use its linear accelerator
as a prototype for similar accelerators it would build for sale or
lease.
</P>
<P>
   High-energy physicists continue to lament the demise of the SSC.
But President Clinton, who signed the legislation that killed the
project, has had second thoughts. In June, after the discovery of
mass in neutrino particles, Clinton told students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology that the discovery ``calls
into question the decision'' to abandon the project.

   &UR; Extinction, Ancient Style &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As a protector of fellow creatures, modern humans' record is
spotty at best. The steamroller of progress has put some species on
the endangered list, and even flattened some to extinction. But now
comes word that not-so-modern humans didn't do so well either.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Australian and American researchers has concluded that
the earliest humans in Australia may have inadvertently wiped out
most of the large animal species on the continent 50,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like other parts of the world, Australia was at one time home to
a diverse assortment of so-called megafauna. In Australia's case,
these included a marsupial that weighed as much as a linebacker, a
horned tortoise that was about the size of a compact car, and a
flightless ostrich-like bird, Genyornis newtoni, that tipped the
scales at 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these large animals became extinct around the same time,
but exactly when has been unclear. The reason has been unclear as
well, with some scientists blaming climate change and others, human
activity. The researchers, who wrote about their work in a recent
issue of the journal Science, used a variety of newer dating
techniques on fossilized eggshells of Genyornis to calculate that
the birds suddenly disappeared 50,000 years ago. This was a time of
only mild climate change, the researchers note.
</P>
<P>
   But it was about 5,000 years after the first humans arrived on
the continent. So the researchers speculate that systematic burning
of vegetation by these aboriginal Australians disrupted the food
chain enough that Genyornis and other shrub- and tree-loving
species became extinct.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tracking Temperatures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Back to modern times for a moment. Much has been made of the
fact that human activity is causing global temperatures to rise.
But the picture is more complex than that: In land areas, average
annual minimum temperatures (that is, nighttime temperatures) are
increasing at twice the rate of average annual maximum (daytime)
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Three Colorado State University researchers, studying the growth
of vegetation on range land since 1970, have discovered that there
appear to be ecological consequences to this phenomenon. The
researchers, writing in Science, found that higher minimum
temperatures have cut the production of buffalo grass, a prime food
source for grazing cattle, and increased the abundance of invasive,
nongrassy plants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers speculate on several reasons for this. For one
thing, they say, the warmer nights extend the growing season, which
would primarily benefit cool-season plants (like the nongrasses)
that grow most rapidly. These plants would rob the hot-season (and
slower growing) grasses of nutrients and water. Warmer nights also
increase plant respiration, which will speed up loss of carbon by
the plant (thus slowing growth) if there is not a corresponding
increase in photosynthesis during the day.

the endangered list, and even flattened some to extinction. But now
comes word that not-so-modern humans didn't do so well either.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Australian and American researchers has concluded that
the earliest humans in Australia may have inadvertently wiped out
most of the large animal species on the continent 50,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like other parts of the world, Australia was at one time home to
a diverse assortment of so-called megafauna. In Australia's case,
these included a marsupial that weighed as much as a linebacker, a
horned tortoise that was about the size of a compact car, and a
flightless ostrich-like bird, Genyornis newtoni, that tipped the
scales at 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these large animals became extinct around the same time,
but exactly when has been unclear. The reason has been unclear as
well, with some scientists blaming climate change and others, human
activity. The researchers, who wrote about their work in a recent
issue of the journal Science, used a variety of newer dating
techniques on fossilized eggshells of Genyornis to calculate that
the birds suddenly disappeared 50,000 years ago. This was a time of
only mild climate change, the researchers note.
</P>
<P>
   But it was about 5,000 years after the first humans arrived on
the continent. So the researchers speculate that systematic burning
of vegetation by these aboriginal Australians disrupted the food
chain enough that Genyornis and other shrub- and tree-loving
species became extinct.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tracking Temperatures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Back to modern times for a moment. Much has been made of the
fact that human activity is causing global temperatures to rise.
But the picture is more complex than that: In land areas, average
annual minimum temperatures (that is, nighttime temperatures) are
increasing at twice the rate of average annual maximum (daytime)
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Three Colorado State University researchers, studying the growth
of vegetation on range land since 1970, have discovered that there
appear to be ecological consequences to this phenomenon. The
researchers, writing in Science, found that higher minimum
temperatures have cut the production of buffalo grass, a prime food
source for grazing cattle, and increased the abundance of invasive,
nongrassy plants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers speculate on several reasons for this. For one
thing, they say, the warmer nights extend the growing season, which
would primarily benefit cool-season plants (like the nongrasses)
that grow most rapidly. These plants would rob the hot-season (and
slower growing) grasses of nutrients and water. Warmer nights also
increase plant respiration, which will speed up loss of carbon by
the plant (thus slowing growth) if there is not a corresponding
increase in photosynthesis during the day.

<P>
   It was the confluence of two important events that made Carol
Baxter start buying organic milk about five and a half years ago.
Her oldest daughter had just turned 1 and soon would move from
breast milk to cow's milk. And American dairy farmers had just
received approval to inject their cows with recombinant bovine
growth hormone, a genetically engineered hormone that increases
milk production.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baxter, who lives in Palisades, N.Y., knew of environmental
groups' claims that treated cows got more infections and needed
more antibiotics, which could then enter their milk. And she
learned that some scientists had raised the possibility of an
increased cancer risk in people who drank the milk. ``Milk is such
an important part of a child's diet,'' she said. ``I didn't want my
child to be a guinea pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has long dismissed such
concerns. In the journal Science in 1990, two agency scientists
concluded that ``no toxicologically significant changes'' were seen
in rats that ingested the hormone. The agency's approval of the
hormone in 1993 rested on the strength of that 90-day rat study,
which was commissioned by Monsanto, the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Safety questions about the hormone never went away among
health-conscious consumers, and recently the old questions have
resurfaced in light of new research and a fresh examination of the
rat study.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Canadian government said that it would not
approve the synthetic hormone. Canadian scientists reviewed
unpublished data from the study and found health effects that had
not been cited in the Science report. Canada's decision leaves the
United States the only major country to permit use of the synthetic
hormone.
</P>
<P>
   In its analysis of the Monsanto rat study, the Canadian
scientists found that 20 percent to 30 percent of the rats that
ingested high doses of the hormone developed antibodies to it, a
sign that it was active in the bloodstream. And some of the male
rats developed cysts on their thyroids and abnormalities in their
prostates.
</P>
<P>
   In December, after the Canadian researchers released their
findings, Sens. Patrick Leahy and James Jeffords, both of Vermont,
asked Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala to
investigate whether the FDA overlooked evidence in the case. Dr.
Shalala has not yet responded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in December, 21 dairy farmer associations and
consumer groups in the United States said they would file suit
against the FDA for failing to require additional safety studies of
the hormone. ``The 90-day rat study doesn't show that recombinant
bovine growth hormone is a human health hazard,'' said Dr. Michael
Hanson, a research associate for the Consumer Policy Research
Institute, a division of the Consumers Union, one of the groups.
``But neither does it show that there is no possibility of any
health hazard, as FDA claimed. It's clear that FDA has grossly
misled us.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is writing a response to the concerns, said Dr.
Stephen Sundlof, director of its Center for Veterinary Medicine. He
acknowledged that the agency had not reviewed the antibody data in
the approval process ``for reasons I can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency had seen the information on the thyroid and
prostate effects, but considered them ``biologically meaningless''
because they were no more prevalent in rats fed high doses of the
hormone than in those fed low doses. Ordinarily, if a substance
like a drug affects the body, the effects increase as the dose
increases. ``Consumers have no reason to be concerned about the
milk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto said its product, called Posilac, is safe. Extensive
evaluations have established that the hormone supplements for cows
do not change the composition and wholesomeness of milk, Dr. David
Kowalczyk and Dr. Robert Collier, Monsanto scientists, wrote in a
statement released Jan. 12. The scientists point out that the
United Nations Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, which
determines the safety of residues from veterinary drugs in foods,
affirmed in March that the growth hormone was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Canadian investigation, two studies published last
year rekindled longstanding worries about a possible increased risk
of cancer from consuming milk from hormone-treated cows. Reports
from two continuing Harvard-based studies, the Physicians' Health
Study and the Nurses' Health Study, found that insulin-dependent
growth factor 1, a protein that is elevated in the milk of
hormone-treated cows, is a strong risk factor for breast cancer and
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the study say this protein circulates naturally
in the human body at such high levels that the added amount in
treated milk is unlikely to be noticed. Also, it occurs in breast
milk in higher amounts than in the milk of hormone-treated cows.
And, the researchers say there is no evidence that consuming the
substance in food contributes to cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, scientists with the Physicians' Health Study
reported in Science that men with the highest levels of IGF-1 in
their blood were four times as likely to develop prostate cancer as
men with the lowest levels. In May, scientists with the Nurses'
Health study reported in The Lancet that premenopausal women with
high levels of IGF-1 had up to a seven-fold increase in breast
cancer risk over those with low levels. They said the findings
suggest ``that the relation between IGF-1 and risk of breast cancer
may be greater than that of other established breast-cancer risk
factors,'' except for family history and dense breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Pollack, who was involved with both studies, noted
that the difference between the IGF-1 in milk from untreated cows
and treated cows is relatively small. Levels range from 1 to 9
nanograms per milliliter of milk from untreated cows and 1 to 13
nanograms per milliliter of milk from treated cows, the FDA said.
And because levels in human milk are slightly higher, ``if there's
a biological difference, one would be most concerned with human
milk,'' said Pollack, a professor of medicine and oncology at
McGill University
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that, according to Canadian scientists, the amount of
IGF-1 that people consume in cow's milk is less than 1 percent of
the total amount of IGF-1 that naturally circulates in the body,
regardless of what people eat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he could not rule out the possibility that daily
exposure to the small additional amounts of IGF-1 in milk over a
lifetime could increase a person's cancer risk. ``It's a
hypothetical concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, scientists cannot tease out the human health risk
of IGF-1 from foods until they know how much of it remains active
in the body after digestion. But that point is also in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consume any peptide, like IGF-1, very little of it is
absorbed in an active form,'' said Dr. Carolyn Bondy, chief of the
developmental endocrinology branch of the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Bondy's research found a
connection between abnormal mammary gland growth in female monkeys
and high levels of IGH-1 given to the monkeys, but these IGF-1
levels were far greater than people get from drinking milk, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the increased amount of IGF-1 in treated milk is
small, Hanson said the possible health effects could not be
dismissed. He cited a 1995 study in the Journal of Endocrinology
showing that the breakdown of IGF-1 in rats is slowed in the
presence of casein, a protein in milk. ``If casein increases the
half life of IGF-1, the effects could be dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts agree with the Consumers Union and the other
parties in the planned lawsuit against the FDA that more testing is
needed to establish whether bovine growth hormone supplementation
is safe. ``More studies need to be done,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle,
director of the department of nutrition at New York University, who
opposed the approval of the hormone as a representative on the drug
agency's advisory panel that approved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science on the effects of oral ingestion of IGF-1 is
incomplete,'' the American Medical Association said in a statement
last month, in response to a reporter's questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the climate of uncertainty, one thing is for sure. Many
consumers want milk without added hormones and antibiotics. Sales
of organic milk nearly doubled to almost $31 billion in 1997, from
about $16 million in 1996, according to dairy industry figures.
</P>
<P>
   And Wendy Gordon, executive director of Mothers and Others for a
Livable Planet, said demand was strong for its list of milk
manufacturers, organic and nonorganic, whose dairies pledge not to
use the synthetic hormone.  &QL;

THREE MEN AND A PAINTING
</HEADLINE>

By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Art'' is the mouse that roared.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving with little fanfare, French playwright Yasmina Reza's
seemingly slight comedy about three middle-age friends who feud
over a work of modern art became one of the most enduringly
hard-to-get tickets in London and New York _ a level of popularity
that is almost unheard of these days among spoken-word plays.
</P>
<P>
   In London, it opened in 1996 with an all-star cast (Albert
Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott), changing actors every few
months and attracting return visits. The American-debut production,
which featured an unusual if talented Anglo-American cast _ Alan
Alda, Victor Garber and British actor Alfred Molina _ became an
instant Broadway hit when it opened last March. It has captured
almost every major British and American prize, including a
best-play Tony and an Olivier Award for best comedy.
</P>
<P>
   That success prompted a furious behind-the-scenes battle for
West Coast debut rights. Finally, the show's producers, including
actor Sean Connery, decided the best ``Art'' for California was the
New York version. Alda, Garber and Molina reprise their roles in
the production opening tonight at the Doolittle Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Alda plays the supercilious Marc, the eldest of the three. When
his friend, Serge (Garber), buys an artwork that consists of
nothing more than white paint on canvas, Marc can't contain his
contempt. He sees Serge's purchase as an act of aesthetic
gullibility; worse, it symbolizes a rupture in what Marc perceives
to be a mentor-student relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Their disagreement escalates into a battle that explores the
very nature and limitations of male friendship. Molina's affable
Yvan at first tries to be the referee but soon gets caught up in a
three-way struggle of ego, pride and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Alda admits to being somewhat surprised at the play's New York
reception, although he was convinced of its quality from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if American audiences would take to it the way
other audiences had, although I also didn't know at that time that
it was as big a hit around the world as it was. I thought it had
just played in Paris and London. I found out later that it had
already played in about 80 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew was that it was one of the best plays I'd ever
read. It didn't really matter to me if audiences liked it as much
as I did. I just wanted to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not completely. Many critics and observers have said
that no trio of red-blooded American guys would be caught dead
arguing about such highfalutin topics as deconstruction and the
aesthetics of modern art. Push us beyond the holy trinity of male
conversational topics _ money, women and sports _ and we're out at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Such a quirk is part of the play's essential Frenchness, but it
doesn't get in the way of Americans' enjoyment of it, Alda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, there are plenty of American men who wouldn't talk like
that. But the fact is it's written about three French guys. I think
deconstruction is an idea that even well-educated Americans would
tend to leave out of their conversation. But it would mean more to
Frenchmen, since it's a French movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber thinks ``Art's'' enduring popularity stems, in part, from
the many levels of insight and interpretation it offers. It means
different things to different people, he said. &QL;

IN SPINOFFS, LOOK FOR THE PRODIGY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When thinking of investing in a spinoff, think about
parents raising a child to live on his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   You're looking for a situation where the offspring is likely to
thrive out in the cold, cruel world.
</P>
<P>
   First, you should determine whether the parent company has given
its corporate child a strong foundation to prosper alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how much time and devotion was given to the
child,'' said Mark Minichiello, analyst at Spin-Off Advisors in
Chicago, an investment banking boutique specializing in spinoffs.
``If the parent was helping the company before the spinoff, that
may put them on a better footing when they become a stand-alone
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning spinoffs have a strong market in their product or
service, have good brand identity and experienced management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the child was neglected, when you put them on their own,
there's going to be a larger adjustment period,'' Minichiello said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most measurable signs of parent-company abuse is the
amount of debt dumped on the spinoff company.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for a parent company to shift some of its debt to
its offspring so the corporate parent's balance sheet looks better.
</P>
<P>
   To see whether this debt loan will turn into a crushing burden,
first read the financial section of the prospectus to see if the
warnings are really stern. Also, look on the financial reports on
the cash flow statements and see if there's any cash left after
paying the debt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
REPUTATION COUNTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closely consider the intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of the company's products makes a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the stock of Bally Fitness Corp., which was spun
off from Bally Entertainment in 1996, has soared since its spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   If you regularly visit a Bally health club and always see lots
of members pumping iron and you like the service, that may be a tip
that it would be a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give up if the spinoff needs work. The parent company
typically spins off what looks like a duller child.
</P>
<P>
   Pay a lot of attention to the management. With the right
leadership, an operation that never fit in after a takeover might
begin to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of the company that is spun off gets to be
management of a public company,'' said Harry Pinson, managing
director of the Houston office of Credit Suisse First Boston, an
investment banking firm. ``They can be rewarded for the performance
of their little piece, as opposed to having that be filtered
through the larger enterprise from which it came.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based PennzEnergy Co. is an example of two ways that a
company involved in a spinoff can be appealing.
</P>
<P>
   First, the management now has the added pressure to focus on
efficiently adding reserves since the company's future depends on
it. But before you invest, it's wise to wait for some sign it's
able to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The second appeal is that a stand-alone company might make an
acquisition target. Many analysts have listed PennzEnergy as a
possible takeover target this year, when depressed energy prices
are likely to spawn a spate of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   For Pennzoil-Quaker State, which was formed when Pennzoil Co.
spun off its specialty-automotive products and oil-change
businesses, going solo means being able to allocate resources to a
more sharply focused business, said spokesman Greg Panagos.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMMUNICATION CAN MAKE, BREAK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff often is designed to create a company Wall Street
understands because it's focused on a single industry.
</P>
<P>
   So look for children who have talents that will let them earn
some big money on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   These can be promising new products or profitable lines of
business that just haven't been noticed because they are buried
inside a big company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons companies spin off subsidiaries is because
they believe the marketplace isn't recognizing the value of that
company,'' said Lanny Sachnowitz, manager of the Aim Charter Fund,
a Houston mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   It's the job of the spinoff to communicate that.
</P>
<P>
   Some good signs are articles about the company in the business
media, analysts' coverage of the company and public appearances by
company executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public communication is important because they have to
convey to the shareholders, as well as the outsiders, what their
strategic plan is, what their goals are, and they have to convey
that in a way that the analysts and shareholders, as well, will
understand,'' Minichiello said.

MOLINA IS A QUICK STUDY IN `ART'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A no-name Hollywood director has just called to
ask if you'd like to appear in his new feature film about the, um,
adult movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Your part, a fleeting character role, would require you to
portray a crazed, coked-up junkie on a shotgun rampage. With a
foreign accent. In your underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Should you: A) Fire your agent _ immediately; B) Beg the
producers of ``All My Children'' to offer you a multi-year
contract; C) Take the job, mostly because, what the hell, it might
be fun, and besides, you've got a bit of down time between two
other big-budget studio gigs?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Alfred Molina, the answer is, obviously, C.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was great,'' the actor recalls of his spectacularly
twisted turn in Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's 90 percent luck, 10 percent judgment,'' Molina
continues. ``Someone said to me, `That movie, you know, that little
10-minute cameo, will be a defining moment in your career.' And I
wish I could say, `Yes, I knew all that, and that's why I planned
it that way.' I wish I could say that, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one actor's luck is another's ability to handle a
wide range of difficult and perversely compelling roles, something
Molina has achieved repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, the London native has averaged about three
feature films per year. In more than one case, he has practically
walked away with the picture, despite being saddled with such
hard-to-love characters as Sally Field's tyrannical Iranian husband
in ``Not Without My Daughter,'' and the murderously jealous lover
of Swinging London playwright Joe Orton, in ``Prick Up Your Ears,''
probably the breakthrough role of his movie career. He'll be
playing the ultimate moustache-twirling cad, Snidely Whiplash, in
the upcoming feature film version of ``Dudley Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina also has demonstrated his extraordinary ear for accents,
a gift he attributes to his mixed Spanish-Italian parentage. He'll
show that aptitude again during the next two months at the
Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, where he'll be co-starring with
Alan Alda and Victor Garber in Yasmina Reza's international hit and
Tony Award-winning play, ``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina has trouble accounting fully for why ``Art'' has hit the
zeitgeist jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno, it's a phenomenon in many ways,'' he says. ``Yasmina
has written I think four or five plays, and this is the only one
that's been like a huge, huge international success. Her other
plays were successes in France, but this one has transcended every
culture and language. Any barrier that you might imagine a play
might come up against, she's like leapt over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lesser kind critics of London called it a
lightweight comedy masquerading as a great work. And I actually
think it's the opposite: I think it's a great piece of work
masquerading as a lightweight comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although an all-white painting is the engine that drives
``Art,'' the play is far less concerned with aesthetics than it is
with masculine rituals of competition and one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men, when we talk about anything with each other, there
is always a degree of competitiveness. There's an element of
jousting, or adversarial kind of to-ing and fro-ing,'' Molina says.
``However friendly or fun it might be, we kind of arm-wrestle with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The pecking order among the three men is established quickly.
Garber's character, Serge, is a dermatologist. His mentor, Marc,
played by Alda, is an aeronautical engineer. Molina's character,
Yvan, is the manager of an office supply store, a job he procured
through his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Molina describes Yvan as the group peacemaker, whose quirky way
of looking at things amuses his friends and justifies his admission
into a trio whose other members outclass him in money and
education.
</P>
<P>
   The actor says that he and his two somewhat more famous co-stars
developed their own stylized ways of interacting during rehearsals
for the show's Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we had to, in a sense, get into the life of the
play somehow very, very quickly,'' he explains. ``And so what we
did is we consciously, deliberately spent a lot of time in the
first few weeks of rehearsal socializing. We went out for dinners,
we kind of hung out, went and did things together. And as it turned
out, we enjoyed doing it and we became friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the men began to take on the personalities of their
characters. Molina says he would be cracking jokes much of the
time, while Alda and Garber would ``lock horns over something, in a
very kind of amiable way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we did this interview, the three of us together, and we
were discussing this and how this worked out. And Alan said _ and
it was brilliant, and I must credit him, too _ he said, `We sit
around together and wait until someone says something sincere. And
then the other two let him have it!'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's precisely what we did. And so we would sit around
and somebody would say, `Oh, I've got a letter from so-and-so
again, so-and-so's got a terrible heart attack.' And the other two
would rip it apart! It stayed the same right through the run of the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it was Molina who got the final word, when he won
last year's Tony Award for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was very nice, and the other two were very
gentlemanly about it,'' he says. ``And I tried not to mention it
too often. I was very good, I didn't crow _ not in public,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny and informal, Molina, 45, seems to have a gift for fitting
in. As he chats, lapsing now and then into one spot-on accent or
another _ Irish, American, Slavic or vaguely Middle Eastern,
depending on the anecdote _ you sense that he could make friends
quickly even in a roomful of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Assimilation comes naturally to him. While growing up in London,
he says he became infatuated with a group of American teens whose
parents were serving overseas in the U.S. military. The Americans
more or less adopted him, and on weekends he began a secret life
hanging out with these cultural extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age, at the time, I thought these kids were like
unbelievably exotic. To me they were like incredibly cool. They
seemed so cool to me, the way they talked, the way they dressed,
the things they said. I think partly they had the confidence that
comes with money. Or at least they were living a lifestyle that
seemed a lot more affluent than mine. You know, their dad was like
an officer in the Army. My dad was a waiter in a restaurant. So
there was an exoticism on that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``But also they were just so confident. I think Americans take
it for granted because you don't know, because you just accept it
as the norm. But American kids, compared to the way European kids
are, are incredibly confident. Like in Europe, kids are often told
just to kind of remember their place, `Don't overreach yourself.'
Whereas American kids are told, `You can do anything you want, you
can be anybody you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Molina learned everything else he needed to know about
Americans, American culture and the American language from _ where
else? _ Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root of the American accent is in fact European,'' he
says. ``It's Italian, Jewish, Irish. So there's something about the
rhythm of America that somehow made absolute sense to me. It didn't
sound foreign to me at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was a kid playing in the street, we used to
play, and we used to go watch Saturday morning pictures (movies).
And we'd play cowboys and Indians and cops and robbers _ we'd play
with American accents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he met his first Americans, Molina says, he wanted to
live in the United States. It took him 40 years. Now happily
settled in Los Angeles with his wife, English actress Gill
Gascoigne, it seems the only thing the easygoing Molina can't abide
are expatriate British malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like L.A. I like L.A. for all the reasons most people hate
it. I don't belong to that group of expatriate Brits who hang out
in Santa Monica and bitch and moan how you can't get a decent cup
of tea. My feeling is, well, drink the coffee, if that's what's
important to you. I've got no time for that. I think it's
insulting. If you don't like it, go home! Make more room for those
of us who do like it.''
</P>
<P>
   A sly grin steals over Molina's face, a sure sign that another
accent is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh, don't get me started,'' he says, in a sort of Cockney
Billy Crystal, ``don't get me started!'' &QL;

IMMUNE SYSTEM AS SUSPECT IN MISCARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOROTHY J. BARNHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women who have had repeated miscarriages or for whom in-vitro
fertilization has failed are often told that nothing can be done to
help them. While almost 70 percent of miscarriages over all are due
to chromosomal defects, at least 50 percent of recurrent
miscarriages have no apparent explanation, according to the
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few doctors are looking at one possible cause of
unexplained miscarriage: problems in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   These doctors theorize that when a woman miscarries again and
again it may be because her immune system is wrongly attacking her
embryo as foreign. If this is the problem, and it can be overcome,
they say, the women may be able to carry pregnancies to term.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is controversial. For one thing, it remains to be
proved that immune system disorders are associated with infertility
or miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Hill, the director of Reproductive Medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and associate professor of
obstetrics-gynecology at Harvard Medical School, warned that ``many
hypotheses or mechanisms have been proposed for pregnancy loss with
an immunologic bent, but there is very little data to support any
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some doctors are treating infertile women with
immunoglobulin, a blood product pooled from thousands of donors and
used to regulate abnormal responses of the immune system. They
believe it somehow modulates the action of the immune system's
killer cells _ the body's first line of defense against illness and
the cells that may be responsible for destroying embryos in some
women.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says that ``no efficacy
data exist to warrant expensive immunoglobulin therapy at this
time.'' Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive director of the American
Society of Reproductive Medicine, said the group regarded any
immunoglobulin treatment as ``experimental'' and recommended that
patients receive it only as ``informed, consenting participants in
a board-approved randomized clinical trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health had planned such a study, but
it was put on hold six months ago because of an insufficient supply
of immunoglobulin, said Dr. Donna Vogel, research coordinator for
the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. ``If
we had the drug today, we would do the study,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The immune system fights infection by identifying tissues
foreign to the body and sending out antibodies to destroy them. In
a normal pregnancy, the immune system differentiates an embryo _
technically a foreign tissue _ from other, abnormal tissues and
develops a protective response toward it, keeping antibodies away
and creating a supportive environment in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe that the immune systems of women
suffering from recurrent reproductive failure may lack this
protective response.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Immunoglobulin, often called intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIg,
is licensed and approved for marketing by the Food and Drug
Administration for a variety of conditions including immune
deficiencies and bone marrow transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   But because doctors may legally prescribe any approved drug for
any purpose, some are using it to treat women suffering repeated
pregnancy loss. Their number is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Obstetrics and Gynecology estimates that at least
15 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, many before
a woman even knows she is pregnant. For that same reason, it is
possible that many instances of unexplained infertility may
actually be early miscarriages. Recurrent pregnancy loss,
traditionally defined as three or more successive miscarriages,
occurs in 4 percent of pregnancies, according to estimates of the
obstetrics college.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carolyn Coulam, director of reproductive immunology and vice
president for medical affairs at the Center for Human Reproduction,
a private fertility clinic in Chicago, estimates that immune
disorders may lie behind as many as 50 to 80 percent of recurrent
miscarriages for which no apparent cause is found and as many as 40
percent of unexplained fertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   Elevations in natural killer cells are found in 12 percent of
women with recurrent pregnancy loss and 25 percent of women with
repeated in-vitro fertilization failures, said Dr. Alan Beer,
professor of obstetrics-gynecology and microbiology and immunology
at the Chicago Medical School. Proponents of immunoglobulin say
that these are the women who may be helped by the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Cowchuck, clinical professor of obstetrics-gynecology
at New York University Medical Center, is not as sure. While there
is ``no doubt that IVIg blocks killer cells in a test tube, we
don't even know that natural killer cells have anything to do with
miscarriages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, both Drs. Beer and Coulam claim an 85 percent
success rate for immunoglobulin among those patients who have had
recurrent miscarriages and infertility and have high levels of
natural killer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, however, questions these results, saying that most cases
of pregnancy loss are due to chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus
which lead to its demise regardless of the therapy given. He also
said that after three consecutive pregnancy losses, for reasons
doctors did not fully understand, the chances of a live birth were
70 percent without any therapy. ``That's a high background success
rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, anecdotes about the treatment, many spread on the
Internet, are prompting patients to ask doctors for the treatment,
a trend that troubles some doctors. ``There's no effective therapy
out there _ none,'' Hill said. ``The trouble is, you've got all
these people on the Internet claiming that IVIg works. ''
</P>
<P>
   But patients like Nancy Hemenway believe in the treatment. Ms.
Hemenway, the executive director and co-founder of the
International Council on Infertility Information Dissemination, a
nonprofit group based in Arlington, Va., said she had had four
miscarriages before being treated with IVIg. She now has a
3-year-old daughter. ``It's my unscientific point of view that
without IVIg my daughter wouldn't be here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the treatment is not without its own risks. Although all
blood products are now screened for viruses like HIV and hepatitis
C, there remains a risk of new viruses or diseases for which
screening and cleansing methods have not yet been perfected. Steve
Manzo, the director of public affairs for the Plasma Products
Industry Association, said the FDA had tightened its regulatory
requirements, a process that caused a temporary reduction in
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many women are eager to try it. ``Hope sells,'' Hill
said. ``Skepticism doesn't.''

`PLAYING FOR KEEPS': WHEN HE SHOT, HE SOARED: JORDAN THE MAN AND
ATHLETE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was an athlete who exhausted our supply of superlatives, a
magician whose sleight of hand never failed to amaze. In a
profession measured by harsh, unforgiving statistics he was
compared to Michelangelo, Baryshnikov and Picasso, and hailed as
Miracle and Superman. In an age of celebrity and hyperbole, he
remained one of those rare performers whose achievements matched
the hype. He took Bill Russell's definition of sport _ ``a mixture
of art and war'' _ to a new level, and in the process he became the
most recognizable person in the world, ``the flying man,'' as one
Chinese newspaper called him, the man who defied the laws of
physics and redefined his sport.
</P>
<P>
   With his retirement from the Chicago Bulls last week, Michael
Jordan demonstrated his usual impeccable timing: going out at the
top of his game, and leaving fans with one final image on his
highlight reel: that beautiful clutch jumper with 5.2 seconds on
the clock that gave the Bulls the win over Utah in game six of the
NBA finals and their sixth championship last June.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of ``Playing for Keeps,'' David Halberstam's new book
about Jordan and the Bulls' arduous 1997-98 season, has turned out
to be nearly as perfect: coming out only days after M.J.'s
departure from the NBA and only weeks after the end of the league's
six-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Although there isn't much in ``Playing for Keeps'' that most
basketball fans didn't already know _ Jordan did not grant any
interviews for the book and much of the volume is a compendium of
compelling but familiar stories fleshed out with new reporting _
the volume is animated by the author's own passion for the game.
Halberstam uses that knowledge to convey to the reader the extreme
mixture of talent, will and old-fashioned hard work that went into
Jordan's achievements. His determination to situate M.J., ``the
phenomenon of him,'' in a historical context provides both the
casual sports aficionado and the ardent basketball fan with an
appreciation of how No. 23's success helped change the NBA and how
those changes, in turn, reflected larger developments in the world
of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam touched upon similar themes in his baseball books
(``Summer of '49'' and ``October 1964''), and in this volume he
dwells at some length on the changes that have overtaken
professional basketball since his last book on the subject, ``The
Breaks of the Game,'' 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Jordan's two great
predecessors, entered the league in 1979, Halberstam writes,
professional basketball was ``considered to be badly tainted'':
``it was seen as far too black, and the majority of its players, it
was somehow believed, were on drugs and willing to play hard only
in the last two minutes of the game.'' Few games were broadcast on
network television, and the total of all players' salaries in 1978
was roughly $40 million, less than a third of the $126 million deal
Minnesota made with the unproven Kevin Garnett in 1997.

   In recent years free agency, cable television, an international
audience and the sneaker wars have turned the NBA into a wildly
lucrative business, and professional sports have increasingly
become a form of entertainment, vying with rock concerts and movies
for audiences' attention. As ticket prices have escalated, team
owners have glitzed up their games with cheerleaders and Jumbotron
graphics and wealthy corporate types have begun to replace die-hard
fans in the seats. At the same time advertisers and television
networks have worked hard to promote individual players instead of
teams, creating superstars readily identifiable to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam argues that America's domination of the international
cultural market and the marketability of basketball (based in part
on the fact that its players' shoes, unlike baseball spikes or
football cleats, can be worn by millions of wanna-be civilians)
made it inevitable ``that the player catapulted forward as the
signature commercial representative of this great new
athletic-cultural-commercial empire would be an American and a
basketball player.'' It is an observation based on retrospective
wisdom, of course, and an observation that oddly underplays
Jordan's own unmatched talents, detailed so vigorously in the
remainder of this book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for Keeps'' gives the reader a keenly observed picture
of Jordan's career: from his Wunderkind debut at North Carolina,
where Dean Smith's vaunted program honed his work ethic and
defensive skills as a player, through his early years with the
struggling Bulls to his apotheosis as a modern basketball god; from
his temporary abdication to play minor league baseball after his
father's slaying, to his triumphant delivery of a second three-peat
championship for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   We are reminded of the razzle-dazzle pyrotechnics of the young
Michael Jordan, with his slashing drives to the hoop, his ferocious
slam-dunks, his dazzling, Dr. J-like moves in midair. We are
reminded as well of an older Jordan's addition of new skills like a
fadeaway jumper to his arsenal and his continued growth as a player
whose uncommon physical gifts were matched only by an indomitable
mental toughness and a ferocious competitive will.
</P>
<P>
   While Halberstam's often lumbering prose is decidedly at odds
with his subject's breathtaking finesse, he manages, through
understatement, to remind the reader of those iconic moments that
galvanized Jordan's career as the greatest player ever to play the
game: his winning shot, as a freshman, against Georgetown in the
1982 NCAA finals, his record 63-point masterpiece (after coming
back from a broken foot) against the Boston Celtics in the 1986
playoffs; his heroic 38-point performance in Game Five against Utah
in the 1997 NBA finals while suffering from a debilitating fever,
and, of course, his parting shot in last June's finals, his 25th
game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he is chronicling Jordan's exploits, Halberstam uses his
storytelling skills to give the reader a vivid sense of the
personalities surrounding him on the court, most notably Scottie
Pippen, Dennis Rodman, their coach Phil Jackson, and their
struggles with the Bulls' front office. He shows us the
difficulties of assembling (and maintaining) a championship team,
examines the unreckoned consequences of fame that attended Jordan's
success and makes us marvel, once again, at M.J.'s dazzling feats,
his singular ability to deliver performances commensurate with _
and often surpassing _ his own legend.

THE ROSES OF YOUTH SMELL LESS IN OLD AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is yet another reason to stop and smell the roses: They
might not smell as sweet later on.
</P>
<P>
   Science has confirmed what many people have long suspected _
that the sense of smell starts to wane with age. For some people,
the loss begins in their 30s.
</P>
<P>
   But because smell is not the most precise of human senses,
charting the decline in ability, let alone understanding its
mechanism, has been difficult. Older people often complain about a
loss of their sense of taste when it is actually olfaction that has
been impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have determined that the loss happens in complicated
ways, said Dr. Marcia Levin Pelchat, a biological psychologist with
the Monell Chemical Sense Center, a nonprofit institute in
Philadelphia. ``Older people have a higher threshold for noticing a
smell,'' Dr. Pelchat said, ``and given an odor that is detectable,
an older person will perceive it as less intense.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a change in adaptation _ the phenomenon that makes
a strong odor seem to fade. ``For older individuals, that process
seems to take place more rapidly and be longer lasting,'' she said.
Finally, older people are less able to identify what they smell.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have begun studying individual
living olfactory receptor neurons _ the nerve cells that translate
chemical molecules in the air into electrical signals to the brain.
Over five years, Dr. Nancy Rawson of Monell collected samples of
these neurons, found in the upper part of the nasal cavity, from
more than 200 subjects, covering a wide span of ages.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier experiments, Dr. Rawson had found that cells from
younger adults responded to some types of smells and not others,
differences that some researchers suspect have to do with the types
of biochemical pathways the cells use to produce different
electrical signals to send to the brain. The human cells showed a
higher level of ``response selectivity'' than had been found in
animal olfactory cells.
</P>
<P>
   So she decided to compare the young human cells with cells from
older people. She took smells that had provoked the either/or
response in cells in younger adults, that is they responded to one
set of smells or the other but not both. (One set of odors
contained things like clove and rose odors, and one had smells like
fish, vanilla and fruit.) To her surprise, about 20 percent of the
neurons from the older people responded to both smells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pelchat said the research team was pursuing a couple of
ideas in trying to figure out the meaning of this finding, which
appeared in the latest issue of The Monell Connection, a newsletter
summarizing the institute's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that this loss of selectivity is causing some of
the decreased accuracy in naming odors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, she said, is that ``perhaps adaptation
becomes less specific'' with age. ``What if smelling roses makes
you less sensitive to coffee's odor?'' she asked. If very different
odors can trigger similar neurons, adaptation may be triggered more
often: sort of the equivalent of hitting the mute button when any
politician comes on the TV, not just the ones you detest.
</P>
<P>
   Not all older people notice a change in the sense of smell. ``We
do know that very healthy aging people tend to have a better sense
of smell than the less healthy,'' said Dr. Pelchat. ``What we don't
know is if that's because they are taking fewer medications _ since
many have side effects that interfere with smelling _ or if it's
just another aspect of successful aging.''

<P>
   Academic overload: When the kids complain about too much
homework, they aren't just whining. Time ($2.95) reports that
after-school assignments have soared.
</P>
<P>
   School crunch: Most of us remember homework as something we did
in study hall or on the bus ride home. Not any more. According to
Time ($3.50), kids today come home with more schoolwork than ever
before and at a younger age. The levels of homework have fluctuated
from a high in the post-Sputnik era to a low in the late 1960s and
'70s. But a 1983 government report on the failings of American
schools spurred educators to get serious again. In addition, baby
boomer parents are pressuring their kids even harder to get into
top secondary schools and colleges. American students are
stressed-out, but Time notes that they still ``work less, play more
and peform worse than many of their counterparts around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan legend: Everyone is familiar with the Michael Jordan
who soared above the net _ and every other player. But what is he
like off the court? In the wake of Jordan's announced retirement
last week, Newsweek ($3.50) talked to friends and family about the
superstar's private life and his plans for the future. The portrait
that emerges is one of a quick-witted man who loves his family but
who prefers hanging out with a tight circle of male friends. Even
with the guys, Newsweek says, he plays golf, cards, or geography
games (he loves to quiz friends on state capitals) with the same
cutthroat competitiveness he exhibited on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the past: The New Yorker ($3) takes us into, of all
places, a hardware store. Not just any hardware store, however.
Restoration Hardware is a paradise for people like New Yorker
writer David Brooks, who found spiritual redemption among the
crystal radios, old-fashioned kazoos and dustpans. Browsers in the
stores see the artifacts of days gone by as keys to the wisdom that
our ancestors possessed, Brooks writes. ``Maybe the little salt
cellars can bring back the old traditions and the old virtues. And,
anyway, at only twelve dollars it's worth a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming attractions: Not surprisingly, the 1999 preview issue of
Entertainment Weekly ($3.50) predicts that George Lucas' ``The
Phantom Menace'' will be the blockbuster of the summer. Other
likely movie hits include ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me''; Kevin Costner's baseball film, ``For Love of the Game''; and
``Mission Impossible II.'' And in books, `` 'Tis,'' Frank McCourt's
sequel to his best-selling memoir ``Angela's Ashes,'' is expected
to be as big as Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' when it hits stores
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Quick reads: Does love at first sight really exist? Absolutely,
reports Life ($3.99) in an article about the science of love.
Researchers now say one glimpse of the right person can set off a
chemical reaction leading to romance.

 &HT;    Put two-part `X-Files' under `A' for answers
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The biggest tease in television, ``The
X-Files'' creator Chris Carter, swears that this time he's going to
deliver the goods the show's fans have been waiting for: real
answers.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-part episode airing in February sweeps, ``X-Files''
Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) will learn definitively who his
biological father is and what happened to his sister Samantha, who
was abducted by aliens, the show's original driving engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show will have to change because so much is going to be
explained,'' Carter told the nation's TV critics meeting here to
preview the midseason schedule. ``You'll understand how Mulder
didn't choose the X-Files, they were chosen for him. Cigarette
Smoking Man is all but stripped of his mystery. He's going to be
exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular series about FBI agents exploring a massive
government cover-up of alien infiltration of Earth (or something
like that) is at its peak popularity in its sixth season,
frequently landing in Nielsen's Top 10 shows. Carter said one
reason he's revealing secrets next month is that the plan is for
next season to be the last, and the complex conspiracy must be
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is prepped for the seventh year to be the last,'' he
said. ``An eighth season could happen, but I'm not expecting
that.'' He is, however, expecting to make another ``X-Files''
feature film, though there are no plans to start it any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Feb. 7 show, titled ``Two Fathers'' (a reference to
doubts about Mulder's paternity), alien abductee Cassandra Spender
returns to Earth and threatens to expose the conspiracy. In the
Feb. 14 episode, ``One Son,'' Mulder learns a fair amount of the
truth, but the next question to be raised will be: What is he going
to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Carter would not confirm or deny rumors that Agent Krycek (Nick
Lea) will be killed in the two-parter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also is working on another series for Fox, which may be
ready for next fall: ``Harsh Realm.'' It will be a science-fiction
exploration of virtual reality and a parallel universe with a
detective twist. No casting yet.

(HLW) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impish man sitting in a warren in a remote corner of the
mathematics building at Oxford University in England is Sir Roger
Penrose, 68, mathematician, physicist, author, teacher, perhaps one
of the greatest living disciples of Albert Einstein. In the 1960s,
Penrose laid much of the foundation for the modern theory of black
holes, objects so dense, according to Einstein's theory of general
relativity, that they would collapse space around them, creating a
hole from which not even light could escape. He is also the
inventor of so-called Penrose tiles, which can cover an infinite
plane without ever repeating their pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know Penrose from his books on scientific questions,
including ``The Emperor's New Mind'' (Oxford University Press,
1989), which criticizes the idea of artificial intelligence, and
``The Nature of Space and Time'' (Princeton University Press,
1986), which he wrote with his friend Stephen Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the last year, there has been an accelerating pace of
discoveries in physics and cosmology? Which have impressed you
most?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some of the most impressive things, I think, are pictures the
Hubble telescope has sent down where the gravitational lens effects
have been observed. This is the bending of light through Einstein's
theory of general relativity, which tells you that light is bent by
a massive body such as the sun. The sun bends light and acts as a
lens. You can detect distributions of mass this way. You may not be
able actually to see the mass in this big galaxy, but if there are
other things behind it, you can see its lensing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you surprised by some of the recent discoveries
confirming the existence of black holes?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Surprised'' would be a little too strong. I think recent
evidence is pretty potent that black holes are there. For a long
time, the evidence was rather indirect. But you knew there was an
object out there that was too massive to be anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how are you voting on the shape of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are three main models. One, is positive spatial
curvature _ that the universe is like a huge sphere. Two, is zero
spatial curvature _ a so-called flat universe. Three is negative _
``saddle-shaped'' spatial curvature. I go with saddle shaped. For a
host of reasons, I think that's the most likely. And the evidence
is in fact shifting toward that. The universe seems ``low density''
and therefore of negative spatial curvature.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of new discoveries, what I wouldn't like is the
cosmological constant _ the mysterious cosmic repulsion Einstein
inserted into his equations to keep the universe stable _ being
non-zero. I've worked in General Relativity for most of my life and
there are aspects to the theory, which when you don't have the
cosmological constant, are much more appealing _ at least to me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if they find that, yes, there has to be a cosmological
constant, I'd have to go along with that. I'm not saying that I've
closed my mind to it. I would just prefer the cosmological constant
not to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And if the cosmological constant is there _ what does that do
to your work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Complicate it! (Laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. You seem to have a good capacity to live with being wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, a scientist should have. If I'm really shamefully
wrong, I have to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you're doing some way-out mathematical computations, do
you sometimes feel like an explorer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes, but also like an archeologist. You are looking for
clues that are sort of lying there, hidden. And you see different
forms of what may be underneath there and you see some of the
corners and you have a sense that there may be some structure that
may have influence on various different areas. Then you dig away
until you can find what the structure is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There was a debate in this newspaper last fall, ``the end of
science.'' Do you agree with those who argue that when it comes to
physics and mathematics that we know just about all that can be
known?
</P>
<P>
   A. The argument is that accessible, important ideas will run
out, that either we'll never understand certain things or we have
already understood them. This is an absurd position to take. People
have been saying that for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of a least one major area, which I'm absolutely sure
is missing from the present-day physics, which probably will come
in the next 50 years or so, and it will be a tremendous revolution.
It has to do with how to understand quantum mechanics. See, quantum
mechanics describes small-scale phenomena _ atoms, molecules,
particles. And if you have certain rules, which if you try to apply
them to large objects, they give you nonsense. They will tell you
that a baseball can be here and there at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless ways that people try to argue around this. But
to me, it says that the theory is just not right and that there is
a level that things go over from the quantum to the classical. I
think one can make good estimates as to what level that is. And I
even have proposals for experiments, which I hope will be
performed, which would tell whether this is right or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Among many physicists today, the leading candidate for
Einstein's dream of a unified ``theory of everything'' is the
theory of superstrings, based on the notion that elementary
particles are not points but strings?
</P>
<P>
   A. String theory is an example of science being driven by
fashion. And I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the
mathematical notions which people associate with string theory are
very appealing. But just because they are appealing doesn't mean
that they are right. In a book I'm trying to write now, I want to
talk about all these theories, including my own baby, twistor
theory _ a mathematical scheme for re-expressing the structure of
space-time in which individual points are not regarded as the
fundamental things, but entire light rays are taken as more
fundamental as individual points. Sorry. I can't explain it in a
less complicated way. My point in the book will be that twistor
theory certainly hasn't solved some of the problems that I thought
it would, but it's very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Ten years ago, in ``The Emperor's New Mind,'' you said that
computers were not likely to ever have consciousness _ that all
they could do was merely ``compute.'' With all the recent advances
in computer technology, do you still feel that way?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. A computer is a great device because it enables you to
do anything which is automatic, anything that you don't need your
understanding for. Understanding is outside a computer. It doesn't
understand. Whereas to know what the calculations are supposed to
do, what the answers mean when it's finished, requires your
understanding and that's complementary to the computation.
</P>
<P>
   And the understanding aspect of it, is something that requires
one's awareness, consciousness. If you didn't have consciousness,
you couldn't understand. The strong artificial intelligence people
feel that consciousness is some kind of ``emergent'' phenomena;
it's something that just comes about.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think some of the artificial intelligence
proponents seem to have such a stake in the notion that a machine
can outthink a human being?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that one reason is that people really cannot think of
anything else which they would call ``scientific.'' And these
computing devices are tremendous and they can do computations in a
fantastic way. But the artificial intelligence proponents think
that's all there is. They think that a scientific theory has to be
computational. If you come from mathematics, as I do, you realize
that there are many problems, even classical problems, which cannot
be solved by computation alone. Another reason is people get work,
they get grants, they publish papers and they want to get more
money. So they don't like my coming along and saying, ``No, no,
there are limits to what you can achieve this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The third is, it's a bit like religion. The question of what the
mind, what consciousness is, is related to what people want
religion for. Some religious people feel happy with a certain
viewpoint and they don't like to be challenged. These artificial
intelligence people are somehow happy because they have a model
that they are content with and they don't want somebody coming
around that disturbs that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the match a while ago between IBM's ``Deep Blue'' computer
and Garry Kasparov, whom were you rooting for?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was rooting for Kasparov, human chauvinist that I am. I'm
not sure that he was the right person to play the match. Because he
depends too much on being brilliant. I think Karpov, who plays more
consistently, but not so brilliantly, would be a much better
person.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you don't think that anyone will ever be able create
computers with emotions?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I believe there is something going on in a conscious
being, which includes many animals, as well as ourselves, that is
not a computational activity. And to be conscious at all is not a
quality that a computer as such will ever possess _ no matter how
complicated, no matter how well it plays chess or any of these
things. It doesn't mean, on the other hand, that somebody sometime
in the future could not build some kind of a device, NOT a
computer, which did whatever we do. I'm saying we won't get at it
through computation alone.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you working on now?
</P>
<P>
   A. Two major research areas. The first is twistor theory, and
more specifically, in developing its relation to Einstein's general
relativity, which I think is key. Once that connection is made
clearer, then the hope is, it will give good leads on how to
combine general relativity with quantum mechanics. There's a big
gap there. If twistor theory can incorporate general relativity
then it will give leads on how to unite general relativity with
quantum theory.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I'm working on also has to do with the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. It's the link I mentioned
earlier between the small scale and the large scale _ and the
possibility of experiments that will show the limitations of
present-day quantum mechanics. This is an experiment that I hope
will actually be performed in space. It's much more directly
related to observation than twistor theory, which is mathematical.
If the experiment comes out the way I hope, it will tell us we need
a major revolution in quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have toys here in your office. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) Science and fun cannot be separated.

   Q: Businesses called oxygen bars, which provide customers with
oxygen-rich air, are cropping up on the West Coast. Do these
provide any health benefits?
</P>
<P>
   _ ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   YES
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that oxygen is a necessary nutrient for the
function and health of every cell in the human body, and there is
more than enough literature in favor of oxygen therapies. I have
seen the practical effect of oxygen on the reversal of many
diseases at my clinic, the Wilshire Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most common benefits are related to lung conditions
such as asthma, and it has even been beneficial in sinusitis. It
has relieved migraine headaches, muscle stiffness and tension, has
been important in chronic fatigue syndrome as well as Epstein-Barr
and other conditions like depression. If you use oxygen for 20
minutes you will notice a change. Muscles become loosened,
headaches and stress seem to disappear. There is a renewed energy
level if you are feeling down, and a feeling of relaxation if you
are feeling tense. I am confident that oxygen works.

oxygen bar, O2
</P>
<P>
   NO
</P>
<P>
   The inhalation of pure oxygen gas has been proven beneficial in
humans suffering from illnesses that compromise the function of
lungs and the cardiovascular system. And the application of
concentrated oxygen gas given to normal, healthy people has proven
efficacious in activities at high altitudes, where the partial
pressure of oxygen in air is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no evidence that breathing oxygen by healthy
people at sea level produces any significant benefit. The body
cannot store oxygen and the brief inspiration of concentrated
oxygen will minimally, if at all, elevate the amount of oxygen
being supplied to the body's tissue. At best, breathing oxygen at
sea level by healthy people will have a greater psychological
effect than any known physiologic effect. It is probably not
detrimental and represents a harmless activity which, at best,
could have some placebo effect.

   LESBIAN HEALTH: A MATTER OF MYSTERIES
</P>
<P>
   After surveying the body of scientific literature on lesbian
health and holding workshops with researchers and clinicians, a
panel of experts convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a
report last week deploring the gaps in reliable information about
lesbian health. The panel called for large-scale studies to counter
rampant ``myths and misconceptions'' and to improve the quality of
treatment lesbians are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of little empirical information, there are
numerous beliefs and misconceptions about the health risks of
lesbians that can affect their health outcome,'' said the report,
called ``Lesbian Health: Current Assessment and Directions for the
Future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some beliefs are true, but many are not, the report said. For
example, lesbians commonly believe they do not need regular Pap
tests or routine gynecological care. And many also worry that there
is an epidemic of breast cancer among lesbians. Though there is
anecdotal evidence that lesbians experience higher rates of breast
and cervical cancers, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, sexually
transmitted diseases, hypertension, and mental health and substance
abuse problems, the panel found no reliable research proving that
lesbianism itself was a risk factor for disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know whether they're at higher risk for certain
cancers per se, because many of them have not had children,'' said
Dr. Ann Burgess, a nursing professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who headed the panel. Hormonal fluxes of pregnancy can
lower the risks of breast and ovarian cancers. Also, as a group,
lesbians smoke more and weigh more than heterosexual women, which
may explain the higher rates of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the panel noted, lesbians tend to visit their
doctors less frequently, either because they fear discrimination or
they are less likely to have health insurance because lesbians
generally cannot share spousal benefits. Managed care often limits
women's ability to choose lesbian-friendly providers.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian leaders have cheered the report's publication. ``This
will be a wonderful resource,'' said Dr. Jocelyn White, co-editor
in chief of The Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.
The Institute of Medicine, which is the nongovernmental health
policy arm of the National Academy of Sciences, conducted the study
for the National Institutes of Health, which provided financing.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for more research on lesbian health and on ways
to improve lesbians' access to care. It also urges researchers
studying women's issues to include questions about sexual
orientation in study designs.

 &HT;    In Denver, Broncos season just as 'magical'
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Around the Rockies, they don't care about that Southern
fairy tale. They know about those in Suwanee, Ga., rallying around
Dan Reeves' heart. They've seen that Dirty Bird thing. They also
realize teams rising from nothing to something in a hurry such as
the Atlanta Falcons always receive the public's hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of that matters to those partial to the Denver
Broncos. They suggest ``Orange Crush'' was the rage long before
there was the flapping of imaginary wings with the fluttering of
feet.
</P>
<P>
   As for Reeves' heart, well, it's like this: Been there, done
that. They had the heart of the Falcons coach, along with his mind,
body and soul for a dozen years when he ran the Broncos through the
1992 season. They saw Reeves push the Broncos to five AFC West
titles, four trips to the AFC Championship Game and three Super
Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the only thing they really care about these days is the
Broncos' current season. Just like that of the Falcons, it has
featured enough pretty moments along the way to the Super Bowl to
make linebacker Bill Romanowski gush, ``This is a magical team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's funny. That's what many say about the Falcons, but they
say so about the Broncos in these parts for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, Jason Elam reached the NFL record book by
tying Tom Dempsey with a 63-yard field goal. Terrell Davis was
named the league's Most Valuable Player after rushing for 2,008
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was John Elway, always the people's choice. He moved
his career passing yards over 50,000. Not only that, he continued
to prosper under the speculation that this is his 16th and final
season.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes down to the following: Which is the biggest catalyst
for a world championship? Reeves' heart or Elway's farewell?
</P>
<P>
   Tough call.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not for the Broncos. They did the impossible Sunday by
playing so poorly against the New York Jets in the AFC Championship
Game that they silenced the eternal screamers inside packed Mile
High Stadium. The Broncos trailed 10-0 moments into the third
quarter, and the Jets gathered even more momentum after a blocked
punt.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elway walked into the Broncos' huddle. Right tackle Harry
Swayne smiled, saying, ``There was a little more oomph in his
inflection after (they blocked the punt). John Elway has had so
many comebacks that we didn't see why 10 points would fluster
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, not with the Broncos racing to a 23-10 victory on
Elway's arm and Davis' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, the Broncos are chasing the ghosts of potent
NFL teams of the 1990s. The Dallas Cowboys won three Super Bowls in
five years. The San Francisco 49ers took Super Bowl XXIX and
appeared in three consecutive NFC Championship Games. The Green Bay
Packers won a world title after reaching two Super Bowls and three
NFC Championship Games.
</P>
<P>
   By handling the Jets, the Broncos joined the 49ers as the only
NFL team ever to win 45 games over a three-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   By handling the Falcons, the Broncos would become only the sixth
team to win back-to-back Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos also would answer our previous questions about fate.

WHY ECO-TOURISTS ARE SHUNNING BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Blessed with a rain forest the size of
Western Europe, wetlands where rivers magically swell from 300
yards to 37 miles in the rainy season, and a dazzling string of
waterfalls in the south, Brazil would seem to be a natural magnet
for ecologically driven travelers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was not long ago that eco-tourism represented the
great hope of Brazilian environmentalists and tour operators: they
hoped to show business interests that doing the right thing by
leaving rain forests and wilderness intact could pay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nature travel in Brazil has failed to take off as once
expected, say tourism experts here, and instead has declined
steadily through the 1990s. While Costa Rica and other Latin
American countries have captured the imagination of nature lovers,
such travelers have been bypassing Brazil, where the
accommodations, infrastructure and expertise come up short. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are scarce, but Roberto Mourao, president of the
Brazilian Ecotourism Association, estimates that over the last
decade, eco-tourism has fallen by half, driven down by failures on
the part of government and the tourism industry to build on the
surging interest in the environment with well-prepared programs for
tourists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of environmental attractions by the Ecotourism
Institute of Brazil found serious obstacles throughout the country,
from lack of road signs to poor accommodations and ill-trained
guides.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amazon has a name that seduces people, so you don't have
to position your product, but there are other problems,'' Mourao
said. About 70 percent of tourists to the Amazon want to see
wildlife, he said, but the Amazon is a dense forest where days or
weeks may pass without any sightings of animals or rare birds.
Guides may know less than amateur bird watchers or animal lovers
who have traveled thousands of miles for a glimpse of a rare or
beautiful creature.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is laced with natural wonders. Its rain forest alone
would cover half the continental United States. The Amazon contains
20 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Unspoiled, fauna and
flora seem to spill over each other from every bit of soil and
bark, and tropical parrots, toucans and other birds flit through
the lush landscape. The string of waterfalls at Iguacu in the south
was the backdrop for the 1986 movie ``The Mission.'' And the
80,000-square-mile Pantanal, the world's largest wetland, is
prolific in wildlife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the problem may have its roots in successful
marketing. Brazil began promoting its ecological wonders without
first creating the infrastructure necessary to receive tourists.
Rare is the hotel outside a major city that will accept
international credit cards, for example. Nor was much market
research done to discover what eco-tourists were after. Often,
Mourao said, tourists reach a remote destination for a prepaid
one-week stay and end up stranded at a rustic inn without enough
programs to explore their surroundings. Though travel agents say
foreigners represent 95 to 98 percent of those who visit the Amazon
or the Pantanal, Brazil's two major eco-tourism destinations, most
guides there speak little or no English, French or German.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renato Riedel, the head of Hotel Partners, which represents a
number of regional hotels and tour boats that ply the Amazon, said
that tourism was down 15 percent over the last two years. El Nino
dried up parts of the rain forest last winter, lowering the water
level of rivers and spreading fires to parts of virgin forest.
``With that, people left and said, `Shoot, this Amazon is
terrible,''' Riedel said. ``And word spreads.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic economic downturn that began last year, he added,
is also responsible for reducing eco-tourism, which is usually more
expensive in Brazil than in smaller countries. He also noted that
Brazil's extremes of wealth and poverty _ among the most dramatic
in the world _ make tourists particularly vulnerable to crime, from
assaults on the beaches to hotel operators who add fraudulent
charges to credit card bills. ``All of that contributes to leaving
us behind when it comes to eco-tourism,'' Riedel said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The destinations of environmental tourists are usually remote
specks on the map, but foreigners inevitably spend some time in Rio
de Janeiro or other cities, and leave shocked by the piles of
houses crammed into the hillside slums and the general lack of
hygiene. When it rains, the raw sewage overflows into the Atlantic
Ocean in Rio, leaving what the Brazilians call a ``black tongue''
of waste along the water's edge.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's eco-tourism also suffers because of the country's size
and the expense of domestic travel. For $1,000, the cost of some
bargain packages covering air fare and hotel, a New Yorker can
spend a week on the beaches of Costa Rica, with a jaunt into the
rain forest. Depending on your departure date, the same amount
would just cover the coach air fare to Manaus, but would not be
enough for the fare to Rio plus the $500 bargain air pass for
domestic travel (available only abroad) to more remote airports in
the Amazon or the Pantanal. Once there, the tourist may still face
an expensive charter flight or cab ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The environment, Riedel said, is a ``natural patrimony that
Brazil has, and it's the best in the world . . . a tremendous
potential that's not being exploited.''

 &HT;    Broncos confident of putting stop to Falcons run game
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Only four times in 18 games this season has Atlanta
Falcons tailback Jamal Anderson failed to gain at least 88 yards
rushing. That number _ ``the double eights'' as Denver Broncos
defensive tackle Keith Traylor referred to it Monday _ is
significant for another reason as well.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four games, the final two of the regular season
and a pair of victories in the playoffs, it represents the total
rushing yards surrendered by the Denver defense. In those four
contests, opponents had a combined 67 carries for a microscopic
average of 1.3 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the run is something we have a lot of confidence in,
because it's something we have done all year,'' Denver middle
linebacker Glenn Cadrez said after the Broncos' 23-10 victory in
the AFC championship game on Sunday. ``The way we have been
playing, teams have to throw the ball 50 times and complete 40 of
them, (because) they're not going to beat us on the ground. That's
just the way it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets tailback Curtis Martin was the latest victim. He
logged 13 attempts on Sunday and finished with a puny 14 yards.
Excluding his 1-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter,
eight of Martin's 13 rushes netted 1 yard or less and his longest
run was for only 4 yards. One week earlier, in a 38-3 romp over
Miami, the Denver defense also limited Dolphins backs to 14 yards
on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Take away a 12-yard run by Miami backup Bernie Parmalee and the
Broncos allowed an average gain of less than two feet per rush.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Dolphins, the rushing totals were a bit skewed,
because Denver sprinted to an early 14-0 lead and effectively
forced Miami to abandon the rushing game. But in a first half on
Sunday that was scoreless until the final play before intermission,
the typically hard-running Martin managed just 11 yards on eight
rushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a man matched up on me everywhere I went,'' said
Martin, who in his career has just 101 yards in four games against
Denver. ``They pursued the ball really well and they wrapped up.
They just didn't hit, they made tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been quite a transformation for a Denver run defense that
last year was arguably the worst ever to advance to a Super Bowl.
The Broncos statistically ranked No. 16 in the league versus the
run. Opponents averaged 4.7 yards per rush, the worst number in the
NFL, and the highest ever for a Super Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing run-stuffing middle linebacker Allen Aldridge to
free agency during the offseason, and inserting second-year tackle
Trevor Pryce into the lineup, the Broncos jumped all the way to No.
3 in run defense this season.
</P>
<P>
   The journeyman Cadrez has been better than coaches anticipated
in replacing Aldridge and, like outside linebackers John Mobley
(weakside) and Bill Romanowski (strongside), is very active. Pryce
likewise has played well and Traylor over the last several years
has been an unheralded inside anchor. The Broncos may play a bit
more one-gap than they did in the past, but their signature under
coordinator Greg Robinson has been as a quick and penetrating front
that tries to surround the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic Romanowski, who had a game-high 11 tackles on
Sunday, plays off blocks well and Mobley (nine tackles) is one of
the NFL's most athletic linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has been most impressive stuffing opponents on first
down. In their postseason victories, the Broncos held the Dolphins
and the Jets to 8 yards total on 14 first-down rushes. As a result,
the two teams averaged 7.8 yards-to-make on third downs and they
converted on just five of 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to (sustain) many drives when it's always
third-and-8,'' said New York quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' success aside, they have not faced a back as good
as Anderson all season. The Atlanta star saw a lot of eight-man
fronts on Sunday, when Minnesota defensive coordinator Foge Fazio
kept bringing strong safety Robert Griffith on run-dogs. He may
face a similar strategy in Super Bowl XXXIII, but the Broncos
acknowledged on Sunday evening that they'll have to tackle
extremely well against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anderson is a runner who will rip your arms right out of the
sockets if you don't wrap him up,'' said Pryce. ``From what I've
seen, you don't arm-tackle that guy. You have to get a lot of
people around him and force him to run laterally if you can. It's
going to be one of our biggest challenges.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NYON, Switzerland _ Before they met in the early 1990s, Roberto
Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu were well on their way to promising
careers as opera singers. As a couple, though, they had something
extra to offer: a touching love story for the gossip columns and an
offstage passion to bring alive their onstage trysts. At least when
they cry or die in, say, ``La Boheme,'' they really seem to love
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it has helped enormously that Alagna, 35, is a lyric
tenor and Ms. Gheorghiu, 33, is a lyric soprano: many of the best
opera roles and most humable arias are written for their voices. If
they wanted to (although they say this is not their intention),
they could even plan their careers almost entirely around
performing with each other. As it is, in the 30 months since they
married, they have frequently recorded and appeared onstage
together.
</P>
<P>
   Yet being a husband-and-wife team in opera is not proving easy,
at least not if you are a moody Sicilian-French tenor and a fiery
Romanian-born soprano. They like to work in tandem to get their
way, but the very chemistry that binds them and excites audiences
has had the effect of irritating a good many power brokers of the
opera world.
</P>
<P>
   Their admirers hope they will grow into a duo as memorable as
Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland. For the moment, though, they
are better known as ``enfants terribles.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the New York
Metropolitan Opera, abruptly withdrew a contract for them to appear
in Franco Zeffirelli's new production of ``La Traviata.'' Jonathan
Miller, who has directed them separately, has nicknamed them
opera's ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' Wags at Covent Garden call them ``the
Ceausescus,'' a less than friendly reference to the deposed
Romanian dictator and his feared wife, Elena.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, they are still very much in demand, which
says something about their talent and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 23 they will be singing in five performances of
Gounod's ``Romeo et Juliette'' at the Lyric Opera in Chicago. In
March they are to sing Mascagni's ``Amico Fritz'' in Monte Carlo,
and in May they are to perform in a duo recital in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Met also wants them back. They are expected to do ``L'Elisir
d'Amore'' together there late in 1999. Alagna is to do ``Carmen''
and Ms. Gheorghiu ``Turandot'' at the Met in late 2000, and they
are both to sing Act III of ``Rigoletto'' in a gala evening that
will open the 2001 season, followed a few days later by ``La
Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they seem to recognize that they have something of an
image problem: if not with the public, at least with some opera
managements. That perhaps explains why Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu
cracked open a bottle of Champagne for a visitor to their
comfortable home overlooking Lake Geneva before their trip to the
United States. They feel a tad misunderstood, they said, and they
wanted to explain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are unsuccessful, you don't have this problem,'' Alagna
said, speaking urgently as if still bruised by criticism. ``From
the moment you are successful, people begin to gossip: not the
public, but the small circles of opera. Why do people still talk
about the fight between Maria Callas and Rudolph Bing at the Met?
Because they were Callas and Bing. Now instead of welcoming two
young singers, people invent, they tittle-tattle, they exaggerate
everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna conceded that he upset opera managements by canceling
some engagements, but he said he had good reasons. ``My first wife
was ill for 18 months before she died in 1994,'' he said. ``During
that time I didn't cancel one show because singing was my way of
forgetting what was happening in reality. I signed every contract.
I did 80 performances a year. I was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Angela and she saw my program, she said I was
crazy. I had to reduce the load to keep sane.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before his much-vaunted and less-than-triumphant debut at
the Met in April 1996, experts were warning this stocky former
cabaret singer that he was working too much, risking damage to his
voice at an early stage of his career. Opera managers, of course,
were not amused by last-minute cancellations by a young crowd
pleaser who was being heatedly promoted by his record company as
``the fourth tenor.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the couple's moments of notoriety are more a function of
the complex power structure of the opera world. Young singers must
compete fiercely for major roles and have little say over the
productions in which they appear. At the other extreme, the likes
of Placido Domingo and Pavarotti can more or less define the terms
under which they perform. Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu are now at a
halfway stage: they want their views to be heard, but they still
face resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one remembers the public,'' Alagna said. ``Today it is all
to do with the director, the conductor and the theater manager, but
no one thinks of the public. People who have had a hard day want to
dream, to feel, `Oh, that's beautiful.' We're artists, and we're
there to entertain people, to give them pleasure. People want to
dream of young love, to cry, to laugh, to see things they don't
have in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu disagree occasionally, talking over
each other as if singing a duet. But on this point there is
consensus: All too often conductors and stage directors forget that
singers are the ones who must face and engage the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a conductor who loves you, who loves the voice,
who understands what you want to do, that's OK,'' Ms. Gheorghiu
said in English, sipping delicately at her glass of champagne.
``But if you have someone who says, `You do it like this,' with no
explanation, it's a problem. Sometimes we are forced to, but it is
not our interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna, more talkative than his wife, chimed in. ``There are
conductors who take themselves for Napoleon,'' he said in French. (
Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu talk to each other in Italian.) ``The
conductors say they are in charge, only they are right. I think
that in every area there should be discussion. If there is a
dictatorship, everyone works at 50 percent capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   When they bemoan the modern and avant-garde productions of
classical operas that are particularly common in Europe these days,
Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu are certainly also speaking for a good
many other singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A modern decor for a contemporary opera makes sense,'' Alagna
said. ``But why distort Verdi, Puccini? Directors today seem to
think if you do a normal `Traviata,' you're ridiculous. The curtain
goes up and the decor is all black. It's nothing. It could work for
`Faust,' `Lucia' or Mozart, but if we say anything, they call us
divas.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna recalled appearing in ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with June
Anderson in a production directed by Andrei Serban at the Bastille
Opera in February 1995; the setting was a gymnasium, and the
costumes resembled SS uniforms. The singers were acclaimed, but
Serban was loudly booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a catastrophe,'' Alagna said. ``We were heckled every
night. Is that normal? The public had no idea what was going on. It
might have interested the director, he might have thought he was
being daring. Real courage would have been to do something new
within the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna and Ms. Gheorghiu still do not always get their way. In
late 1997 she sang Violetta in Miller's new production of ``La
Traviata'' at the Bastille Opera. Bizarrely, the director set the
opera's final act in a modern hospital ward. ``I begged Jonathan in
a friendly way to change that,'' Ms. Gheorghiu recalled, ``but he
would not. The production got bad reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   During a Japanese tour of the Met's production of ``Carmen,''
she stormily refused to wear a blond wig and was promptly replaced
by her understudy. For the following performance, she reluctantly
donned the wig, but felt, she said, absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Decor was apparently a factor in Volpe's decision to withdraw
the contract for the couple to appear in ``La Traviata'' at the
Met. He said he had shown them the production sketches but had also
given them a deadline to sign their contracts. Alagna said he
declined because he did not want to be away at that time from
Ornella, his 7-year-old daughter from his first marriage, but he
also criticized the set proposed for Act II. And he may have been
right. Zeffirelli's production was savaged by New York critics.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment the couple have not insisted on performing
together, they said, partly because opera managements would
probably refuse, partly because they both have their own favorite
operas. But it suits them when opera houses bring them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have joint careers, and we also have separate careers,''
Alagna said. ``But above all we want to be together in life because
otherwise this job isn't worth doing. We get invitations to sing
every day, but we say no more often than yes. We try not to be
apart for more than two weeks at a time because we love each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Their decision to live in this sleepy Swiss town rather than
Paris, London or New York can only reflect a desire for a private
life, ``to be able to go out to the shops without being bothered,''
as Alagna put it. And close friends say Nyon has been working its
soothing magic on the couple: they are more relaxed as artists and
have even learned to laugh at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To test this, Ms. Gheorghiu was asked whether she knew that her
strong personality had earned this Romanian soprano the nickname
``La Draculette'' at the Paris Opera.
</P>
<P>
   She looked puzzled, but Alagna burst out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be brave to have married a Dracula,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I were from Russia, what would I be?'' Ms. Gheorghiu
asked innocently.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's eyes gleamed with mischief. ``Rasputina!'' he
shouted, then rewarded her with a warm hug.

HURRICANE MITCH SPARED KEY TOURISM AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 24.) 
(ms) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA _ Hurricane Mitch has come and gone, but the damage
wrought by the most devastating natural disaster to strike Central
America this century will take years to repair. The pattern of
destruction throughout the region was capricious, however, meaning
that some areas were pummeled while others were barely touched, if
at all. So here is a quick assessment for potential visitors:
</P>
<P>
   The two nations most severely affected by the storm, which at
its peak in late October had winds of more than 180 miles an hour,
were Honduras and Nicaragua. Most of the 10,000 people estimated to
have been killed by Mitch died in those countries, which also bore
the brunt of the $3 billion in damage to property and
infrastructure in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But even in those two countries the devastation was hardly
generalized. In Nicaragua, damage was concentrated in the far
northwest, well off the tourist track, while in Honduras, the
capital, Tegucigalpa, was ravaged but important tourist sites such
as the Maya ruins at Copan were not affected. As a result, tourism
officials in neighboring countries now complain that the entire
region has been unjustly tarred by the travails of a relatively
limited area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Mitch did not really hit us, other than some damage
to docks and some beach erosion on the outer islands,'' said
Valerie Woods, director of the Belize Tourist Board. ``The real
damage we have suffered is a result of people lumping us together
with Honduras and Nicaragua and thinking we were wiped out, which
unfortunately has led to some reservations being canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the Central American isthmus, hundreds of
miles away from the path of the hurricane, Costa Rica and Panama
suffered even less damage: minor flooding and a bit of debris when
the storm was still far out at sea and before it turned inland from
the Gulf of Honduras, but no harm to infrastructure. In El
Salvador, the storm killed more than 240 people and wreaked havoc
with roads and agriculture; the damage was mostly in the eastern
third of the country, where foreign visitors rarely venture.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's situation is more complicated. President Alvaro Arzu
decreed a state of national emergency, which was lifted earlier
this month, and later said that, though the death toll was much
lower than that of the 1976 earthquake, material damage caused by
Mitch was higher. Nearly 100 bridges were destroyed or damaged,
most of them in the departments of Zacapa and Chiquimula, which
border Honduras and are often used as staging points for day trips
to Copan.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, though, much of the damage had been repaired and
traffic was back to normal, most notably on sections of the
Pan-American Highway west from Guatemala City toward the Mexican
border. That means visitors to Lake Atitlan and its surrounding
volcanoes, or to Chichicastenango and other popular market towns in
highland areas such as the Quiche, should not have to endure
anything other than the usual delays. Weather in the highlands has
been unusually cold, though, with overnight temperatures in the 30s
in the wake of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the route from Guatemala City northward to
the Peten still has delays for repairs and one-lane pontoon bridges
where permanent bridges were washed out, according to tour
operators and bus lines. Even in the best of times, the route is a
long, slow trek _ some of it on paved roads, but other long
stretches on rugged surfaces. But the airport at Flores, in the
heart of the Peten, is operating normally, and no hotels in the
jungle region were damaged by the storm, whose path across
Guatemala took it parallel to the Pacific coast in the far south.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Belize, also part of the popular Ruta Maya (a
circuit of archeological sites in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and
Belize), took only a glancing blow, largely confined to offshore
areas such as Ambergris Cay and the Turneffe Islands. But even
there, damage was mostly cosmetic: The Belize Hotel Association
says that only one of its members, on Glover's Atoll, was forced to
close even temporarily, but notes that overall bookings were off
about 8 percent in November and December because of lingering
concern over the storm's impact.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, Mitch may actually have benefited the diving
aficionados who flock to the Bay Islands of Honduras and the many
keys, atolls and reefs just off mainland Belize. While a few
denizens of the deep such as sea fans and tube sponges were hurt,
sea life as a whole has been invigorated and the overall marine
environment cleansed. The storm swept some silt buildup from the
reefs and everything looks a little cleaner, said Hugh Parkey,
owner of the Belize Dive Connection in Belize City. ``It's like
someone took a giant feather duster and dusted it off,'' he said.

RUFF TO ARGUE DEFENSE CASE IN CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff is expected
to delve into the facts of President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky when White House lawyers begin their defense case
Tuesday at the president's Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is likely to increase the likelihood that the
Senate will call witnesses later this month so that the lawmakers
can try and decide whose version to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, 59, a widely respected veteran of Washington legal circles
who served as the fourth and final Watergate special prosecutor
from 1975 to 1977, is scheduled to be the sole White House lawyer
to speak Tuesday when the trial resumes at 1 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors are hard pressed to persuade two-thirds of
the Senate to impeach the president, but it appears increasingly
likely that the Senate will vote to hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle acknowledged Monday that
witnesses ``may be inevitable.'' Daschle said he believes witnesses
are unnecessary but conceded the political momentum was moving
toward having some witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After House prosecutors wrapped up their three days of
presentations Saturday, many Republican senators said they hoped to
see the White House dispute the facts laid out by the House
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incumbent upon the president or the president's attorneys
to show where these facts are wrong,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``They are going to have to explain why this isn't perjury,
why this isn't obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If all they do is come in here and say the bar has to be very,
very high, we all know that,'' Hatch added. ``It's phony to (state)
that this doesn't rise to the level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., also said he was waiting to see White
House lawyers address the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if the tight web the House managers have woven
can be torn by the White House,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart continued the defense
attack on any plan to bring witnesses to the trial, saying such a
step would ``only extend and delay this process.'' Many of them
have already been deposed and testified over 20 times, Lockhart
complained, and ``asking them to do it one more time is not likely
to provide any new or shocking revelations in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who was U.S. attorney in Washington from 1979 to 1982,
uses a wheelchair because of a paralyzing disease he caught when
visiting Africa as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   His presentation will be an overview that will launch three days
of White House attacks against the prosecution's case, arguing the
facts, the law and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the defense team expects
to attack what he said was the House prosecutors'
``mischaracterizations of the evidence in the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said House prosecutors ``painted a false picture'' by
``taking things from the record out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if you look at the full record and the
testimony in context it will become clear that the allegations
don't hold up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors last week accused the president of plotting to
get Lewinsky, the former White House intern, to file a false
affidavit in the Paul Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit and to
cover up their relationship by hiding gifts that Clinton had given
to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors also said the president helped find a job for
Lewinsky in exchange for her silence and tried to illegally
influence the testimony of other witnesses. They also claim the
president lied to the grand jury about his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart expressed confidence that, at the end of the three days
of defense argument, ``people will have a different view of the
case that's been laid out and the facts that have been laid before
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Ruff will point out that the president
acknowledged to the grand jury that he had an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow that message hasn't gotten out there,'' Lockhart said.

 &HT;    Leap from wide bodies to well bodies appeals to RoeckBy Scott
Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's life after airlines for Tom Roeck, even if
it's not with a wide-bodied corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The former Delta Air Lines Inc. chief financial officer,
jettisoned along with other top executives in the management
overhaul at Atlanta's biggest employer, has landed with a small but
growing health care firm that blends business and altruism.
</P>
<P>
   Roeck is ``executive committee chair'' at Chamberlin Edmonds &AMP;
Associates, which helps hospitals convert uninsured patients into
Medicaid or Medicare recipients. The business focuses on two goals:
boost the hospitals' bottom lines and help patients get coverage
for better treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of doing well by doing good has great appeal,'' said
Roeck, still looking corporate in a crisp button-down and striped
tie during an interview at the firm's Buckhead office.
</P>
<P>
   Roeck is chief strategic and financial advisor to Chamberlin
Edmonds owner and CEO Judy Starkey, who started the firm in 1986.
She had the idea after navigating the health care maze to get
treatment for her autistic son.
</P>
<P>
   Starkey said Roeck, who has a two-year contract, adds
``tremendous long-range vision and expertise'' to her firm, which
employs about 180 people.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin Edmonds has hospital clients in 11 states and plans a
rapid national expansion, Roeck said. It collected about $100
million in Medicaid and Medicare funds for hospitals last year and
got a percentage of that in fees. Patients pay nothing for the help
they get.
</P>
<P>
   Roeck is no stranger to health-related causes. He chairs AID
Atlanta's finance committee, has worked for the United Way on
children's health-care projects and is on the board of Mission New
Hope, which fights drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving Delta in late 1997, where he made $490,000 in
salary and bonus in his last full year, Roeck could afford to take
his time assessing his future and begin it with a small company.
</P>
<P>
   He still closely follows events at Delta and betrays no
bitterness about the management shakeup. He praises the airline's
chief executive, Leo Mullin, who arrived in mid-1997 and replaced
Roeck a few months later. Mullin has since eased out other
old-guard Delta executives; so far Roeck is the only one who's
emerged with another company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Leo's done a terrific job recruiting some terrific
people,'' Roeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Roeck said he got along with Mullin initially, but added:
``There comes a point when you get the feeling the chemistry just
isn't there....it was just one of those things.'' After the ax
fell, he said, Mullin ``was very gracious throughout the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He's less forthcoming about his relationship with former Delta
CEO Ronald Allen, whom Mullin replaced. One story had it that a
quiet move by Allen to sack Roeck without board approval was one of
the flashpoints that led to Allen's forced early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Allen remains in Atlanta but hasn't given interviews about his
departure. In light of that, ``it wouldn't be fair for me to
speculate on what I might have had to do with it,'' said Roeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it was a knee-jerk reaction to any one event,''
he said, adding he has had only one chance meeting with Allen since
both left the airline.
</P>
<P>
   But Roeck worked closely with Allen in the early 1990s as Delta
lurched into an international expansion that coincided with a deep
industry downturn. ``When we got into 1992 and started losing the
kind of money we were, I didn't expect that,'' Roeck said, adding
that his finance department raised $3.6 billion in capital just to
sustain the airline's daily operations over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 management imposed layoffs and cutbacks that finally
restored profits but sapped morale and created service problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could and had to make a lot of tradeoffs,''
said Roeck. He added management knew service might suffer but
underestimated the impact of staff cuts in customer-contact areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the troubles on a 1991 move to buy bankrupt Pan Am's
Europe routes and absorb 7,800 of its workers in the midst of a
recession. By some accounts, Roeck opposed Allen's pursuit of the
deal, but that isn't true, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I knew all along how it would turn out. I
was an active supporter of the Pan Am deal. The industry was in
turmoil and these routes were being offered up and they were vital
to establishing a position in Europe,'' he said. Roeck said he
believed _ wrongly, it turned out _ that the best part of the deal
was Pan Am's Frankfurt, Germany, hub, while its New York operations
were questionable. Delta has since dismantled the Frankfurt hub and
built up overseas flights from the Kennedy Airport gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Roeck is aware some Delta workers and customers will always
blame the old management team for tarnishing the company's culture
and service commitment. But he takes an upbeat view. ``The way I
look at it, the airline industry in general went through a very
difficult period. All of us can be proud we got the company through
it in fairly good order, considering the pressures on it.''

STRETCH MARKET FOR LIMOUSINES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Mass., Fla.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The passengers in those limousines are not all haughty film
stars sipping Cosmopolitan cocktails. In the last few weeks, I
heard about a Halloween birthday party where 15 costumed
8-year-olds had a ball riding to a New York restaurant in a maximo
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, at loggerheads with a son about who would drive the
second car needed to get seven people to Connecticut for Christmas
dinner, hired a stretch limo for the whole group for $240 each way
and was delighted with the trip and the sociability.
</P>
<P>
   Even I, after years as a limo shunner, have at last seen the
inside of a super stretch. At the travel agents' convention in Los
Angeles in October, a hotel organization sent a long white limo to
take a group of us to a reception.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking an alternative, I climbed aboard with nine others: three
facing front, two facing back and five along the side. I have since
learned that this was probably a 120-inch stretch, meaning that the
sedan had been cut apart and 10 more feet of car inserted in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   If 8-year-olds and people like me, who are neither getting
married nor going to a prom, are riding in limousines, it dawned on
me that things must have undergone a radical change. And indeed
they have.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kosman, president of 1-800-Limo-Center, a new national
network of companies with headquarters in Rochelle Park, N.J., said
there has been an explosion in the chauffeured-car business in the
last two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, a limo was something of a luxury,'' he said.
``Today the corporate world has realized it is the most
cost-effective way to get around. If a $500,000-a-year executive is
flying to someplace to close a $10 million deal, it does not make
sense for him to get a rental car, figure out where he's going,
drive there, find a parking place and walk in wilted.'' He said
that estimates in the business, which is quite fragmented, put
annual growth at 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Limousine and Chauffeured Transportation, published
in Torrance, Calif., reports that nationally 65 percent of company
operators reported average revenue increases of 29 percent last
year; 6 percent reported a decline, the rest level revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's editor, Sara Eastwood-McLean, said that companies
now tend to buy each other out so that after 13 years of growth or
stability in the total number of companies, 1998 saw a decline from
9,600 operators to 9,100.
</P>
<P>
   Scott A. Solombrino, president of Dav El Chauffeured
Transportation Network, with headquarters in Chelsea, Mass., said
his company has grown an average of 28 percent a year for five
years. The worldwide fleet, he said, totals 10,400 vehicles. Like
Kosman, he said that corporate business was powering the expansion,
particularly businesses' belief that resources were being wasted
when executives were using rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second big force is the advent of the female executive,''
Solombrino said. ``A company knows it is incurring a liability if a
female CEO arrives in Dallas at 11 p.m. and takes a cab to the
hotel. They have demanded the use of chauffeured cars, and pretty
soon everyone in the company begins to see the value of protecting
all executives. Women executives are our best clients.''
</P>
<P>
   A third factor he cited was an out-of-control economy, saying
that the same prosperity that was soaking up the first-class and
business-class airline seats was causing car-service fleets to
expand on the double. Right now, with gasoline prices way down, the
companies are doing well and can expand. But, Solombrino said, he
was not sure that growth would stay at 28 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dav El is business-oriented, he said: Less than 5 percent of its
volume involves proms, weddings, nights on the town or gambling
expeditions. In any case, he said, not many cars are sitting in the
parking lot on Saturday and Sunday: Weekend corporate business has
tripled in five years because so many companies now hold meetings
over the weekend to take advantage of lower air fares.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, according to Limousine and Chauffeured
Transportation magazine, corporate business accounted for 24
percent of the operators' income last year, airport trips 22
percent and weddings 20 percent. In 1996, corporate business was at
19 percent, airport trips 23 percent and weddings 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate clients use black sedans, most often Lincoln Town
Cars, rather than the extra-long babies seen at Oscar night or prom
time. On Christmas Day, when three of us needed to get from Captiva
Island, Fla., to Fort Myers, and local taxis were not available,
employees at the marina recommended Royal Palm Luxury Car Service.
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable black Town Car driven by the small company's
president, Anthony Paolercio, who had a career at IBM and left New
York three years ago, scooped us up. He packed our luggage into the
big trunk, recommended a place to buy oranges to take home, and
three of us glided to our meeting spot for $75. We asked him to
recommend a service as smooth and reliable as his elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That was difficult, he said, and limo people agree, because if a
recommended company proves a lemon, this could alienate a longtime
customer from the original car service. So Royal Palm is part of
still another of the growing number of limo networks: Empire
International, in Norwood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It is headed by David Seelinger, who owns the part of the
company serving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and has
affiliates in 250 cities worldwide. It is growing so rapidly that
the telephone message that played spoke of 100 cities, which
Seelinger said was only a year out of date.
</P>
<P>
   The listings under Limousine Service cover most of nine pages in
the Manhattan Yellow Pages, and almost four more pages of listings,
some duplicates, appear under Car Service. It's pretty easy to tell
which companies have contracts with corporations and law firms
(clients use vouchers rather than cash) just by looking at the tags
in the limo windows outside big office buildings, especially late
at night on Wall Street. But the profusion of choices for the
individual consumer means that a network or a trade name is a big
help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That is how 1-800-Limo-Center got into the business in July,
Kosman said. After months of travel and checking into existing
services in other cities, he said he was trying to think how to
market directly to customers. He decided that 1-800-Flowers was the
model to follow, and eventually he got American Express to be his
``messenger'' and put his leaflets into customer mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Like the two other networks discussed here _ and there are
doubtless others _ Limo Center takes reservations and credit card
numbers and then bills the client for everything, including tip, so
no cash is needed at the time of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have varying prices and ways to respond to
foul-ups, particularly cars that do not show up, but networks'
basic response is to cancel the charge. Clients who do not find
their cars waiting call the 800 number, according to the operators,
and another car is dispatched if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the network system, in a city like New York, when law
firms and similar businesses have contracts with limo companies,
they may not be able to fulfill a request if the weather turns bad,
or it is a major holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The big networks use airline computer systems to find out if the
flights they are meeting will be severely delayed. These companies
have access to buses for large groups, and also have minibuses with
conference tables for business groups that want to work on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some details on the three networks.
</P>
<P>
   1-800-Limo-Center is the company's name, and the 24-hour number
translates to (800) 546-6236. The company started in July, and
headquarters are at 336 West Passaic Street, Rochelle Park, N.J.
07662. It operates in the top 150 airports in the country through
its links to 200 companies, 190 in the United States and the rest
in London, Paris, Rome and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are based on distance, which is determined by a computer
program showing ZIP codes. These rates are quoted on the phone; a
sheet of sample rates shows a trip from O'Hare Airport in Chicago
to a downtown address in the 60618 ZIP code starts at $44 for a
trip in a sedan, $74 in a 6-passenger limo and $94 in an 8- to
10-passenger limo. To Evanston, Ill., the rates are $40, $70 and
$90.
</P>
<P>
   To these rates, the company adds a 15 percent tip for a sedan
(20 percent for longer cars) and a 10 percent processing fee. For
domestic flights, the first 30 minutes of waiting time after the
posted arrival is free. There is a $15 charge for meeting
international flights, but no further charges for waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 15-minute grace period for non-airport pickups. The
additional charge for each 15 minutes of waiting time is $11 for
sedans and $15 for limos.
</P>
<P>
   If the car does not show up in 15 minutes, the customer must
call the 800 number; if no car then responds, this call avoids a
no-show charge, which is the cost of the trip, the tip and waiting
time. If the car never does show up, the cost of alternative
transportation is paid by the company. Cancellations not made two
hours or more in advance incur a charge of $44 for a sedan, $60 for
a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Dav El Chauffeured Transportation Network, 200 Second Street,
Chelsea, Mass. 02150, operates in 458 cities, 284 of them in the
United States. The toll-free number is (800) 922-0343. Reservations
may be made by phone, fax or Internet, and travel agents can reach
the company on Apollo or Sabre reservation systems. The company
approves customers' credit and opens an account.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and Canada, the company uses standard
indexed hourly prices, which Solombrino says represent a national
average. These are below the market rate in New York, he said,
although they may be above elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A sedan costs $49 an hour, plus 15 percent tip. An 80-inch
stretch Lincoln, holding seven people (six in two back seats, one
in the front passenger seat) costs $63 an hour, plus 20 percent
tip. An executive van for nine people with a table costs $63 plus a
15 percent tip. A regular passenger van for 15 people is $63 an
hour, plus 15 percent. Waiting time costs the same as driving time.
</P>
<P>
   Empire International, 55 Walnut Street, Norwood, N.J. 07648,
(800) 451-5466, operates in 250 cities through a licensing
arrangement. Outside the New York three-state area, it uses
regional prices based on a computer program that gives the
distance. In Chicago, for example, the trip from O'Hare to ZIP code
60618 would cost $80 in a sedan, plus a 15 percent tip. The same
trip by limo or van would be $115 plus 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller cities, the price is a minimum of $100, which is the
two-hour minimum at $50 an hour, plus 15 percent. The company will
establish individual accounts.

 &HT;    Genuine Parts growth lag an incentive for changes
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies, like cars, eventually need a tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Genuine Parts is getting, in hopes of reigniting
double-digit sales and earnings growth in its slow-growing but
highly profitable distribution businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, best known for its NAPA Auto Parts outlets, last
year embarked on a $600 million acquisition spree to boost market
share in its auto and industrial replacement parts businesses, and
in its office supply unit. It also added a business segment by
buying a distributor of electrical and electronic equipment with
annual sales of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Larry L. Prince, chairman and chief executive,
predicts sales and earnings growth will return to double-digit
levels, something the 71-year-old company hasn't seen since 1994.
Sales could increase as much as 20 percent this year, he said. But
profits probably won't return to double-digit levels until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More acquisitions could be on the way, financed either with
cash, stock or a combination. The company has strong cash flow and
a solid balance sheet with modest debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we could have a certain amount of market-share
gains in our current markets,'' said Prince, 60. ``But to really
get to double-digit sales growth, we really would have to make some
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   That epiphany came about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were poised to hit double-digit (sales) growth
in 1997, but as the year progressed, we saw that business was
slower and tougher,'' Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   That took a toll on the company's stock, which has lagged the
benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, of which it is a
member. Last year Genuine Parts' stock lost 1.47 percent of its
value. Over the past five years, it gained 33.3 percent. In
contrast, the S&AMP;P 500 appreciated 26.7 percent last year and 163.5
percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholder value certainly is one of our reasons for
recognizing the need to grow,'' said Prince, who has been chief
executive since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the performance of its shares, Genuine Parts has
compiled an enviable record: Sales are up 49 years in a row.
Profits are up 38 consecutive years. The company has consistently
met its target of at least a 20 percent return on beginning-of-the
year shareholders' equity.
</P>
<P>
   But sales growth of its biggest business _ distributing auto
replacement parts _ has slowed to 3 percent to 5 percent annually,
in part because of better-made vehicles. Profit margins have shrunk
from a peak 12 percent in 1989 to 10.6 percent in 1997, largely
because of increased competition, which has limited price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, management has been trying to jump-start that
segment, which this year is expected to account for just over half
of Genuine Parts' total revenue of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company took several steps. It changed its NAPA Auto Parts
stores to become more retail friendly. The refurbished stores, with
extended hours and increased inventory, saw profits increase 5
percent to 8 percent on sales growth of 10 percent to 15 percent,
according to Jerry Nix, senior vice president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers now account for 40 percent of the company's
auto parts sales, up from 30 percent five years ago. Professional
installers account for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a growing market, considering the complexity of
today's vehicles. To strengthen that business, the company started
a program that provides access to national advertising and business
support to a network of more than 8,600 independently owned repair
shops.
</P>
<P>
   To widen its distribution channels further, Genuine Parts this
month completed the acquisition of a company that last year sold
$120 million worth of parts to large fleets and new car dealers.
And it acquired its Canadian partner, which has annual sales of
$550 million.
</P>
<P>
   The managements of each business unit continue to hunt for
growth opportunities. For example, the office products group now
also distributes janitorial products.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the moves haven't helped Genuine Parts' stock price. It
finished Friday at $32.31 1/4, up 68 3/4 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be shown that we're going to bring earnings along
with this sales growth,'' Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   Once that occurs, he thinks investors will give the stock a
richer price-to-earnings multiple. It now trades at 14.9 times
estimated 1999 earnings of $2.16 a share, according to IBES
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be the multiple of some of the newer
developing companies,'' Prince said. ``But if it moved to a 20
times earnings range, I don't think that would be out of the
question, provided we produce the earnings.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the national radio ocean of wisecrack and punditry, canned
music, and network news, Delilah surfaces night after night with a
voice that is altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles to Long Island, from Jacksonville, Fla., to
Bangor, Maine, the new queen of nighttime radio cuts through the
loneliness of traffic jams and dinner dishes, playing requests and
sharing stories and feelings, everything but her last name, with
listeners. She has 1.2 million a week, her syndicators say, and she
invites them to share, too. By the thousands, they do.
</P>
<P>
   On and off the air, she is the friendly next-door neighbor with
time to talk over a virtual backyard fence. She is no Dr. Laura
Schlessinger. (Delilah will be the first to say she is not a
counselor, licensed or otherwise.) But she is more than a disk
jockey taking dedications. And although digital technology helps
her sound local, her studio is in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Her two-year-old show is carried by 176 stations five evenings a
week from 7 to midnight, with a recorded reprise on Sundays. (In
the New York region, she is heard on WHUD-FM, 100.7; WLVG-FM, 96.1,
and WEBE-FM, 107.9.) She does the show live from 5 to 10 p.m.
Pacific time, filling in the first hour in the East with the last
hour from the previous day. The last two hours in the West are
tapes of the first two hours that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show, via tape, Delilah will give the local
station's call letters in her silken, best-friend voice. If the
station sends her the material, she may also tape comments on local
events, big and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``People guess it's not local because they hear the Southern
callers,'' concedes Jill Dedrick, who screens the calls. (Some
100,000 times a night, people try to get through.) Ms. Dedrick, 23,
talks to 150 callers each night and passes along the 25 who get on
the air. Most of them want to talk about love, good or bad, found
or lost, double dealt or sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Delilah tapes and edits their conversations, finds their
requests and puts them on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman called last night,'' Delilah said in a recent
telephone interview from home. ``She was a single parent. She had a
little boy, and she had been dating this guy. She loved him. Her
son loved him. But he told her he was moving out of state, and he
was not looking for a committed relationship. She asked me, `How do
I make him stay?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her: `You don't. He told you up front how he felt.' She
said, `But I love him.' I said: `He's made it clear he has a
different agenda. You've got to find someone with the same agenda.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If you play this song, will it change him?' and I
told her: `No, ma'am. This song will not change someone's mind.'
She said, `Will you tell him how much my son loves him?' And I
said: `No, it will only hurt your son. It will make him feel
abandoned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Delilah, 38, has heard most of it before. She grew up in
Reedsport, Ore., she said, in a family of four children with an
alcoholic father and ``a classic, raging co-dependent'' mother.
``They had an abusive marriage, with a lot of physical violence,''
she recalled. She graduated from high school with honors, but left
home the night of her graduation party, after her parents locked
her out.
</P>
<P>
   At 21 ``I fell in love'' and married a black man, said Delilah,
who is white. They later had a son, and her mother invited the
couple to come home for Christmas. But when they stepped onto the
front porch, ``my father freaked out and jumped up and ran to the
gun closet,'' she said. ``He chased me off with a shotgun.'' He did
not apologize, she said, until a few days before he died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high school, Delilah won a speech contest, reciting
the Gettysburg address. After the contest, the judges, who owned a
radio station, ``approached my folks and me and said, `Wow, she
likes to talk a lot.''' They offered her a chance to report school
news and sports several days a week. In high school, during a
work-study program, she learned to write copy, produce commercials
and read newscasts, and she worked in the station every weekend. In
college, she did traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left home thinking I would escape the insanity,'' she said.
``Little did I know I would become the insanity. When you're raised
where deceit is the norm, you don't grow up normal. You develop
survival skills that numb the pain, but eventually end up killing
you.'' She had developed an eating disorder. ``Then I repeated my
parents' marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   When her son was 10 months old, Delilah's brother, who was to be
the child's godfather, and his wife were killed on the way to the
christening, their small plane crashing in the mountains. ``A
couple of months after that,'' she said, ``my son's father moved in
with his girlfriend, and my life fell apart. I lost my job at the
radio station, which changed format.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``It was the best thing that happened to me,
having my heart broken, because I said, `I don't have all the
answers.' I started searching for the answer. I became a Christian.
I found Al-Anon. Since then I haven't done anything addicting. God
saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked at an oldies station in Seattle until her son was 5,
then went to work for stations in Boston, Philadelphia and
Rochester, N.Y. She married again, had a baby and nursed her mother
through the final stages of brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She started her current show in Rochester in February 1996.
Broadcast Programming began syndicating it at the end of that year.
She moved back to Seattle, and by January 1997 had 12 stations. The
target was the 25- to 54-year-old women who listen to adult
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delilah broke all the rules,'' said Jim LaMarca, senior vice
president for sales at Broadcast Programming, a radio consulting
company, and director of its broadcast division, which also
produces ``Neon Nights,'' a country music show.
</P>
<P>
   Initially station managers, who tend to be men, resisted her,
LaMarca said. ``They told me: `I spend all day making the program
consistent, run the same 200 songs. Now she's going to talk two to
three minutes at a time and then play a song I don't know? I can't
do that.''' But many did. At the end of her first year, Delilah had
70 stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting hundreds of calls a night,'' recalled Peter
Oleshchuk, program director of WHMS-FM, a light-rock station in
Champaign, Ill. ``And when we're out and about in town, people will
say, `Which one of you is Delilah?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   She explains her national appeal this way: ``People are people.
Even though you can fax someone across the world, and they can
e-mail you, it seems communication is less and less effective. I
try to encourage people to form relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent, love your children. If you're married,
honor your spouse instead of looking on the Internet for love in
all the wrong places. I'm talking about real relationships, not
false intimacies. To show love for people, that's what the whole
show is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Delilah, now pregnant with her third child, also has an adopted
son and is seeking custody of the boy's sister and brother. ``I
went from being the single parent of one to a married mom of four,
soon to be six, in five years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delilah ``keeps no secrets,'' Ms. Dedrick said. ``She uses every
aspect of her life to sympathize with people, and she has
incredible power of empathy. She seems able to dig into their
brains and tell them what they need to hear, not necessarily what
they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name, Delilah said, is the real thing. ``My older brother
was named Matthew Mark Luke. My parents decided to counterbalance
good and bad, so they named me Delilah. For a while, I lived down
to my name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask me, `Why did you pick that for a stage name?'
I say, `I didn't.'''

NEW THEORIES OF DEPRESSION FOCUS ON BRAIN'S TWO SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new theories of depression are rekindling interest in the
once fashionable topic of how the left and right sides of the human
brain interact.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience last November in
Los Angeles, Dr. Jack Pettigrew, a neuroscientist at the University
of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, proposed that people with
manic depression have a ``sticky switch'' somewhere deep in their
brains.
</P>
<P>
   In normal people, the switch allows either the left or right
hemisphere to be dominant during different mental tasks, with the
two sides constantly taking turns. In people with manic depression,
one hemisphere becomes locked into a dominant position in periods
of depression while the other hemisphere is locked at times of
mania. In a truly bizarre finding, Pettigrew reported that the
placement of ice water into one ear seems to unstick the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The second theory is being put forth by Dr. Frederic Schiffer, a
psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. He maintains that one
hemisphere can be more immature than the other and that this
imbalance leads to different mental disorders. Schiffer has
designed special goggles to help people ``talk'' to each half of
the brain separately, to learn which is less mature, and to bring
the two hemispheres into harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas have been well received by brain lateralization
authorities eager to see a revival of their specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see the left and right hemispheres are back,''
said Dr. Brenda Milner, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Montreal
Neurological Institute in Quebec. Dr. Brenda Milner, a cognitive
neuroscientist at the Montreal Neurological Institute in Quebec.
The notion that the human brain has two halves and that the left
side is associated with logical, analytical thinking while the
right side is more intuitive, emotional and creative was
popularized about 20 years ago, she said, and soon became received
wisdom about how the brain works. ``This idea fell from fashion not
because people didn't like it but because they got interested in
other things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, a cognitive scientist at the New School
for Social Research in New York City and early pioneer in brain
lateralization studies, believes that left and right brain ideas
also fell from fashion because they were oversold. People looked
for universal dichotomies _ the left brain is a whiz at legal
briefs but the right brain is deft at poetry _ that carried things
too far. But the new theories are ``intriguing,'' Kinsbourne said,
although they have a long way to go before they can be accepted as
valid. ``We are in half-baked land here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new theories are also appealing to many experts because they
take on a question that has divided researchers for decades. Do
people have one overarching mind that spans the two hemispheres? Or
are they born with two separate minds _ one on the left and one on
the right _ which operate so seamlessly that the person simply does
not notice that there are two?
</P>
<P>
   The subjective sense of having just one mind is overwhelming and
unmistakable, said Dr. Joseph Bogen, a neurosurgeon at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But if the thick
band of fibers connecting the two hemispheres is severed, he
explained, humans seem to end up with two separate minds that show
different abilities. In one dramatic disparity, the left hemisphere
does all the talking while the mute right hemisphere has better
access to emotions. For example, when the right brain is shown a
photograph, the talkative left brain will say that it does not see
anything and cannot comment. But the left hand, which is connected
to the right brain, can raise a thumb up or down in response to the
question, ``Do you like the picture?''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of experiments led to a dichotomy of opinion among
neuroscientists, Dr. Bogen said. One camp held that in splitting
the brain, a single mind is cut into two but that it is abnormal to
have two brains. The other camp said every person is born with two
brains but because the two sides get along so well, people simply
have the illusion of one mind.
</P>
<P>
   After thousands of experiments carried out on normal subjects
and split-brain patients, scientists still passionately disagree.
But one feature has clearly emerged, said Dr. Terry Sejnowski, a
neuroscientist at the Salk Institute in San Diego: Human brains
show enormous variation in lateralization.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that certain talents or abilities lie in one
hemisphere or the other is usually based on averaging the brains of
many people, he said. Because each individual brain is a complex
system that evolves in response to a unique environment, many brain
functions do not end up in the same place. This is further
complicated by the fact that the left and right hemisphere probably
communicate through deeper pathways that are not affected in
split-brain patients.
</P>

   The new ideas about lateralization will not resolve the question
of one versus two brains, but they do add insights and suggest new
ways to treat mental patients, said Schiffer, whose research was
set off by his observation that many of his patients seemed to have
a kind of double personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, they are very mature and stable, but on the
other hand, they can be irrational, overly emotional and
compulsive,'' he said. ``Often these two sides appear to struggle
against or sabotage each other. The troubled part seems stuck in a
traumatic past, whereas the other part seems more mature and in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting he was seeing two minds working at cross purposes,
Dr. Schiffer designed a pair of goggles that forced his patients to
view the world from either the left or right hemisphere separately.
</P>
<P>
   Many experiments show that it is possible to stimulate one
hemisphere and inhibit the other so that a person looks at the
world using half a brain at a time, Schiffer explained. When people
gaze to the far right and engage their left brains, they do better
on verbal memory tasks, he said, and when they look far to the
left, to engage the right brain, they feel more inertia and
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   To test how this affects psychiatric patients, Schiffer made two
types of goggles. One permits vision only in the right visual
field, thus activating the left brain. The other allows a person to
see objects in the left visual field, which activates the right
brain. Each brain hemisphere controls the opposite side of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   When patients looked through goggles, they reported very
definite feelings, depending on which side of the brain was being
engaged, Schiffer said. Some felt negative symptoms like anxiety
and sadness when the right brain was activated. Others felt bad
when the left brain was engaged. In general, he said, depressed
patients felt worse when the right side was stimulated and people
with post-traumatic stress syndrome fared poorly when the left side
was more active.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffer speculates that in certain mental disorders, one
hemisphere is less mature than the other. The immature side is the
repository of past traumas and can come to dominate the healthy
side. Thus each hemisphere has mental properties with some autonomy
from the other side. Each can hold separate opinions, have a
different sense of human and carry a different perspective on the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Many people feel no mood difference when wearing the goggles,
Schiffer said. This may be because both their hemispheres have
similar outlooks, being equally calm or equally troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffer uses the goggles in therapy sessions to help patients
recognize their two minds and to help the mature side take control
over the immature side. Patients wearing goggles can actually
converse with the opposite hemisphere, he said, and through talk
therapy work toward recovery. The goggles do not support the idea
that the right brain is poetic and the left is logical, Schiffer
said. People are very different. Each hemisphere is
individualistic; either one can be messed up or both sides can be
in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew, who invented the sticky-switch idea of depression,
also falls into the two minds camp, He theorizes that patients
cycle between bouts of mania and depression for days, weeks or
months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the hemispheres have different cognitive styles, I
thought it doesn't make sense to have them both working at the same
time,'' Pettigrew said in an interview at the neuroscience meeting.
``So I thought there should be a switch. This would allow each side
to take turns dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew said there was plenty of evidence that different parts
of each hemisphere cycle back and forth, left and right, during
everyday tasks. Parts of the visual cortex switch dominance every
few seconds, he said, whereas parts of the frontal lobes cycle
every couple hours.
</P>
<P>
   To measure how fast the two sides switch dominance in a visual
task, Pettigrew used a standard apparatus that measures so-called
binocular rivalry. When a target of horizontal lines is shown to
the right eye and vertical lines are shown to the left eye, and the
targets are flashed, the brain does not fuse the lines into a
hatched pattern. One side of the brain sees vertical, the other
side sees horizontal and the two take turns seeing a pure target.
Most people switch sides every two to three seconds, Pettigrew
said. But patients with manic depression require 20 to 30 seconds
to switch between the two targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a sticky switch between the hemispheres,''
he said. If the switch is stuck, it may be possible to unstick it,
Pettigrew said, by turning to a strange observation made several
years ago by Italian scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tilt a person's head 30 degrees to the side and put ice
water into one ear, the opposite brain hemisphere will become
activated,'' he said. Thus cold water in the left ear, activating
the right hemisphere, might temporarily reduce the symptoms of
mania. Depression might be temporarily reduced by placing cold
water in the right ear.
</P>
<P>
   Ice water in the ear is a traditional neurological test that has
been performed, among other things, on astronauts in space to help
understand space sickness. How ice water stimulates one hemisphere
is not precisely known, but it seems to activate orientation
pathways in one ear (which tell people where they are in space),
and these pathways are connected to mid- and higher-brain regions
in the opposite side of the head, Pettigrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying the ice water in his own left ear, Pettigrew, who suffers
from manic depression, said, ``I sat on my couch at home for 40
hours, ruminating about my life.'' His left brain was stuck in the
depression phase. It was, he said, an unpleasant experience.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, about 200 men and women converged on
St. Luke's Church on Hudson Street for the annual Christmas carol
walk. We divided into groups, each heading into the West Village,
song sheets in hand containing all the old-time carols as well as
more newfangled fare like ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   We shrugged off our shyness as we started singing and were soon
spreading Christmas cheer. We sang for diners in an Italian
restaurant and were rewarded with a bottle of wine. We serenaded a
big town house, at which point a couple of pedestrians joined us.
Finally we sang our way down Christopher Street. At a fitness gym,
our serenade fell flat; the members were more in the mood for bench
presses than for us. Somewhat dejected, we continued.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, three stories up one building, a window flew open and
a young woman stuck her head out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sing a carol,'' she said. ``I just moved here and my
parents in Illinois are worried about New York.'' We launched into
``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen'' and looked up to see her holding a
phone receiver out the window. We sang even louder, hoping our
voices would carry up three flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' the woman shouted as we finished. ``My parents
are feeling much better. Merry Christmas.''

   It was early morning on the 96th Street crosstown bus, so packed
that even standing room was at a premium. A group of sleepy-eyed
prep school students were spread out across the back four or five
seats, schoolbooks spread across their laps, hard at their
homework. This 50-plus-year-old teacher was feeling weaker by the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning toward the nearest teen-ager, I quietly asked if I could
have her seat, explaining that I was feeling a bit weak. She looked
up and told me her teacher would kill her if she didn't turn in
this assignment on time. I leaned down again and with a smile, told
her that I, too, was a teacher, wasn't feeling well and might kill
her first if she didn't have the decency to let me sit for a
minute. She cocked her head. ``Whatever,'' she said, and went back
to her homework.

   On a recent mall trip, Michael Sorum Rockefeller came across a

scrawled ``10-1 they don't answer.''

   Margo Arceri was on a crowded car on the Long Island Rail Road
where half the passengers were standing.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman entered the train, standing behind her. A man
in front of her, also standing, suggested that a nearby male
passenger give up his seat for the elderly woman. The man brushed
off the suggestion, at which point Ms. Arceri arose and insisted
that the older woman take her seat. Then she and the man who had
made the original suggestion began discussing their astonishment at
the male passenger's refusal to give up his seat.
</P>
<P>
   At Huntington, their exchange ended as the fellow standee
prepared to get off. ``That was very kind, what you did,'' he said
and slipped something into her pocket. ``Have a drink on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The train emptied nicely. Ms. Arceri found a seat, reached in
her pocket and found a $100 bill.

   My friend Linda's mother, Sis, died after relocating to Naples.
Fla., but before her move her friends had been full of advice about
security measures for women living alone. ``Now Sis,'' one of them
advised, ``be sure to have a can of Mace in the car for your
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Sis was never a carjacking victim. But Linda had to
smile when she looked in the glove compartment not long after her
mother's funeral. There, at the ready, was the small red and white
can that McCormick spices come in _ she had followed the advice
given her. It was, indeed, a can of mace.

   Susan Smpadian was at the bus stop when she overheard this

<P>
   First woman: ``Well that brings you up to date on my nothingless

<P>
   ``If you're that sensitive, you shouldn't be shopping at

<P>
   During a busy shopping time, I visited my favorite food store.
It was extremely crowded. A woman entered and addressed one of the
apron-clad workers behind the counter ``Do I have to take a

``We are on the honor system in this store.'' ``Good,'' the woman
yelled. ``I'm next.''

</P>
<P>
   `That rotten husband of mine wanted me to sleep with the
landlord because he lost the rent money playing poker,` the
housewife told a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't do it, did you?`
</P>
<P>
   `I have to admit I did, though with certain misgivings, I might
add. What I haven't done, though, is tell my husband the rent is
paid up for six months!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The housewife could see that the TV repairman couldn't keep his
eyes off of her. Every time she came in the room, he'd near about
jerk his neck right out of joint looking at her.
</P>
<P>
   When he'd finished she paid him and said, `I'm going to make a
...well...unusual request. But you have to first promise me you'll
keep it a secret.`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman quickly agreed and she went on. `Well, it's kind
of embarrassing to talk about, but while my husband is a kind,
decent man - sigh - he has a certain physical weakness. A certain
disability. Now, I'm a woman and you're a man...`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman could hardly speak, `Yes yes!`
</P>
<P>
   `And since I've been wanting to ever since you came in the
door...`

gave him a broom and said, `Your first job will be to sweep out the

</P>
<P>
   `But I'm a college graduate,` the young man replied indignantly.
</P>

   Two storks are sitting in their nest - a father stork and baby

calm him. `Don't worry, son. Your mother will come back. She's only
bringing people babies and making them happy.`
</P>
<P>
   The next night, it's father's turn to do the job. Mother and son
are sitting in the nest, the baby stork is crying, and mother is
saying `Son, your father will be back as soon as possible, but now
he's bringing joy to new mommies and daddies.`
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the stork's parents are desperate - their son
is absent from the nest all night! Shortly before dawn, he returns
and the parents ask him where he's been all night.

   &UR; RAISING THE BAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man walked into a bar and ordered a glass of white wine. He
took a sip of the wine, then tossed the remainder into the
bartender's face. Before the bartender could recover from the
surprise, the man began weeping. `I'm sorry,` he said. `I'm really
sorry. I keep doing that to bartenders. I can't tell you how
embarrassing it is to have a compulsion like this.`
</P>
<P>
   Far from being angry, the bartender was sympathetic. Before
long, he was suggesting that the man see an analyst about his
problem. `I happen to have the name of a psychoanalyst,` the
bartender said. `My brother and my wife have both been treated by
him, and they say he's as good as they come.`
</P>
<P>
   The man wrote down the name of the doctor, thanked the
bartender, and left. The bartender smiled, knowing he'd done a good
deed for a fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the man was back. `Did you do what I
suggested?` the bartender asked, serving the glass of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   `I certainly did,` the man said. `I've been seeing the
psychoanalyst twice a week.` He took a sip of the wine. Then he
threw the remainder into the bartender's face.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered bartender wiped his face with a towel. `The doctor
doesn't seem to be doing you any good,` he sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   `On the contrary,` the man said, `he's done me world of good.`
</P>
<P>
   `But you threw the wine in my face again!` the bartender
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes,` the man said. `But it doesn't embarrass me anymore.`

One finally ran up, panting heavily.
</P>

   `Sorry, sir! I can explain, you see I had a date and it ran a
little late. I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it
broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran
10 miles, and now I'm here.`
</P>
<P>
   The General was very skeptical about this explanation but at
least he was here so he let the G.I. go. Moments later, eight more
G.I.s came up to the general panting, he asked them why they were
late.

   `Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the

   The General eyed them, feeling very skeptical but since he let
the first guy go, he let them go, too. A ninth G.I. jogged up to
the General, panting heavily,

   `Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the

 UNDATED: excuse everything.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Smpadian was at the bus stop when she overheard this
recent exchange between two women:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``Well that brings you up to date on my nothingless
state of mind and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Gosh, I thought nothing could be more
nothingless than my life, but I guess I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Zabar's was even more crowded than usual when an elderly woman
rushed by Steven Gerber and banged into him with her bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' he said. ``You really should apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're that sensitive, you shouldn't be shopping at
Zabar's,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   During a busy shopping time, I visited my favorite food store.
It was extremely crowded. A woman entered and addressed one of the
apron-clad workers behind the counter ``Do I have to take a
number?'' she asked. ``I don't see any.'' ``No,'' a clerk replied.
``We are on the honor system in this store.'' ``Good,'' the woman
yelled. ``I'm next.''

   &UR; MARRIAGE VOWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `That rotten husband of mine wanted me to sleep with the
landlord because he lost the rent money playing poker,` the
housewife told a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't do it, did you?`
</P>
<P>
   `I have to admit I did, though with certain misgivings, I might
add. What I haven't done, though, is tell my husband the rent is
paid up for six months!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The housewife could see that the TV repairman couldn't keep his
eyes off of her. Every time she came in the room, he'd near about
jerk his neck right out of joint looking at her.
</P>
<P>
   When he'd finished she paid him and said, `I'm going to make a
...well...unusual request. But you have to first promise me you'll
keep it a secret.`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman quickly agreed and she went on. `Well, it's kind
of embarrassing to talk about, but while my husband is a kind,
decent man - sigh - he has a certain physical weakness. A certain
disability. Now, I'm a woman and you're a man...`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman could hardly speak, `Yes yes!`
</P>
<P>
   `And since I've been wanting to ever since you came in the
door...`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes yes!`
</P>
<P>
   `Would you help me move the refrigerator?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLLEGE GRAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A young man hired by a supermarket reported for his first day of
work. The manager greeted him with a warm handshake and a smile,
gave him a broom and said, `Your first job will be to sweep out the
store.`
</P>
<P>
   `But I'm a college graduate,` the young man replied indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that,` said the manager. `Here,
give me the broom - I'll show you how.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OXFORD BLUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two storks are sitting in their nest - a father stork and baby
stork. The baby stork is crying so the father stork is trying to
calm him. `Don't worry, son. Your mother will come back. She's only
bringing people babies and making them happy.`
</P>
<P>
   The next night, it's father's turn to do the job. Mother and son
are sitting in the nest, the baby stork is crying, and mother is
saying `Son, your father will be back as soon as possible, but now
he's bringing joy to new mommies and daddies.`
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the stork's parents are desperate - their son
is absent from the nest all night! Shortly before dawn, he returns
and the parents ask him where he's been all night.
</P>
<P>
   The baby stork says, `Nowhere. Just scaring the crap out of
college students!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RAISING THE BAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man walked into a bar and ordered a glass of white wine. He
took a sip of the wine, then tossed the remainder into the
bartender's face. Before the bartender could recover from the
surprise, the man began weeping. `I'm sorry,` he said. `I'm really
sorry. I keep doing that to bartenders. I can't tell you how
embarrassing it is to have a compulsion like this.`
</P>
<P>
   Far from being angry, the bartender was sympathetic. Before
long, he was suggesting that the man see an analyst about his
problem. `I happen to have the name of a psychoanalyst,` the
bartender said. `My brother and my wife have both been treated by
him, and they say he's as good as they come.`
</P>
<P>
   The man wrote down the name of the doctor, thanked the
bartender, and left. The bartender smiled, knowing he'd done a good
deed for a fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the man was back. `Did you do what I
suggested?` the bartender asked, serving the glass of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   `I certainly did,` the man said. `I've been seeing the
psychoanalyst twice a week.` He took a sip of the wine. Then he
threw the remainder into the bartender's face.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered bartender wiped his face with a towel. `The doctor
doesn't seem to be doing you any good,` he sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   `On the contrary,` the man said, `he's done me world of good.`
</P>
<P>
   `But you threw the wine in my face again!` the bartender
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes,` the man said. `But it doesn't embarrass me anymore.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GI JOE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The General went out to find that none of his G.I.s were there.
One finally ran up, panting heavily.
</P>
<P>
   `Sorry, sir! I can explain, you see I had a date and it ran a
little late. I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it
broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran
10 miles, and now I'm here.`
</P>
<P>
   The General was very skeptical about this explanation but at
least he was here so he let the G.I. go. Moments later, eight more
G.I.s came up to the general panting, he asked them why they were
late.
</P>
<P>
   `Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the
bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it broke down, found a farm,
bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran 10 miles, and now I'm
here.`
</P>
<P>
   The General eyed them, feeling very skeptical but since he let
the first guy go, he let them go, too. A ninth G.I. jogged up to
the General, panting heavily,
</P>
<P>
   `Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the
bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but...`
</P>
<P>
   `Let me guess,` the General interrupted, `it broke down.`
</P>
<P>
   `No,` said the G.I., `there were so many dead horses in the
road, it took forever to get around them.`

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A genius in marketing? That would be someone who could make
money selling videotapes of the Senate trial of Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TIMES THEY AIN'T A CHANGIN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A quote attributed to one of America's founders, John Adams, in
the play 1776: `I have come to the conclusion that one useless man
is called a disgrace, two men are called a law firm, and three or
more become a Congress.'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, about 200 men and women converged on
St. Luke's Church on Hudson Street for the annual Christmas carol
walk. We divided into groups, each heading into the West Village,
song sheets in hand containing all the old-time carols as well as
more newfangled fare like ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   We shrugged off our shyness as we started singing and were soon
spreading Christmas cheer. We sang for diners in an Italian
restaurant and were rewarded with a bottle of wine. We serenaded a
big town house, at which point a couple of pedestrians joined us.
Finally we sang our way down Christopher Street. At a fitness gym,
our serenade fell flat; the members were more in the mood for bench
presses than for us. Somewhat dejected, we continued.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, three stories up one building, a window flew open and
a young woman stuck her head out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sing a carol,'' she said. ``I just moved here and my
parents in Illinois are worried about New York.'' We launched into
``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen'' and looked up to see her holding a
phone receiver out the window. We sang even louder, hoping our
voices would carry up three flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' the woman shouted as we finished. ``My parents
are feeling much better. Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   _STEPHEN M. MORRISON
</P>
<P>
   It was early morning on the 96th Street crosstown bus, so packed
that even standing room was at a premium. A group of sleepy-eyed
prep school students were spread out across the back four or five
seats, schoolbooks spread across their laps, hard at their
homework. This 50-plus-year-old teacher was feeling weaker by the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning toward the nearest teen-ager, I quietly asked if I could
have her seat, explaining that I was feeling a bit weak. She looked
up and told me her teacher would kill her if she didn't turn in
this assignment on time. I leaned down again and with a smile, told
her that I, too, was a teacher, wasn't feeling well and might kill
her first if she didn't have the decency to let me sit for a
minute. She cocked her head. ``Whatever,'' she said, and went back
to her homework.
</P>
<P>
   _JUDITH NICHTERN
</P>
<P>
   On a recent mall trip, Michael Sorum Rockefeller came across a
men's room towel dispenser with a sticker: ``Gambling Anonymous.
Call 1-800'' followed by the numbers. Beneath it, someone had
scrawled ``10-1 they don't answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Arceri was on a crowded car on the Long Island Rail Road
where half the passengers were standing.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman entered the train, standing behind her. A man
in front of her, also standing, suggested that a nearby male
passenger give up his seat for the elderly woman. The man brushed
off the suggestion, at which point Ms. Arceri arose and insisted
that the older woman take her seat. Then she and the man who had
made the original suggestion began discussing their astonishment at
the male passenger's refusal to give up his seat.
</P>
<P>
   At Huntington, their exchange ended as the fellow standee
prepared to get off. ``That was very kind, what you did,'' he said
and slipped something into her pocket. ``Have a drink on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The train emptied nicely. Ms. Arceri found a seat, reached in
her pocket and found a $100 bill.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Linda's mother, Sis, died after relocating to Naples.
Fla., but before her move her friends had been full of advice about
security measures for women living alone. ``Now Sis,'' one of them
advised, ``be sure to have a can of Mace in the car for your
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Sis was never a carjacking victim. But Linda had to
smile when she looked in the glove compartment not long after her
mother's funeral. There, at the ready, was the small red and white
can that McCormick spices come in _ she had followed the advice
given her. It was, indeed, a can of mace.

   A quote attributed to one of America's founders, John Adams, in
the play 1776: `I have come to the conclusion that one useless man
is called a disgrace, two men are called a law firm, and three or
more become a Congress.'

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, about 200 men and women converged on
St. Luke's Church on Hudson Street for the annual Christmas carol
walk. We divided into groups, each heading into the West Village,
song sheets in hand containing all the old-time carols as well as
more newfangled fare like ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   We shrugged off our shyness as we started singing and were soon
spreading Christmas cheer. We sang for diners in an Italian
restaurant and were rewarded with a bottle of wine. We serenaded a
big town house, at which point a couple of pedestrians joined us.
Finally we sang our way down Christopher Street. At a fitness gym,
our serenade fell flat; the members were more in the mood for bench
presses than for us. Somewhat dejected, we continued.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, three stories up one building, a window flew open and
a young woman stuck her head out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sing a carol,'' she said. ``I just moved here and my
parents in Illinois are worried about New York.'' We launched into
``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen'' and looked up to see her holding a
phone receiver out the window. We sang even louder, hoping our
voices would carry up three flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' the woman shouted as we finished. ``My parents
are feeling much better. Merry Christmas.''

   It was early morning on the 96th Street crosstown bus, so packed
that even standing room was at a premium. A group of sleepy-eyed
prep school students were spread out across the back four or five
seats, schoolbooks spread across their laps, hard at their
homework. This 50-plus-year-old teacher was feeling weaker by the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning toward the nearest teen-ager, I quietly asked if I could
have her seat, explaining that I was feeling a bit weak. She looked
up and told me her teacher would kill her if she didn't turn in
this assignment on time. I leaned down again and with a smile, told
her that I, too, was a teacher, wasn't feeling well and might kill
her first if she didn't have the decency to let me sit for a
minute. She cocked her head. ``Whatever,'' she said, and went back
to her homework.

   An elderly woman entered the train, standing behind her. A man
in front of her, also standing, suggested that a nearby male
passenger give up his seat for the elderly woman. The man brushed
off the suggestion, at which point Ms. Arceri arose and insisted
that the older woman take her seat. Then she and the man who had
made the original suggestion began discussing their astonishment at
the male passenger's refusal to give up his seat.

   At Huntington, their exchange ended as the fellow standee
prepared to get off. ``That was very kind, what you did,'' he said
and slipped something into her pocket. ``Have a drink on me.''

   My friend Linda's mother, Sis, died after relocating to Naples.
Fla., but before her move her friends had been full of advice about
security measures for women living alone. ``Now Sis,'' one of them
advised, ``be sure to have a can of Mace in the car for your
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Sis was never a carjacking victim. But Linda had to
smile when she looked in the glove compartment not long after her
mother's funeral. There, at the ready, was the small red and white

given her. It was, indeed, a can of mace.

   `That rotten husband of mine wanted me to sleep with the

housewife told a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't do it, did you?`
</P>
<P>
   `I have to admit I did, though with certain misgivings, I might
add. What I haven't done, though, is tell my husband the rent is
paid up for six months!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;

   The housewife could see that the TV repairman couldn't keep his
eyes off of her. Every time she came in the room, he'd near about
jerk his neck right out of joint looking at her.
</P>
<P>
   When he'd finished she paid him and said, `I'm going to make a
...well...unusual request. But you have to first promise me you'll
keep it a secret.`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman quickly agreed and she went on. `Well, it's kind
of embarrassing to talk about, but while my husband is a kind,
decent man - sigh - he has a certain physical weakness. A certain
disability. Now, I'm a woman and you're a man...`
</P>
<P>
   The repairman could hardly speak, `Yes yes!`

bringing people babies and making them happy.`
</P>
<P>
   The next night, it's father's turn to do the job. Mother and son

<P>
   A man walked into a bar and ordered a glass of white wine. He
took a sip of the wine, then tossed the remainder into the
bartender's face. Before the bartender could recover from the
surprise, the man began weeping. `I'm sorry,` he said. `I'm really
sorry. I keep doing that to bartenders. I can't tell you how
embarrassing it is to have a compulsion like this.`
</P>
<P>
   Far from being angry, the bartender was sympathetic. Before
long, he was suggesting that the man see an analyst about his
problem. `I happen to have the name of a psychoanalyst,` the
bartender said. `My brother and my wife have both been treated by
him, and they say he's as good as they come.`
</P>
<P>
   The man wrote down the name of the doctor, thanked the
bartender, and left. The bartender smiled, knowing he'd done a good
deed for a fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the man was back. `Did you do what I
suggested?` the bartender asked, serving the glass of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   `I certainly did,` the man said. `I've been seeing the
psychoanalyst twice a week.` He took a sip of the wine. Then he
threw the remainder into the bartender's face.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered bartender wiped his face with a towel. `The doctor
doesn't seem to be doing you any good,` he sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   `On the contrary,` the man said, `he's done me world of good.`
</P>
<P>
   `But you threw the wine in my face again!` the bartender
exclaimed.

<P>
   `Yes,` the man said. `But it doesn't embarrass me anymore.`

little late. I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it
broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran
10 miles, and now I'm here.`
</P>
<P>
   The General was very skeptical about this explanation but at
least he was here so he let the G.I. go. Moments later, eight more
G.I.s came up to the general panting, he asked them why they were
late.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. _ In a bold but potentially frightening effort
to turn one of the world's most virulent killers into a cure,
scientists and biotechnology companies are trying to tame the AIDS
virus and harness it to treat disease.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say they have stripped the human immunodeficiency
virus of its ability to cause disease, while leaving intact its
ability to infect human cells. Such a crippled virus, they say,
could be used to deliver genes into human cells for gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Several university scientists and biotechnology companies hope
to begin clinical trials using the modified HIV viruses to carry
genes that they hope can be used to treat diseases such as cancer
and hemophilia. At least one attempt will even be made to use the
modified HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to treat AIDS itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ironic to cure AIDS with the AIDS virus,'' said
Dr. Inder M. Verma, a professor at The Salk Institute for
Biological Studies here, who has pioneered the effort to harness
HIV for gene therapy. But he added, ``There is a saying that
diamond cuts diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   Verma and others involved in such research say it is virtually
inconceivable that anyone treated using the crippled HIV could get
AIDS as a result. The gene carrier, which is known as a vector, not
only is missing the HIV genes that cause disease but also lacks the
ability to replicate and spread in the body, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts note that in rare instances, disabled viruses
can recombine with genetic material from other viruses or from the
person's own cells to regain the ability to replicate. And even if
the actual risks are low, patients are likely to be afraid, and
regulators cautious, about injecting patients with even a modified
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a human pathogen that's caused a terrible pandemic, so
one needs to be thoughtful about using it, even in a crippled
form,'' said Dr. Eric Poeschla, an assistant professor of medicine
at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, whose approval is required for
gene therapy trials, agreed. ``There are a number of scientific
questions and safety issues to be addressed before any of that
could go forward,'' Dr. Philip Noguchi, the director of the
agency's division of cellular and gene therapies, said in an
interview. ``We don't quite know what we should be concerned about
because the biological understanding has not been developed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health held a meeting of experts last
March to explore the use of HIV vectors for gene therapy, which
involves inserting genes for a particular function into a patient's
cells. But Noguchi said a wider, more open public hearing would be
held before his agency would consider approving the first such
trial. ``The public hasn't really weighed in with its own
opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the very infectiousness of HIV that makes it attractive
for gene therapy, which so far has not lived up to its
expectations. People with hemophilia, for instance, have an
inherited genetic defect that prevents them from making a crucial
protein needed for blood clotting. But if enough of the patient's
cells could be provided with the proper gene, the patient could
manufacture his own blood clotting factor.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver the genes of interest, scientists generally insert
them into debilitated viruses, because viruses spread by delivering
their own genetic material into the cells of their target. But gene
therapy, which has been tried for about a decade, has in general
failed because it has been impossible to deliver enough of the
genes, and get them to work long enough, to make enough of the
required protein.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the viral gene carriers are attacked and destroyed
by the body's immune system. Some of the viruses used so far allow
for only transient production of the protein because they do not
incorporate the genes they carry into the chromosomes of the target
cells.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most commonly used vectors, derived from mouse
leukemia virus, can deliver genes into chromosomes, where, it is
hoped, they will operate for a long time. But this vector can do
this only when cells are dividing, making it difficult to treat
diseases in the brain, liver, heart and other organs in which cells
divide rarely if at all. And a promising new vector, based on
adeno-associated viruses, appears safe and somewhat effective, but
is limited in the size of the genes it can carry. HIV, on the other
hand, is both cunning at evading the body's immune defenses and can
carry large genes. Most important, it is one of a small class of
viruses, known as lentiviruses, that can incorporate genes into the
chromosomes even of nondividing cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lentiviral vectors are really a new hope in the field of gene
therapy,'' said Dr. Philippe LeBoulch, assistant professor of
medicine at Harvard University and chief scientific officer of
Genetix Pharmaceuticals Inc., a privately held Massachusetts
company planning to use HIV-based vectors in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Verma's lab has used the vector to incorporate genes into the
brain, liver, muscle, bone marrow and retinal cells of rats or
mice. The genes seem to function for months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others say, it is not clear whether the HIV vectors will
be efficient enough to make gene therapy work. ``They are still
going to have to struggle to get genes into people, even using an
HIV vector,'' said Poeschla of the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being infectious, the AIDS virus has been extensively
studied, so that scientists know how to modify it. ``We know every
nucleotide down to the last base,'' Verma said.
</P>
<P>
   His laboratory's latest vector removes six of the nine genes in
the AIDS virus. One big change that is required is that of the
virus' protein coat, which determines which cells it can attach to.
The AIDS virus mainly infects certain white blood cells known as T
cells. So scientists have replaced the HIV protein coat with that
of a cattle virus that seems to be able to infect many different
types of human cells.
</P>
<P>
   The only genes taken from the HIV itself to make the vector are
those that govern the process by which the viral genetic material
is incorporated into the chromosome of the target cell. These genes
are put into cells known as packaging cells, which produce the
actual vectors.
</P>
<P>
   The vectors themselves _ the particles that would be injected
into a patient _ contain the viral proteins needed to incorporate
the therapeutic gene into the patient's chromosomes, but they do
not contain the genes that direct the creation of those proteins.
So after it incorporates the gene into one cell, the viral particle
cannot go on to direct the cell to produce more viruses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Verma and others point out that the HIV vectors are far more
different from a real virus than the crippled viruses that are
already used in traditional vaccines for deadly diseases like
smallpox and polio.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that the other vectors used for gene therapy,
while perhaps not effective, have also not been shown to cause
disease in patients or to recombine with other genetic material to
become active again, in part because the FDA has strict guidelines
for vector purity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Emerman of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, who had questioned the safety of HIV vectors
when Verma's lab reported two years ago on its first one, said the
newer ones have fewer HIV genes and appear to be safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the concerns I had at the time are being addressed,''
he said. One possible concern, he said, is that people who receive
the vectors may test positive for AIDS on a frequently used blood
test because they may make antibodies to particular AIDS proteins
that remain in the vector.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists say it is best not to play with fire. If
a lentivirus is needed because of its ability to infect nondividing
cells, then animal viruses could be used instead of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Poeschla and Dr. Garry P. Nolan, an assistant professor at
Stanford University School of Medicine, are independently
developing vectors based on the feline immunodeficiency virus,
which causes an AIDS-like disease in cats but has not been known to
cause disease in people. Oxford Biomedica, a British biotechnology
company, and Dr. John C. Olsen of the University of North Carolina
are separately developing vectors based on equine infectious anemia
virus, which causes a disease in horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the real danger,'' Nolan said. ``It's the
psychological issues.'' He said that even some of his own
researchers would object to using the AIDS virus. ``I want to do
research without looking over my shoulders all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said there was ``absolutely not'' a chance that someone
could get AIDS itself from use of such a vector. But he said there
was a very small risk that the vector could recombine with another
virus, creating a new virus that could spread in the patient's body
or even to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the HIV vectors say that there might be some
risk of introducing animal viruses into people as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a virus from one species and move it to another,
it's very difficult to predict what will happen,'' said Dr. Didier
Trono, professor of genetics and microbiology at the University of
Geneva. Trono, who was previously at the Salk Institute, was a
major collaborator with Verma in developing the lentiviral vector,
along with F.H. Gage, who is still at Salk, and Luigi Naldini, now
at the University of Turin in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who insist that the vectors are safe acknowledge that
political problems will confine HIV vectors to use in the most
serious diseases. ``Clearly one is going to want to start to
address the questions in patients with terminal diseases,'' said
Dr. Stephen A. Sherwin, president of Cell Genesys, a gene therapy
company in Foster City, Calif. The company, of which Verma is a
director, is thinking of trying the HIV vector on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Genetix also is thinking of inserting a gene that confers
resistance to chemotherapy drugs into blood stem cells, the cells
in bone marrow that give rise to all blood cells. That would allow
patients to undergo stronger chemotherapy without destroying their
immune systems or requiring bone marrow transplants. The company
has a patented HIV vector, based on work by Dr. Joseph G. Sodroski
of Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Verma wants to use his vector to treat hemophilia and hopes
to apply for Federal permission for a clinical trial in a year or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Kohn, director of gene therapy at Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles, hopes to apply this year for Federal approval to use
the HIV vector to treat AIDS, delivering a gene that interferes
with the functioning of the HIV virus. One question is whether this
gene will also interfere with the functioning of the vector.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, who is also a professor at the University of Southern
California School of Medicine, has unsuccessfully tried to use gene
therapy for AIDS and other diseases, delivering the genes to blood
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just not been getting the genes into the bone marrow
cells,'' he said. But experiments using the Salk Institute vector
on bone marrow cells grown in culture show ``the lentivirus is
much, much better,'' he said. The safety of the vector, he added,
is not that much of a concern for AIDS patients. ``Certainly,
nothing you give them will be worse than what they have,'' he
said. &QL;

   Potent thunderstorms fueled by a strong jet stream disturbance
ripped through the Middle Atlantic states Monday, producing 70
miles-per-hour wind gusts near Pittsburgh, Pa. Tuesday, relatively
tranquil weather will return to the Middle Atlantic and
Northeastern states in the wake of the disturbance. Indeed,
abundant sunshine and seasonable temperatures will be found from
Washington, D.C., to Boston, though gusty winds from the west will
make the air feel cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Farther inland, residual moisture in the lower portions of the
atmosphere will cause clouds to linger from the Great Lakes to
western New England. Occasional snow showers will add slightly to
the substantial snow pack across the region, particularly east of
Lake Ontario and in the Adirondack mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding air currents associated with high pressure will
suppress clouds across the Southeast and southern Plains on
Tuesday. The plentiful sunshine will help to boost temperatures
into the 60s and lower 70s over the region. Slightly more humid
conditions will support scattered clouds across southern Texas and
south Florida where isolated showers may develop.
</P>
<P>
   Overcast skies and showers will cover the Pacific Northwest and
northern two thirds of California as a steady flow of moist air
from the Pacific Ocean persists. Upon being lifted and cooled, the
damp air will produce heavy snow in the Sierra and Cascade
mountains. Valley showers and mountain snow will also occur near
much of the west-facing slopes of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tennessee Tornadoes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deadly tornadoes descended on western Tennessee on Sunday night
as a cold front from the Pacific crossed the Mississippi Valley.
Oddly, fronts of Pacific origin tend to trigger more severe storms
in the South during the winter than do Arctic fronts. The Pacific
fronts, while lacking sharp temperature contrasts common with polar
fronts, tend to draw large quantities of very mild, moist air,
vital to thunderstorms, northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Pacific
fronts are often preceded by very strong winds just a few thousand
feet above the ground and this is a critical ingredient for
twisters.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THIS CASH COW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday Jan. 20)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is possible that you were so preoccupied exhaling a huge sigh
of relief that Dennis Rodman is going back to work that you missed
the story of Lucy the cow.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy is an 8-year-old Holstein (for all you bovine-challenged
folks, that is a make of cow, sort of like a Chevy Vega, only with
better acceleration) who lives at La-Foster Farm in Rowan County,
N.C. Lucy made (small) headlines recently for (possibly) setting a
new international record for milk production in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmer Terry Foster and his wife, Sarah, said Lucy
produced 75,275 pounds of milk in a 365-day period. For those of
you who don't buy your milk by the pound, that translates to 8,753
gallons, or an average of almost 24 gallons of milk each day.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Lucy was feeling particularly generous and produced
nearly 30 gallons of milk, which is 5 times what other Vegas
-excuse me, Holsteins - usually produce.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit at the outset that I am not an agricultural kind of
guy. In fact, the only knowledge I could share with you about dairy
farms is that you should roll up your window when you drive by one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even someone who thought 2-percent milk came from
2-percent cows can be deeply impressed and humbled by Lucy's
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The question, to me, is not how but why Lucy produced so much
milk. Does she come from a long line of overachievers? Do the
Fosters offer perks, like extra hay or, perhaps, monogrammed
bathrobes to cows that go the extra mile, or quart, as the case may
be? Or has the whole Monica Lewinsky thing got Lucy so upset that
she's producing extra milk simply as a means of relieving her
anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   (There was no mention in The Associated Press story as to
whether Lucy is a Democrat or Republican, nor does it say how North
Carolina cows, as a group, feel about impeachment. By my guess is
that they've been subjected to Clinton-like behavior many times
around the barn yard and consider it no big deal.)
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Lucy does what she does very well, and she
does it without drawing a lot of attention to herself, which is
refreshing in these days of overexposed celebrities. Although Lucy
had the kind of year at the milking machine that Mark McGwire had
at the plate, she has not hired an agent, asked to be traded to a
bigger-market dairy farm nor signed an endorsement contract with a
major shoe company.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse - and you can put me down in the ``for
better'' column - dairy cows, even record-setting dairy cows - are
not as popular as professional athletes. When, for example, was the
last time you saw 70,000 people pack a stadium to watch a cow eat
grass? While it could be argued that such a spectacle would be more
exciting that your average Super Bowl, the fact remains that dairy
farming, like World Cup soccer, has thus far failed to generate
much interest among average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucy delivered her world-record 8,753rd gallon of milk,
fans did not fight each other for the plastic jug like they did for
Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball. When Lucy heads to the barn
after a hard day of cud-chewing, she isn't besieged by hordes of
autograph-seekers. Whether this is because dairy cows are uncool or
because autograph-seekers are averse to getting their shoes dirty
is hard to say; all I know is Lucy has thus far escaped writer's
cramp from signing too many T-shirts and visors.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is unsung, Lucy's accomplishment is every bit as
amazing as McGwire's. If you think it's hard hitting a 500-foot
home run, try producing 30 gallons of milk in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Way to go, Lucy. You earned your extra hay, and your monogrammed
bathrobe, too.
</P>

GUATEMALA, ON THE VERTICAL: CLIMBING MAYA RUINS AND VOLCANOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (HLW)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had brushed away a thin black dust that kept settling on the
pages of the novel I was reading at least three times before I took
conscious note of it and began looking around for its source. I was
baffled. There were few trees near the pool deck where I was
sitting; there was no construction under way. Just row upon row of
splendidly lush hills, rising to the snub-nosed peaks of some of
Guatemala's trademark volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes? Could it be? I wiped off another layer of ashy grime
and, in my mangled Spanish, asked one of the hotel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacaya,'' he said with a naughty smile. ``Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacaya was one of the volcanoes I could not see, the summit
nearest to Guatemala City, some 30 miles away, and it had indeed
gone boom. The eruption was modest _ no lava, no loss of lives _
but potent enough to scatter debris all the way to my hotel in the
mountain town of Antigua. It temporarily closed the airport in
Guatemala City and forced the cancellation of my return flight to
New York, stranding me in Guatemala for 24 hours longer than I had
planned to stay. And it underscored my entire experience of what is
arguably Central America's most exotic country, a place that
continually provided surprises _ by turns exhilarating and
debilitating, awe-inspiring and crazy-making.
</P>
<P>
   I chose it because it made perfect sense. My sister, Adelle, and
I had only a week away in September, and we wanted to fly somewhere
that did not require too much time in the air from New York, that
was not besieged by other tourists, that provided a satisfying
combination of history and natural splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala fit the bill. The combined traveling time from New
York to Miami, and then Miami to Guatemala City, was just under six
hours. And in a relatively inexpensive, unhurried eight days _ nine
with the unexpected eruption _ we managed to see the Maya temples
in Tikal National Park near the Mexican border, the mountain-ringed
idyll of Lake Atitlan, the bustling native market in the highland
village of Chichicastenango and the colonial town of Antigua _
formally Antigua Guatemala _ with its narrow cobblestone streets
and boutiques brimming with jade, religious ornaments and handmade
textiles.
</P>
<P>
   But we also learned that Guatemala is not easy, that tourists
who head there need to pack an ample supply of patience before they
depart. Rickety, sluggish trucks clog the two-lane, serpentine,
generously named highways that connect various cities and villages;
what should be a one-hour drive can easily expand into three, and
road signs in some areas are obscure or nonexistent. The changeable
weather makes it difficult to choose the right time or day to
ascend a volcano or rent a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the crime, or at least the fear of it. Although
Guatemala is no longer plagued by the political instability of 5 or
10 years ago, it remains an impoverished country in which wealthy
foreign tourists are conspicuous and, according to some travel
guides and the State Department, ready prey. Tourists have been
robbed, assaulted and, in the widely publicized case of five
American college students traveling in a group from Maryland last
year, raped.
</P>
<P>
   My experience and those of other tourists with whom I spoke
suggested that this threat was overblown, but it nonetheless
restricts and governs the movements of any cautious traveler.
Although there were activities my sister and I would have liked to
do by ourselves, we felt compelled by the advice of hotel employees
and travel agents to hire guides.
</P>
<P>
   On our first full day, we took, for about $200 each, a daylong
trip to Tikal National Park that included round-trip air fare for
the 45-minute flight from Guatemala City to the small northern city
of Flores, transportation between the Flores airport and the park
and a guide for exploration of the Maya ruins, scattered throughout
a dense jungle inhabited by rare birds and spider monkeys. We saw
our first monkey no more than a few yards down the footpath into
the park.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishingly intact ruins, mostly dating from around 700
A.D., are spread out over several square miles that also include
some structures still being excavated, and they are a revelation,
accessible to tourists in a way they would not be in a more
developed country. The difference, I'm convinced, is liability. If
these steeply graded stone temples, with jagged facades that
resemble crude staircases, were situated in, say, the Arizona
desert, they would undoubtedly be cordoned off. In Tikal, a visitor
can climb to the top of each pyramidal structure, a hair-raising
experience surpassed only by the trip back down.
</P>
<P>
   Going in that direction, Adelle and I were forced to slither
backward, bellies to stone, lest vertigo and utter panic overtake
us. We felt like fools, until our guide assured us that more
intrepid tourists had met ghastly fates. He said that one American
teen-ager took a furious tumble and broke a dozen bones. A German
tourist intent on videotaping his descent lost control of more than
his camera and ended up in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   We heaved sighs of relief and reassured ourselves that no other
activity on our trip would prove so nerve-wracking. We had yet to
reach Lake Atitlan, where a volcano beckoned us toward its
cloud-shrouded apex.
</P>
<P>
   It is astonishing that the mention of Atitlan does not prompt
the instant recognition among travelers that the names Tahoe or
Como do, because Atitlan's beauty easily trumps that of more famous
lakes. Atitlan lies about 5,100 feet above sea level, and the three
volcanoes along its shores rise to peaks averaging about 10,000
feet. Moreover, the tiny villages along the 50-square-mile lake are
still inhabited by modern-day Mayas wearing traditional dress,
kaleidoscopic garments shimmering with purple, orange and crimson
threads.
</P>
<P>
   But it took us nearly three hours by car to reach Atitlan from
Guatemala City on the Pan-American Highway, and the natural wonder
we encountered was less than lovingly maintained. Maya women use it
as a laundry basin, and litter coats some of its shores.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There is only one truly sumptuous place to stay, the Hotel
Atitlan, a fantasia of ornately maintained gardens, caged parrots,
hand-carved wooden furniture and gorgeous ceramic tile. In many
countries, the Hotel Atitlan might cost $300 a night; here it is
only about $100, and once we checked in, we never wanted to leave.
That turned out to be a good thing, because one of our three days
was spent simply languishing there, achy and feverish.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the legacy of our volcano adventure. Heeding travel
books and advisories that warned of occasional robberies along
hiking trails, we spent what was considered top dollar _ about $75
apiece _ to hire a guide to take us across the lake and up the
slopes of the volcano of San Pedro. This bought us passage in a
crowded, dirty -motorboat and then 15 minutes in the refuse-strewn
bed of a pickup truck navigating the bumpy gravel and dirt road
from a squalid village to the trail head.
</P>
<P>
   The climb itself was pure torture _ the incline of the
weed-tangled, rock-studded path was sometimes close to vertical _
and after the first of the three and a half hours to the summit at
9,908 feet, any views were obscured by the dense tree cover. When
we reached the top, our reward was sweat-soaked clothing, burning
thighs, altitude-aggravated shortness of breath and an impenetrable
fog that diminished visibility to about 75 feet. A Dutch couple
whose curses had occasionally been audible from about 100 feet
ahead of us on the trail lay inert on a mossy boulder, but they
seemed to be breathing. At least, we thought, the hard part was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Then a veritable monsoon hit, turning the air frigid and the
narrow trail into a treacherous mudslide. As we baby-stepped our
way down in sneakers ill-suited for such conditions, my feet flew
out from under me at least a dozen times; my sister tumbled
repeatedly into thorny bramble. The blood from her scratches
mingled with tears from her terror, prompting an epiphany. Never,
she vowed, would she go on vacation with me again.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we awoke with sore throats, high temperatures
and muscles so shredded we could barely get out of bed.
Fortunately, we had a full day to recuperate before our next
destination. Even more fortunately, that destination, after a brief
stop in Chichicastenango, was the Casa Santo Domingo, a five-star
hotel of nonpareil beauty in the relaxing and refined village of
Antigua, Guatemala's colonial capital in the 16th, 17th and 18th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Santo Domingo's labyrinth-like series of dark stone
hallways and column-fringed courtyards ramble through the ruins of
a 17th-century Dominican monastery, and the hotel's attentive
caretakers evoke the sacred aura of the place with a multitude of
religious statues and flickering candles that, at night, are pretty
much the sole source of light (except, of course, in guest rooms).
Fresh flower petals float atop the tiny concrete pools that dot the
public areas. All of this, plus a room with a fireplace and
terrace, cost about $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua itself is a miracle of pain-staking preservation, its
buildings and streets little changed over the last 200 years. To
wander through the center of the town, which has about 35,000
residents, is to encounter the remnants of convents, monasteries
and elaborately sculptured churches built between the mid-1500s and
the mid-1700s. The views of the surrounding volcanoes change as
clouds gather, disperse and scuttle from one horizon to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua also boasts craft stores tucked into quiet courtyards
with ornate gardens, quaint bars and restaurants that offer
sophisticated cuisine not easily found elsewhere in the country. We
enjoyed a particularly fine dinner at Meson Panza Verde, which
serves its beef and pork dishes in rich sauces laced with Cognac
and cream. With a bottle of wine from the extensive list, two
people can stuff themselves for around $70.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua is a perfect two-day stop, but we had allotted three,
grew restless and then discovered, upon our return to Guatemala
City, that we would have to check into a hotel while we waited for
the airport to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should hire a guide for Pacaya,'' said Adelle, her
scratches faded and her spirit healed, in a moment of bravado.
</P>
<P>
   We thought a moment, burst out laughing, then perused the
pay-per-view options at the Westin Camino Real, a bland but
full-service, American-style hotel. A movie and cheeseburgers from
room service were just about our speed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE JUNGLE, ON THE LAKE &LR;  &QC;  SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States Department of State does not have a
warning in effect on Guatemala, its Consular Information Sheet,
dated July 6, 1998, is lengthy, and includes the following: ``While
violent crime has been a serious and growing problem in Guatemala
for years, there has been a marked increase in incidents involving
U.S. citizens since early 1997. ... Highway robberies by armed
thieves have increased significantly over the past year and have
occurred in all parts of the country. Tourist vans have been a
particularly susceptible target.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says that it is dangerous to climb volcanoes because of
the possibility of robbery or attack but that the ruins at Tikal
are ``considered to be generally safe, provided that visitors fly
to Flores and then travel by bus or tour van to the ruins.''
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, with $2 billion already spent on construction of what
would have been the world's mightiest particle accelerator, the
Congress killed the project, known as the Superconducting
Supercollider, or SSC. All that remains are some buildings, a lot
of land around Waxahachie, Texas, and a section of the planned
54-mile tunnel that would have housed the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   But a small company, International Isotopes Inc., has acquired
some very expensive apparatus from the project for a song ($2.9
million), moved the machinery to its headquarters in Denton, Texas,
and will soon use it to manufacture radioactive pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its operation will help free United States
hospitals from dependence on military and foreign sources of these
vital substances.
</P>
<P>
   International Isotopes has modified an 80-foot-long linear
accelerator, or linac, built for the SSC and will use it to make a
dozen or more radioactive chemicals essential to diagnosing and
treating cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   When a proton from such an accelerator strikes the nucleus of an
atom it sometimes merges with the nucleus, changing it into a
different _ and often radioactive _ element. Depending on the
chemical nature of the new element, it can be used to target tumors
in a specific part of the body; radioactive iodine, for example,
seeks out tumors in the thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the SSC, the completed linac would have given a beam
of protons a preliminary shove of up to 70 million electronvolts
before injecting the beam into the main accelerator ring, where the
protons would have been further accelerated to 20 trillion
electronvolts. The main ring was abandoned after a small section of
its tunnel was dug. But the linac was nearly finished.
</P>
<P>
   Carl W. Seidel, president of International Isotopes, said that
his company had modified the linac to greatly increase the number
of protons in its beam. The company expects to begin using the
linac to make the radioactive chemicals starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy has encouraged the project partly
because it will assure a reliable domestic source of short-lived
radioactive chemicals, most of which must be used within hours of
their manufacture. One such substance, fluorine-16, used to
pinpoint cancerous tissue in the brain, decays so rapidly that half
of any amount of it disappears in 110 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinicians depend partly on the production of radioactive
chemicals as byproducts of Defense Department reactors, which do
not operate continuously. Most of the shortfall must be obtained
from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors using radioactive substances for diagnosis and treatment
must obtain these materials from reactors or accelerators that are
nearby, although the longer-lived isotopes can survive short air
trips. But Seidel said his company would use its linear accelerator
as a prototype for similar accelerators it would build for sale or
lease.
</P>
<P>
   High-energy physicists continue to lament the demise of the SSC.
But President Clinton, who signed the legislation that killed the
project, has had second thoughts. In June, after the discovery of
mass in neutrino particles, Clinton told students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology that the discovery ``calls
into question the decision'' to abandon the project.

<P>
   Q. (italics)I am planning a hiking trip to Wales this spring,
and would like some general information on trails. _ Mindy Dillon,
Buffalo, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are thousands of miles of walking paths throughout
Wales, ranging from those that traverse the heather moorlands and
mountainous terrain of the 845-square-mile Snowdonia National Park
in the north, to less demanding trails that crisscross the gentle
countryside of central Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular destinations are in the western coastal regions of
Pembrokeshire National Park and southern Wales' mountainous Brecon
Beacons National Park. Wherever you roam, especially in the parks,
you're likely to encounter abundant wildlife, including seals and
numerous bird species.
</P>
<P>
   The Wales Tourist Board publishes a free 53-page guide called
``Walking Wales'' that includes a selection of walks long and
short, tough and easy. Nearby accommodations and a small map with
Ordnance Survey references accompany each entry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the short walks is the four-mile St. Brides Major Walk
that incorporates both inland countryside and segments of the
14-mile Glamorgan Heritage Coast in southern Wales. Sites on the
route include a ruined castle, the remains of an old walled garden,
the sandy beach at Dunraven Bay, traces of a Celtic settlement and
an ancient church.
</P>
<P>
   Among the longer walks are the 182-mile Offa's Dyke Path, which
crosses the England-Wales border 13 times; and the 186-mile
Pembrokeshire Coast Path with its rugged cliff trails and sandy
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The guide also includes a 10-page list of publications on hiking
in Wales, a list of tourist office addresses and phone numbers,
advice on transportation; and other useful information. It is
available from the Wales Tourist Board, Department PP12, Post
Office Box 1, Cardiff, Wales; telephone (44-1222) 457766, fax
(44-1222) 482436.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies specializing in hiking in Wales are Acorn
Activities, in Hereford, (44-1432) 830083; fax (44-1432) 830110,
and Heart of Wales Farm and Country Holidays, telephone and fax
(44-1686) 688444.
</P>
<P>
   You may also be interested in a spring walking festival. From
May 28 to 31, the Llanelli Festival of Walks will include 10 hikes
along coastal paths, and through the hills of southern Wales; the
walks range from 6 gentle miles to 10-mile strenuous walks. The fee
is $24.50. A festival dinner costs $16. The Festival Office in
Llanelli, telephone (44-1554) 770077, can provide information on
lodgings in the area. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like to go to the Panorama Percussivo
Mundial festival in Salvador, Brazil. Please provide information. _
Mabel MacDonald, Aspen, Colo.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The six-year-old Panorama Percussivo Mundial (World
Percussive Panorama, or Percpan, as it is called in Brazil) is a
jubilant festival that showcases international percussion-based
music _ both traditional and modern _ from Brazil, Africa, the
Caribbean and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the festival is only two months away, promoters for
the event, which will be held March 22 to 27 in Salvador, the
capital of the northeastern state of Bahia, are not releasing
details about international performers, with whom they're still in
negotiation. It has been announced that the Brazilian songwriter
Gilberto Gil and Nana Vasconcellos, a percussionist, will act as
masters of ceremony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're likely to see some colorful performances by musicians and
dancers decked out in headdresses, feathers and flowing robes.
Calabash and gourd rattles, cowbells, an exotic variety of drums,
even a pair of wooden shoes, provided the rhythms for last year's
festival, which included Doudou N'Diaye Rose, a Senegalese drum and
dance ensemble, the Japanese group Wadaiko Yamato and the Brazilian
composer Hermeto Pascoal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the evening performances (there are about five a
night), you can attend daily two-hour workshops, led by
participating musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Percpan will take place in downtown Salvador's Castro Alves
theater (Praca 2 de Julho, Campo Grande). Nightly ticket prices are
likely to be the same as last year: $8, $4 for students. For more
information call (55-71) 243 6364, or by e-mail to
percpan(AT)e-net.com.br. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you know the names of bookstores in Paris that
specialize in rare books? Simon Lagroste, Providence, R.I.(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of Paris' antique book stores (called librairies) are
concentrated in two distinctly different neighborhoods: on the Left
Bank, in the fifth arrondissement near the Sorbonne and in the
sixth arrondissement between St.-Germain-des-Pres and Odeon; and on
the Right Bank in the area around the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore,
as well as in the eighth and ninth arrondissements.
</P>
<P>
   The Left Bank shops are in a neighborhood for printers and book
shops, which were established in the 15th century. At that time,
the first printing press arrived in the city, and was housed in the
Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
   Shops you might come across include: Alain Brieux, at 48 Rue
Jacob in the sixth arrondissement. It was established at the end of
the 19th century, and began specializing in rare medical and
scientific books and instruments in 1958. It is open Monday to
Saturday from 10 to 1 and 2 to 6:30; telephone (33-1) 42.60.21.98.
</P>
<P>
   Librairie Gourmande, 4 Rue Dante in the fifth, stocks many rare
books on the art of dining from the 16th century to the present. It
is open every day from 10 to 7; (33-1) 43.54.37.27.
</P>
<P>
   Librairie Beres, 14 Avenue Friedland in the eighth, is reputed
to have the best collection of rare books from the 9th to the 20th
centuries, on subjects ranging from politics and economics to
literary first editions. Hours are 9 to 6 daily; (33-1)
45.63.85.53. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Coulet, 166 Boulevard Haussmann in the eighth,
specializes in handsomely bound works of French literature from the
16th to the 18th centuries. It is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10
to 12:30 and 2 to 6:30; (33-1) 42.89.51.59.
</P>
<P>
   For rare maps, atlases and engravings from the 15th to the
mid-19th centuries, you might want to go to the Librairie La
Bail-Weissert, 5 Rue Lagrange in the fifth. The shop includes
original topographical maps of the world, as well as maps of
European cities, regions and a collection of architectural
engravings. Hours are Monday to Saturday, from 10 to 12:30 and 2 to
7; (33-1) 43.29.72.59.

AN OPEN-AIR PERCH IN THE JUNGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For release on Sunday, Jan. 24)  
(ms) 
 By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A red dugout canoe floated on the calm aqua sea, orchids were
blooming in the garden, large grapefruit and limes hung
languorously in the orchard. And on a steep slope above, we
glimpsed the edge of a deep green, mysterious Costa Rican rain
forest. Nothing wrong with the view. But something was definitely
amiss. A rather big something. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the vista from our room at the top of the stairs in a
jungle lodge reachable only by boat, we could see the canoe, citrus
trees and forest clearly for a good reason. On three sides, between
the beaded board wainscoting (which came up to my waist) and the
roof, there was nothing but tropical sea air. Our room was almost
without walls. My husband, Bernard, and I had known this in advance
but even so, seeing it up close was disquieting. In any case, the
space was now ours, and paid for in advance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We set down three small pieces of luggage. Then there was a
flutter of wings. A large toucan flapped straight toward us,
stopping a few feet away in the branches of a tall water apple
tree.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' Bernard said, as he looked at the bird looking at him
through the gap beneath the roofline.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason for staying in a room that was half-porch at
the top of the lodge operated by Rainbow Adventures-Costa Rica, in
the southwestern part of the country near Panama. It is set in a
1,200-acre rain forest, blessed with spectacular scenery and
gorgeous birds. Here, we wanted to test an idea embraced by Alec
Waugh, the English writer, who liked to size up unfamiliar
territory from a veranda. Like him, we wanted to find out if we
could see a respectable amount of jungle life from the edges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you are the explorer, who leaves no corner unexamined,
who hurries from place to place collecting and codifying facts; or
else you are the observer,'' Waugh wrote in ``Hot Countries,'' his
book about travels in the tropics. ``Myself, I have always chosen
to let life come to me.''  &QC;  Still, there were questions. The main
one: how much of our third-floor room would we be sharing and with
how many varieties of wildlife? Costa Rica is said to have 850
species of bird and more than 35,000 species of insect, including
hordes of mosquitoes. We had learned that Rainbow's owner, Michael
Medill, had not installed ceiling fans because they could
annihilate hummingbirds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guidebooks to the country are full of advice about jungle
safeguards, suggesting insect repellent strong enough to cloud
plastic, masses of first-aid equipment and other precautions,
which, if we had listened, could have displaced our clothing. The
small planes we were booked on had a limit of 25 pounds of luggage
per person. In the end, I checked to see if my tetanus shot was
still valid, packed bath oil, which a forest ranger friend had
recommended as a mosquito deterrent, and threw out an umbrella to
make room for an extra sun hat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our trip to Rainbow Adventures had progressed in stages of
declining amenities. It began with an overnight stay in Costa
Rica's mountainous capital, San Jose, in the cozy Hotel Grano de
Oro, which, except for the tropical garden and the excellent local
beer, was reminiscent of a comfortable New England inn. Early the
next morning we flew in a twin-engine plane 50 minutes southeast
over the mountains to Puerto Jimenez, a village on the Golfo Dulce
near the Pacific Ocean. Bernard and I were headed for the Osa
Peninsula and Lapa Rios, an upscale jungle lodge, where the rooms
were protected by mesh screens. Two mornings later we checked out
of our pleasant room with mixed feelings and climbed into a
four-wheel drive truck that would take us to Puerto Jimenez for the
boat trip across the Golfo Dulce to our room without walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow's boatman, Balto Villareal, wearing shorts and no shoes,
was waiting at the dock with the lodge's 22-foot skiff for the
35-minute ride to the lodge. ``Peligroso?'' I asked apprehensively,
pointing to a darkening bank of clouds toward the north, where we
were headed. We were traveling in November near the end of rainy
season and what is considered winter in southern Costa Rica's
Pacific region. Balto laughed and pointed to three brown pelicans
circling lazily overhead and later to dozens of fish jumping off
our starboard side, a school of skipjack tuna.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Rainbow, built in a grassy clearing between the volcanic sand
beach and the steep forested ridge, Brian Strehlow, a co-manager,
wearing camp counselor shorts and T-shirt, was waiting as we
stepped from the skiff onto rocks and splashed through tidal pools
to reach the shore.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We stopped briefly on the veranda-cum-lobby and dining room, to
test a large hammock and handmade polished hardwood chairs. The
coffee table was hidden under stacks of nature books and a
backgammon board. A chart of Costa Rica's snakes hung on a wall. In
the library behind the veranda, shelves held hundreds of books on
natural history.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our third-floor room at the top of the stairs, we walked into
a hodgepodge of collectibles (not the upscale antiques that
guidebooks had led me to expect), panels of stained glass, small
tables of Art Nouveau objects, several vases filled with bouquets
of fresh flowers, faded prints on the wall and polished hardwood
floors. Fine mesh mosquito netting shadowed the double bed. Along
the room's edges, where the walls should have been, there were
shiny wood swivel chairs positioned for spotting the birds and
animals that roam Rainbow's grounds. Even with gaps in the walls,
it felt homey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the spacious bathroom, shielded from the bedroom by an
interior wall, a bidet sat beneath a mola of a fire-breathing
dragon. Hanging stained-glass panels screened some of the views.
Thanks to hydropower, an unlimited amount of hot water flowed
freely in the large tiled shower. Rainbow's electricity is
generated by the inn's high-tech water wheel, propelled by a stream
from the hills above.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs on the breezy veranda, the kitchen smells were
enticing, the work of a cook, Juana Villareal (a common last name
in the area). She was bent over a behemoth stainless-steel stove
that had been shipped to the lodge from the Golfo Dulce's main
port, Golfito, south of Rainbow, in a huge dugout canoe. The
home-style lunch was delicious: fresh tamarind juice, a large soft
tamale filled with chicken and fresh vegetables and a salad of
marinated cauliflower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Energized by the tamarind juice, we decided to go for a walk
with Brian, included in the daily rate for room and meals. He
helped us find the right size rubber boots from a cache by the
front steps for an hour and a half tour of the grounds, the orchard
and organic vegetable garden. On an easy trek wading up one of
Rainbow's clear rocky streams we saw a green kingfisher in a wild
avocado tree, beautiful fungi that looked like tiny white caps
growing on tree limbs, and a plant species with an elephant-ine
trunk, which Brian said ``has been sitting out in the jungle since
dinosaur times, the cycad.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we saw nothing on our walk as beguiling as the frangipani
tree in Rainbow's side garden, festooned with hanging clumps of
pastel orchids growing in coconut husks _ though the ylang-ylang
tree with a languid yellow flower came close. Hummingbirds sipped
from the bird-of-paradise-like blossoms of the heliconia plant. The
tree sheltering a family of bats was less appealing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just before dinner, a small boy, about 4 years old, emerged from
the foliage and ran up the lodge steps with a shout, ``A moth, a
moth!'' That was Max, calling to his father on the veranda. The
family of five, from England and Atlanta, the only other guests at
Rainbow that day, had spent a week in one of the two cabins without
walls, built near the lodge, and Max was showing talent as a
wildlife spotter. During a four-hour river boat trip, between naps,
he had helped his mother, father, grandmother and 2-year-old sister
spot 35 species of birds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later at dinner on the veranda, when a bat zoomed out of the
darkness and jetted over the main course _ excellent grilled red
snapper, served with green salad and crisp green beans _ I was the
only person who flinched. At the next table, Max's mother smiled,
saying, ``You're as jumpy as we were when we first arrived.'' I
recovered over the soothing fresh coconut flan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, we drifted outside to look for tree frogs and
other creatures near the 48-foot nonchlorinated, spring-fed
swimming pool, part of Rainbow's evening ritual. The frogs flatten
themselves against green leaves until they are almost
two-dimensional. There were plenty of frogs but no sign of the boa
constrictor that had visited the pool area a few days before.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Night falls early in Costa Rican jungles, and so do
bird-watchers. By about 10 p.m. you crawl under the mosquito
netting to wait for dawn, when you're awakened by silvery bird
calls. Later the rain came down in torrents as loud as disco music,
but the room stayed dry, protected by the wide roof overhang.
Beyond the buckets of rain that fell in the inky black, I was aware
only of perfume from the ylang-ylang tree.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day began with glasses of fresh orange and grapefruit
juice, eggs cooked to order, served with rice and beans, and
magnificent coffee. It was brewed from freshly ground Costa Rican
beans, and we poured copious amounts from a pot that sat on a
counter between the dining area and the kitchen. The round polished
hardwood dining tables were decorated with dewy fresh flowers in
jelly glasses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, we left the veranda with Balto for a trip to
the main attraction in Rainbow's world, Casa de Orquidias, a
botanical garden that is a 15- or 20-minute boat ride south of the
lodge. The garden was created by two Americans, Ron and Trudy
MacAllister, who prefer living in a place without roads,
telephones, television and newspapers, dependent only upon their
home-grown vegetables, shortwave radio and boat, which takes them
south to Golfito once a week to shop for supplies. The beguiling
70-acre garden surrounding the small house they built themselves 19
years ago out of native woods lies between the steep jungle
hillside and the beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the garden's wild tangle of tropical splendors _ plants
growing on top of plants and sprouting from every visible cranny _
one orchid species grows up to 12 feet tall and another has a bloom
no bigger than four pinheads. Inviting pathways curve through
thickets of mango, papaya, guanabana, cashews, and star fruit
trees, spiky bromeliads, giant strangler figs, heliconias, a
variety of gingers and countless other species. There were
cactuses, which grow much faster in Costa Rica than in the desert,
and a palm tree that, Trudy said, ``you can see grow _ five feet in
two weeks. I sit on my porch and watch it grow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily the tour means stopping for fruit-tasting sessions
under sheltering trees but because it began to rain, we did our
tasting on the front porch, biting into juicy grapefruit and star
fruit, fleshier and more intensely flavored than any shipped fruit
I'd ever tasted, and a red berry called the miracle fruit, sour
when eaten plain and sweet when sprinkled with lemon juice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The garden has 100 species of orchid but ``Costa Rica has about
12,000,'' Trudy said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at Rainbow, early the next morning, I saw Carol, a newly
arrived guest from Seattle, wandering distractedly up the path to
the lodge after a stroll around the garden with binoculars and a
thick guide to the birds of Costa Rica. ``There's so much to see,
you can't move very far,'' she said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving, I sat in front of the lodge on a seaside
bench made of a split log for a last look, spotting brown pelicans
circling above dolphins. The pelicans followed our boat south to
Golfito and its small landing strip. Waiting for the plane back to
San Jose, we sat on a bench under trees hung with bromeliads. My
wildlife tally after two days beside the rain forest was paltry by
Costa Rican standards: a dozen bird species I could name, dozens of
others I couldn't name, an agile racoonlike coatimundi, a tayra (a
weasel that looks like a fisher) and no mosquito bites. But what we
did see was choice. And we had learned what we had hoped to learn,
that you can see quite a bit without straying far from a veranda.

BRITISH COURT RECONSIDERS PINOCHET'S BID TO BE FREED
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A panel of Law Lords, Britain's highest court, Monday
opened a rehearing of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's plea to be freed from
house arrest and allowed to return home to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Alun Jones, the British lawyer arguing the case against the
former dictator, said the Lords should disregard his supporters'
claims that trying him was a matter for Chile alone or that
prosecuting him would destabilize Chilean democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that the liability for the crimes against humanity
that Pinochet is charged with lies with him and not with Chile. He
cited the Nuremburg war crimes tribunal's conclusion that ``crimes
against international law are committed by men, not by abstract
entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such
offenses can the provisions of international law be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also introduced evidence that Pinochet may not have been
officially head of state at the time that the killings and torture
occurred, calling into question his claim of sovereign immunity.
Lord Browne-Wilkinson, chief Law Lord, said the court might ask the
Foreign Office for a certificate clarifying when Britain recognized
Pinochet as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better look at this overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, is protesting his arrest in London on Oct. 16,
saying that as Chile's former head of state he enjoys sovereign
immunity. That view was upheld by the High Court on Oct. 28 but
reversed by a five-man panel of Law Lords on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The British police arrested the general in response to an
application from a Spanish judge seeking his extradition to Madrid
to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping in
connection with the death or disappearance of more than 3,000
people in the 17 years that he ruled Chile after seizing power in a
coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   After the Law Lords' decision, Home Secretary Jack Straw
validated the Spanish claim, and the general, in his only public
appearance, went before a London judge for a bail hearing Dec. 11
that continued his house arrest and prompted predictions that he
would be unable to leave England for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 17, in a development that deeply embarrassed the
British judiciary and led to this week's reopening of the case, the
Lords set aside its earlier decision because one of the judges who
ruled against the general, Lord Hoffmann, had not disclosed his
involvement with Amnesty International, which is a party to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing was the first time the Lords had ever reviewed
one of their rulings, and the panel numbered seven instead of the
customary five Law Lords, a measure of the gravity of the case for
Britain and the reputation of its court system. Chile was granted
the right to make its case in support of the general's release
during what is expected to be at least four days of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If the seven senior judges now find in favor of Pinochet, he is
expected to fly home on a Chilean air force plane that returned
Monday to Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base in Oxfordshire, where
it had been parked this fall to provide the general a quick exit
from England. If they rule against him, he would have to remain in
the suburban house he has been living in under police guard for the
many months it will take the extradition process to wind through
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who started the case as part
of his investigation of atrocities during the so-called dirty wars
in Latin America in the 1970s, was present Monday as an observer.
His petition has since been endorsed by the Spanish government, and
Jones emphasized that the extradition effort was not ``an isolated
exercise by a single magistrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to arguments he made in the past that crimes like
torture and kidnapping cannot be covered by immunity, he said
methods put into practice by Pinochet were ``the most hideous
imaginable.'' He cited systematic rape and sodomy and added, ``On
occasions dogs were used in a sexual way against victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that Garzon began has inflamed opinions in Chile and
among exile groups in Europe, and rival gatherings of demonstrators
thronged either side of the street outside Parliament on Monday
chanting slogans and waving banners and placards. On Sunday
hundreds of Chilean exiles staged a protest in London against
Pinochet, while hundreds of his supporters were arriving here from
Santiago to rally for his release and return home.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a
friend of the general's who says he ought to be treated with
gratitude for his support during the Falkland Islands war of 1982,
has published a widely circulated pamphlet called ``The Real
General Pinochet,'' portraying its subject as the victim of ``a
politically inspired kidnap.''
</P>
<P>
   The author, Dr. Robin Harris, former head of the Conservative
Research Department, said, ``Senator Pinochet is the closest thing
Britain has to a political prisoner.'' The onetime Chilean
strongman had himself declared senator for life as a way of
immunizing himself from any prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 22 Chilean lawyers issued a statement here saying
that, contrary to the claims of the general's supporters, Chile's
sovereignty was not infringed by his being brought to justice in a
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something that really has affected our national
sovereignty and dignity, it is precisely the systematic violations
of human rights during his dictatorship, which have been denounced
and condemned internationally,'' the lawyers said in a statement
read by Fabiola Letelier, sister of Orlando Letelier, a
pre-Pinochet Chilean defense minister assassinated in a car bombing
in Washington in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview with The Sunday Telegraph from the home
he has rented in an exclusive residential enclave in Surrey, south
of London, Pinochet said he was resigned to dying in England.

N.Y. CITY OPERA HALTS TOUR REHEARSALS

   NEW YORK _ The New York City Opera National Company canceled
musicians' rehearsals Sunday and Monday for its annual tour, which
is scheduled to begin in San Antonio next Monday, because of a
dispute with the musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement, which threatens the tour, is over the
musicians' demand for a guarantee that the touring ensemble have a
minimum of 28 or 29 players. In a dispute two years ago, the
company considered sending out its singers with piano
accompaniment, a proposal that angered the musicians and many
organizations that had planned to present the company's
performances. No such plan has been suggested for this year's tour,
which is scheduled to run 9 weeks, down from 16 last year, with 56
performances of Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Moriarity, president of Local 802 of the American
Federation of Musicians, said that when the musicians arrived for
rehearsal Sunday morning, they were told that rehearsals could not
begin until the musicians had ratified the contract they have been
negotiating for the last year. The last contract expired in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met, we considered the offer, and we approved all the
terms,'' Moriarity said, ``but the only change we asked was that
they guarantee a minimum number of musicians, no more than they've
hired in the past. So we proposed playing the rehearsals on Sunday
and Monday and discussing it further, but the management said no,
without a ratified contract, rehearsals are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Woelzl, a spokeswoman for the New York City Opera, said,
``We have been advised to say that we don't negotiate in the press,
therefore we have no comment.'' Moriarity said he was having
telephone discussions with Julie Samuels, the company's negotiator.

BRITISH AEROSPACE IN TALKS TO BUY GEC'S MARCONI UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's leading military contractors _ British
Aerospace PLC and the General Electric Co. PLC _ acknowledged
Monday that they were in ``advanced discussions'' on a deal for
General Electric's Marconi Electronic Systems that could be worth
as much as $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The brief announcement, confirming newspaper reports here,
pushed British Aerospace stock down by 25.5 pence, or 5 percent, to
493.5, reflecting analysts' fears that the company would pay too
much for Marconi. Shares of General Electric, which is not related
to General Electric of the United States, rose 8 pence, to 577.5,
on a day when London share prices rose 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said news reports valuing the prospective deal at up to
$13 billion could indicate that British Aerospace was prepared to
offer a big premium for Marconi, which makes warships, missiles and
military electronics. Based on military companies in the United
States, which carry a valuation of about 1.3 times sales, analysts
calculated a fair value of the deal at about $10 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement was the latest in a series of developments in
efforts to consolidate Europe's military industry _ fragmented
among key players in France, Germany and Britain _ in the face of
overwhelming competition from U.S. giants.
</P>
<P>
   An all-British deal would initially set back the building of a
European military group unless other companies reached deals with
the British company.
</P>
<P>
   A merger of British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems
could create a company worth at least $23 billion _ depending on
the outcome of negotiations and stock price fluctuations _ but
neither company seemed prepared Monday to give more than a terse
confirmation of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boards of GEC and British Aerospace have noted recent
press comment and confirm that they are in advanced discussions,''
their joint statement said. ``A further announcement will follow in
due course.'' General Electric's board is scheduled to meet
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts have depicted the planned deal as part of a
broader, European consolidation, recent moves have shown the
sensitivities surrounding the issue of cross-border mergers in
Europe's military industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, British Aerospace was reported close to a deal with
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace that would have created a company with
combined sales of $23 billion. But those negotiations foundered
when it emerged that General Electric had renewed its overtures to
British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, France's Thomson-CSF was reported to be seeking a
separate merger with General Electric. And DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace said last week that it was talking to the French company
Aerospatiale, apparently piqued by the scuttling of its deal with
British Aerospace.

ANNAN LEVELS BLAME FOR ANGOLAN STRIFE ON GOVERNMENT AND UNITA
REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ANGOLA) 
(JT) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in one of the
toughest and bleakest reports to emerge from his office, faults the
Angolan government and the Unita rebel organization for destroying
all hopes of peace in one of Africa's potentially richest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The report, sent on Sunday to the Security Council, says that
Angola is on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown, with
malnutrition and disease rising as fighting spreads, leaving
hundreds of thousands of civilians on the run from towns and
villages under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said in the report that with the recent resumption of
fighting ``the conditions for a meaningful U.N. peacekeeping role
ceased to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last few months have clearly demonstrated
that, for all intents and purposes, the Angolan peace process has
collapsed and the country is now in a state of war,'' Annan
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Annan proposed appointing a New-York based special envoy for
Angola. He noted that the United Nations has spent $1.5 billion on
peacekeeping for Angola over the last four years. But he added that
for the moment all that was left to do there was to remove safely
1,000 international monitors and aid workers and try to prevent the
loss of millions of dollars in equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle takes its place on the growing roster of
international missions that have failed because of standoffs
between bitterly entrenched foes and because U.N. member
governments have been unwilling to commit the huge military and
economic resources necessary to take charge of developments.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is facing similar intransigence in dealing
with several other African conflicts, from the Horn of Africa to
Congo, as well as in Afghanistan, where efforts to reconcile
battling factions have been stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report recommends closing the United Nations operation
in Angola by March 20. It holds the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi,
responsible for setting off the latest round of fighting by
ignoring the terms of a 1994 peace accord. But the report is also
sharply critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has in
recent weeks called for the complete isolation of Savimbi and the
withdrawal of the United Nations so that fighting can resume
uninterrupted, the report says. Similar threats to broaden attacks
are being made by Unita, the Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been attacking civilian populations and sowing
additional land mines in one of the most heavily mined countries in
the world. More than 500,000 people have been driven from their
houses in the last year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Unita and the governing party, the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, have been fighting since 1975. That year the
country became independent through a political revolution in
Portugal, the colonial power in Angola. Until the end of the Cold
War Unita had Western _ particularly American _ backing, and the
Popular Movement was aided by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Russia, the United States and Portugal have been
working collectively to foster peace efforts. Russia has 100 troops
in Angola, Portugal 40 and the United States none.
</P>
<P>
   The government, Annan wrote, has created a ``negative public
atmosphere'' toward the United Nations. Its civilian police force
and local self-defense militias act as adjuncts to the
party-dominated national army, not as neutral enforcers of law or
protectors of the population. Human rights work has become
impossible in many places.
</P>
<P>
   The low international price of oil, mismanagement by a one-party
government and endless fighting have ruined the economy, U.N.
officials say. Social indicators, in a country awash in diamonds
and oil, are plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate effects of the war have been the increasing
levels of malnutrition, especially among young children, and
appalling sanitation and health conditions,'' the report says.
``The risk of epidemics has grown dramatically, especially in the
war-affected areas, where the number of vulnerable persons is
increasing rapidly with little access to health care and
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   In some areas the population is already living off stockpiled
food, with little hope of new U.N. deliveries, the
secretary-general said, adding, ``The humanitarian situation in
Angola, already critical, has the potential to develop into a
full-scale catastrophe.''

QUIETLY, CHINESE OFFICIALS MUFFLE SOME LIBERAL WRITERS AND
PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As they very publicly send the most outspoken
democracy campaigners to prison, China's leaders have also quietly
tightened the screws on liberal intellectuals, journalists and
publications.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks the Communist Party's powerful Department
of Propaganda has closed down an influential book publisher in
Beijing and an adventurous newspaper in the southern city of
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   It has sent stern warnings to some magazines and newspapers that
strayed too far from the prescribed line, forced some editors and
writers out of their jobs and halted distribution of several books
that delve into political alternatives or embarrassing episodes in
the history of Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign reflects the leadership's concern for stability as
it confronts rising unemployment and protests by workers and
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials may also be worried about dissent related to the 10th
anniversary this June of the violent smashing of pro-democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and the 50th anniversary on Oct.
1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, liberals who want more open discussion of
political alternatives have been testing the limits of public
discourse. But in recent interviews, many scholars, magazine
editors and journalists said they now sensed a shrinking of the
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some writings and meetings that are relatively
free by China's standards continue, and none of those interviewed
said they believed that China was in the throes of an all-out
crackdown or a major shift in policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since many books, magazines and newspapers touch on sensitive
topics these days, the repressive measures to date seem almost
arbitrary. They have not been mentioned in the press here. But word
spreads quickly, and the authorities may hope that by setting
examples they will induce others to exercise new caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be a general crackdown on liberal
intellectuals,'' said one such scholar, Liu Junning, a political
theorist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and editor of
a journal on political thought. ``But they may tighten up on
publications, making it more difficult for people to get their
ideas out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some intellectuals interviewed said that in today's China, with
burgeoning outlets for publishing, so many intellectuals chafing to
explore new ideas and so many eager readers, the government
probably lacked the ability to suppress debate altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent setbacks, writers could not directly
discuss multiparty politics or the possibility of ending the
Communist Party's monopoly on power. Still, the last year has been
a relatively loose period, with more books frankly discussing
issues like corruption, crime, the effects of different economic
strategies and _ in a guarded, theoretical way _ the nature of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Such books, in turn, have served as the basis for seminars at
universities and bookstores. Only a small number of those books
that the government sees as most objectionable have been directly
curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers and magazines around the country have explored
similar topics and exposed local corruption or policy failures.
</P>
<P>
   The publications campaign is directed by the party's Department
of Propaganda, under the leadership of Ding Guangen, a onetime
bridge partner of the late leader Deng Xiaoping who has become
President Jiang Zemin's chief ideological enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   A joke that plays on the elements of Ding's name has been
circulating among intellectuals, who say he has a talent for three
things: ``ding,'' which can mean ``keeping watch,'' ``guan,'' which
can mean ``closing down'' and ``gen,'' which can mean ``rooting
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most far-reaching act was the suspension in early
January of operations of one of China's boldest and most
influential book publishers pending ``rectification'' of the staff.
Two top editors at the company, China Today Publishers, have been
ordered to write self-criticisms _ a time-honored Communist
technique for forcing wayward individuals to acknowledge
ideological errors _ according to people familiar with the
situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   China Today Publishers, based in Beijing and operating under the
authority of an information unit of the Communist Party, issued
several of last year's most widely discussed books including
``China's Pitfall,'' a withering analysis of corruption in the
dismantling of state enterprises; ``Crossed Swords,'' a strong
attack on the remaining opponents of the country's move toward a
market economy and looser social control, and ``Political China,''
a collection of essays on political change by scholars and former
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Political China,'' which quickly sold out its
first printing of 30,000 last fall, authorities forbade a second
printing. But other books from the publisher have not been
similarly quashed.
</P>
<P>
   Several books recently issued by other publishers, including
volumes of political essays or memoirs of past ideological battles,
have been restricted, usually by barring new printings and
distribution or, in some cases, book reviews.
</P>
<P>
   So far at least, the suppression of liberal writing is not
universal. Liu, the political theorist, edits a journal of
political thought called Res Publica. The newest issue of the
journal, which has a circulation of 10,000, contains essays
exploring the difference between direct and indirect democracy. Liu
said he had not heard any official complaints.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other small journals and magazines explore
once-heretical political and economic ideas, including one that has
just appeared in the southern province of Guangdong called Reading
Tour. Its maiden issue includes articles with titles such as
``Freedom of Thought and Democratic Politics'' and ``The Loneliness
of the Dissident,'' and an essay by the late, anti-Communist
philosopher Isaiah Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But a highbrow Beijing journal called Way, which under its
mandate for exploration of the natural and social sciences has
carried adventuresome articles on politics and society, is under
sharp pressure from the authorities, who have told its editors to
stick to more scientific subjects or close down, according to
people who have written for the journal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Feng Xiaozhe, the editorial director
of Way, which has a monthly circulation of 20,000, would only say:
``We have not received any official, written complaint from the
Department of Propaganda.'' In the absence of a formal complaint,
he said, the journal would continue with its efforts to promote
``cross-disciplinary inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, more than 40 of the journal's editors, authors and
supporters met to discuss the challenge, according to a participant
in the meeting. While the group, including some eminent scientists,
endorsed its current direction, the editors did say future issues
of the publication would include more articles related to science.
Whether this will satisfy the authorities is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been especially concerned about some newspapers
in the southern province of Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong and
has a more advanced market economy and generally more freewheeling
attitudes than most of China.
</P>
<P>
   An adventurous weekly, Cultural Times, published under the
auspices of the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences and
distributed in major cities around China, was shut down by
authorities on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the authorities ordered the firing of the chief
editor and other senior leaders of another Guangzhou newspaper, the
Guangzhou-Hong Kong Information Daily. A Communist Party circular
said the paper, which concentrated on economic news, had interfered
with the work of the country by overly critical reporting on
economic goals and other issues, according to an account in the
Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao.
</P>
<P>
   A nationally prominent weekly from Guangzhou, Southern Weekend,
which has a reputation for writing about ignored social
controversies, has also felt the government's sting. Authorities
have ordered the paper to discipline some editors and writers and
to dismiss a regular columnist who had written about corrupt and
incompetent officials, journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the affected scholars said this week, ``We'll be
trying in every way possible to keep writing and publishing and
discussing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public demand is huge'' for new ideas about politics and
economics, he said, ``and the supply is limited.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The compressed calendar of presidential primaries
has set off a competitive frenzy among Republican and Democratic
contenders who believe that they must begin _ almost immediately _
to raise money or they may find it impossible to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this year is more crucial than 2000 in determining
whom the two parties will nominate. That is because the survival of
candidates, until next winter when issues and personal appeal may
be noticed, depends on one practical fact: who has enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who do not start collecting the $20 million to $25
million that a primary will require _ that amounts to $55,000 to
$70,000 a day, seven days a week by the end of the year _ may find
it difficult to wage a full-fledged campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates may no longer enjoy the luxury of scoring an upset
early in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary and using
that victory to raise money to keep their campaigns alive for
another round of contests.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping his fingers for effect, Mel Sembler, the national
finance chairman of the Republican Party and a 20-year veteran of
presidential campaign fund-raising, said: ``It's going to be quick.
Keep your eyes on the guys, or gals, who can raise the money
because those are going to be your serious, viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   While some candidates have not broken stride since Election Day
1996, the maneuvering has grown especially intense since the start
of the year. Several candidates have declared themselves in or out
or announced the creation of skeletal political committees. Behind
the scenes, they are engaged in bidding wars to recruit strategists
and scrambling for people to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vice President Al Gore, who for years had refused to
acknowledge his desire to succeed President Clinton _ and had been
particularly careful to appear loyal during the impeachment inquiry
_ announced that he has formed a campaign organization. Even though
he dominates the Democratic field, Gore's advisers said he could
not wait any longer to begin soliciting contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost an irrational gold rush with these guys,'' said
Mike Murphy, a Republican media consultant. ``It's like you get a
prize if you announce by the end of January.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the first votes will not be cast for 12 months, the
contenders are jumpy for good reason. The campaign laws require
that the money they raise be collected in individual amounts of no
more than $1,000 _ a daunting, if not impossible, task for most
candidates. The goal of each candidate is to raise $10 million more
than the top goal set in the 1996 primary. Almost all of the
candidates are expected to abide by the overall federal spending
limits of about $45 million, which will allow them to collect
federal campaign subsidies next year based on how much they raise
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the candidates must come up with their own money in a
hurry is because with California, New York and other large states
seeking more influence by moving up the dates of their primaries
and caucuses to early March, nearly two-thirds of the national
convention delegates could be selected by the end of that month _
traditionally the time when primaries just get going. Never before
have so many contests been bunched so closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys out there running, they don't have a lot of time,''
said Kelly Guesnier, a Republican fund-raising consultant who has
yet to sign up with anyone. ``They need to get out there and
hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, who is assembling a campaign organization for Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, said: ``The jockeying is white-hot intense. In
states like Iowa and New Hampshire the retail element is critical _
as is landing someone who knows all the important bits of
information, like what fish fry to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field is roughly the size of the one in 1988, the
last time no incumbent president was running.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas is the early favorite in the polls despite some lingering
uncertainty that he will actually make the race. But the surprising
moves by Elizabeth Hanford Dole and Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who said in recent days that they would begin assembling campaign
operations, demonstrated that the race was not being conceded to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the circle of Democratic prospects is shrinking,
which is good news for Gore. For more than two years he has been
quietly assembling an organizational juggernaut that his advisers
hoped would scare off rivals. Thus far, the only other prominent
Democrat who clearly intends to run is former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, who this week announced a full-fledged campaign
committee. Two senators who had been viewed as possible candidates,
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, announced
recently that they would not take on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And advisers to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House
Democratic leader who for two years had been energetically building
a possible campaign organization, said he was increasingly inclined
to stay in the House.
</P>
<P>
   They said he began rethinking his plans after the Democrats
performed better than expected in the November election. Gephardt
would almost certainly become speaker if Democrats win back the
House next year. Already, Gephardt has sent top operatives who were
working on his possible presidential bid to jobs on the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, whose goal is to elect more
Democrats to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Once the primary contests begin, the rapid-fire calendar could
put a premium on candidates who had defined themselves _ and their
positions _ early. The danger is that the schedule could give
voters less opportunity to get to know and evaluate the
contestants. ``Chances are the Republicans are going to have to
chose someone whom the public does not yet know intimately,'' said
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``We're going to wake up with
someone whom we only just met.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is preparing to run
himself, agreed that the dash to the nomination might be too hasty.
``It probably would be better to have time for everyone to reflect
after you've had a primary,'' he said. ``But it's wishful thinking
on my part that it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For a year or so, the maneuvering of prospects has taken place
under the shadow of the White House scandal, which has drawn most
of the press coverage. But Gore's advisers said they believed that
the president's troubles had actually helped the vice president
politically because no other Democrat has been able to break
through and draw great attention.
</P>
<P>
   And they said Democrats who take on Gore now risk looking as if
they are taking on the president while the party faithful rally
behind him. The risk, of course, for Gore is that Clinton's
troubles will ultimately tarnish the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Roy Romer, the Democratic Party's general chairman, had
to concede the obvious: ``It's clear that Al Gore is a very strong
front-runner. Very clear.'' Romer, who by party tradition is
supposed to stay neutral, quickly added a caveat, ``But it is
early.''

   For months, many Republicans have touted Bush as the leading
candidate, although he is untested nationally. He is in a
commanding position because he is a popular chief executive in a
large state, places at the top of the polls and can tap into the
connections of his father, former President George Bush. Bush has
been coy about his intentions, even as his advisers have in recent
weeks been quietly contacting people about raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the announcements of Mrs. Dole and McCain that they plan to
take the first steps to assembling campaigns underscores that not
all Republicans are willing to cede the field. Mrs. Dole, a
two-time Cabinet secretary who is stepping down as president of the
American Red Cross, and McCain, a popular war hero, could draw from
moderates inclined toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Republican strategist, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Bush's advisers were ``thrilled beyond words''
about Mrs. Dole's move because it takes pressure off him as the
front-runner and tamps down expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy, the Republican media consultant, disagreed, saying:
``In a fantasyland they're keeping expectations low. The
expectations are there. The game has already begun for him. It's
the price of being the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate whose financial prowess is undeniable is Steve
Forbes, the magazine publisher who plans to dip into his own
fortune to pay for his campaign and forgo the limits on spending
for candidates who accept federal subsidies. While Forbes is viewed
by Republicans as a top-tier contender because of his financial
wherewithal, he is also potent because he has run before, in 1996,
and has successfully courted conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate from 1996 who never stopped running is former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Alexander is a disciplined
candidate who already has strong organizations in Iowa and New
Hampshire. But he may draw from the same base of support as Bush,
Mrs. Dole and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican actively preparing a campaign is Gary Bauer,
the head of the Family Research Council, who has never served in
public office. He is expected to compete with Quayle for support of
religious conservatives.
</P>

<P>
   Kasich, the House Budget Committee chairman hopes that his
energetic and youthful image will catapult him to the top. Pat
Buchanan, the conservative columnist who ran in 1992 and 1996, may
also try again, as may former Gov. Pete Wilson of California. Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire, another conservative, also plans to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri announced last week that he was
not running. He did so even though he had gained the most ground in
the last year, elevating himself from being considered a hopeless
long shot to becoming a favorite of religious conservatives. But he
was still a long shot and feared losing his Senate seat in 2000 if
he was not nominated for president.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley, who is preparing to take on
Gore, announced a full-fledged campaign committee this week. But
while he was a respected senator and brings star appeal as a former
professional basketball player, he has kept a relatively low
profile in recent months and it is far from clear whether Bradley
can compete financially.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts is also seriously considering a
bid. He could tap into the fortune of his wife, Teresa Heinz,
although he has said he would not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, who has run twice before, also said he was
weighing a run; he might carry particular appeal to liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising money and assembling staffs, candidates are
trying to figure out how they will pace themselves; with the
primary set for March 7 in California and New York, they can no
longer simply concentrate on Iowa and New Hampshire. Some
politicians say those states will be even more important because of
the shortened primary season; others say they will be overshadowed
by larger states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for California to make New Hampshire
even more important,'' said Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a
Democrat. ``One of the lessons to me about the primary process is
to be careful of unintended consequences. Trying to manipulate the
process to benefit certain ends does not always turn out the way
you expect it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1988, said he could not fathom trying to
campaign simultaneously in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least when I ran, it was a one-hour difference with Iowa
and New Hampshire,'' he said of the time zone. For candidates in
2000, Dukakis said, ``sleep patterns are going to be badly
disrupted _ I'll tell you that.''

   NEW YORK _ A dictatorial mastermind. A global crime syndicate.
Enemies dispatched in a supposed ``health clinic.'' These are among
the elements of ``Barrabas,'' the restored silent film masterpiece
that will unspool for nearly seven and a half hours beginning at
12:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art. Made in 1919 by the
pioneering Louis Feuillade, whose early works included such
fantasies as ``Judex,'' ``Fantomas'' and ``Les Vampires,'' this
film is a 12-part serial restored by Gaumont, the French studio
that produced it 80 years ago for weekly release. ``Barrabas'' will
be shown in a single session only once, but the first five episodes
will be shown at 2:30 p.m. Jan. 30 and the last seven at 2:30 the
next day.

   And the winner is ``Ulysses.'' That's the decision of the 47
literary critics and writers asked by the British bookseller
Waterstone's to choose 10 essential classic novels from any century
that were likely to survive the next millennium. Finishing in a tie
for second to James Joyce's masterwork (which was banned in Britain
in its early days) were ``The Great Gatsby'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald
and ``Remembrance of Things Past'' by Marcel Proust. These were
followed by Virginia Woolf's ``To the Lighthouse'' and Orwell's
``1984.'' In the bookshop's ``Test of Time,'' works by writers like
Ernest Hemingway, Evelyn Waugh and D.H. Lawrence fared better than
those by Charles Dickens or Jonathan Swift.

   NEW YORK _ The eminent Victorians cast their spell once more,
beginning Tuesday at the Dahesh Museum at Fifth Avenue and 48th

Albert Moore, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Landseer, an
exhibition titled ``A Victorian Salon: Paintings From the
Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth, England'' opens
a run through April 17. These works, drawn from the collection of
Merton Russell-Cotes, a wealthy hotelier and patron of the arts,
include examples of Pre-Raphaelite, neo-classical, Social Realist
and Esthetic Art, as well as local landscapes and Orientalist
depictions of distant sites.

   In the latest chapter of the long-running battle over the Elgin
marbles, Greek officials claimed a victory Monday. The source of
their elation was a petition signed by 339 of the 626 members of
the European Parliament urging Britain to return the 2,500-year-old
collection of figures, which were part of a frieze that adorned the
Parthenon on the Acropolis. Next month the Parliament is expected
to ratify the petition formally. But it carries no legal authority
to force Britain to return the marbles, which bear the name of Lord
Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire who removed
them to England in 1806. Britain has consistently rejected appeals
for their return.

   NEW YORK _ Finally, here come fashionable shoes designed to be
comfortable. The innovation combines the technology of athletic
shoes with the styling of dress shoes. Molded bottoms of rubberized
synthetic materials that conform to the contours of the foot are
combined with uppers of leather or fabric, resulting in shoes that
are dressy enough to be worn at the office, and maybe even out to
dinner.

STATE OF UNION TALK TO SHOW CLINTON PLANS TO REMAIN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, MARK HELM And DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, focusing on kitchen-table issues
rather than impeachment, on Monday readied a State of the Union
address that maps middle-of-the-road proposals to appeal to
traditional Democratic constituencies and Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hoped to use the speech to show he plans to finish out
his presidency with forward-looking initiatives aimed at winning
support from women, suburbanites, minorities, the elderly and union
members as well as and the more conservative armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to deliver his annual address to a
joint meeting of the House and Senate at 9 p.m. EST Tuesday, just
hours after White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff opens Clinton's
three-day defense in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in
trying to cover up a sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insisted that Clinton will not mention his
impeachment as he tries to set the nation's agenda as a lame-duck
president halfway through his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will become the first elected chief executive in
American history to address the House and Senate in the face of
impeachment and possible removal on a two-thirds vote by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton looked
forward to speaking to the American people and dismissed
suggestions that the president would be uncomfortable speaking
before a GOP-led House that voted two articles of impeachment
against him on Dec. 19 and a Republican-led Senate that is weighing
his conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is always comfortable when he's dealing with
issues that impact real people's lives,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will come away from the nationally televised address
seeing ``an administration that is energized and is looking forward
to moving into the 21st century with an ambitious and activist
agenda,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they hoped to keep the public focus on
Clinton's agenda with a quick trip to Buffalo, N.Y., and
Norristown, Pa., on Wednesday by the president, First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt
University, said Clinton's decision to avoid mentioning impeachment
underscores his ``assumption that he's going to remain president.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
Clinton needed to make ``some vague reference'' to impeachment or
he would appear ``somehow disconnected from what's happening.''
Rothstein added: ``He can't ignore it entirely because it would
seem like he's unaware of most important event affecting his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University,
said he expects Clinton to try to present himself as ``absolutely
buoyant'' and ``act as if impeachment never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposals Clinton will outline Tuesday night _ which
will make up the $1.8 trillion budget he submits to Congress on
Feb. 1 _ have already been leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the initiatives will include sweeping changes in
federal support for locally-controlled public education, increased
federal spending on civil rights enforcement, a boost in the
minimum wage, tax breaks for Americans providing long-term care for
family members, increased federal support for after-school programs
to help working parents, and the largest Pentagon spending increase
since 1985, containing the biggest boost in pay and benefits for
the armed forces since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to a strategy that has given Democrats a wide edge
among women voters, Clinton will lay out a nationwide effort to
hold state and local school districts accountable for the
performance of students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He will also renew his call for $4 billion in federal spending
over five years for construction of new schools to relieve
overcrowding. Clinton will ask for more than $1 billion to help pay
for the hiring of 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an $18 billion, five-year program to help working
parents take care of children, Clinton's address also outlines a
tax credit of up to $500 per child one year old or younger to add
federal support to parents who choose to stay home with their
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seeks tax breaks for Americans providing long-term care
for family members and increased federal support for after-school
programs to help working parents.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to middle-aged Baby Boomers who begin facing
retirement in 2011, Clinton will challenge Congress to devote a
projected $1.6 billion federal budget surplus over the next 10
years to bailing out the imperiled Social Security system rather
than using the money to finance GOP-backed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned fresh efforts to help the poor by seeking
additional tax breaks for companies that invest in poor urban and
rural areas. He also will ask Congress for $1 billion over five
years to improve health care for many of the nation's 32 million
uninsured adults. The administration wants Congress to boost civil
rights enforcement spending by 15 percent to $663 million in the
fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to preempt the GOP's cherished claim of being the
party that supports a strong national defense, Clinton will ask for
a $112 billion increase in Pentagon spending over the next six
years with a hike in pay and benefits for the nation's 1.4 million
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's State of the Union address and his Feb. 1 budget
submission launch a nine-month period of bargaining between the
White House and the Congress over federal spending for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He faces an uphill battle. A study of the process in 1998
released by Congressional Quarterly, a weekly magazine, found that
Clinton prevailed in only 51 percent of the 154 House and Senate
floor votes that the White House took a position on last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study ranked Clinton's sixth-year performance with Congress
lower than those of his two-term predecessors going back 46 years
to President Dwight D. Eisenhower _ even lower than President
Richard M. Nixon's in 1974, when he was forced to resign in the
Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost none of the priorities that Clinton set at the
beginning of the year became law, and few of them even got a floor
vote,'' the authoritative publication reported
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon delivered his State of the Union address to Congress
in 1974 just eight months before resigning, he said, ``The time has
come to bring that (Watergate) investigation and the other
investigations of this matter to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I want you to know that I have no intention whatever
of walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for
the people of the United States.''

BELL ATLANTIC FEELING DISCONNECTED WHEN AIRTOUCH BID FAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard being a regional Bell these days. When the regulators
are not shooting down your latest scheme for getting into the
long-distance business or opposing your merger plans, your powerful
unions might be threatening to strike or some upstart
telecommunications wunderkind is breaking up a promising deal.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much summed up the feelings of executives at the
Bell Atlantic Corp. Monday after finishing second with their bid to
acquire Airtouch Communications Inc. Instead of creating the
world's largest wireless communications carrier with a strong base
in the Northeast, they watched Airtouch announce at a news
conference in London that it was joining forces with Vodafone Group
PLC, Britain's biggest wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment and frustration have become recurring themes in
the evolution of the local phone companies _ the remaining Bells
spun off in the break-up of AT&AMP;T, and the GTE Corp. Even as many
have posted strong gains in financial performance and stock price,
and even as they have continued to reinforce their stature as some
of the nation's largest and most powerful corporations, they have
been frustrated in their most far-reaching strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the local phone titans have no reason to cry. The
seven Baby Bells that emerged from the 1984 breakup of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Co. have in the last few years merged into
five and are poised to become four. What is more, they still
control perhaps the most valuable communications asset in the
world: copper wires into almost every commercial and residential
building in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial and regulatory realities are clearly limiting
opportunities for these companies even as their ambitions expand.
What is unclear is whether those realities benefit consumers and
stockholders and whether today's fetters will adversely affect the
local phone giants' growth for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a senior regional Bell executive to name his biggest problem
and he will almost surely say regulation. The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 opened the door for the local phone companies to enter
the much-coveted long-distance market, but none has yet reached
that promised land by convincing the Federal Communications
Commission that it has fully opened its local network to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Reed Hundt, then the FCC's chairman, pulled out the
heavy rhetorical artillery in 1997 and blasted SBC Communications
for its merger talks with the AT&AMP;T Corp., the No. 1 long-distance
carrier, as ``unthinkable'' _ even before the two companies could
announce a deal. It may also be why Bell Atlantic runs into more
hurdles than it anticipates as it tries to acquire GTE, which runs
a big long-distance Internet operation called BBN.
</P>
<P>
   But if the battle for Airtouch proved anything, it was that in
mergers and acquisitions the local phone companies are held back by
their own shareholders at least as much as by regulators,
especially when the going gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. The Bells and GTE have shareholder bases dominated
by conservative investors. For years, the local phone business has
been regarded by many investors as akin to a utility. Those
shareholders are focused on dividends, which could otherwise be
reinvested in the company's operations, and a steady growth of the
bottom line, which could be diluted by big acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of conservative, steady-hand investor is fine when
everyone is in the same boat. The problem for the local phone
companies is that many of their new competitors have aggressive
shareholders who are more tolerant of dilution and more focused on
growth in revenue and cash flow. That gives the new players a lot
more financial flexibility when it comes to making deals.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, for instance, could simply afford to pay more for
Airtouch than Bell Atlantic could. Not only does Vodafone's stock
trade at a much higher multiple to earnings than Bell Atlantic's
does, but Vodafone's shareholders care less about those earnings in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost the same thing happened to GTE in 1997. After Worldcom
Inc. made an unsolicited bid to acquire the MCI Communications
Corp., breaking up MCI's deal with British Telecommunications PLC,
GTE also made its own offer.
</P>
<P>
   But GTE discovered that even as it offered cash, it just could
not win a bidding war; Worldcom continued to increase its all-stock
offer in billion-dollar increments. As a younger company with
faster growth, Worldcom could afford more dilution of its existing
shares without risking a massive selloff by investors. The fact
that Worldcom projected huge synergies from a combination with MCI
did not hurt, either. MCI is now MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Run this concept past top Bell company executives and they tend
to agree that their market profiles do not allow them the same
flexibility their newer rivals enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they almost always come back to regulation. They note
that companies like General Electric and Merck are also valued on
an earnings-per-share basis, but those companies get richer
valuations because they grow faster.
</P>
<P>
   If only the FCC would let them into the high-growth segments of
communications _ especially high-speed data _ without the
regulatory conditions they must satisfy, these executives say,
their companies could grow faster and get higher valuations for
their shares, even with the same shareholder profile.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably something to that, but it raises a thorny
question. Which is easier: persuading a new sort of investor to buy
into the local phone industry or persuading federal regulators to
buy into a new mode of regulation?

BUSH CELEBRATES MLK'S BIRTHDAY AS PART OF INAUGURAL THEME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush, preparing to deliver his
inaugural speech about ethnic inclusiveness Tuesday, said that
Martin Luther King Day and its message are for ``all Texans to
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry attended a Houston event
Monday celebrating the slain civil rights leader's birthday as part
of their inaugural theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us remember his wisdom and his legacy,'' Bush said. ``Let
us remember that compassion will overcome all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who promotes himself as a ``compassionate conservative,''
spoke to an audience of mostly children at the annual celebration
of King's birthday, sponsored by the local Black Heritage Society.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's event became an official part of Bush's
inaugural activities, which continued Monday and Tuesday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically people have viewed Martin Luther King Day as
something that only African-Americans are to celebrate,'' Bush said
at a news conference after his speech. ``That's not the way I feel.
I feel all Texans ought to celebrate Dr. King and his message.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, Bush explained, is ``judging people for what they
are, not lumping people into groups, but giving each individual a
chance to exercise their heart and soul and conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his inaugural speech will focus partly on ``what
challenges we face to make sure everybody participates'' in the
future of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was scheduled to take his oath of office, to a second
four-year term, at noon CST Tuesday in Austin. Fellow Republican
Perry, the outgoing agriculture commissioner, was to be sworn in as
lieutenant governor, replacing retiring Democrat Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that blacks voted overwhelmingly for his
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, the race is over and ``I am still going to be
everybody's governor.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said during the King
celebration that King's visit to Houston in 1958 did not draw
attention from state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, Texas has made progress by having its elected
leaders honor King's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who will preside over the state Senate, told the audience
that every day he stands in the Senate chamber, ``I can look to my
left and see a portrait of Barbara Jordan. It's a reminder of how
far Texas and America have come thanks to the work of individuals
like Martin Luther King.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan served in the state Senate before becoming the first
black in this century to be elected to a Texas congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   Years behind most other states, Texas made King's birthday a
full, official state holiday in 1991. Conservative Democrats and
Republicans in the Legislature blocked earlier bills on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday he did not know if King would have wanted him
to fight the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Hopwood case, which
was interpreted by former state Attorney General Dan Morales to
require the end of affirmative action programs in state college
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopwood case was named for Cheryl Hopwood, one of four white
plaintiffs who sued after being denied admission to the University
of Texas Law School in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bush said, he is working with legislators such as Ellis and
state Rep. Al Edwards _ African-Americans who attended the King
celebration with him _ to improve public schools and make sure that
``people from all walks of life'' apply to public universities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he hopes that Houston's Texas Southern
University, a mostly black school facing financial problems, will
remain independent from other Texas universities. The Legislature
has considered moving TSU under the administration of other
university systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin later Monday, Bush and Perry attended an inaugural
children's program, which featured martial arts and science
demonstrations and music and dance acts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who briefly addressed the youthful audience at the end of
the show, thanked them for sharing his and Perry's ``special day.''
</P>
<P>
   He also advised children to stay in school and avoid drugs and
plugged his reading initiative program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm looking at another governor. I hope there's a new
governor out there,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guess what? You'll realize you can't be governor if you
abuse drugs. So, I want to thank you all for sending a clear
message _ no drugs in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also asked how many of the children read more than
they watched television. A number raised their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the truth,'' Bush teased. ``My dream is for everybody to
be the best reader in Texas. When you read, reading is freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We wish you to be able to realize your dream. Stay
in school. Don't use drugs. Go to college. Dream the big dream, and
you can be anything you want to be in the great state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's parents, former President George Bush and Barbara Bush,
were scheduled to attend their eldest son's second swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I hope to be able to observe it,'' Bush said. ``Last
time I was so emotional I didn't pay much attention to what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Percolating in the background is Bush's pending decision on
whether to run for president in the middle of his second term. Bush
said the question is still under discussion in his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge decision, as everyone knows, and we haven't made
it yet,'' Bush's wife, Laura, told reporters. ``Right now we're
focusing on Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush's discussions about the White House contest have
reached well beyond relatives. In private sessions in the
Governor's Mansion, he has talked about the race with policy
experts, campaign financiers and legislators from other states.
Would-be campaign contributors are scheduled to meet with Bush in
Austin on Thursday, according to sources who did not want to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's inaugural ceremonies in Austin start with a private
prayer service at the First United Methodist Church near the
Governor's Mansion. Bush is a Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   The noon inauguration and speeches at the state Capitol will be
offered live to television stations statewide and can be seen on
the Internet at www.governor.state.tx.us/inauguration.html.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration will be followed by a barbecue on the Capitol
lawn before the parade up Congress Avenue. Four inaugural balls
take place in downtown Austin on Tuesday night.

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic
leader, says it ``appears to be inevitable'' that the Senate will
vote to depose witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial

hear live testimony, Daschle said, Democrats might honor any
reasonable request on whom the House prosecutors or White House
could summon, suggesting that he would encourage a drawn-out

`GEN': HOPE FOR A BAREFOOT CHILD IN A CITY SHATTERED BY THE BOMB
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A vastly ambitious autobiographical Japanese-language
musical built around the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on Aug. 6,
1945, will reach the end of its brief but meritorious
five-performance run Wednesday at the Sylvia and Danny Kaye
Playhouse at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Gen,'' this engrossing, well-acted, touching and
horrific plea for peace is based on the work of Keiji Nakazawa, a
graphic novelist and cartoonist who survived the bombing that
immediately claimed the life of his father, brother and sister,
soon killed a newborn sister and years later led to the death of
his mother from radiation.
</P>
<P>
   With Nakazawa as its author and Kyo Kijima as its adapter,
lyricist and director, ``Gen,'' a short form for
``Hadashi-no-Gen,'' or ``Barefoot Gen,'' focuses on the
impoverished family of a little boy named Gen Nakaoka (Miyuki
Tanaka). Unfolding by means of dramatic action, narration, song,
music, stylized dance, mime, documentary slides and ominous and
awesome sound effects and lighting, ``Gen'' is a complex mix.
Bitter toward a government that continued fighting when it was
clear well before the bombing that the war was lost, it is bitter
as well toward the death and suffering that the atomic bombing
inflicted on the people of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Remorseful about Japan's brutal treatment of subjugated Koreans
and about the country's military, it upholds Japanese values and
speaks through Gen's courageous father, an opponent of the war,
about the importance of standing up for one's beliefs and for
upholding the family.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the bombing itself, with its hellish flames, wailing
winds and smoke, the musical's scenes of survivors in silhouette in
procession across the stage while long strips of skin dangle from
their burned hands and of starving children tending an angry,
reeking, infected artist for a few yen to try to feed and buy
medical care for a dying infant are among many that have immense
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this reflection on the end of World War II in the Pacific
from the vantage point of more than half a century is suffused with
hope. Children were told that nothing would grow in Hiroshima for
70 years. But, as Gen discovers, in the midst of death there is
life.
</P>
<P>
   For those who speak no Japanese, individual earphones transmit a
helpful translation of the one-hour-40-minute intermissionless
performance, which was powerful and intriguing despite the absence
of the production's normal sets, costumes and props, stranded by
snow in Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative publisher  &UR; Mike Antonucci  &LR; wishes to add something
to last week's item about  &UR; President Clinton &LR; 's crossword wizardry:
A 1993 story that ran in the Boston Herald said the president at
least occasionally used an aide to call the New York Times'
crossword answer line. Suspecting that Clinton used the line
routinely, early in the day, and then filled in the puzzle _
quickly, with answers he already knew _ so as to dazzle visitors,
Antonucci challenged the president to a puzzle-off.
</P>
<P>
   Antonucci forwards a copy of a March 1994 letter from the White
House declining his offer. It is signed by the aide that the Boston
newspaper had named as the answer-retriever, who the White House
says is now working at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>

SASSA, HERZOG TAKES CABLE SMARTS TO NETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For two guys with so much in common, Scott Sassa
and Doug Herzog couldn't be more different.
</P>
<P>
   Both were named the entertainment president of a major network
late in 1998. Both are 39 and made their names as cable television
executives. They even moved into the same swanky Los Angeles hotel
before finding a permanent West Coast residence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's scrape below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, the president of NBC Entertainment, is a business
suit-wearing numbers-cruncher who is running a network on the
downswing. He took the press through an array of charts and graphs,
clicking from one to another with a high-tech remote control at the
Television Critics Association Press Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced Warren Littlefield, who ran NBC Entertainment for
nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Herzog. The president of the Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
entertainment division, met the press with an open collar and a few
jokes. His presentation was low-tech; the only graphics he used
were cardboard signs that said such things as ``Fresh Meat'' and
``Human Target,'' and during a later press conference he sat in the
back of the room tossing a Nerf football.
</P>
<P>
   Few in recent years have survived longer than three years in the
position he now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa and Herzog's lives are parallel yet divergent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Scott and I would make a great team,'' Herzog
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two have known each other since the beginning of the '80s.
And Herzog once worked for Sassa _ for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa tabbed Herzog to work for him at Turner's Cable Music
Channel in 1984, when Turner was eager to take a run at MTV. Herzog
was 25, and the job was paying $75,000, plus a car.
</P>
<P>
   MTV also wanted him and offered him a spot back in New York to
start up its news division for $40,000 a year and no car.
</P>
<P>
   After an excruciating week of playing the pros and cons game,
Herzog decided to accept Sassa's offer.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was urged to have breakfast with MTV co-founder Bob
Pittman at the Hotel Bel-Air. After some persuasion and another
$10,000 in salary, Herzog made a 180-degree turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cable Music Channel was on the air a month, and it crashed
and burned,'' Herzog said. ``Scott called me and said I made the
right decision. He understood. I think MTV was trying to hire him
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   They have both come a long way from the days in the early 1980s,
when Herzog booked appearances for a late-night talk show and Sassa
escorted guests to the show as part of his job with a publicity
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The two cable guys are now jumping into the network game, a
trickier gig than ever, precisely because of the cable world they
helped create.
</P>
<P>
   Now the network strategy is not to serve one well-defined
segment of the viewing audience but to satisfy as many as possible,
particularly those between the ages of 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Sassa's made his first big stir by announcing his
intent to broaden the network's fare beyond shows about single
people in New York on the hunt for casual sex.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Sassa's comments about sexual content created the
biggest stir.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sex is used in a smart way, it works out OK,'' he said.
``In some cases, sometimes, I think we could use a few more words
between `Hello' and `Would you sleep with me?' So we need to figure
out how to use sex appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The new reach for balance and broader portrayals leads Sassa to
this conclusion: tell stories about traditional families, set shows
in places other than New York and diversify the casts.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he has any plans to get rid of the ``Friends''
image _ single, New York, casual sex _ that brought NBC a devoted
viewing audience on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to create a family channel here,'' said
Sassa, who will be promoted to head of NBC's West Coast operation
after Don Ohlmeyer retires later this year. ``I'm just making the
observation about balance, that we need to be balanced about what
we show, and we need to move the pendulum back a little bit more
toward these values.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at Fox, Herzog has his own agenda to promote _ that is,
more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   His broad goals are to build on the brand that Fox has made for
itself, much in the way that he built an identity at Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I bring to the job _ from the cable world _ is a
keen sense of branding. Fox has got a brand, maybe _ or arguably _
the best brand in broadcast television. And so I want to evolve the
brand, and I want to strengthen the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is that brand? ``Adventurous,'' ``edgy'' and ``in
certain cases, experimental,'' Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox is doing it,'' he said, ``it should mean that ABC, NBC,
CBS, whomever, aren't doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got his bases covered in the animation department. None of
the major networks can claim to have as many hyped animated shows
as Fox, with a midseason lineup filled with such shows as ``The
PJs,'' ``Family Guy'' and ``Futurama.'' They join the established
``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation is familiar territory for Herzog, whose main success
at Comedy Central was with animated shows such as ``South Park''
and ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist.''
</P>
<P>
   But one genre new to Herzog will be developing live-action
sitcoms, something Fox hasn't been able to do consistently for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's daunting,'' he said. ``It's all very daunting.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative publisher  &UR; Mike Antonucci  &LR; wishes to add something
to last week's item about  &UR; President Clinton &LR; 's crossword wizardry:
A 1993 story that ran in the Boston Herald said the president at
least occasionally used an aide to call the New York Times'
crossword answer line. Suspecting that Clinton used the line
routinely, early in the day, and then filled in the puzzle _
quickly, with answers he already knew _ so as to dazzle visitors,
Antonucci challenged the president to a puzzle-off.
</P>
<P>
   Antonucci forwards a copy of a March 1994 letter from the White
House declining his offer. It is signed by the aide that the Boston
newspaper had named as the answer-retriever, who the White House
says is now working at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   White House press aide  &UR; Roger Salazar &LR;  said that the president
does crossword puzzles all the time, and ``just like anyone else,
when he's stumped, he'll ask for help. But for anyone to suggest
that he's cheating is a seven-letter word for lunch meat.''

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sitting in New York last year, two ambitious
young Turks plotted a return to their homeland and wondered what
they would do once they got back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rafi told me he wanted to open a bagel shop, I started
laughing, because I had come up with the same idea,'' one of them,
Hikmet Ongan, said during a break from serving customers on a
recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ongan, 27, and his business partner, Rafi Karako, 30, opened
Istanbul's first bagel cafe in November. It is already thriving.
The cafe's neighborhood, called Yenikoy, is home to many
foreigners, and dozens of them have become regular customers. But
about 80 percent of the patrons are Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Most who come to the cafe enjoy the bagels, which few have ever
tasted before. They often comment on the coffee, which is rich and
flavorful, not like the watery instant to which they are accustomed
or the potent brew served in tiny cups as an after-dinner drink.
</P>
<P>
   But neither a bagel nor coffee is the main attraction at the
cafe, which is called Tribeca. Nor are the muffins, the brownies or
the cappuccino cheesecake. Ongan and Karako are selling something
that they believe is even more irresistible. They are selling
America, a product that is becoming ever more popular here.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribeca cafe is hardly the only sign of growing American
influence in Turkey. Moviegoers flock not just to Hollywood epics
and animated features, but also to quirky films like ``The Big
Lebowski,'' which recently completed a long run. Multiplex movie
theaters have begun sprouting in big cities, and a new one opened
in Istanbul on Friday with features including ``Meet Joe Black''
and ``The Mask of Zorro.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food outlets led by McDonald's and Burger King are part of
many Turks' daily lives. In one Istanbul neighborhood, a Burger
King opened a few months ago just as a store next door that
specialized in stuffed grape leaves and other Turkish specialties
closed. Doughnuts have arrived in the form of three Dunkin' Donuts
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Christmas season, more shop windows than ever
were decorated with holiday designs, and almost every shopping mall
featured visits from Santa Claus. This was despite the fact that
about 99 percent of Turks are Muslims, although many are highly
secular.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Istanbul Jazz Festival has become a magnet for
audiences hungry for American music. This year's scheduled
performers include Santana, John Lee Hooker and Grover Washington
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Hollywood, America is becoming the official culture
of the whole world,'' Ongan said at Tribeca. ``Maybe people in
other countries don't understand what a bagel is, but they saw
Bruce Willis eating one in `Die Hard' so they want to eat the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of cops came in here the other day, and we gave them
some coffee to take out in a paper cup, with a lid on top. They had
never had that before. They looked at each other for a minute, they
looked at the cups in their hands, and then one of them said: `Wow!
Just like N.Y.P.D. Blue'!
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Turkey will stay Turkey. France will stay France. But that
American daily culture will become the world culture because
Hollywood is so powerful. It is a huge power.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Tribeca evokes the United States. Framed
photos of the Manhattan skyline hang on the walls. The ceiling is
high with exposed beams. Behind a glass counter sit baskets of
poppy seed bagels, sesame bagels, cinnamon bagels and, in a
concession to local tastes, black olive bagels. Sixties tunes play
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   There are even plans for ``Seinfeld Nights,'' at which patrons
will be able to watch video reruns of the television show that came
to represent New York in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brady, a 28-year-old American architect who moved to
Istanbul two years ago, is a regular customer at Tribeca. She stops
in most mornings on her way to work for two mocha coffees and two
bagels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but the place feels typically
American,'' Ms. Brady said. ``The bagels are very good, better than
any I've ever had outside of Boston or New York. The only thing
that's missing is those refillable car mugs. I'll have to bring one
back from Starbucks next time I'm in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is full of teahouses, kebab houses, nightclubs where folk
music is played until dawn, and every variety of restaurant. But
the cafe where no alcohol is served, where one lingers over good
coffee and reads a newspaper or talks with friends, is something
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Turkish style, like going to a kebab place,'' said
Asli Aslan, a young Turkish woman who sat with her friend at
Tribeca on a recent afternoon. ``I think I'll be coming here a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Turk, however, has surrendered to the trend. ``It's
true that we are becoming very, very Americanized,'' said Gulser
Cetin, owner of a Turkish restaurant near the Tribeca cafe. ``But I
sense that the desire to eat Turkish and Ottoman food is slowly
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ongan, who earned a degree in business administration at Fordham
University, and Karako, who worked for a Turkish-owned textile
concern in New York, have no intention of stopping where they are.
They plan to open a second Tribeca next month, and are scouting
locations for more than a dozen others. There are also plans for a
catering service and home delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends in New York all had full-time jobs, but they also
worked out, saw every new movie, had girlfriends and went to
restaurants,'' Ongan said. ``They were doing everything at the same
time. People don't do that here, but they have an idea that there's
a lifestyle like that in America. The common culture is
convenience. That's the style and the image we're selling.''

STATE OF UNION TALK TO SHOW CLINTON PLANS TO REMAIN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: DELETES 6th graf beginning Clinton will become...)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, MARK HELM And DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, focusing on kitchen-table issues
rather than impeachment, on Monday readied a State of the Union
address that maps middle-of-the-road proposals to appeal to
traditional Democratic constituencies and Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hoped to use the speech to show he plans to finish out
his presidency with forward-looking initiatives aimed at winning
support from women, suburbanites, minorities, the elderly and union
members as well as and the more conservative armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to deliver his annual address to a
joint meeting of the House and Senate at 9 p.m. EST Tuesday, just
hours after White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff opens Clinton's
three-day defense in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in
trying to cover up a sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insisted that Clinton will not mention his
impeachment as he tries to set the nation's agenda as a lame-duck
president halfway through his second term.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton looked
forward to speaking to the American people and dismissed
suggestions that the president would be uncomfortable speaking
before a GOP-led House that voted two articles of impeachment
against him on Dec. 19 and a Republican-led Senate that is weighing
his conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is always comfortable when he's dealing with
issues that impact real people's lives,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will come away from the nationally televised address
seeing ``an administration that is energized and is looking forward
to moving into the 21st century with an ambitious and activist
agenda,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they hoped to keep the public focus on
Clinton's agenda with a quick trip to Buffalo, N.Y., and
Norristown, Pa., on Wednesday by the president, First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt
University, said Clinton's decision to avoid mentioning impeachment
underscores his ``assumption that he's going to remain president.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
Clinton needed to make ``some vague reference'' to impeachment or
he would appear ``somehow disconnected from what's happening.''
Rothstein added: ``He can't ignore it entirely because it would
seem like he's unaware of most important event affecting his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University,
said he expects Clinton to try to present himself as ``absolutely
buoyant'' and ``act as if impeachment never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposals Clinton will outline Tuesday night _ which
will make up the $1.8 trillion budget he submits to Congress on
Feb. 1 _ have already been leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the initiatives will include sweeping changes in
federal support for locally-controlled public education, increased
federal spending on civil rights enforcement, a boost in the
minimum wage, tax breaks for Americans providing long-term care for
family members, increased federal support for after-school programs
to help working parents, and the largest Pentagon spending increase
since 1985, containing the biggest boost in pay and benefits for
the armed forces since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to a strategy that has given Democrats a wide edge
among women voters, Clinton will lay out a nationwide effort to
hold state and local school districts accountable for the
performance of students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He will also renew his call for $4 billion in federal spending
over five years for construction of new schools to relieve
overcrowding. Clinton will ask for more than $1 billion to help pay
for the hiring of 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an $18 billion, five-year program to help working
parents take care of children, Clinton's address also outlines a
tax credit of up to $500 per child one year old or younger to add
federal support to parents who choose to stay home with their
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seeks tax breaks for Americans providing long-term care
for family members and increased federal support for after-school
programs to help working parents.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to middle-aged Baby Boomers who begin facing
retirement in 2011, Clinton will challenge Congress to devote a
projected $1.6 billion federal budget surplus over the next 10
years to bailing out the imperiled Social Security system rather
than using the money to finance GOP-backed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned fresh efforts to help the poor by seeking
additional tax breaks for companies that invest in poor urban and
rural areas. He also will ask Congress for $1 billion over five
years to improve health care for many of the nation's 32 million
uninsured adults. The administration wants Congress to boost civil
rights enforcement spending by 15 percent to $663 million in the
fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to preempt the GOP's cherished claim of being the
party that supports a strong national defense, Clinton will ask for
a $112 billion increase in Pentagon spending over the next six
years with a hike in pay and benefits for the nation's 1.4 million
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's State of the Union address and his Feb. 1 budget
submission launch a nine-month period of bargaining between the
White House and the Congress over federal spending for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He faces an uphill battle. A study of the process in 1998
released by Congressional Quarterly, a weekly magazine, found that
Clinton prevailed in only 51 percent of the 154 House and Senate
floor votes that the White House took a position on last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study ranked Clinton's sixth-year performance with Congress
lower than those of his two-term predecessors going back 46 years
to President Dwight D. Eisenhower _ even lower than President
Richard M. Nixon's in 1974, when he was forced to resign in the
Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost none of the priorities that Clinton set at the
beginning of the year became law, and few of them even got a floor
vote,'' the authoritative publication reported
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon delivered his State of the Union address to Congress
in 1974 just eight months before resigning, he said, ``The time has
come to bring that (Watergate) investigation and the other
investigations of this matter to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I want you to know that I have no intention whatever
of walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for
the people of the United States.''

HEALTH INSURANCE PRICE INCREASES HIT SMALL BUSINESSES HARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Optional trims indicated throughout.) 
(fe) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the notice came in December that his company's
health insurance premiums were going up 22 percent, Jonathan South
knew what he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   South, the office manager for a small Manhattan company that
makes costumes for Broadway shows, dropped the plan with Cigna
Health Care, one that allowed employees to go to doctors out of the
network and would now have cost the company $241 per employee each
month, and signed the company up for a plain vanilla health
maintenance plan offered by Aetna, at a cost of $179 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Eric Winterling Inc., also cut its contribution to
its employees' premiums from 50 percent to 25 percent. Half of the
15 full-time employees chose to go without insurance, South said.
</P>
<P>
   While all U.S. businesses _ and in many cases, their employees _
are facing some of the steepest price increases for health
insurance in almost 10 years, small businesses are feeling the
worst of it, insurance experts and business owners say.
</P>
<P>
   For small employers, the increases have led to tough decisions
about whether to absorb the higher costs, pass them on to employees
or not offer benefits at all. The problem is particularly
pronounced in New York, where several factors combine to make the
increases even less palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly small businesses are getting whacked,'' said Elliott
Shaw, the director of government affairs for the New York State
Business Council. ``Unlike in the '80s, when everyone had the same
experiences, in the last six months larger employers have been able
to keep their increases at inflation, and small businesses are
seeing double digits.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, insurance prices for businesses with more than 100
employees rose about 6 percent on average around the country,
experts said, while small businesses are facing increases in the
range of 10 percent to 13 percent, with more increases expected.
The New York State Insurance Department is considering requests
from several companies for rate increases for small businesses
ranging from 7 percent to more than 600 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, where small businesses employ more than half
the state's work force, there are deeper implications than simply
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of doing business, especially in New York City, is
significantly higher than in other areas, making increases all the
more painful. Further, New York has the most stringent form of
community rating _ businesses with fewer than 50 employees are
subject to prices set by geographic area _ giving small businesses
no negotiating power with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most gravely, New York's uninsured population is far higher than
the country's average _ 28 percent versus 17 percent _ and
employees who become priced out of the market may end up adding to
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago small businesses were among the most vociferous
opponents of President Clinton's failed health plan, arguing that
if they were forced to offer health insurance benefits to
employees, many would go broke. But some analysts argue that the
Clinton plan would probably have led to more uniform rates, easing
the economic strain that small companies are now facing.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ease this strain, Clinton administration
officials said Monday that the president would propose a tax credit
for companies with fewer than 25 workers that established or joined
purchasing alliances to buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the latest increases will vary according to the
fiscal health and, in some cases, the generosity of the companies.
While the extremely tight labor market will make it difficult for
employers to drop health insurance entirely, employees will see
costs increase in the form of greater weekly contributions, raised
deductibles and co-payments, or less generous plans.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many employers who were thinking of adding insurance
this year may find the costs prohibitive, Shaw said, while
struggling companies may be forced to eliminate benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, 73 percent of the state's uninsured population
consists of people who have jobs, like Sarup Arora and his
employees at Party Glitters, a store in Brooklyn. ``Right now, we
pay cash when we go to the doctor and try not to get sick,'' Arora
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are still enrolling in insurance programs, and
others will not renew their contracts until later this year. But
the increases are giving some employees pause.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Nathan, who owns the restaurant Frontiere in SoHo,
regrets that he cannot offer insurance to more of his employees. He
has insurance for only himself and his two managers, but the
restaurant covers the full cost, even in the face of rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't turn to a restaurant manager and say, `I can't pay
that,''' he said. ``A restaurant manager often works an 80-hour
week. They have a high rate of sickness. So insurance is a costly
necessity. I would love to be able to offer it to more employees if
I could be financially successful and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And many employees who are offered insurance feel they cannot
afford to take it because of the amount they must contribute. ``I
have considered it, but basically I can't afford it,'' said
Laurence Woodbury, the manager of Doggie-Do, a pet grooming,
boarding and retail store on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Larry Roth, pays half of the company's policy with
Oxford, which went from $300 to $336 a month recently. He was
dismayed by the increase, Roth said, and ponders what he will do if
there is an increase next year. ``I find this is the perk that is
most significant to employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Woodbury said he cannot find it in his budget to pay.
``I probably don't worry about it because I probably don't think
about it,'' he said. ``I know that's not very smart. But I very
rarely get ill. What worries me is getting hit by a bus.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While small businesses make up the largest employer group in the
country and are a powerful lobbying voice, individually they
generally hold little power with suppliers, including insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies charge higher rates to small businesses because
their volume is smaller and because the risk of illness is spread
out among fewer people. And with community rating, which was
intended to spread that risk among employers, small businesses are
barred from cutting their own deals.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the Clinton health care plan, small businesses, led
by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, argued that
they could contain costs better on their own.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed in recent years, employers have faced modest
increases as insurance companies fought for market share, often
offering discounted rates to win business. But a recent
consolidation among the managed-care companies and their
realization that they could not make money offering such low
premiums have caused the rates to rise sharply in the last six
months, taking many employers and their workers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these businesses were deluded into thinking that the
private sector had discovered a panacea for medical costs,'' said
Ted Marmor, a professor of politics at the Yale School of
Management, who has written extensively on health care policy.
``And this is a case of getting what they feared, partly out of the
actions they took to avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   The business federation does not see it that way. ``Is it cause
for growing concern? Absolutely,'' said Jim Weidman, a spokesman
for the organization. ``But at least now small employers can still
drop insurance, and under the Clinton plan, they would be out of
business. And when push comes to shove, health insurance is a
benefit. We think it is far better to have a job with no benefits
than no job.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing rising health insurance costs among small businesses
has become a concern with New York City's government _ the rise of
the uninsured is a major public policy problem and is already
putting strains on the city's hospital system.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office has announced two pilot plans to try to deal
with the issue. One would offer discounted rates to small business
owners on two of the Health and Hospitals Corp's managed care plans
that require patients to use certain public hospitals and their
doctors. The plan will begin in East Harlem and parts of Brooklyn
and the Bronx this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The other City Hall plan, a joint venture with the New York
Business Group on Health, will form an insurance purchasing
alliance for small businesses. Under this program, employers will
be able to buy insurance through a central office and offer each
employee a choice of many plans. The company can choose to
subsidize the least expensive option, and the worker who wants a
fancier plan can pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The advantage, said Laurel Pickering, managing director of the
Business Group, is that employers will have access to many plans
and will not longer have to do the administrative work, one of the
biggest hassles with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing groups, in a variety of forms, have been used with
varying success around the country. The Council of Smaller
Enterprises in Cleveland, for instance, started one of the
country's first joint purchasing programs 20 years ago and now
offers insurance to 13,000 companies, employing 200,000 people. The
council's program is quite different from New York's _ it offers
only one carrier but is its largest client.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance has helped to hold insurance costs for small
employers in northeast Ohio 20 percent lower than the national
average, said Rob Fowler, executive director of group, who added,
``It's pure price for volume.''
</P>
<P>
   While New York's plan is less ambitious, it has already drawn an
eager audience. ``It will be great,'' said Bill Berry, president of
Berry Communications, a public relations firm with three employees.
``Now we can all pick our own plan. Before, if they hated their
health care, they would hate me. With five choices, everyone will
be able to find something.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that employees will be absorbing more of the
costs is almost inevitable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Barber, a graphic designer and senior associate at
Russell Design Associates in Manhattan, said that when he worked
for a big company, he paid about $150 a month for insurance for
himself, his wife and two children. Now, he pays $800 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have no options,'' he said. ``A lot of people
don't pay that much for rent. And everything I read about HMOs
makes me think they don't know what they are doing and they might
double all the rates tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Anthony Russell, who owns the firm and watched Oxford
raise his rates 10 percent in January, said that while he does not
contemplate dropping health insurance, he hates telling his
employees about rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always difficult for us to have to be the surrogate for
the insurer,'' Russell said. ``They are insulated from 15 screaming
employees, and I resent having to explain it every time.''

STYLISTS AND MODELS IN `HAIR WARS' TOUR CONVERGE ON LOS ANGELES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The City of Angels has seen its share of war.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been gang wars, water wars and, on
Oscar night, star wars. And as dusk fell Sunday, a hair war broke
out in a hotel near the airport, the site of numerous fare wars.
</P>
<P>
   This war is an intense competition and showcase for hairstylists
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is a chance for them to let their imaginations run wild and
their inhibitions, if they have any, disappear _ say, into a
glittery hair sculpture that is twisted, teased, pressed, curled,
sprayed and colored to look like an airplane, complete with
motorized propellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hair entertainment,'' said David Humphries, who started
the ``Hair Wars'' 12 years ago in a small nightclub in Detroit.
``They're not the kind of hairstyles you wear to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphries, who is an event promoter, not a stylist, said that
Detroit was ``the hair capital of the world'' and the wars there
were legendary. But as often as he can, he takes the show on the
road in his ``Hair Wars U.S. Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   About 75 designers and as many as 300 models competed Sunday and
Monday; in addition to Los Angeles, other scheduled stops on the
tour are Las Vegas, Miami and the deck of a Caribbean cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair,'' Humphries said, ``is big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night was the all-California night and about 20 teams of
designers from Los Angeles, Compton, Riverside, San Diego and
elsewhere competed. Their models strutted down a fashion-show-style
runway, spinning this way and that to show off their sparkling
costumes and color-coordinated hairdos, some of which curled and
spiked more than a foot into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some designers hire professional models and sound technicians
to do their skits,'' Humphries said. ``Other people just get their
cousins and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was designers from the East Coast versus designers
from the West Coast. But the hair wars, Humphries said, are more
showcase than competition. Usually, there is no prize money and no
one is declared the winner. The contestants pay their own way to
the wars and do so, he said, to build a name for themselves in the
business of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Before the competition began Sunday, the master of ceremonies,
LaToya Pearson, told the audience of at least 300 to be respectful
of all the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see some tall models and short models and light models
and dark models, some gay models and straight models,'' Ms. Pearson
said. ``Remember, if you can't say anything nice, don't say
anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As the models pranced across the stage, Ms. Pearson offered
words of encouragement. ``Walk for me, walk for me,'' she said.
``Come on, throw that hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the male models caught her eye. ``You're kind of
cute, honey,'' she said. ``Are you single? You are. Do you like old
ladies with money?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stylists battling it out in the wars are men, like
Keith Watkins, the designer of the airplane of hair.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said he used 102 bags of human hair to build his plane,
shaped like a B-52 bomber. He said each bag contained about 12 feet
of hair. The plane is taken on and off the model like a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the industry for 17 years,'' said Watkins, 38.
``I was always sort of artsy and nerdy. Science fair was my
favorite event of the year when I was a kid. Hair was the perfect
blend of the two.''
</P>
<P>
   A body builder and hair designer, Big Bad D legally changed his
name and got into the business 14 years ago when he was laid off
from his job at an auto plant in Detroit. Losing his job was a
blessing, he said. Nowadays, he wears an enormous gold ring shaped
like a pair of scissors, and he designed his own salon chair, a
$50,000-throne made out of alligator skin with gold and diamond
claws.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bad D was not competing. Instead, he signed up his top
stylist from Detroit, Cool C, ``the hair superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy taking a woman from `Cousin It' to a hit,'' said Cool
C, 25. ``You ever see Michael Jordan play basketball? Well, I'm on
that level when it comes to hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the designers in the wars are African-American, but
everyone is welcome. Anna (Lucky) Schnitt, 27, a white designer
from Indianapolis, brought several models to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her models, June Sullivan, 22, who works with the
mentally retarded, and Renita Moore, 26, a claims adjuster for an
insurance company, are African-American and often find themselves
telling disbelieving acquaintances that, yes, ``a white girl did
our hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to teach her or get in her chair and tell her
what I want,'' said Ms. Moore, who was sporting a series of curls
and loops called a roller coaster. ``She knows. She's the baddest
white girl in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schnitt said she knew so much about African-American hair
care and design because when she was 4 her German mother married a
black American soldier, and she was ``raised in a black family.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been doing hair professionally for seven years and has
built up a loyal following. Some of her clients take her hair
creations with them to the grave, like a 16-year-old girl who
recently died.
</P>
<P>
   When the girl was alive, her mother refused to allow her to wear
colored hair extensions. But the mother called Ms. Schnitt after
her daughter's death and asked her to put the extensions in for her
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told all my clients,'' Ms. Schnitt said, ``that if they
pass away, I'll do their hair for free.''

TEXAS BILLS MAY HELP CURB TELEMARKETING ABUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans could hang up on telemarketing calls for
good if a legislative bill that has the stamp of approval of the
state's utility regulators becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, anyone who wants to ban uninvited salesmen
from ringing up at mealtime or otherwise making themselves a pest
could sign up for a single, statewide ``don't-call'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketers who persisted in calling numbers on the list would
face hefty fines from the Texas Public Utility Commission, up to
$5,000 a day for each violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you've got all these people who are on the
phone just constantly barraging people, saying we want to sell you
this, sell you that. There have been too many complaints,'' said
state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin. His proposal to curb
telemarketing abuse, Senate Bill 120, has companion legislation,
House Bill 537, sponsored by Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of complaints have rolled into the PUC from angry
telephone customers who have pleaded to no avail for individual
telemarketers to quit calling. Even though current federal and
state laws require companies to maintain and respect their own
``don't call'' lists, enforcement authority remains weak and
ineffective, said Saralee Tiede, the PUC's chief of customer
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 562 telephone solicitation complaints the PUC
investigated in the last fiscal year, more than 400 were about
companies that called even after customers asked to be put on their
internal ``don't-call'' lists.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Tiede said, is that current state law gives
telemarketers so many chances to avoid penalties that the PUC has
only been able to fine one telemarketer _ a Central Texas home
security company called Protect America _ $5,000 for repeated
violations. No penalties have been levied so far this year, even
though complaints in the first four months had already surpassed
the number in the previous full year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have sought to do is really tighten up the
(telemarketing) statute and make it much easier to enforce,'' Tiede
said of the legislation. ``It's really a great improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects the statewide ``do not call'' list to be popular.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for a bigger crackdown grew out of hearings this
past year by the House Subcommittee on Telemarketing, in which
legislators said members of their own staffs had witnessed
companies and organizations ignoring their internal don't-call
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Five other states have already passed similar laws _ Alaska,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Oregon _ to good effect, they say.
In Georgia, where the telemarketing law is new, 90,000 people
signed on to the list the first month it was offered, according to
Tiede.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying nationwide to rein in telemarketing is the American
Association of Retired Persons, which is making passage of such
don't-call bills a priority in every state.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 140,000 telemarketers nationally generate annual
sales of $550 billion, the AARP told the House subcommittee on
telemarketing last spring. The organization noted that about
one-tenth of those telemarketers are believed to be scam artists
who prey on people who are 55 and older. More than three-fourths of
those victimized by telemarketing scams fall into that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement stings, according to the AARP, have even
uncovered unscrupulous companies that obtained lists of patients
with Alzheimer's disease to target.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have been ripped off are well-educated people who
simply don't expect anyone to lie to them.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Alexander of Levelland, near Lubbock, is a grandmother of
18 who grew up in an age when people could be trusted. So, she
believed the man on the phone when he said, ``Oh Mary! You have
won. You have won the big money!''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't sure exactly which sweepstakes she had entered, but
the man on the phone said it was in Canada. She must pay a duty,
however, before he could send her the big winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't have that kind of money in my personal account,
so I had to charge it to my Visa card,'' said the homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The first time it happened, Alexander sent $1,950 from her Visa
account ``and guess what?'' she said. ``I never heard from him
again.'' She's embarrassed to admit it happened again. Another call
from Canada, another $2,000 for duties or taxes, and nothing in
return but an angry husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``What grabbed the representatives was she said she was paying
the Visa (card) back with money out of her Social Security every
month. It just brought tears to your eyes,'' said the AARP's Mary
Lee Comer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is draw a line in the sand. If you put
your name on a non-call list and you continue to be called anyway,
then you know these people are fraudulent because the legitimate
telemarketers and those trying to do the right thing will not call
you,'' she added. ``We're not after all telemarketers. We very well
realize there are people in this country who could not have any
part in our economy if they were not telemarketers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Direct Marketing Association, however, told the committee
that the industry's national and voluntary don't-call list combined
with federal restrictions that bar calls for 10 years to anyone
asking to sign a don't-call list are safeguards enough.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Alcorta, who represents the group's legal interests in
Austin, said he questions whether the PUC's authority allows it to
fine telemarketers operating from outside the state's lines. The
jurisdiction has not been legally challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Texas, Alcorta added, some 20,000 to 100,000 companies
that sell by phone could be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of jobs out there. This would affect Texas
callers to Texans and a lot of Texas telemarketers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, however, noted that a 1994 federal law aimed
at telephone consumer fraud gives state law enforcement officers
the ability to prosecute telemarketers calling Texas from other
states.
</P>
<P>
   C. Tyler Prochnow, an attorney representing the American
Teleservices Organization, said statewide don't-call lists, such as
the one proposed for Texas, raise First Amendment freedom of speech
issues. In addition, he said, ``It creates a tremendous amount of
confusion for companies doing business in all 50 states.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NO HISTORY, NO FUTURE, ENJOY 1998
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ At the risk of depressing all Jets fans _ and
there are many more than four months ago _ forget all the babble
about 1998 being the steppingstone to some kind of dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Put bluntly, next season could stink. Instead, Jets' fans should
relish what Vinny Testaverde and Keyshawn Johnson and Moe Lewis
gave them in the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   The fans should savor it, embrace it, because it may not come
around again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a very transient thing,'' said the coach, Bill
Parcells, looking wan on very little sleep Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The players cannot caress this season because that is not the
nature of their highly pragmatic business. They fumbled, they held,
they blanked out. They lost to the Denver Broncos, 23-10, and they
must look upon that as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go to the Super Bowl, nothing's changed,'' said
Keyshawn Johnson, a mensch all season. ``If you don't set your goal
on the Super Bowl, you might as well leave it alone. Give yourself
an extra month's vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   New York being Knee-Jerk City, you could hear it both
extravagant ways Monday. The truly shabby point of view is that the
leering gap-toothed ghost of seasons past somehow pursued the Jets
all the way to Denver and cut off their oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
   How disrespectful that theory is to the grunts on the line, the
special-team zealots, the so-called skill players, who thrived from
September right through the old witching month of December.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of Parcells, this was a new team, with a new attitude
and new capability. This was a sound football team that worked
hard, that earned the respect of the fans, and in the end made too
many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing to be this close,'' said Testaverde,
the local boy from Elmont, just down the Hempstead Turnpike from
here. ``It's very disappointing to be packing up your bags and
going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Packing up is too elegant a phrase. Packing up implies luggage.
Essentially the players throw what they want in garbage sacks and
drag them out to their sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Pasta, I'll call you,'' shouted Ray Lucas, the utility
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Luke,'' Testaverde called out.
</P>
<P>
   There was the sense that most of these guys liked each other, a
far cry from recent Jets' teams. Winning does that, along with
Parcells' inspired goading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the younger guys understand what it takes to get to the
Super Bowl,'' Testaverde said, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there are no Six Easy Steps to a Better Super Bowl Life,
to paraphrase Cosmo covers. There have been precious few dynasties
in recent years, as free agency made every season unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Pittsburgh last year,'' said Bryan Cox, the combative
old linebacker. ``Look at the Giants. They played so well last
year, they had high expectations. Kansas City had a great record
and didn't live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sneak up on anybody next year,'' Cox
continued, referring to the weighted schedule that gives better
teams slightly tougher schedules in search of parity. ``We're going
to play the toughest schedule in our division next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys are not going to be in this locker room next year,''
Cox added. ``We are going to have to bond again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox came out of the morning session with Parcells swearing to
work harder next time: ``We need to understand. I need to
understand. I don't want to gain my 30 pounds in the off-season.
I'm going to cut down on my alcohol intake, cut down on fatty
foods, take long walks with my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   On this last morning of the 1998 season, Cox did permit himself
a moment of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fun,'' he said. ``We won a lot of games. We dispelled
the myth of the New York Jets. We put in a lot of effort. We did a
lot of good things. This was as good as it gets, without getting to
the Super Bowl. If this happens again next year, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would predict it could happen again. Parcells, who came
back after heart surgery, gets the booby prize of having to coach
in the Pro Bowl, not what his cardiologist might propose.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells wasn't blustering about changes, but Bill Belichick
could take one of the jobs in Kansas City or Chicago, and free
agents could depart, and trades could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the 1999 New York Jets will look like,''
Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Jets looked like winners. Out of respect to the coaches
and players, the fans just might want to hold on to that image for
a while.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Colo. _ Next weekend, skiers here are to inaugurate
the world's highest chair lift. Whisking 1,200 skiers an hour to a
12,700-foot ridge, the lift will offer sweeping views of the
Rockies and challenging runs down the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of changing times in the nation's most popular
skiing state, a Colorado environmentalist is suing, charging that
Loveland Ski Area has violated its federal permit for building on
National Forest Service land.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting logging, mining and cattle grazing on National
Forest lands, environmentalists declared open season this winter on
ski areas, once the environmental good guys. Fueling opposition is
fear that ski area expansions are triggering runaway real-estate
development on adjacent private land.
</P>
<P>
   Many large ski companies are turning to mountain real estate as
a source for dynamic profits in the future. In contrast, the number
of lift tickets sold nationwide each winter has been stagnant for a
decade, hovering around 53 million. In that period, Colorado's
ticket sales increased by about 20 percent. But in a
weather-dependent business, Colorado has seen its ski ticket drop
11 percent this season as some resorts endured their worst
Christmas snow in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about skiing, it is about real-estate development,''
said Jonathan Staufer, a shop owner in Vail who is chairman of the
Ski Area Citizens Coalition, a new environmental group.
``Industrial tourism is posing the next major threat to wild places
in Colorado and America.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the High Rockies, signs of growth abound.
</P>
<P>
   Directly below Loveland's new Continental Divide chair lift, but
muffled by a quarter mile of granite, traffic on Interstate 70
regularly slows to a crawl in the Eisenhower Tunnel, a major link
between Colorado's busiest ski areas and greater Denver's 2 million
people. In 25 years, traffic has quadrupled in the tunnel, 60 miles
west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the 75 miles between here and Eagle-Vail Airport, enough home
construction is planned to double the populations of several towns
in five years. A rural airstrip in 1990, the airport is Colorado's
second busiest this winter, offering direct jet service to 13
cities, including New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On public lands, recreation is shaping up as the new
battleground. In the last decade, while the volume of timber cut in
National Forests fell by two-thirds, the number of recreational
visitors jumped by 40 percent. The U.S. Forest Service predicts it
will record 1 billion recreational visits a year by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see lawsuits, not only against oil, gas and mining, but
also to stop recreational use,'' the chief of the Forest Service,
Mike Dombeck, said in Denver recently, after encountering
protesters objecting to a 2,000-acre expansion of Vail into
National Forest land.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where most skiing is done on National Forest land,
the conflict flared into the public eye in October when an
amorphous group, the Environmental Liberation Front, protested the
expansion of Vail's ski slopes by burning three buildings and
damaging four lifts.
</P>
<P>
   But in less dramatic fights, Colorado environmentalists are
lobbying federal agencies to block new ski trails at Keystone
Resort and Breckenridge Ski Resort. Nearby, at Arapahoe Basin, they
are trying to block the installation of a snow-making system that
would fulfill that area's dream of becoming the nation's first to
offer skiing year round.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, environmentalists are fighting
construction of a new ski area, Pelican Butte, in southern Oregon,
and the expansion of Snowbasin in Utah. In recent months, the
Forest Service overrode objections to the expansion of Santa Fe ski
area in New Mexico, but rejected a proposed ski area for Mount
Shasta in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Colorado, in the face of strong local opposition, a
consortium of Vermont and Colorado developers abandoned plans to
build a ski area 10 miles south of Steamboat Springs, which would
have been called Catamount. In addition to the ski slopes, the
developers planned 3,700 new homes and 1,000 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the resources and they had the permits,'' said Susan
Otis, executive director of the Yampa Valley Land Trust. ``But they
knew that in the community there no longer was a desire to have a
new ski area.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers gave the Yampa Valley trust conservation
easements preserving 3,296 acres of pasture and announced plans to
build 40 luxury houses and a lodge at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures show that Colorado has the third-fastest growing
population in the nation, after Nevada and Arizona. Now, defenders
of the fragile lands in the Rockies are also worried that
out-of-state demographic pressures will result in a proliferation
of second-home developments and swelling crowds at ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   On one end, the average age of a second-home buyer in the United
States is 51. Over the next 18 years, 78 million Americans are to
turn 51. Their children number 72 million and are expected to pack
ski areas again. The intermediate group now in their 20's and 30's
numbered only 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over land use is really just starting, because you
are talking of a burgeoning population of residents and visitors,''
said Diane Gansauer, executive director of the Colorado Wildlife
Federation, a conservation group composed largely of hunters and
anglers. ``I don't buy the view of wildlife that accepts deer as
lawn ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   At public hearings in Vail last spring, one resident drew
applause when he said, ``We want to look at trophy elk, not trophy
homes.'' At the hearings, most speakers spoke against the expansion
plans of Vail, the nation's largest ski area.
</P>
<P>
   Critics noted that within 40 miles of Vail, eight ski areas are
already operating, with 126 lifts and 850 trails covering almost
15,000 acres. Vail Resorts is expanding its ski terrain by 19
percent, even though lift ticket sales dropped 5 percent last
winter, to 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a company close to Vail Resorts, Turkey Creek
LLC, successfully bid $42 million for a 2,900-acre parcel of
private land that is a mile from the resort's new expanded area.
The ski company has an option to buy half of Turkey Creek.
</P>
<P>
   And Vail Resorts and Intrawest Corp., a Canadian company, are
partners in the construction of 4,600 housing units at the Keystone
ski area. Intrawest has a total $1 billion in construction planned
at the nine ski areas it owns in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is to focus on real estate, while quietly selling
some ski tickets on the side,'' said Sandy Shea, a director of High
Country Citizens' Alliance, a group that opposes a 300-home
development planned for private land next to Crested Butte Mountain
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Crested Butte offers free skiing early in the season
to fill company-owned hotel rooms, Shea added: ``I don't think any
ski area is making money off tickets. Most of the money is made
from real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Forest Service approves ski slopes near private land,
the value of the private land jumps. Looking at ski lifts that
serve mediocre slopes near vacation homes, some Colorado
environmentalists derisively call them ``real estate lifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ski-in, ski-out real estate commands a 25 percent premium,''
said Neil Adams, a real-estate broker in Crested Butte. ``When you,
your wife and your five kids decide to go skiing, do you want to
play taxi driver? Your kids can come home for lunch, no problem.
Just ski right up to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The ski industry describes as minuscule the 20,000 acres of ski
area expansions planned on National Forest lands around the nation.
About one-quarter of the nation's 525 ski areas operate on Forest
Service land, leasing about 190,000 acres out of total National
Forest holdings of 190 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that on one-tenth of one percent of Forest Service
land, 30 million people enjoy a winter recreation experience,''
said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry group based outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of a Forest Service policy in Colorado to favor
expansion of existing ski areas over the construction of new ones,
and fights waged by environmentalists against new ski areas, the
last one to open on National Forest land in the state was Beaver
Creek, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While ski areas are magnets for growth, not all of the growth in
second homes in the Colorado high country is tied to skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to other areas of Colorado, where there are no ski
areas, and trophy homes are being built,'' said Lyle Laverty, the
Forest Service's top official for Colorado. ``Part of the
attraction is being close to a National Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit against Loveland, the environmentalist, Steven
Hannon, asserts that the Forest Service awarded permit for a
1,700-foot surface lift and then allowed the ski area to nearly
triple the length of the lift and to change it to a chair lift.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Abrahamson, the general manager of the ski area, which is
fighting the suit in Federal District Court in Denver, said: ``The
Forest Service approved putting skiers on top of the ridge. We
followed the process from A to Z.''
</P>
<P>
   While ski area operators say they can work with mainstream
environmentalists, they say they are worried that the fight is
being escalated by fringe elements.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Earth First Journal, a radical publication,
applauds the arsons at Vail as ``a rational, overtly political and
defensive act undertaken by Mother Earth's freedom fighters, not
terrorists, in face of overwhelming odds.'' The newspaper also
devoted a full page to instructing readers how to make the kind of
Molotov cocktails that caused $12 million in fire damages at Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Walcher, Colorado's newly appointed director of the state
Department of Natural Resources, has watched the Rocky Mountain
economy shift dramatically to tourism from mining, grazing and
logging, partly because of environmental opposition to extractive
industries on public lands. Now he worries, he said, that: ``Some
people want to slow tourism down, then shut it down. It would be a
horrible mistake not to take them seriously.''

COMMENTARY: RATTLING THE RATTLER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one quite knows how Nigeria's evil dictator Sani Abacha died
last June at age 54, but the story that has made the rounds goes
like this: Several Nigerian officers who finally got fed up with
Abacha's utterly venal and corrupt rule got together, imported
three prostitutes from India, sent them to his villa with a poison,
which he somehow ingested (one report says it may have been in his
Viagra) and then dropped dead. The three prostitutes were back on a
plane to India before General Abacha's body was cold. Whatever the
details, a senior U.S. official privy to the intelligence told me:
``Let's just say Abacha did not die a natural death and he did not
die alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth thinking about Nigeria as we reflect on where to go
next with Iraq. One thing Abacha's timely passing reminds us of is
that when an absolute dictator becomes so evil, there is hope that
other generals around him will eventually dare to eliminate him
when the pressure gets intense enough. Abacha so ran down Nigeria's
infrastructure that the country, the world's 11th-largest oil
producer, had to import energy. The other lesson is that getting
rid of just one evil leader really can make a difference. With
Abacha gone, Nigeria's generals are now holding elections to move
to civilian rule, and the process so far has been relatively
honest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Saddam Hussein is more clever at keeping his opponents
at bay than was Abacha (although the story making the rounds in the
Middle East is that Saddam's son Uday, who was shot and paralyzed
in late 1996, survived only because the young lady in whose company
he was at the time took most of the assassin's bullets in her body.
Such a nice family.) But it is not unreasonable to think that
whoever replaced Saddam would be a vast improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Clinton administration says it has
decided to focus its energy now on producing the ouster of Saddam,
rather than just containing him. Almost the entire target list from
the U.S. attack on Iraq three weeks ago was aimed at the generals
and Republican Guards who up to now have protected Saddam. The
message on the U.S. smart bombs, which apparently killed hundreds
of Saddam's palace guards, was: ``Warning: Hanging Around With
Saddam Hussein Can Be Hazardous To Your Health.''
</P>
<P>
   The other good news: This tactic has rattled Saddam. There are
reports that several generals have been executed in recent weeks,
and Saddam himself clearly went off his rocker when he described
his fellow Arab leaders as ``dwarfs'' and called for their
overthrow. As an Iraq specialist, Amatzia Baram, pointed out in a
paper for the Washington Institute, the U.S. air strikes, by
prompting Saddam to attack his Arab brethren, have isolated him
more than ever from other Arab regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the U.S. attack and the way that Saddam just curled up
and took the blows have clearly upset his core supporters in the
Republican Guards, and this explains why Saddam now is trying to
prove he is still defending the nation, by attempting every day to
shoot down a U.S. fighter jet _ an idiotic strategy because it
gives the United States the excuse to blow apart another piece of
his air defense system every day.
</P>
<P>
   With Saddam rattled, now is the time to really rattle his cage:
Turn up the volume on Radio Free Iraq to extra loud and call for
his ouster 24 hours a day: ``All Saddam, all the time.'' Take steps
to have Saddam declared a war criminal by the United Nations. Blow
up a different power station in Iraq every week, so no one knows
when the lights will go off or who's in charge. Offer a reward for
removing Saddam from office. Use every provocation by Saddam to
blow up another Iraqi general's home. Tell Russia and France that
if they are so eager to sell out American policy on Iraq, so that
they can sell into Iraq, we have just the proposal for them _ the
Frequent Flier Solution. Send a Russian or French jet to Baghdad
and take Saddam and his top henchmen out of the country to Algeria,
Moscow, Tonga or wherever they want, and then the Russians and
French can do all the business with Iraq that they want.
</P>
<P>
   All the noise about impeachment here has obscured the fact that
the latest U.S. air strikes did one important thing: They broke the
spell of invincibility around Saddam. They proved, as Baram put it,
that Saddam's ``system of control and intimidation is less
impregnable than previously feared _ certainly strong yet capable
of being shattered.''

RIOS AND IVANISEVIC JOIN SAMPRAS ON THE INJURY LIST
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Pete Sampras announced his withdrawal
from the Australian Open in December, when he was home in the
United States. Marcelo Rios and Goran Ivanisevic waited until they
traveled all the way to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Bad backs were the culprits in both Rios' and Ivanisevic's case.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, seeded No. 1 in Sampras' absence, announced his withdrawal
in the late Monday, the first day of play at the Open, because of a
stress fracture in his second lumbar vertebra. David Bolzonello,
the tournament physician, said the injury would likely keep Rios
from practicing for three to four weeks and from returning to the
tour for at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance he will be playing in March,''
Bolzonello said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours earlier, the 11th-seeded Ivanisevic had withdrawn
shortly before he was scheduled to play his match because of an
inflamed disk. Ivanisevic could be out of action for several weeks,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the same thing as Sampras,'' Ivanisevic said of his
withdrawal. ``The only difference is I picked up my pass.''
</P>
<P>
   On the courts, top-seeded Lindsay Davenport routed Gala Leon
Garcia of Spain in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Corretja, seeded second but now the top remaining
player in the men's draw, needed five sets to defeat 116th-ranked
Takao Suzuki of Japan, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Suzuki was making his Grand Slam debut in
Australia because he plays like the Australians of yore: pushing
forward to the net whenever possible and patrolling it with
gumption and grace. Monday, he played the style well enough against
Corretja to serve for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   But at 15-15, Corretja assumed command as Suzuki stopped
punching his volleys with the same assurance. The Spaniard won the
next point after hitting a looping backhand return that landed on
the line and forced Suzuki to retreat and fire up a weak lob. He
won the next point with a cocksure forehand pass down the line. He
then broke Suzuki's serve by passing him down the line with a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that even if you are struggling and you
trust in yourself, good things can happen,'' Corretja said.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja still had to rally from a 3-0 deficit in the fourth-set
tie breaker, but once he had managed that, the fifth set was a
denouement.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Patrick Rafter came out of his recent funk and
defeated Oliver Gross in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter then expressed his concern that Petr Korda was able to
defend his title in this tournament after testing positive for the
steroid nandrolone and having his one-year suspension rescinded by
an appeals committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion on that is I think it's probably killing the
sport,'' Rafter said. ``If someone gets tested in any other sport,
they are out straight away. That's not the case in tennis, and I
think that should be the case unless Petr has got a bloody good
explanation, and we didn't hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Korda scheduled to play Tuesday, Rios, the gifted man he
beat in last year's Australian Open final, will rest and ruminate.
He will drop from No. 2 to at least No. 5 in the world ranking and
will drop much lower if his lower back does not allow him to defend
his titles at Indian Wells and Key Biscayne in March.
</P>
<P>
   He has been troubled by leg injuries and back soreness often in
the last three months, and Bolzonello indicated that the same
magnetic resonance imaging scan that revealed his stress fracture
Monday also showed evidence of a previous stress injury on the
other side of the same vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``These injuries are potentially serious for all athletes,
particularly those involved in a sport that involves extension of
the back,'' Bolzonello said. ``Now, we that we know it's there he
can follow the appropriate treatment, which is essentially rest,
and there's a very good chance it will heal without any concerns in
the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only two upsets on the opening day: No. 13-seeded
Irina Spirlea was beaten by Anke Huber, the former Australian Open
finalist, 7-5, 6-4. The only seeded men's player to lose was No. 16
Thomas Johansson of Sweden, who had two match points in the fourth
set but ended up losing in the fifth to Nicolas Lapentti of
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Krajicek, seeded ninth, was impressive in his four-set
victory over the creative Hicham Arazi of Morocco. Michael Chang,
unseeded here after an injury filled season in 1998, defeated Brett
Steven of New Zealand in straight sets and will face 14th-seeded
Mark Philippoussis of Australia in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams struggled to a 3-6, 6-3, 9-7 victory over
82nd-ranked Silvija Talaja of Croatia. The fifth-seeded Williams
made a rash of unforced errors _ 87 in three sets _ and struggled
with her serve, double-faulting nine times and often under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was an all-time low for the last two weeks,'' the
18-year-old Williams said of her play.
</P>
<P>
   Talaja, a consistent 20-year-old baseliner, forced a number of
Williams' errors by chasing down her powerful ground strokes and
drawing her into long rallies. But Williams shot herself in the
sneaker without assistance, too, and when she served to stay in the
match at 4-5, she soon found herself down by 0-30 on her serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to myself that this is not my fate; this is
someone else's fate,'' Williams said. ``I can't go out like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, she wouldn't, and Talaja, just two points
from a major upset, lost the next four. She would stay with
Williams until 7-7. But the more experienced Williams prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Capriati, the former phenom turned journeywoman, won
her first match at the Australian Open since 1993 by defeating an
Australian teen-ager, Evie Dominikovic, 5-7, 6-3, 8-6. &QL;

CLINTON MOUNTS DOUBLE-BARRELED DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a double-edged presidential power play,
President Clinton sends his defense team to the Senate Tuesday to
argue against impeachment charges, to be followed by his
state-of-the-union speech to Congress, which Clinton hopes will
reinforce his standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans and even some leading Democrats had urged
Clinton to delay the speech until after the Senate impeachment
trial is over, the White House sees a nexus between the two events
that could help the president. With Clinton aides assuming that
most Senate Republicans would vote to convict Clinton, the White
House is anxious to ensure that Clinton's public standing remains
high and thus reassure Senate Democrats it is politically safe to
back the president.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of the two events prompted some Republicans to
consider walking out on the speech or refusing to applaud, but GOP
leaders over the weekend instructed party members to attend the
speech and clap respectfully. Clinton is expected to make several
proposals that he hopes will resonate with both Democrats and
Republicans, such as a measure to ensure that schools receiving
federal funds meet higher standards, and a renewed call for Social
Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart told reporters at a
briefing Monday that counsel Charles Ruff, widely considered to be
the president's most effective legal defender, will be the sole
attorney speaking at the trial, which resumes at 1 p.m. Ruff will
deliver two themes, aides said. First, he will argue that Clinton
did not commit perjury or obstruct justice, as alleged in the
impeachment articles. Secondly, Ruff will argue that even if
senators believe the charges are true, they do not rise to the
level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' needed to convict the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have a compelling case to make based on the law,
the facts and the Constitution,'' Lockhart said. ``We will do that.
We look forward to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also fired another rhetorical salvo at the House
managers of the trial, saying they are ``singlemindedly'' focused
on having witnesses, even though no witnesses with first-hand
knowledge of the case appeared before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a stunning admission that they don't believe
that the case that they sent over from the House, and the case that
they presented to the Senate, is strong, and is strong enough to do
what they've set out to do from the beginning, which is remove the
president,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, the Clinton legal team's strategy will be
to vigorously fight against as many details as possible in the
charges. An underlying goal during the alloted 24 hours of defense
is to try to convince the Senate that it is not necessary to call
witnesses, which adds an unpredictability factor that Clinton aides
want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But with Republicans controlling the Senate 55-45, and only 51
votes needed to call a witness, the White House is preparing for
the growing possibility that former intern Monica S. Lewinsky and
others may be called to the testify in the well of the Senate. As a
result, Clinton's legal team hopes this week to spread doubts about
the usefulness of such testimony. For example, Clinton lawyers will
highlight many lines of testimony from Lewinsky, presidential
secretary Betty Currie and lawyer Vernon Jordan that could be
helpful to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the most frequently cited testimony, the White House has
noted that Lewinsky said that no one asked her to lie and no one
offered her a job in exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that witnesses certainly could help the case,''
Lockhart said. ``There could be exculpatory information. There is
exculpatory information.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the House managers of the prosecution noted during the
last week, Lewinsky also said that no one discouraged her from
lying and that she knew what Clinton wanted her to say.
</P>
<P>
   Representative George Gekas, the Pennsylvania Republican and one
of 13 House managers of the trial, said Lewinsky's testimony is so
strong against the president that he is surprised Clinton hasn't
volunteered to testify in rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a choice that the president would have to make,'' Gekas
said on CNN Monday. ``As a matter of fact, I always felt that
because Monica Lewinsky's testimony is largely unchallenged,
undenied, uncontradicted, as it were, that the president's lawyers
would want to put the president on to contradict that testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton aides said the president has no plans to testify.
Instead, Clinton will rely largely on three lawyers: Ruff, Gregory
B. Craig and David Kendall. It is the same trio that defended
Clinton unsuccessfully before the House Judiciary Committee, which
approved the articles of impeachment that subsequently were backed
by the full House and sent to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the House managers said Monday that it is possible the
White House team might persuade the Senate not to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in this case anything is a foregone
conclusion,'' Representative Asa Hutchinson, the Arkansas
Republican, said Monday on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``Certainly,
the White House defense team, which are terrific advocates for the
president, quality lawyers, will make an outstanding defense this
week, and I'm sure that no decision will be made until after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, meanwhile, clearly were hoping that the
president's state of the union speech would boost his standing
during this crucial phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the end of the speech, people will look not at an
administration that has entered the last two years of office and is
slowing down,'' Lockhart said, ``but an administration that is
energized and is looking forward to moving into the 21st century
with an ambitious and activist agenda.''

LOTUS NEEDS MORE TIME FOR NOTES UPGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Corporate software buyers waiting to get their
hands on the latest version of Lotus Notes will have to wait a
little bit longer. But many of them think it'll be worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   At Lotus Development Corp.'s annual Lotusphere conference at
Walt Disney World, chief executive Jeff Papows had been expected to
announce that the product was ready to ship. Instead, Papows said
the schedule had slipped again. ``We need two to three more weeks
for polishing,'' he said. But when he vowed the new product would
ship next month, the audience of about 5,000 erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the expected reaction,'' said a surprised Papows.
``Maybe we ought to slip a few more products.''
</P>
<P>
   Papows got still more cheers when he promised a Linux version of
Domino, the server software that powers Notes. At Lotusphere in
Berlin last year, Papows had rejected the idea of supporting Linux,
the free Unix-like operating system that has developed a growing
following in recent months. But he said his comments in Berlin had
generated a storm of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally got back and had more hate mail than you can
imagine,'' he said, ``much of it from my boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus has been promising R5, a new version of the Notes and
Domino groupware programs, since 1997, but there have been numerous
delays in rolling out the product. Now the stakes are especially
high, as Lotus faces fierce competition from Microsoft Corp. and
its Exchange groupware product. Papows called R5 the most important
software release at Lotus since the Cambridge, Mass. company
introduced Notes in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Lotus found the product a tough sell. Few companies
knew what groupware was, much less how it could be of benefit to
them. Today, it's a multibillion-dollar market. Companies use
groupware to exchange information in highly selective and
sophisticated ways that go far beyond standard e-mail. For
instance, groupware allows teams of workers scattered all over the
world to collaborate on the same documents.
</P>
<P>
   R5 is designed to make the process easier and more powerful. The
new Notes version is designed to resemble an Internet browser, so
that many advanced Notes features can be used simply by pointing
and clicking.
</P>
<P>
   It also features an instant messaging component. A user will be
able to see at a glance if colleagues are logged on to the system.
If they are, he'll be able to type messages to them in real time,
instead of waiting for a response to e-mail. In addition, the front
page of Notes will feature a selection of news and information
provided by America Online Inc. as part of a strategic partnership
between Lotus and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The Notes client _ the part that resides on a user's desktop
machine _ will be entirely based on Internet standards, so that it
can be used for all types of e-mail, not just mail from a Lotus
server. It's expected to sell for a list price of $29.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of Domino server has been upgraded for easier
control by system administrators, and for easier migration to Notes
from other messaging programs, including Exchange and Lotus'
earlier e-mail product, cc:Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The new versions of Notes and Domino should give Lotus an edge
in this year's market share battle with Microsoft. Papows said
Microsoft probably won't upgrade Exchange again until it completes
work on Windows 2000, its high-end operating system. Windows 2000
will contain a feature called Active Directory that will be used by
Exchange to match some of the features of Notes.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows 2000, which was supposed to have shipped last year,
has suffered repeated delays. Microsoft announced Friday that a
third beta version of the software would be delayed yet again. But
the company still vows Windows 2000 will ship by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the delay gives Lotus more time to cement its position
in groupware. Papows bragged that Lotus sold 5 million Notes
licenses in the fourth quarter of 1998, for a 1998 total of 14.2
million seats, two million more than they'd expected. That means
there are now 34 million Notes users, compared to about 20 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   That is considerably higher than last week's estimate from
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. IDC estimated there
are now just under 30 million Notes users, compared to 21 million
users of Microsoft Exchange. Novell Corp.'s Groupwise product is a
distant third at an estimated 14.2 million users.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How many times does it happen like this? How many
times is the biggest victory in franchise history also the greatest
game?
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the 11 1/2-point spread, it was the biggest upset in
a conference championship game since the 1970 merger. It began
according to script and then went every which way. The Vikings had
the ball longer and ran 10 more plays. Robert Smith outrushed Jamal
Anderson. Pressure on Randall Cunningham was slight. The Falcons
made two turnovers and were supposed to come undone before the
raging Vikings and the roaring Metrodome. But no.
</P>
<P>
   Using center Robbie Tobeck's silent count, the Falcons went all
game without a procedure penalty. Every time the Vikings drew
farther ahead, the visitors reeled them in. Given every chance to
join the honorable-but-forgettable ranks of losing semifinalists,
the Falcons simply refused.
</P>
<P>
   They'd opened nicely, scoring after the kickoff. No 17-point
jump for Minnesota this day. But that good early work soon seemed a
faded memory. Harold Green fell and fumbled. O.J. Santiago ran and
fumbled. The Falcons were called for personal fouls on consecutive
snaps.
</P>
<P>
   First-and-10 at the Falcon 19 after Michael Booker's late hit,
the visitors reeling now. Randy Moss broke open over the middle.
Hold Cunningham's pass and it's 24-7 and pretty much over. But the
great rookie could get his hands only on the ball's back half. The
purple tide had broken. The greatest offense in NFL annals would
run 61 more plays and score but one more touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Up by 13, the Vikes overreached. Chuck Smith stripped Cunningham
inside the half's final minute, Travis Hall recovering, Chris
Chandler finding Terance Mathis for the touchdown that made this a
game again. ``They were going for the knockout punch,'' Smith would
say. ``But nobody had actually gone at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once all season had an opponent stayed within seven points
of the Vikings in the Metrodome. The Falcons closed within three.
The Vikings made it 10 again. On third-and-9 Chandler stepped into
a fearsome blitz and delivered the 70-yarder to Tony Martin. Field
goal. Cunningham flubbed a snap, Shane Dronett recovering. Dan
Reeves went for it on fourth-and-4, surely a howling mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings drove for the kill. Gary Anderson missed. Chandler
threw to Ronnie Harris. The Vikes' Robert Griffith couldn't hold a
deflected pass. On the next play Chandler hit Mathis on a slant.
Touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Burned once by greed, the Vikes meekly allowed regulation to
expire. The greatest offense in NFL annals took the ball first in
OT, managed 13 yards, punted, got it back, moved 12 yards, punted
again. Chandler hit Santiago once, twice. Hardy Minnesotans began
leaving by the dozens. Morten Andersen kicked it true. Of this
stirring tableau, Jessie Tuggle said: ``All I remember is the ball
going through the uprights. . . . We're headed to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, but Miami is a mere destination. In the fortnight of
hype to come, let no one forget the long day's journey that got the
Falcons there. Let no one forget team president Taylor Smith's
benediction: ``I don't think I've ever seen so much character.''

CLINTON TO PROPOSE SPENDING MORE TO CURB RUSSIAN NUCLEAR THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his State of the Union message on Tuesday night,
President Clinton will insist that the United States substantially
increase its financial assistance to Russia to minimize the threat
posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes it's in the national security interest
of the American people that we work with Russia and other former
Soviet countries to reduce the risk that materials, technology and
expertise for weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of
rogue nations or terrorists,'' said David Leavy, a National
Security Council spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the president was concerned about ``people trying
to sell what has value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Russia is in a period of greater economic distress, it is
even more in our interest to accelerate these programs,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials said the president would propose
spending $4.2 billion over the next five years, a 68 percent
increase over the $2.5 billion already budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   The new money would be used in these areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ To dismantle warheads and other dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ To redirect Russian scientists and scientific institutes into
civilian pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   _ To tighten controls over non-nuclear weapons and materials
like chemical and biological weapons and missile parts and help the
Russians beef up their export controls.
</P>
<P>
   _ To assist in the relocation of Russian troops now stationed
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The president will stress that the money will not be available
to institutions that offer nuclear assistance to Iran. Last week,
the White House announced economic sanctions against three Russian
institutions that the administration said were helping Iran and
possibly other nations develop nuclear weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L.
Stimson Center, a military research organization here, and an
expert on Russian nuclear weapons, said that the increased spending
to be proposed by the president would be ``a good down payment to
solve an important problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much it would cost to solve the problem once and for
all, Krepon replied, ``There isn't a soul who knows the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for additional financial assistance to Russia will
be the centerpiece of the one-quarter of the speech devoted to
foreign and military policy, the official said. They said the
president would also talk about efforts to contain the threat from
Iraq and to achieve peace in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He will also press for a five-year increase in the Defense
Department budget, with an emphasis on improving the ability of
troops to respond quickly to emergencies, and will call on the
Senate to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. As long as the
United States does not join the 151 other nations who have signed
the treaty, the president plans to say, this country will lack the
moral authority to persuade India and Pakistan to stop testing
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Other passages will involve U.S. policy in Asia and Africa, and
there will be a sizable section on trade and international
economics. The president will urge Congress to reinstate his
authority to negotiate trade agreements under a process that would
allow Congress to approve or reject the pacts but not amend them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union,
Congress approved legislation that provided money to Russia and
other former Soviet states to help them dismantle their nuclear
arsenals and create safe storage for weapons-grade nuclear
material.
</P>
<P>
   This is called the Nunn-Lugar program after its chief sponsors,
former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who headed the Armed Services
Committee, and Sen Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee and now the committee's second-ranking
Republican. An administration official said that somewhat more than
$1 billion had been spent since the program's inception.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lugar said that the senator had been briefed on
Clinton's proposed expansion of the program and supported the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's plan could still run into difficulty in
Congress, because many Republicans do not trust the Russians and
are wary about giving them assistance.

 &HT;    Some remember King by serving communityBy Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In years past, Noreen Lewis Cochran has either stayed
home or gone to work on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but neither
felt right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt an emptiness,'' Cochran said. ``It seems
necessary to mark it in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she took time off from her job to help paint a house on
Auburn Avenue near King's birthplace. Hands On Atlanta coordinated
the project in conjunction with the National Park Service, which
has an ongoing restoration project in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stay away,'' Cochran said as she dipped her roller
into a tray of paint. ``This just made the most sense of what to do
today. It's perfect. I can see me doing this every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn Avenue project was one of more than 20 coordinated by
Hands On Atlanta, a nonprofit volunteer service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, and across the United States, the nation paused
to honor King, who was assassinated in 1968 and would have turned
70 last week. In Atlanta, the day began with a service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King once preached and continued with the
Hands On Atlanta service projects and Gov. Roy Barnes leading a
parade honoring the civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   At Ebenezer, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel
Peace Prize winner like King, gave the keynote speech, praising
U.S. civil rights leaders for their role in ending apartheid in his
county. Also at the service, King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
presented the 1999 Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize
to John Hume, who last year shared the Nobel Peace Prize for his
efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to live out Dr. King's legacy of building
communities through service,'' said Julie Mehan, a staff member
with Hands On Atlanta. She estimated 1,000 volunteers worked at the
various community service sites, which included sorting books at
Goodwill, preparing meals for people living with AIDS and planting
gardens, painting murals or cleaning up a number of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old DeAnna Weede spent part of Monday at a nursing
facility, where volunteers played bingo with residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I help people, I feel good about myself,'' said DeAnna, a
member of the I Have A Dream Foundation. ``I know they enjoy our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAnna sat with resident Mary Darden, marking the bingo cards
when their numbers were called out. Darden recalled the day she
learned of Dr. King's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working in Dayton Ohio,'' in a coffee shop, she said.
``A lady was watching TV. She came out and said, `Everybody be
quiet, sit down. Martin Luther King just got shot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to think it over for a while,'' she continued. ``It
finally came to me what had happened. I said, `No, not Dr. King.'''
</P>
<P>
   The annual observance of Dr. King's birthday is a time of
reflection for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit and think about what all he went through,'' Darden said.
</P>
<P>
   It pleased her to have young people visit this year and remember
the civil rights leader by sharing their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're here,'' she said.

POPE TO VISIT ST. LOUIS, MEXICO CITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds: Pope's visit begins Friday) 
(Moved in ``a'' and ``i'' categories) 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's visit to Mexico and the United States, which
begins Friday, brings an aging church patriarch to two of the
world's most Catholic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Only Brazil has more Roman Catholics than Mexico, which has 86.3
million. The United States has 61.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   To believers in both nations, John Paul II is literally Jesus
Christ's representative on earth. Even if they disagree with him,
his opinions on secular and sacred issues matter. As sovereign of
the Vatican, he commands the respect accorded any visiting head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's five-day visit to Mexico City is expected to attract
1 million visitors and to cost the local archdiocese more than $1.3
million. Officials say they cannot estimate the visit's total cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost to the archdiocese is high in a nation struggling
with high crime in its capital city, a beleaguered economy, ongoing
ethnic and religious conflicts, extreme poverty and government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, he's going to talk about the poor and its
problems,'' said Brian Smith, a religion and ethics professor with
expertise on Latin America at the University of Wisconsin at Ripon.
``But he's also probably going to raise the issue of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated costs of the papal visit to St. Louis range as high as
$5 million with, at least, 100,000 visitors expected.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting the pope in St. Louis on behalf of the nation's 300
Catholic bishops will be Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of
the national bishops' conference and leader of 1 million Catholics
in the Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza predicted that the pope will decry abortion, capital
punishment and euthanasia, encouraging Catholics ``to bring the
moral values of the Gospel into the society of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in the United States, citizens confront the
impeachment trial of a still popular president. In a recent Gallup
Poll, Americans named President Clinton the most popular man in the
United States, with the pope coming in second. The two will meet
during the pope's 30-hour stop in St. Louis on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason for the pope's visit is to outline his
response to the Synod of the Bishops for America, held at the
Vatican in late 1997. It brought together Catholic bishops from two
continents to explore common concerns ranging from poverty and
foreign debt in Latin America to declining morality in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's ``apostolic exhortation,'' a sermon responding to the
synod, is expected to address a cross section of social justice
issues, including the rights of indigenous peoples throughout the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Frail and stooped shouldered, John Paul is making his 85th
pastoral journey outside Italy. At age 78, he is a far cry from the
robust, dynamic pontiff who won U.S. and Mexican hearts on his
first tours of each nation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But he keeps a grueling schedule, still enjoys meeting people
and remains sharp-witted, according to U.S. bishops. Because of his
age and declining health, this trip's schedule is less crammed than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, his itinerary includes a courtesy visit with
President Ernesto Zedillo, celebrating Mass at the Basilica of Our
Lady of Guadalupe, visiting a hospital and attending a rally. On
his first visit to Mexico in January 1979, just months after he was
elected pope, he crammed 26 events into a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pastoral visit, but, of course, every single
pastoral visit has its political consequences, as is quite clear in
the visits to Bosnia, Poland and Cuba,'' said the Rev. Luis G.
Ramos, director of students at Mexico City's Dominican School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single papal visit can be manipulated to hide national
problems,'' Ramos said. ``The major problems right now are the
continually rising price of tortillas, milk and gas. The price of
the tortilla has doubled in the past month.''
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has the Catholic Church in Mexico been allowed to
own property and to take an open role in educating its people.
Because the church backed repressive governments during Mexico's
colonial period, it was not allowed certain rights for many years.
Diplomatic relations with the Vatican only were restored in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation is central in Vatican strategy, said Bernardo
Barranco Villafan, president of the Mexican Center for Religious
Studies in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the bridge between South America and North
America,'' he said. ``The South Americans see us as a bit gringo,
and the gringos see us as very South American. ... For the Holy
See, the concept of Latin America has disappeared. It now sees
America as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the pope will use Mexico as a platform to speak to
the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to Mexico, John Paul II's 30-hour St. Louis stop
seems short.
</P>
<P>
   He is visiting the region because it is one of most heavily
Catholic areas in the United States that he has not visited, and
because its archdiocese is headed by his old friend Archbishop
Justin Rigali. Rigali served 30 years in the Vatican before being
named to head the archdiocese in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope is likely to condemn the bombing of Iraq,
urge U.S. bankers to forgive the debts of developing countries,
condemn abortion and press for stronger interfaith relationships.
He is also expected to urge young Catholics to live their faith
daily with such fervor that they may lead the church into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis stop includes a brief meeting with Clinton, but
analysts expect the pontiff to focus on general issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope will be more interested in the American people and
that we not compromise our values, our strong sense of right and
wrong,'' said the Rev. Michael Miller, president of the University
of St. Thomas in Houston. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; When Clinton meets the pope right after the pontiff's jet
lands, there will be a tinge of irony in this, their fourth,
meeting. The pope remains a critic of rampant capitalism, but it is
a buoyant economy that analysts believe is behind Clinton's high
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Their encounter brings together one of the world's foremost
spiritual leaders with one of its most powerful political figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something of a sense of humor about this visit,'' said
the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America and
an expert on the Vatican. ``Bill Clinton probably wishes he was a
medieval king. In medieval times, the king would sin, and he could
go before the pope, kneel down, confess his sins, be absolved, get
a penance and then go on with being king.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, doesn't have that option. In
addition, this is a pope who takes ``on systems, not individuals,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope's chief concern is likely to be urging
that the world's wealthiest nation lead the way in taking the side
of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II's traditional views on birth control, ordaining
women and other issues do not play well with Catholic liberals. But
even his critics credit him with a strong record on human rights
before and during his 20-year pontificate. The determination that
served him well when he helped bring about the fall of communism in
Eastern Europe keeps him going.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights concerns will weave through the pope's visit, said
Bishop Fiorenza.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars predict John Paul II will exercise that strength by
urging all of Latin America to implement democratic reforms and
root out corruption. His effectiveness will be measured only by
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, where the pontiff visited last January, church leaders
report only limited progress toward political reforms since the
papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, analysts are predicting the government will try to
avoid public discussion of its five-year conflict with Zapatista
rebels in southernmost Chiapas state during the pope's visit, even
though this could be President Zedillo's last chance to reignite
the peace process before his term ends in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is John Paul II's first visit to Mexico since the Zapatista
uprising began in January 1994. Church leaders doubt the pontiff
will address the issue directly, though he might bring it up in the
private meeting with Zedillo. But they acknowledge that the pope
always pushes for justice and human rights in his sermons,
especially in economically distressed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit is a bit uncomfortable for government officials,''
said the Rev. Jesus Garza, provincial head of the Redemptorist
Order of priests based in Mexico City. ``They wish the country were
in better condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican church remains vital, marking small annual increases
each year, according to church leaders. But there is division in
its top ranks. Some bishops espouse political activism, while
others follow a traditional church-focused course. The rising clout
of Protestant evangelicals worries many. How significant the issue
is varies from diocese to diocese, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary even more among U.S. Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently have shown that many disagree with the pope's
opposition to abortion, birth control and extending the priesthood
to married men or women. However, it appears liberal church groups
have only limited protests planned in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   So much enthusiasm is associated with a papal trip that too much
protest is counterproductive, said Frances Kissling, president of
Catholics for a Free Choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general feeling is that when the pope is in a country, you
can do a modest amount of activity calling attention to the
problems in the church, but the reality is that while the pope is
in any country, this is a moment for celebration,'' she said.
``Whether people disagree or agree with the pope, they're happy
he's there.''

SCHUMER ANTICIPATES A LONG TRIAL IF WITNESSES ARE CALLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Charles E. Schumer, who argued against
impeaching President Clinton as a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Monday the impeachment trial would last well into
the spring if House prosecutors are allowed to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The former Brooklyn congressman also predicted that the Senate
would fall well short of the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from
office for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If House managers get four or five witnesses, it'll take
months to depose them and bring them before the Senate,'' said
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Then the president obviously will want the same,
and there may be counter-witnesses or re-cross-examination or new
witnesses either side might want to bring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd find it hard to believe we'd finish by May 1st,'' Schumer
added.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer voted against impeachment as a member of the Judiciary
Committee and again on Dec. 19 when the full House approved two
articles of impeachment against Clinton. On Monday, he said the
case argued by the 13 House impeachment managers failed to sway
many in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to have the vote on impeachment on removing the
president right now, I doubt it would get 35 votes,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the momentum is building to hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., acknowledged Monday
that witnesses ``may be inevitable.'' Daschle conceded the Senate
was moving toward having at least some witnesses, despite efforts
by the White House and Senate Democrats to limit the trial to the
existing record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for
trying to conceal his affair with Lewinsky, a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors wrapped up three days of presentations on
Saturday, while Clinton's lawyers will begin their defense on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's lawyers finish their presentation later
this week, senators will submit questions in writing to be read by
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is the presiding
trial officer. That phase could last up to 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under bipartisan ground rules agreed to by lawmakers, the Senate
won't vote on the issue of witnesses until after they consider a
motion to end the trial, which can be offered after the president's
lawyers finish their case and after the question period.
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent senators in both parties, including Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of
the rules committee, believe that a motion to end the trial before
hearing from witnesses will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent 18 years in the House before ousting the incumbent
senator, Alfonse D'Amato, in the November election.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Reader's Digest Association's annual meeting late last
year, Nell Minow, whose Lens fund owns more than $8.5 million worth
of Reader's Digest stock, spoke out about her fund's proposal to
bring the company in line with others in the way it issues shares.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the stock is held in a separate class by
foundations. Ms. Minow argued that the foundations' aversion to
risk had hamstrung the company, which while actually based in
Chappaqua, N.Y., has nearby Pleasantville as its postal address.
Reader's Digest, she said, is years behind the rest of Corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a movie called `Pleasantville,' two young people bring a
black-and-white community stuck in 1958 into the world of modern
reality and color,'' she said at the meeting. ``It is impossible
not to think of that today as we visit Pleasantville, N.Y., to see
whether it, too, will move beyond the 1950s aura in which it seems
to have been floundering.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's proposal, however, was later rejected. Nonetheless,
the effort was a perfect opportunity for Ms. Minow to marry her two
careers and passions.
</P>
<P>
   By day _ or three days a week, to be exact _ she is the public
face of Lens, an activist shareholder firm she co-founded in 1992
to invest in companies that are underperforming for reasons that
Lens thinks it can change, like a board that is reluctant to take
drastic action because it is too cozy with management.
</P>
<P>
   Lens, flush from successes in battles with companies like Sears,
Roebuck, Stone &AMP; Webster and Waste Management, has posted an
average annual return of 25 percent the last six years. Lens
recently doubled its size when Hermes Pensions Management of
Britain announced it would join forces and invest $100 million in
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow is the public advocate for many of Lens' efforts in
part because of her knack for sound bites. She has, for example,
been known to cite the physicist Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle in comparing boards to subatomic particles.``They behave
differently when they are observed,'' she noted, ``and my job is to
let them know that I'm observing them.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also compared corporations to sharks: ``No malevolence,
no intentional harm, just something designed with sublime
efficiency for self-preservation, which is accomplished without any
capacity to factor in the consequences to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Minow has managed to win the respect of many
executives of companies she has taken on. ``She is somebody who is
very clear about what she wants, very logical, very reasonable, but
very determined,'' said Thomas Ryder, the chairman of Reader's
Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow is also known as Movie Mom. Since 1995, she has run a
Web site (www.moviemom.com) on which she reviews current movies and
suggests the best films for families. She has also written for
magazines like Parents, Family Fun and Child.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Avon will publish ``The Movie Mom's Guide to Family
Movies,'' which includes advice on how parents can be more involved
in choosing and watching movies with their children. Among other
things, she recommends a regular ``detox'' of no movies or
television for a week or two so children remain engaged, rather
than numbed, by what they watch.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, holding down one job is tough enough. But Ms.
Minow, 46, is a rare example of someone who is pursuing two
consuming interests simultaneously. And her interest in movies has
helped liven up the often rarefied world of corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, during one effort to persuade a board to see
things her way, she told the directors: ``Remember that scene near
the end of `Frankenstein,' when the people from the village storm
the castle carrying torches? That's what the shareholders are going
to do if you keep going in this direction.''
</P>
<P>
   She has often described chief executives who are in denial about
poor performance as being like the Wizard of Oz, who says, ``Pay no
attention to the man behind the curtain.'' And after Sears reduced
the number of its directors to rebuff an effort by Robert A.G.
Monks, Lens' other co-founder, to join the board, she wrote a
critical article about the company titled, ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Board.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also waiting _ very patiently, mind you _ for the day
somebody calls her with a request to suggest movies for the
ultimate corporate film festival. Her candidates include ``The
Solid Gold Cadillac,'' about a woman who with just 10 shares of
stock topples a corrupt management, ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' which
chronicled General Motors' layoffs in Flint, Mich., ``Wall Street''
(greed is NOT always good), and for its lessons on leadership for
chief executives, ``The Adventures of Robin Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   As worlds apart as her interests in movies and corporate
governance may seem, there are many similarities, Ms. Minow said.
Both movies and companies often start out with a grand vision, but
for reasons that have long intrigued Ms. Minow, something often
gets lost in the execution. So big-budget movies with brand-name
stars and proven directors often flop, and boards and executive
ranks are studded with well-qualified professionals who often fail
to live up to their promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There actually is some consistency in my two passions in my
life,'' she said, characteristically relying on a movie allusion to
explain her point. In a scene from ``Inherit the Wind,'' the movie
based on the Scopes trial, which focused on evolution and the
Bible, Spencer Tracy is cross-examining Fredric March and pins him
down in his interpretation of the Bible as literal truth. The March
character blusters, ``I don't think about what I don't think
about.'' The Tracy character then asks him, ``Do you ever think
about what you DO think about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book and in my interactions with companies,'' she said,
``that is the question I try to get people to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow received some early training in critical thinking from
her parents. She and her two sisters were generally not allowed to
watch television, but her mother and father were big movie fans and
often gathered around the television on Sunday night for the weekly
Disney movie. Her father, in particular, was a tough audience:
Newton Minow, a former chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, called television a ``vast wasteland'' in a famous
speech in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow's interest in movies grew exponentially when at age 16
she came down with a bad case of mononucleosis just before summer
break. She spent the whole summer in bed, a great deal of it
watching a varied diet of movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always loved movies, but I then really learned about
movies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She brought a television, not a stereo, to college, and began
watching an average of a movie a day, a habit she would maintain
for the next 16 years, until her son was born (she has since cut
back to about three a week). In college, she often wrote essays
with a movie playing. ``Ideally, it was a movie I've already seen
once,'' she said. ``It's the perfect way to write a paper.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her career started developing two tracks. She went to law school
_ ``the default protocol in my family'' _ and during summers worked
in federal and state prosecutors' offices in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But she started doubting whether she wanted to be a lawyer, and
sent a script to ``Days of Our Lives.'' She was offered a job as a
writer, but then the boyfriend she had known since high-school,
David Apatoff, asked her to marry him and move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and
then the Office of Management and Budget, studying ``implementation
issues,'' or why good ideas and plans become subverted. She met
Monks, and he asked her to help him start Institutional Shareholder
Services, or ISS, to advise pension funds on how to vote their
corporate proxies on matters relating to shareholder rights. Ms.
Minow, a new mother at the time, told him she only wanted to work a
few days a week. He said fine. She kept the same arrangement when
she left ISS as president and joined Monks to form Lens in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, my decision to work three days a week has resulted
in much more professional success than I would otherwise have had
because I've had to think very creatively about my career.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lens, the strategy for working with companies is fairly
simple. After studying the corporation and its industry, Lens
develops a plan to lift its performance. It then approaches the
company with three options: deal with Lens' plan, come up with a
better plan or explain what is wrong with Lens' plan. If Lens meets
resistance, it will try to rally other large shareholders, using
Ms. Minow's knack for sound bites to galvanize support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nell finds the exact right words, something out of
contemporary culture,'' said Monks, ``that are always better than
all the polysyllabic Harvard words I can manage.''
</P>
<P>
   When many shareholders of Occidental Petroleum tried
unsuccessfully to block the company and its former chairman, Armand
Hammer, from using shareholders' money to build a museum, Ms. Minow
wrote an article for the ISS newsletter in 1990 titled, ``Please
Hammer Don't Hurt Us; Delaware Court to Shareholders: You Can't
Touch This.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from giving her the rare opportunity to make allusions to
rap star M.C. Hammer in an article about corporate governance, the
episode remains fodder for a screenplay that Ms. Minow said she
would like to write someday called ``Hammering Hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Hollywood is for,'' she said. ``I'd rewrite that
one and make it a Rocky story, with the shareholders winning in the
end.''

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Colo. _ Next weekend, skiers here are to inaugurate
the world's highest chair lift. Whisking 1,200 skiers an hour to a
12,700-foot ridge, the lift will offer sweeping views of the
Rockies and challenging runs down the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of changing times in the nation's most popular
skiing state, a Colorado environmentalist is suing, charging that
Loveland Ski Area, the owner of the lift, has violated its federal
permit for building on National Forest Service land.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting logging, mining and cattle grazing on National
Forest lands, environmentalists declared open season this winter on
ski areas, once the environmental good guys. Fueling opposition is
fear that ski area expansions are triggering runaway real-estate
development on adjacent private land.
</P>
<P>
   Many large ski companies are turning to mountain real estate as
a source for dynamic profits in the future. In contrast, the number
of lift tickets sold nationwide each winter has been stagnant for a
decade, hovering around 53 million. In that period, Colorado's
ticket sales increased by about 20 percent. But in a
weather-dependent business, Colorado has seen its ski ticket drop
11 percent this season as some resorts endured their scantiest
Christmas snow in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about skiing, it is about real-estate development,''
said Jonathan Staufer, a shop owner in Vail who is chairman of the
Ski Area Citizens Coalition, a new environmental group.
``Industrial tourism is posing the next major threat to wild places
in Colorado and America.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the High Rockies, signs of growth abound.
</P>
<P>
   Directly below Loveland's new Continental Divide chair lift, but
muffled by a quarter mile of granite, traffic on Interstate 70
regularly slows to a crawl in the Eisenhower Tunnel, a major link
between Colorado's busiest ski areas and greater Denver's 2 million
people. In 25 years, traffic has quadrupled in the tunnel, 60 miles
west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the 75 miles between here and Eagle-Vail Airport, enough home
construction is planned to double the populations of several towns
in five years. A rural airstrip in 1990, the airport is Colorado's
second busiest this winter, offering direct jet service to 13
cities, including New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On public lands, recreation is shaping up as the new
battleground. In the last decade, while the volume of timber cut in
National Forests fell by two-thirds, the number of recreational
visitors jumped by 40 percent. The U.S. Forest Service predicts it
will record 1 billion recreational visits a year by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see lawsuits, not only against oil, gas and mining, but
also to stop recreational use,'' the chief of the Forest Service,
Mike Dombeck, said in Denver recently, after encountering
protesters objecting to a 2,000-acre expansion of Vail into
National Forest land.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where most skiing is done on National Forest land,
the conflict flared into the public eye in October when an
amorphous group, the Environmental Liberation Front, protested the
expansion of Vail's ski slopes by burning three buildings and
damaging four lifts.
</P>
<P>
   But in less dramatic fights, Colorado environmentalists are
lobbying federal agencies to block new ski trails at Keystone
Resort and Breckenridge Ski Resort. Nearby, at Arapahoe Basin, they
are trying to block the installation of a snow-making system that
would fulfill that area's dream of becoming the nation's first to
offer skiing year round.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, environmentalists are fighting
construction of a new ski area, Pelican Butte, in southern Oregon,
and the expansion of Snowbasin in Utah. In recent months, the
Forest Service overrode objections to the expansion of Santa Fe ski
area in New Mexico, but rejected a proposed ski area for Mount
Shasta in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Colorado, in the face of strong local opposition, a
consortium of Vermont and Colorado developers abandoned plans to
build a ski area 10 miles south of Steamboat Springs, which would
have been called Catamount. In addition to the ski slopes, the
developers planned 3,700 new homes and 1,000 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the resources and they had the permits,'' said Susan
Otis, executive director of the Yampa Valley Land Trust. ``But they
knew that in the community there no longer was a desire to have a
new ski area.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers gave the Yampa Valley trust conservation
easements preserving 3,296 acres of pasture and announced plans to
build 40 luxury houses and a lodge at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures show that Colorado has the third-fastest growing
population in the nation, after Nevada and Arizona. Now, defenders
of the fragile lands in the Rockies are also worried that
out-of-state demographic pressures will result in a proliferation
of second-home developments and swelling crowds at ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   On one end, the average age of a second-home buyer in the United
States is 51. Over the next 18 years, 78 million Americans are to
turn 51. Their children number 72 million and are expected to pack
ski areas again. The intermediate group now in their 20's and 30's
numbered only 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over land use is really just starting, because you
are talking of a burgeoning population of residents and visitors,''
said Diane Gansauer, executive director of the Colorado Wildlife
Federation, a conservation group composed largely of hunters and
anglers. ``I don't buy the view of wildlife that accepts deer as
lawn ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   At public hearings in Vail last spring, one resident drew
applause when he said, ``We want to look at trophy elk, not trophy
homes.'' At the hearings, most speakers spoke against the expansion
plans of Vail, the nation's largest ski area.
</P>
<P>
   Critics noted that within 40 miles of Vail, eight ski areas are
already operating, with 126 lifts and 850 trails covering almost
15,000 acres. Vail Resorts is expanding its ski terrain by 19
percent, even though lift ticket sales dropped 5 percent last
winter, to 1.6 million.

 &HT;    South playing high-tech odds

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Celebrating a new century a year early, the Southern
governors of the new millennium have plugged into the vision thing,
promising higher educational standards for a high-tech economy _
and enough gambling money to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Education and technology dominated as themes in inauguration
addresses and state-of-the-state speeches delivered over the last
few days by governors who will lead the South through the 2000
curtain and into the 21st century. On Monday, new Alabama Gov. Don
Siegelman sounded his call for a statewide lottery and promised to
make Alabama ``the education state,'' using lottery dollars. The
Democrat said in his inauguration speech, ``Our children will have
state-of-the-art computers. Our children will have preschool. And
our children will have college scholarships. The people demand it.
Our children deserve it. Alabama needs it. It can be done. It will
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the biggest bow to technology, Republican Gov. Jim
Gilmore of Virginia, where Blacksburg has been called ``the most
wired city in America,'' delivered the nation's first ``Webcast''
of a state-of-the-state address. The governor offered Internet
users his live digital image on Wednesday at either 28,800 bits per
second or 56,600 bps. He vowed to make Virginia ``the Internet
Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, new Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, who, like
Siegelman, has promised a lottery to help pull his state out of the
educational ditch, urged in his inaugural address last week that
citizens join him in a ``children's crusade _ a 21st century
crusade of textbooks and computers and parents and teachers allied
against the enemies of ignorance and indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring the Second Coming or a chance to be president, seven
Southern governors who took office this month expect to be in
office through 2002: Democrats Hodges in South Carolina, Siegelman
in Alabama and Roy Barnes in Georgia; Republicans Jeb Bush in
Florida, George Bush in Texas, Mike Huckabee in Arkansas and Don
Sundquist in Tennessee. Elected in 1997, Gilmore will serve in
Virginia through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Three Southern governors will end their terms this year:
Republicans Mike Foster of Louisiana and Kirk Fordice of
Mississippi, and Democrat Paul Patton of Kentucky. Gov. Jim Hunt of
North Carolina, a Democrat, ends his fourth term next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatizing the imminence of the turn of the century, Hodges
provided a countdown to his inauguration audience in Columbia on
Wednesday: ``Three hundred fifty-two days, twelve hours. As I
prepared to take the oath to become South Carolina's 114th
governor, I realized that's how close we are _ 352 days, 12 hours _
to the year 2000, what most consider the beginning of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, many political prognosticators predict, at least one of
the Governors Bush _ probably George, beginning his second term in
Texas _ will be running for president. It was his and brother Jeb's
father, President Bush, who, in groping for a phrase for foresight
and inventiveness, pinned ``the vision thing'' on the aspirations
of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But visionaries do not always see eye-to-eye. In Georgia, Gov.
Barnes talks of trains as a key part of a new transportation
philosophy. In Florida, Gov. Bush last week abruptly killed state
funding for a proposed 200-mph train from Miami to Orlando and
Tampa. ``There are better alternatives for $70 million per year
compounded at 4 percent,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With lottery fever running high in the nonlottery states of
South Carolina and Alabama, desperate to improve education,
Tennessee's governor faces the prospect of being surrounded by
gambling states in another two or three years amid growing concerns
about that state's educational system. The Governor's Council on
Excellence in Higher Education said in a draft report last week
that the Volunteer state needs at least $441 million to improve
public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist, beginning his second term, steered away from the
lottery issue in his inauguration speech Saturday, focusing instead
on protecting the environment and reforming government. ``We have
the opportunity to make history anew by reforming our government to
meet the demands of the Technological Age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Siegelman hit the lottery issue head-on in his
inauguration address Monday in Montgomery, where he took the oath
of office from outgoing Georgia Gov. Zell Miller, who pushed
through the Georgia lottery that funds HOPE scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who think a lottery is wrong, I want you to
know I respect your deeply held beliefs. I understand that I cannot
sway your convictions, nor would I try,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me tell you what I think is wrong. I think it is wrong
for a working mother to hold down two or three jobs, to work her
heart out, to scrimp and save trying to make ends meet with no
hope, no hope she will ever be able to send her son or her daughter
to college. That's what I think is wrong.'' In South Carolina,
Hodges also sought to personalize the frustrations of citizens who
cannot afford to advance their educations, by drawing on his early
labor in a textile mill _ a company he ultimately served as legal
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day, every day, I shouldered cloth or tended the card
machines that turned raw cotton into fiber. Around me worked men
and women with little or no formal education,'' he said. ``Almost
all wanted a better life for their children and grandchildren. They
knew the wisdom of the old saying, `Education is the one thing in
life that can't be taken away from you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let those good people, and everyone like them _ we
cannot let them down. We've got to do a better job educating our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, life in some Southern states is pretty rosy
already, as Jeb Bush, in a speech emphasizing a policy of
inclusion, reminded those who watched his inauguration in
Tallahassee last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our shores, men have traveled to the mountains of the
moon,'' Florida's new governor declared. ``Our population has
increased more than 25-fold, and we have an economy that is the
16th largest in the world, ahead of entire countries such as India
and Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   From the height of optimism to the deepest worries, the Southern
governors aired their views. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ ALABAMA, Gov. Don Siegelman, from his inauguration address:
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, the waiting is over. Too much time wasted. Too many
promises broken. Too many dreams shattered. We will dare great
things. We will try new things. If they don't work, we will try
something else. . .
</P>
<P>
   My parents worked as hard as anyone, but could not go to
college. Not because they lacked the skills or the knowledge, but
for one reason and one reason only: They didn't have the money.
</P>
<P>
   Together, we will shatter the financial barriers to college and
open the doors of higher education to every Alabama family. Any
student who works hard, stays in school, stays out of trouble, and
graduates from high school, will have earned the right to go to
college, tuition free. Nothing will hold them back. This will be
our HOPE college scholarship program. And this is my HOPE for
celebrating Alabama children.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Alabama today a child is born. Eighteen years from
now it will cost that family $96,000 to educate that single child
at a public college. $96,000. No child should fail because of the
lack of money. I want every child, white or black, rich or poor, to
have the same hope and expectation that they can attend college,
get a good job and provide for their family's future. If _ if _
they are willing to work for it, HOPE will be there. We will
fulfill the dreamer's dream. Every Alabama child will be judged by
the content of his character and the content of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ VIRGINIA, Gov. Jim Gilmore, from his State of the Commonweath
speech:
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, optimism lives, opportunity abounds. We have
entered the last year of this millennium in a state of unparalleled
prosperity and promise. We're working more _ and earning more _
than at any time in nearly 30 years. We're developing the tools of
technology that will lead our nation into the new economy of the
Information Age . . .
</P>
<P>
   As we address the needs of Virginia's tobacco heritage, we must
also look forward to a new economy. We must be more competitive
with other states and look beyond America's borders. We must meet
employers' needs for a highly skilled, highly educated and
plentiful work force. We must understand that our economy is strong
only when each region shares in the prosperity of all others . . .
</P>
<P>
   My administration is keeping Virginia's economy and government
on the cutting edge of the global technology revolution. I
appointed the nation's first cabinet-level Secretary of Technology,
Don Upson, who is advancing Virginia as a global technology leader
. . . The Internet is the empowerment tool of the 21st century. It
provides unlimited information and unlimited opportunities to
improve every person's life. My Information Technology Commission
has recommended to me the nation's first statewide Internet policy.
The Commission's policy recommendations stay true to market-driven
principles and also embrace our Virginia principles of freedom and
democracy. Web-enabled government, privacy, security and the
protection of children _ these cutting-edge Internet issues are
addressed by my comprehensive legislation. I urge you to support my
package of Internet legislation and seal Virginia's leadership
position as the Internet Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   _ SOUTH CAROLINA, Gov. Jim Hodges, from his inauguration
address:
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hodges administration is committed to improving
education without tax increases, we must adopt a statewide lottery
with all the revenues targeted for specific educational needs. We
must begin by aggressively moving to cut class size in the early
grades and implementing a strong pre-kindergarten program. Lottery
dollars, coupled with a commitment to make education the top
spending priority in our state, can help create a truly superior
educational experience. South Carolina's children deserve nothing
less . . .
</P>
<P>
   When I was 3, with the encouragement of my father, my mother
went back to college. With three young children, her only times to
study were early in the morning and late at night. But she kept at
it _ course after course _ until she finally earned her bachelor's
degree. But that was just the beginning. The same year I was
graduated from high school, my mother earned her Ph.D. What
followed was a distinguished career as an educator helping many
nontraditional students like herself realize their dreams. My
mother never gave up on her dreams; she never gave up on her dreams
for me. Join me, so that our children never have to give up on
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   _ FLORIDA, Gov. Jeb Bush, from his inauguration address:
</P>
<P>
   Faith. Family. Friends. These are what's best. These will
endure. We should trust in these more than we trust in government.
State government, now and forever, must respect and nurture and
rely on these enduring institutions so that we can unleash their
amazing potential.
</P>
<P>
   Public servants must have the humility to listen to and trust
Florida's head, heart and soul. Only then will the body be strong.
Government will be unencumbered to make a true difference where it
is most needed and where it can be most effective: Education,
public safety, public works, and the protection of the frailest and
weakest among us. Give to Floridians a state government that makes
these few precious things the core of its being, and we can match
the lofty challenges illuminated by the wonder of a new tomorrow.
We can see that children learn a year's worth of knowledge in a
year's worth of time, and work with unbridled determination to
ensure that no child in our education system is left behind. . . .
For these are the principles that will guide us. I want state
government to be an ally, not an adversary of positive change
within each community. I want to protect people, not bureaucracies.
I want state government to be more respectful of the earnings of
Florida's families, not more desirous. I want our leaders more
trustful of the choices of our citizens, not more suspicious. And,
I want to rely on the rich debate afforded by diversity, not the
sterile monologue of insular politics.
</P>
<P>
   _ TENNESSEE, Gov. Don Sundquist, from his inauguration speech:
</P>
<P>
   We must build a system of education _ at the elementary,
secondary and collegiate levels _ that will teach and train
Tennesseans of all ages to lead and serve the world of tomorrow. We
must maintain a growing economy that rewards courage and
creativity, that generates jobs, attracts investment, provides
opportunity and promotes the prosperity of every Tennessean. We
must ensure that Tennessee has a health care system on which every
Tennessean can rely, which every Tennessean can afford and which
provides the quality of care that every Tennessean deserves. We
must continually invest in a system of transportation - on land,
through the water and in the air - that moves people and products
safely and efficiently around the state and into the future . . .
</P>
<P>
   We must keep Tennessee beautiful. This commitment cannot be
government's alone but must involve all of us as fellow citizens of
this natural paradise we call home. So I will propose that we mark
the new millennium by making Tennessee look good. Through simple
acts of environmental protection, reclaiming and maintaining the
common areas that are visible, physical symbols of community _ our
parks and playgrounds, our roadsides, our rivers, lakes and streams
and even our vacant lots. . . . It is my hope that one of the
lasting legacies of my service in this office will be a more
beautiful Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   _ ARKANSAS, Gov. Mike Huckabee, from his State of the State
address:
</P>
<P>
   One of the things we need to do here is repeal some of the
restricting legislation that makes it very difficult for schools to
operate because they are busy trying to keep up with legislative
mandates that they don't have time to give full attention to the
students. We also need to make sure we never, ever go backward in
per pupil funding. We won't propose it. And even if we did, you
wouldn't allow it. And I think that's one thing upon which we can
readily agree today and drive a stake in the ground and say
Arkansas students will have more money, not less money. . .
</P>
<P>
   As we focus on education, Smart Start will help our kids get
started right. But if they do what we want them to do, we need to
make sure that at the end of that education there is some reason
for them to go on. We are going to propose an autonomy of our
technical schools, not only to give them the opportunity to better
train our people for the work force but to give us a greater level
of accountability for those technical schools. . . . I'm going to
ask you for something of significance when I ask you to join and
expand the Academic Challenge Scholarship program. Right now, that
scholarship program doesn't go to any great value to families who
earn more than $35,000 or $40,000 a year. There are a lot of
families in Arkansas who earn more than that but struggle to get
their kids in college. As a result, we are losing a lot of our good
kids. They are going out of state. I want to keep the best and
brightest right here in Arkansas. . . . I'll ask you to do it by
raising that limit to $70,000 so more students in Arkansas will
decide that staying here is a good investment.

GEORGETOWN, Colo.: 1.6 million. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a company close to Vail Resorts, Turkey Creek
LLC, successfully bid $42 million for a 2,900-acre parcel of
private land that is a mile from the resort's new expanded area.
The ski company has an option to buy half of Turkey Creek.
</P>
<P>
   And Vail Resorts and Intrawest Corp., a Canadian company, are
partners in the construction of 4,600 housing units at the Keystone
ski area. Intrawest has a total $1 billion in construction planned
at the nine ski areas it owns in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is to focus on real estate, while quietly selling
some ski tickets on the side,'' said Sandy Shea, a director of High
Country Citizens' Alliance, a group that opposes a 300-home
development planned for private land next to Crested Butte Mountain
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Crested Butte offers free skiing early in the season
to fill company-owned hotel rooms, Shea added: ``I don't think any
ski area is making money off tickets. Most of the money is made
from real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Forest Service approves ski slopes near private land,
the value of the private land jumps. Looking at ski lifts that
serve mediocre slopes near vacation homes, some Colorado
environmentalists derisively call them ``real estate lifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ski-in, ski-out real estate commands a 25 percent premium,''
said Neil Adams, a real-estate broker in Crested Butte. ``When you,
your wife and your five kids decide to go skiing, do you want to
play taxi driver? Your kids can come home for lunch, no problem.
Just ski right up to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The ski industry describes as minuscule the 20,000 acres of ski
area expansions planned on National Forest lands around the nation.
About one-quarter of the nation's 525 ski areas operate on Forest
Service land, leasing about 190,000 acres out of total National
Forest holdings of 190 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that on one-tenth of one percent of Forest Service
land, 30 million people enjoy a winter recreation experience,''
said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry group based outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of a Forest Service policy in Colorado to favor
expansion of existing ski areas over the construction of new ones,
and fights waged by environmentalists against new ski areas, the
last one to open on National Forest land in the state was Beaver
Creek, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While ski areas are magnets for growth, not all of the growth in
second homes in the Colorado high country is tied to skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to other areas of Colorado, where there are no ski
areas, and trophy homes are being built,'' said Lyle Laverty, the
Forest Service's top official for Colorado. ``Part of the
attraction is being close to a National Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit against Loveland, the environmentalist, Steven
Hannon, asserts that the Forest Service awarded permit for a
1,700-foot surface lift and then allowed the ski area to nearly
triple the length of the lift and to change it to a chair lift.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Abrahamson, the general manager of the ski area, which is
fighting the suit in Federal District Court in Denver, said: ``The
Forest Service approved putting skiers on top of the ridge. We
followed the process from A to Z.''
</P>
<P>
   While ski area operators say they can work with mainstream
environmentalists, they say they are worried that the fight is
being escalated by fringe elements.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Earth First Journal, a radical publication,
applauds the arsons at Vail as ``a rational, overtly political and
defensive act undertaken by Mother Earth's freedom fighters, not
terrorists, in face of overwhelming odds.'' The newspaper also
devoted a full page to instructing readers how to make the kind of
Molotov cocktails that caused $12 million in fire damages at Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Walcher, Colorado's newly appointed director of the state
Department of Natural Resources, has watched the Rocky Mountain
economy shift dramatically to tourism from mining, grazing and
logging, partly because of environmental opposition to extractive
industries on public lands. Now he worries, he said, that: ``Some
people want to slow tourism down, then shut it down. It would be a
horrible mistake not to take them seriously.''

FRED HOPKINS, 51, EXPERIMENTAL JAZZ BASSIST
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jazz bassist Fred Hopkins, an important figure of the new
jazz in New York during the 1970s and 80's, died on Jan. 7 at the
University of Chicago Hospital. He was 51 and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, said his mother, Lula Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Always playing behind a band leader, Hopkins had a thick, dark
sound influenced by Jimmy Garrison and Paul Chambers. He improvised
powerfully whether the music had chord changes or not, and the
music he was involved with, inspired by the energy of free jazz,
was compositionally ambitious, too.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a dramatic urgency to bands that included the trio
Air and ensembles led by David Murray, Henry Threadgill, Muhal
Richard Abrams, Arthur Blythe and Oliver Lake. Hopkins also had a
decadelong musical partnership with the cellist Deidre Murray. He
made his name as a musician in New York, living there from 1975 to
1996; recently, he moved back to his hometown, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was one of many jazz musicians who studied under Walter
Dyett, an imperious, inspiring music teacher at DuSable High School
in Chicago. After his early training, Hopkins played in the Chicago
Civic Orchestra and studied with Joseph Guastafeste, the principal
bassist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In his mid-20s, he
started to play with Abrams and some members of the Association for
the Advancement of Creative Musicians, an influential collective of
experimental jazz-based players, though he did not formally join
the organization until he moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But in the underground jazz scene that converged around
musicians' loft spaces, Hopkins was most often associated with Air,
including Threadgill and the drummer Steve McCall. Formed in 1971
in Chicago as a one-shot affair to provide music for a play about
Scott Joplin, Air was an unusual ensemble band, with liquid roles
for the musicians, an impressive rhythm section and a humorous,
playful take on the problem of jazz composition.
</P>
<P>
   Air got together again in New York in 1975 and made nearly a
dozen albums through the 1980s. Meanwhile, Hopkins appeared on such
other significant albums of the period as Murray's ``Ballads,'' the
Henry Threadgill Sextett's ``Just the Facts and Pass the Bucket,''
``Hearinga Suite'' and Craig Harris' ``Black Bone.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, he is survived by his brothers,
Allan, Joel, Dennis and Brian, all of Chicago; and his sisters,
Jacqueline Graham and Cynthia Hopkins, both of Oak Park, Ill.

CLINTON'S LEGAL TEAM TO BEGIN ITS DEFENSE IN SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal team plans to begin
defending him against impeachment Tuesday with a two-pronged attack
against the arguments by House Republicans who want to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, leader of the team of
government and private lawyers, will open the three-day defense,
which the president's defenders say will ``point out significant
holes,'' in the case against Clinton. His defenders also will argue
that, even if true, the perjury and obstruction of justice charges
do not merit terminating his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's lawyers will argue against removal of a
politically popular president whose job performance continues to
receive high marks, an argument bolstered by a poll released Monday
showing that two-thirds of U.S. adults oppose his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Ruff's presentation before the Senate, the
president _ in one of the more ironic moments of the impeachment
saga _ makes his annual trip to the Capitol to deliver his State of
the Union address to a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. EST, Clinton will mount the rostrum of the House of
Representatives, the Republican-dominated body that formally
accused him of lying under oath and obstruction of justice in
trying to conceal an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Clinton will lay out an agenda for the coming year to an audience
that includes the 100 senators who will decide whether he should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is unusual, it's never happened before, but then a lot
of things have been firsts over the last year,'' said Rep. George
Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican and one of the House managers
prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the nation's 42nd president, is only the second to be
tried in the Senate. Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868
ended with his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing a thorough defense showing that the case
presented against the president was not supported by the facts (in
the report by independent counsel Kenneth Starr) or the law,'' said
White House counsel spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to point out significant holes in the presentation by
the Republican managers, as well as a misleading and overreaching
characterization of the evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster those claims, the legal team apparently considered
asking some Democratic House members from the judiciary committee
to accompany them to the Senate, although no firm plans were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing perceived weaknesses in the House case and stressing
Clinton's technical innocence, however, could risk raising
questions that can be resolved only by calling witnesses,
particularly former presidential paramour Lewinsky. Many Democrats
and the White House oppose that step.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.,
acknowledged that witnesses ``may be inevitable.'' At the same
time, Daschle said, he remains opposed to seeking more testimony,
but he conceded that the political momentum was moving toward
summoning some witnesses to testify during the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart continued his criticism of
any plan to bring witnesses to the trial, saying such a step would
``only extend and delay this process.'' Many of them have already
been deposed and have testified over 20 times, Lockhart complained.
``It boggles the mind a bit to try to understand how someone
testifying for the 10th time, the 23rd time, or the ninth time,
might provide any clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies in the impeachment fight, including Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., have begun suggesting that if witnesses are to
be called, then Starr and Linda Tripp should be summoned. A little
over a year ago, Tripp's secret tape recordings of conversations
with Lewinsky were used by Starr to seek expansion of his
investigation of Clinton's business dealings to include his affair
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the defense presented by Clinton's
team will attack what is seen as weak points in the evidence _ all
of it was gathered during a grand jury investigation overseen by
Starr _ that Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury and
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an emphasis on statements by Clinton friend Vernon
Jordan, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Lewinsky, key
figures in the obstruction of justice allegation, that the
president never specifically asked them to lie.
</P>
<P>
   To support Clinton's claim that he misled but did not lie to the
grand jury, the president's lawyers plan to focus on grand jury
testimony by Lewinsky in which she said she didn't consider their
relationship to be sex, just ``fooling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the president's lawyers will challenge the prosecution's
claims that efforts to get Lewinsky a job were linked to her
potential testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. The
defense plans to argue that an accurate look at the timing of the
job search leads to the interpretation that it was simply an effort
to help a young person at the beginning of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also will deny charges that Clinton
orchestrated the hiding of gifts he'd given Lewinsky, arguing that
he gave her gifts even after knowing she was to be a witness in the
Jones case. Clinton lawyers will stress that neither Lewinsky nor
Currie, who at one point retrieved the gifts, say Clinton ordered
it as alleged by House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Monday found that fewer than one-third of U.S.
adults are paying close attention to the Senate trial, which was
dominated last week by the House managers' three-day presentation
of their case against Clinton. Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed
said the trial has not changed their opinions about whether Clinton
should be forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 14-18 telephone poll of 1,200 adults, conducted by the
Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press, found 63 percent
approve of Clinton's performance in office, down from 71 percent in
December in the wake of the House vote to impeach the president.
Two-thirds of those surveyed want Clinton to remain in office, and
53 percent are satisfied with the way things are going in the
country _ up from 46 percent a year ago.

POPE TO VISIT MEXICO CITY, ST. LOUIS 

</HEADLINE>

(Moved in ``a'' and ``i'' categories) 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's visit to Mexico and the United States, which
begins Friday, brings an aging church patriarch to two of the
world's most Catholic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Only Brazil has more Roman Catholics than Mexico, which has 86.3
million. The United States has 61.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   To believers in both nations, John Paul II is literally Jesus
Christ's representative on earth. Even if they disagree with him,
his opinions on secular and sacred issues matter. As sovereign of
the Vatican, he commands the respect accorded any visiting head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's five-day visit to Mexico City is expected to attract
1 million visitors and to cost the local archdiocese more than $1.3
million. Officials say they cannot estimate the visit's total cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost to the archdiocese is high in a nation struggling
with high crime in its capital city, a beleaguered economy, ongoing
ethnic and religious conflicts, extreme poverty and government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, he's going to talk about the poor and its
problems,'' said Brian Smith, a religion and ethics professor with
expertise on Latin America at the University of Wisconsin at Ripon.
``But he's also probably going to raise the issue of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated costs of the papal visit to St. Louis range as high as
$5 million with, at least, 100,000 visitors expected.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting the pope in St. Louis on behalf of the nation's 300
Catholic bishops will be Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of
the national bishops' conference and leader of 1 million Catholics
in the Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza predicted that the pope will decry abortion, capital
punishment and euthanasia, encouraging Catholics ``to bring the
moral values of the Gospel into the society of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in the United States, citizens confront the
impeachment trial of a still popular president. In a recent Gallup
Poll, Americans named President Clinton the most popular man in the
United States, with the pope coming in second. The two will meet
during the pope's 30-hour stop in St. Louis on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason for the pope's visit is to outline his
response to the Synod of the Bishops for America, held at the
Vatican in late 1997. It brought together Catholic bishops from two
continents to explore common concerns ranging from poverty and
foreign debt in Latin America to declining morality in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's ``apostolic exhortation,'' a sermon responding to the
synod, is expected to address a cross section of social justice
issues, including the rights of indigenous peoples throughout the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Frail and stooped shouldered, John Paul is making his 85th
pastoral journey outside Italy. At age 78, he is a far cry from the
robust, dynamic pontiff who won U.S. and Mexican hearts on his
first tours of each nation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But he keeps a grueling schedule, still enjoys meeting people
and remains sharp-witted, according to U.S. bishops. Because of his
age and declining health, this trip's schedule is less crammed than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, his itinerary includes a courtesy visit with
President Ernesto Zedillo, celebrating Mass at the Basilica of Our
Lady of Guadalupe, visiting a hospital and attending a rally. On
his first visit to Mexico in January 1979, just months after he was
elected pope, he crammed 26 events into a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pastoral visit, but, of course, every single
pastoral visit has its political consequences, as is quite clear in
the visits to Bosnia, Poland and Cuba,'' said the Rev. Luis G.
Ramos, director of students at Mexico City's Dominican School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single papal visit can be manipulated to hide national
problems,'' Ramos said. ``The major problems right now are the
continually rising price of tortillas, milk and gas. The price of
the tortilla has doubled in the past month.''
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has the Catholic Church in Mexico been allowed to
own property and to take an open role in educating its people.
Because the church backed repressive governments during Mexico's
colonial period, it was not allowed certain rights for many years.
Diplomatic relations with the Vatican only were restored in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation is central in Vatican strategy, said Bernardo
Barranco Villafan, president of the Mexican Center for Religious
Studies in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the bridge between South America and North
America,'' he said. ``The South Americans see us as a bit gringo,
and the gringos see us as very South American. ... For the Holy
See, the concept of Latin America has disappeared. It now sees
America as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the pope will use Mexico as a platform to speak to
the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to Mexico, John Paul II's 30-hour St. Louis stop
seems short.
</P>
<P>
   He is visiting the region because it is one of most heavily
Catholic areas in the United States that he has not visited, and
because its archdiocese is headed by his old friend Archbishop
Justin Rigali. Rigali served 30 years in the Vatican before being
named to head the archdiocese in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope is likely to condemn the bombing of Iraq,
urge U.S. bankers to forgive the debts of developing countries,
condemn abortion and press for stronger interfaith relationships.
He is also expected to urge young Catholics to live their faith
daily with such fervor that they may lead the church into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis stop includes a brief meeting with Clinton, but
analysts expect the pontiff to focus on general issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope will be more interested in the American people and
that we not compromise our values, our strong sense of right and
wrong,'' said the Rev. Michael Miller, president of the University
of St. Thomas in Houston. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; When Clinton meets the pope right after the pontiff's jet
lands, there will be a tinge of irony in this, their fourth,
meeting. The pope remains a critic of rampant capitalism, but it is
a buoyant economy that analysts believe is behind Clinton's high
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Their encounter brings together one of the world's foremost
spiritual leaders with one of its most powerful political figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something of a sense of humor about this visit,'' said
the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America and
an expert on the Vatican. ``Bill Clinton probably wishes he was a
medieval king. In medieval times, the king would sin, and he could
go before the pope, kneel down, confess his sins, be absolved, get
a penance and then go on with being king.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, doesn't have that option. In
addition, this is a pope who takes ``on systems, not individuals,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope's chief concern is likely to be urging
that the world's wealthiest nation lead the way in taking the side
of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II's traditional views on birth control, ordaining
women and other issues do not play well with Catholic liberals. But
even his critics credit him with a strong record on human rights
before and during his 20-year pontificate. The determination that
served him well when he helped bring about the fall of communism in
Eastern Europe keeps him going.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights concerns will weave through the pope's visit, said
Bishop Fiorenza.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars predict John Paul II will exercise that strength by
urging all of Latin America to implement democratic reforms and
root out corruption. His effectiveness will be measured only by
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, where the pontiff visited last January, church leaders
report only limited progress toward political reforms since the
papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, analysts are predicting the government will try to
avoid public discussion of its five-year conflict with Zapatista
rebels in southernmost Chiapas state during the pope's visit, even
though this could be President Zedillo's last chance to reignite
the peace process before his term ends in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is John Paul II's first visit to Mexico since the Zapatista
uprising began in January 1994. Church leaders doubt the pontiff
will address the issue directly, though he might bring it up in the
private meeting with Zedillo. But they acknowledge that the pope
always pushes for justice and human rights in his sermons,
especially in economically distressed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit is a bit uncomfortable for government officials,''
said the Rev. Jesus Garza, provincial head of the Redemptorist
Order of priests based in Mexico City. ``They wish the country were
in better condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican church remains vital, marking small annual increases
each year, according to church leaders. But there is division in
its top ranks. Some bishops espouse political activism, while
others follow a traditional church-focused course. The rising clout
of Protestant evangelicals worries many. How significant the issue
is varies from diocese to diocese, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary even more among U.S. Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently have shown that many disagree with the pope's
opposition to abortion, birth control and extending the priesthood
to married men or women. However, it appears liberal church groups
have only limited protests planned in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   So much enthusiasm is associated with a papal trip that too much
protest is counterproductive, said Frances Kissling, president of
Catholics for a Free Choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general feeling is that when the pope is in a country, you
can do a modest amount of activity calling attention to the
problems in the church, but the reality is that while the pope is
in any country, this is a moment for celebration,'' she said.
``Whether people disagree or agree with the pope, they're happy
he's there.''

 &HT;    Atlanta fans hoping to go to Super Bowl discovering sticker
shockBy Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For fans hoping to travel to Miami to see Super Bowl
XXXIII live, it would help to be making the same kind of money as
the players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a tour package that includes a game ticket _
usually a crummy one at that _ starts at about $2,500, a price that
could cool the ardor of the most fevered Falcons fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, I think, are in sticker shock right now,'' said Cary
Dean, president of Esoteric Sports Tours in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Monday, Dean's company had already booked about half the
seats on a chartered flight to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents across metro Atlanta - and the country - were
flooded with calls from fans hoping to follow the Falcons to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   AAA Travel Agency, which advertises itself as the official Super
Bowl Tour of the Atlanta Falcons, got more than 200 telephone calls
Monday, said travel manager Rachelle Rabinowitz. And the volume was
expected to get heavier, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets + Travel, a sports tour company based in Indianapolis,
got 2,100 phone calls from the Atlanta area from the time Morten
Andersen's field goal split the uprights Sunday through
mid-afternoon Monday, said Jeff Kaplan, company CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've never seen before,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   The package being offered by AAA Travel includes four-night
hotel accommodations, round-trip airfare to Fort Lauderdale, ground
transfers and admission to the NFL Experience and NFL Players
Party. The cost, depending where you stay, is $1,599 to $1,849 per
person, double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually getting into the game will cost an additional $1,350 to
$2,850 a head.
</P>
<P>
   Esoteric Sports Tours' package, available through the company
and area travel agents, includes charter flight, three-night
accommodations, rental car and charter bus transportation to the
game. The cost is $1,099 to $1,299 per person, double occupancy.
Tickets are an extra $1,375 to $1,575.
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't care about seeing the game live, said JoAnn
Starks, an agent with Duluth Travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `Just get me there and get me a room,'''
Starks said. ``They will just go hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wanting to go by themselves faces a challenge tougher
than stopping Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis, travel
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is not really a fan event anymore,'' said James
Amerson of Spectacular Sport Specials in New Orleans. ``This is a
corporate event and they book well in advance. It's almost not
about who is playing. It's just the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Most lodging near the stadium, which is between Miami and Fort
Lauderdale, has been booked for months, if not years, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for cheap airfares will likely have to fly to
Orlando, Tampa or Fort Myers, all several hours' drive from Miami,
said Clara Bosonetto, a travel consultant who writes a column for
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When booking a package, Bosonetto said, make sure you're dealing
with a reputable company. Ask if they are a member of the
International Association of Travel Agents, she said, ``and it's
not a bad idea to ask for references.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is you don't want to pay anyone with
a check or money order,'' she said. Paying by credit card offers
consumers some protection from rip-off artists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost, plenty of Falcon fans will make the trip,
travel agents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the type of thing,'' said Rabinowtiz of AAA Travel,
``that if you want to go, you'll pay any price.''

SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER CONCEDES WITNESSES ARE LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IMPEACH-REPUBS, IMPEACH-LOBBY, IMPEACH-SANTORUM) 
(pr) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said on
Monday that it ``appears to be inevitable'' that the Senate will
vote, probably along party lines, to depose witnesses in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And if Senate Republicans push to hear live testimony, Daschle
added, Democrats might object to placing any strict limits on which
witnesses the prosecutors could summon, suggesting that he would
encourage a drawn-out process aimed at embarrassing Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to give them wide latitude about what witnesses
should be called,'' Daschle said in telephone interview. ``I don't
think it's appropriate to dictate to either side how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Democrats are not in the majority, Daschle's only real
leverage is to threaten to allow the Senate proceedings to become
as partisan as the impeachment vote was in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial procedures agreed to by the two parties, the
Senate will take two votes in late January after opening arguments
and questioning from senators. Those votes will be on whether to
dismiss the case and whether to depose witnesses. After taking
depositions, if they are approved, the Senate would vote on which
witnesses, if any, should give live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and the House Republican managers have
narrowed their differences on the quesioning of witnesses after
senators warned the prosecutors to keep their witness list short.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle repeated his view, shared by most Democrats, that
witnessess are unnecessary. Before last week's trial arguments, the
45 Senate Democrats held on to a slim hope that they could stay
united and muster six Republican defections to dismiss the case or,
failing that, defeat a vote to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors' presentations, which even many
Democrats acknowledged were more effective than they had expected,
dashed any Democratic hope of dismissing the case. Some influential
Democrats said on Monday that Republicans would probably use their
majority to push through a vote to depose a limited number of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the case,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said, ``Given the comments of Republicans, it appears to
be inevitable that witnesses will be deposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's comments suggest that the Democrats will try to turn
their tactical retreat on witnesses into a fresh partisan assault,
accusing Republicans of dragging out a scandal with little chance
that witnesses will clear up conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, welcomed
Daschle's comments on witnesses, but disputed the notion that
hearing witnesses would unduly prolong the trial. ``If everyone
works hard,'' said the spokesman, John Czwartacki, ``there's no
reason this will have to extend beyond February, unless someone
decided to play partisan politics and drag this process out''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House lawyers were putting the final touches on
their opening arguments, set to begin when the trial resumes on
Tuesday. President Clinton's defense has been alloted three days,
after which senators will have 16 hours over two days to ask
questions of both sides through Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said on Monday that the
White House remained opposed to calling witnesses but added that if
the Senate allowed House prosecutors to do so, the president's
lawyers might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boggles the mind a bit to try to understand how someone
testifying for the 10th time or the 23rd time or the 9th time can
provide any more clarity,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House managers insist on witnesses and the Senate
approves them, certainly we will look at calling witnesses,''
Lockhart said. ``Either way we are looking at a process that is
extended and delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House confirmed on Monday that Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel, would open the president's defense on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruff is a wise choice because he comes across as totally
honest, very shrewd and very smart,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
heads the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House is considering asking Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee, including Thomas Barrett of
Wisconsin, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Rick Boucher of
Virginia, to argue in Clinton's defense at the trial, congressional
aides said. House Democrats refused to join the 13-Republican House
prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers are expected to mount a vigorous
challenge to the House prosecutors' case on the facts, on the law
and on the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans warned in interviews that the managers'
strong showing increased the pressure on the White House. ``It's
important for the White House to recognize that this is their
opportunity to refute the case laid out by the House managers,''
said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. ``They can't treat this
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, added, ``This atmosphere is much
more serious and somber and has allowed the House managers, in the
eyes of even some Democrats, to come across no longer as being the
partisan harpoon-carriers out of the black pit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, senators will question the opposing counsels. Lott,
the majority leader, and Daschle, the minority leader, have agreed
to divide the 16 hours equally between Republicans and Democrats,
switching back and forth every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Each caucus will review its questions in advance to reduce
repetition. Before each query, Rehnquist is expected to name the
senator who wanted it asked, Czwartacki said. Senate Republicans
were preparing a data bank of questions, and so far, had collected
about 50 from lawmakers for consideration, Hatch said.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO OFFER FULL AGENDA IN STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH
 &HT;    830&AMP;add. With UNION-SOCIAL.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after White House lawyers wrap up Day One of
their defense in the Senate impeachment trial Tuesday, President
Clinton will take his case directly to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   With some 60 million Americans expected to watch the annual
State of the Union address, the question on many people's minds
will be how Clinton will sally forth into the eerie atmospherics of
the House chamber. Just last month, he was impeached there on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice and is now on trial
before the other body that will be present, the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But as he launches the new legislative year, Clinton isn't
expected to mention the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the speech is crafted to highlight six years of peace
and prosperity, and to outline policy initiatives on everything
from nuclear weapons and Social Security to long-term illness and
lousy schools.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Clinton's remarks, however, will be the argument that
his leadership and continued focus on bread-and-butter issues far
outweigh the moral shortcomings that have shadowed the White House
for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president will present a lot of ideas on how we move this
country forward,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters Monday, ''and we look forward to beginning Wednesday
morning working with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the agenda Clinton will outline in his speech, beginning
at 9 p.m. EST, has been previewed in White House events or leaks
over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He'll call for $100 billion over the next six years in increased
defense spending, for example, reiterate last year's call for a
bipartisan plan to fix the financially troubled Social Security
system, and propose to restructure some $20 billion in annual
education spending to encourage national standards in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promised to seek $6.2 billion over the next five
years to help families that provide long-term health care for the
seriously ill or disabled. Aides said Clinton also would press one
more time for national legislation to raise cigarette taxes and
restrict tobacco marketing efforts that target youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will be one of our top priorities in the new Congress,''
Clinton's top domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to address a haunting post Cold War security threat,
Clinton is expected to ask Congress for $4.2 billion over the next
five years, in increased funding for a program to help safeguard
nuclear weapons and research facilities in Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond what has been previewed, Lockhart told reporters the
speech _ in the works for more than a month _ would contain
unannounced proposals ''that will knock your socks off.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton has spoken of ''an American renaissance''
under his leadership. At a time of global economic turmoil, the
U.S. economy is forging ahead _ private economists estimate the
economy grew at about 4 percent in 1998 _ with an expansion that's
nearly eight years old. Unemployment, inflation and interest rates
are at their lowest levels in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The glowing economic performance enabled the federal government
to show a budget surplus _ expected to top $76 billion in 1999 _
after three decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will certainly dwell on those achievements, taking
credit for leading the country to a new high-water mark
economically, before calling the nation to turn its resources to
tackling a range of issues that threatens to undermine good times
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   A sure cornerstone of the speech will be his call to set aside
future budget surpluses _ which could top $1.5 trillion over the
coming decade, by some estimates _ to address Social Security
shortfalls projected to begin around 2013.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides played down the likelihood that Clinton would
unveil a detailed plan for saving Social Security, but he was
certain to devote time to the issue in Tuesday's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not expect a detailed comprehensive plan,'' Gene
Sperling, director of Clinton's National Economic Council, told
reporters last week. Sperling said he expected the president to try
to hammer out concrete proposals in meetings with Capitol Hill
Republicans ''over the next couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Most striking, though, will likely be what Clinton won't
mention.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insisted as late as Monday that he would say nothing about
the sex-and-deception scandal the White House has been mired in
since the allegations first broke a year ago this Thursday of
Clinton's Oval Office relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't bring up the subject in last year's State of the
Union address one week after the Lewinsky charges broke. The
difference this time is that he'll be addressing the House, which
last month voted to impeach him on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice, and the Senate, which now sits in judgment
of him.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors wrapped up three days of building a case
against him on Saturday, a process that appears to have cut
slightly into Clinton's high public approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,200 adults polled Jan. 14-18 by the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press showed Clinton's job approval
rating had slipped to 63 percent. That's still extraordinarily high
for a second-term president, though it's down from his 71 percent
showing in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's task Tuesday night, though, could be to hold public
opinion through a convincing portrayal of a president hard at work
on the people's business.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, his task appears to be first, do no harm, and
''not to do or say anything that leads to an erosion of his
support, especially among Democrats who are among his 100 jurors,''
said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.

GAYLE YOUNG, 63, BALLET DANCER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gayle Young, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theater who
partnered such leading ballerinas as Margot Fonteyn and Cynthia
Gregory, died on Jan. 8 at Cottage Hospital in Woodsville, N.H. He
was 63 and lived in Haverhill, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said Darryl Dodson, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a tall, lean dancer whose quietly sympathetic manner
made him a natural lead dancer and partner in Antony Tudor's
ballets.
</P>
<P>
   He performed many of those roles during his 21-year career with
Ballet Theater. He also danced lead roles in ``Giselle,'' ``Swan
Lake,'' ``Coppelia'' and ``The Nutcracker,'' and in ballets by
Agnes de Mille. The ballerinas Young partnered also included Sallie
Wilson, Marcia Haydee, Lupe Serrano and Lynn Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Young studied dance with Dorothy Prince while a student at the
University of California at Berkeley. He joined the Joffrey Ballet
in 1958 and performed with the New York City Ballet in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Young taught dance at the State University of New York at
Purchase for the last 16 years. He also staged ballets for
companies throughout the world, most recently Bronislava Nijinska's
production of ``Les Noces'' for the National Ballet of Holland, the
Paris Opera Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet and the Berlin
Opera Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dodson, Young is survived by a brother, Eugene,
of Tenafly, N.J. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE TWO REALITIES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Were the House Republican prosecutors talking about the
president or about a mafia don? Their language was sometimes so
extreme _ ``conspiracy,'' ``infamy'' _ that it was hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The very shrillness of the attack signaled the dual nature of
this impeachment trial. It has the trappings of a trial: a great
and solemn one, as the commentators keep saying. But it is also the
culmination of years of political effort by a passionate minority
to destroy this president.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how we got to where we are. At every stage the hand of
the extreme right is evident.
</P>
<P>
   It began five years ago, when a far-right magazine, The American
Spectator, printed an article by David Brock about the Arkansas
troopers who guarded Bill Clinton when he was governor. The article
quoted one trooper as saying a woman named Paula was willing to be
the governor's ``regular girlfriend.'' Brock has since said that he
regrets throwing in that name.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of women named Paula in Arkansas, and none
were identified. But six weeks later Paula Jones came forward and
demanded that Clinton apologize for the slur on her reputation.
Where did she do that? At a Washington conference of the
Conservative Political Action Committee. Her lawsuit, when it
followed, was supported _ indeed, made possible _ by hundreds of
thousands of dollars from conservative sources.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same year as the Brock article, 1994, Congress
renewed the Independent Counsel Act. The act sets up a special
court to appoint the counsels. The practice had been to pick a
judge of seniority to head the panel. But Chief Justice William
Rehnquist chose a junior member of the District of Columbia U.S.
Court of Appeals, David Sentelle, a deeply conservative Republican
and friend of the two far-right Republican senators from his state,
North Carolina: Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Republican, Robert Fiske, had been investigating
Clinton's role in the Whitewater land deal. But after Sentelle had
lunch with Helms and Faircloth, the judicial panel replaced him
with Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Having found nothing to use against the president in more than
three years of investigation, Starr a year ago threw his immense
resources into the Monica Lewinsky matter. No detached,
professional prosecutor would have undertaken such a case. Robert
Morgenthau of New York, perhaps the most respected prosecutor in
the country, said last week that Starr had violated ``every rule in
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr acted as an agent of the House of Representatives: a
profoundly anti-constitutional politicization of the law. One of
the most strident conservatives in the House, Tom DeLay of Texas,
the Republican whip, led the cry for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key players in this history come from the new
conservative Republican heartland, the South and Southwest: Helms,
Faircloth, Sentelle, Starr, DeLay and now Trent Lott: the Senate
majority leader. Lott's talk of bipartisanship is just that, talk _
occasioned by his concern that 13 Republican senators are up for
re-election next year in states that Clinton carried in 1996. He is
doing all he can to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not all the Republicans involved in the campaign
against the president, or sitting in judgment now, are on the far
right. Political interests push others to join. Exactly that
happened with Joe McCarthy; many Republicans sought political
advantage in his demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   But the essence here is an attempted coup by
ultra-conservatives. I do not doubt their sincerity. That is what
makes it terrifying. When Tom DeLay says this is ``about relativism
versus absolute truth,'' he speaks the language of totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   I think this country is better than the scene being played out
in the hothouse of Washington. Americans are more diverse, less
strident, more understanding about human nature.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing speech for the House prosecutors, Henry Hyde said
he hoped that ``a hundred years from today, people will look back
at what we have done and say, `They kept the faith.''' I think it
will take much less than 100 years for historians to see this for
what it is: a vengeful attempt to twist the Constitution into a
partisan tool.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The last two years have been fabulous years
economically. Inflation has disappeared; unemployment, like murder,
is down to levels not seen since the 1960s, and growth is a
vigorous 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has made millionaires irrelevant. To be rich
today, one has to be a billionaire. Nothing in the memories of
those now alive compares with what has happened in 1997 and 1998.
Even in the high-living 1980s, the misery index _ inflation plus
unemployment _ was always far higher.
</P>
<P>
   True, we are in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion in
American history. Yet, as in all economic stories, there is another
side.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly longer view shows median family incomes that haven't
risen since the early 1970s, yet the average wife is working 15
more weeks a year than she did back then. Real wages for 80 percent
of the male labor force are below where they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 90 percent of the stock market gains have gone to the top
10 percent of the households, and the bottom 60 percent of
Americans cannot benefit from the market boom because they don't
own any stock. There have been better years in the past: Growth was
6.5 percent in 1964 and 1965, inflation was much lower in 1961 and
1962, and unemployment was at 3.5 percent in 1968 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans don't want to hear that other story, any more than
they want to hear about President Clinton's impeachment trial.
Americans want to party.
</P>
<P>
   The right defining statistic for the last two years is the
negative savings rate first recorded in September 1998. Negative
savings rates hadn't been seen since 1933. The Great Depression was
under way, unemployment was approaching 30 percent, earnings had
collapsed, unemployment insurance benefits had yet to be invented,
no one had heard of welfare, and assets had to be sold if someone
wanted to eat. Consumption was above income because for too many
people there was no income.
</P>
<P>
   A very different story has to be told to explain 1998's negative
savings rates. Americans felt rich because of the booming stock
market and, not surprisingly, wanted to spend some of their new
wealth. Consumption exceeded income not because incomes were down
but because wealth was up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were tired of watching their wealth grow on paper and
wanted to feel and touch some of their money with
bigger-than-that-of-my-neighbor sport utility vehicles,
10,000-square-foot homes or other conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   This story sounds reasonable until you think about it for more
than a microsecond. Negative savings rates first occurred in
September when the market was plunging. At that time there were
real fears of an American meltdown of 1998 that would rival the
collapse of Japan's bubble economy in 1990. Russia was going down
the tubes and carrying some very big banks with it. Bankers Trust
and Bank of America announced billion-dollar losses.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was shaking, as it is now, and it seemed likely that it
would carry the rest of Latin America down with it, as it does now.
A government-organized rescue was being shaped for a
trillion-dollar hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, to
prevent it from pulling down the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board lowered interest
rates three times in four weeks _ once on an emergency basis. In
September no one was predicting that soaring stock prices would
return in November. Those who had been market optimists in August
were scorned.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this bad news dampened Americans' desire to spend.
They consumed like the stock market was going up when in fact it
was going down. Americans simply wanted to party, party. And in
part because they did so, the market went back up.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that the interesting questions about 1997 and 1998
are probably sociological and not economic. These two years were
good economically, but we seem to feel far better about them
sociologically than their performance warrants. Why?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons to party.
</P>
<P>
   One can have a party to celebrate a victory. However one
calibrates America's performance in the last two years, it is far
better than that of the rest of the world. In 1990 only one of the
10 most valuable companies in the world was American. In 1998 nine
of the 10 most valuable companies in the world were American.
</P>
<P>
   One can also have a party to push out of one's mind, at least
for a short period, things that one would rather not think about.
There is a lot to push out of one's mind: the impeachment trial,
dying children in Kosovo, a failing peace agreement in the Middle
East and chaos in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the political analysts have it wrong on Clinton's
impeachment. They explain the opinion polls supporting the
president with the argument that the public gives him credit for
the economy's performance and doesn't want to take a chance on
disrupting those good results. But do that many Americans truly
believe that the good economy would disappear if Clinton
disappeared?
</P>
<P>
   Or one can have a party simply to announce that ``I am rich.''
In this case, the bigger the party, the better. The whole purpose
of the party is to make my neighbors envious of my success.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can of course want to party for any one of these
reasons. They must remember that like all parties, the good times
have to end. But who wants to think of the prospects for 1999 _ our
ballooning trade deficit, Brazil's incipient meltdown, slower
economic growth _ when 1998's party is still under way?

<P>
   In many ways, this year is more crucial than 2000 in determining
whom the two parties will nominate. That is because the survival of
candidates, until next winter when issues and personal appeal may
be noticed, depends on one practical fact: who has enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who do not start collecting the $20 million to $25
million that a primary will require _ that amounts to $55,000 to
$70,000 a day, seven days a week by the end of the year _ may find
it difficult to wage a full-fledged campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates may no longer enjoy the luxury of scoring an upset
early in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary and using
that victory to raise money to keep their campaigns alive for
another round of contests.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping his fingers for effect, Mel Sembler, the national
finance chairman of the Republican Party and a 20-year veteran of
presidential campaign fund-raising, said: ``It's going to be quick.
Keep your eyes on the guys, or gals, who can raise the money
because those are going to be your serious, viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   While some candidates have not broken stride since Election Day
1996, the maneuvering has grown especially intense since the start
of the year. Several candidates have declared themselves in or out
or announced the creation of skeletal political committees. Behind
the scenes, they are engaged in bidding wars to recruit strategists
and scrambling for people to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vice President Al Gore, who for years had refused to
acknowledge his desire to succeed President Clinton _ and had been
particularly careful to appear loyal during the impeachment inquiry
_ announced that he has formed a campaign organization. Even though
he dominates the Democratic field, Gore's advisers said he could
not wait any longer to begin soliciting contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost an irrational gold rush with these guys,'' said
Mike Murphy, a Republican media consultant. ``It's like you get a
prize if you announce by the end of January.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the first votes will not be cast for 12 months, the
contenders are jumpy for good reason. The campaign laws require
that the money they raise be collected in individual amounts of no
more than $1,000 _ a daunting, if not impossible, task for most
candidates. The goal of each candidate is to raise $10 million more
than the top goal set in the 1996 primary. Almost all of the
candidates are expected to abide by the overall federal spending
limits of about $45 million, which will allow them to collect
federal campaign subsidies next year based on how much they raise
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the candidates must come up with their own money in a
hurry is because with California, New York and other large states
seeking more influence by moving up the dates of their primaries
and caucuses to early March, nearly two-thirds of the national
convention delegates could be selected by the end of that month _
traditionally the time when primaries just get going. Never before
have so many contests been bunched so closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys out there running, they don't have a lot of time,''
said Kelly Guesnier, a Republican fund-raising consultant who has
yet to sign up with anyone. ``They need to get out there and
hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, who is assembling a campaign organization for Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, said: ``The jockeying is white-hot intense. In
states like Iowa and New Hampshire the retail element is critical _
as is landing someone who knows all the important bits of
information, like what fish fry to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field is roughly the size of the one in 1988, the
last time no incumbent president was running.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas is the early favorite in the polls despite some lingering
uncertainty that he will actually make the race. But the surprising
moves by Elizabeth Hanford Dole and Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who said in recent days that they would begin assembling campaign
operations, demonstrated that the race was not being conceded to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the circle of Democratic prospects is shrinking,
which is good news for Gore. For more than two years he has been
quietly assembling an organizational juggernaut that his advisers
hoped would scare off rivals. Thus far, the only other prominent
Democrat who clearly intends to run is former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, who this week announced a full-fledged campaign
committee. Two senators who had been viewed as possible candidates,
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, announced
recently that they would not take on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And advisers to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House
Democratic leader who for two years had been energetically building
a possible campaign organization, said he was increasingly inclined
to stay in the House.
</P>
<P>
   They said he began rethinking his plans after the Democrats
performed better than expected in the November election. Gephardt
would almost certainly become speaker if Democrats win back the
House next year. Already, Gephardt has sent top operatives who were
working on his possible presidential bid to jobs on the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, whose goal is to elect more
Democrats to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Once the primary contests begin, the rapid-fire calendar could
put a premium on candidates who had defined themselves _ and their
positions _ early. The danger is that the schedule could give
voters less opportunity to get to know and evaluate the
contestants. ``Chances are the Republicans are going to have to
chose someone whom the public does not yet know intimately,'' said
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``We're going to wake up with
someone whom we only just met.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is preparing to run
himself, agreed that the dash to the nomination might be too hasty.
``It probably would be better to have time for everyone to reflect
after you've had a primary,'' he said. ``But it's wishful thinking
on my part that it's going to happen.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Q: Who will be the half-dozen most important people in the year
2010? What will be the half-dozen most important products in the
year 2010?
 &HT;    ___ Amy Bruhnheil, Brussels
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: If importance is defined by global political impact, the most
important people in the year 2010 will be those leaders whose
constituency is truly the world at large. In the digital era,
separate nation-states, with isolating boundaries, are less
important than leadership or governance that is both more local and
more global.
 &HT;    Today we know how to be more local. In many countries, more and
more decisionmaking is being pushed into the community. But we are
almost clueless about working at the global level because 1) there
is no clear constituency of people to please and 2) our current
global organizations exist as bureaucracies in favor of consensus,
not leadership. Yet those leaders who can rise above the confines
of the nation-state will be the most important.
 &HT;    Addendum: It goes without saying that humanity is faced with a
handful of scientific challenges, which, if met, would position the
inventor as heroic. The list of ``most important people'' would
surely include anybody who cured AIDS, invented teleportation or
discovered an organism that ate air and sea pollution and excreted
pure oxygen.
 &HT;    As to important products, these are in the eye of the beholder.
Some people might consider a toaster that won't burn bread to be
vital. On a world level, we probably all agree that non-polluting
cars; low-cost, low-earth-orbiting satellites; and perfectly safe
airplanes would be major new products.
 &HT;    My more idiosyncratic list would include batteries (1/100th the
size and 100 times the capacity), ubiquitous wireless
communications and computers with common sense.
 &HT;    We underestimate the need for products to improve power
management. Just look at the spaghetti of cords and AC adapters you
have, witness the enormous proportion of weight and size of
batteries in cellphones and electric cars, and consider the
potential impact of wireless power distribution (if we could invent
it). We are doing better and better at consuming less power in the
digital world, but the physical world is far less flexible.
 &HT;    The field of wireless communication today is compartmentalized,
inconsistent and unreliable. Think of a scale that goes from the
handy remote-control unit of your television (i.e., near-field
wireless communications) to global satellite systems. The challenge
is to make our wireless world seamless. In so doing, we will have
to have far more compatible systems that can talk to each other
regardless of where we are in the world or how far away on the
scale.
 &HT;    Digital common sense is the highest on my list. If computers in
2010 could have the common sense of an 8-year-old child, the world
would be a better place. The human interface with computers is in
part driven by the quality of the computer's sensory means, those
for both expression and recognition.
 &HT;    But in much greater part, the quality of the interface is driven
by the computer's intelligence. No more dumb error messages, no
more standstill because of typos, no more mistakes because the
computer ``did what I said vs. what I meant.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Not long ago, malls devastated downtown shopping areas;; is
it possible the expected surge in e-commerce might make malls
obsolete?
 &HT;    ___ Eduardo Salazar, Madrid
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Without question. Malls as we know them will become obsolete
as a means to sell the products that people know they want. Malls
will become the means to browse, the places to meet people and the
centers for location-based entertainment. Mall owners and tenants
need to reinvent their own magnetism, which in the future will be
more like the attraction of theme parks than street shops. If mall
owners and tenants are complacent, they will become little more
than indoor advertising: a place where people go to browse and take
notes _ while they buy later over the Net.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What approach would you take to getting a technophobe to sit
down at a computer screen?
 &HT;    ___ P. Vance, New York City
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Keep in mind that technophobia is not unjustified _ computers
have become far too complex and using them far too humiliating. In
almost all cases, the worst path to enlightenment is to go to a
school. The classroom is just the wrong setting for a technophobe,
who needs to feel first and foremost that this new skill is about
life, not computers.
 &HT;    After a certain age, people are either too busy to learn or they
feel ``why bother; after all, I've lived without computers so
far.'' The key to changing this attitude is to show the value of
cyber-skill.
 &HT;    Examples include the value gained by authors from word
processing, parents from e-mail to kids and researchers from the
Web. Increasingly, consumers and businesses alike are learning that
the Internet provides huge conveniences and cost savings over faxes
and telephoning.
 &HT;    Once clear reasons have been established as to why it's a good
idea to ``bother,'' the next step is to provide a soft landing on
the otherwise hostile terrain of the digital world. In some cases,
this is best done through the charisma of children as teachers _
especially when the students are grandparents. In some cases, it is
best done by peer groups.
 &HT;    History will look back upon our era as a cruel period, one that
forced people into a sense of ignominy through no fault of their
own. Keep reminding the technophobe of this.

 WASHINGTON: to happen.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year or so, the maneuvering of prospects has taken place
under the shadow of the White House scandal, which has drawn most
of the press coverage. But Gore's advisers said they believed that
the president's troubles had actually helped the vice president
politically because no other Democrat has been able to break
through and draw great attention.
</P>
<P>
   And they said Democrats who take on Gore now risk looking as if
they are taking on the president while the party faithful rally
behind him. The risk, of course, for Gore is that Clinton's
troubles will ultimately tarnish the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Roy Romer, the Democratic Party's general chairman, had
to concede the obvious: ``It's clear that Al Gore is a very strong
front-runner. Very clear.'' Romer, who by party tradition is
supposed to stay neutral, quickly added a caveat, ``But it is
early.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, many Republicans have touted Bush as the leading
candidate, although he is untested nationally. He is in a
commanding position because he is a popular chief executive in a
large state, places at the top of the polls and can tap into the
connections of his father, former President George Bush. Bush has
been coy about his intentions, even as his advisers have in recent
weeks been quietly contacting people about raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the announcements of Mrs. Dole and McCain that they plan to
take the first steps to assembling campaigns underscores that not
all Republicans are willing to cede the field. Mrs. Dole, a
two-time Cabinet secretary who is stepping down as president of the
American Red Cross, and McCain, a popular war hero, could draw from
moderates inclined toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Republican strategist, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Bush's advisers were ``thrilled beyond words''
about Mrs. Dole's move because it takes pressure off him as the
front-runner and tamps down expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy, the Republican media consultant, disagreed, saying:
``In a fantasyland they're keeping expectations low. The
expectations are there. The game has already begun for him. It's
the price of being the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate whose financial prowess is undeniable is Steve
Forbes, the magazine publisher who plans to dip into his own
fortune to pay for his campaign and forgo the limits on spending
for candidates who accept federal subsidies. While Forbes is viewed
by Republicans as a top-tier contender because of his financial
wherewithal, he is also potent because he has run before, in 1996,
and has successfully courted conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate from 1996 who never stopped running is former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Alexander is a disciplined
candidate who already has strong organizations in Iowa and New
Hampshire. But he may draw from the same base of support as Bush,
Mrs. Dole and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican actively preparing a campaign is Gary Bauer,
the head of the Family Research Council, who has never served in
public office. He is expected to compete with Quayle for support of
religious conservatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kasich, the House Budget Committee chairman hopes that his
energetic and youthful image will catapult him to the top. Pat
Buchanan, the conservative columnist who ran in 1992 and 1996, may
also try again, as may former Gov. Pete Wilson of California. Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire, another conservative, also plans to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri announced last week that he was
not running. He did so even though he had gained the most ground in
the last year, elevating himself from being considered a hopeless
long shot to becoming a favorite of religious conservatives. But he
was still a long shot and feared losing his Senate seat in 2000 if
he was not nominated for president.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley, who is preparing to take on
Gore, announced a full-fledged campaign committee this week. But
while he was a respected senator and brings star appeal as a former
professional basketball player, he has kept a relatively low
profile in recent months and it is far from clear whether Bradley
can compete financially.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts is also seriously considering a
bid. He could tap into the fortune of his wife, Teresa Heinz,
although he has said he would not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, who has run twice before, also said he was
weighing a run; he might carry particular appeal to liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising money and assembling staffs, candidates are
trying to figure out how they will pace themselves; with the
primary set for March 7 in California and New York, they can no
longer simply concentrate on Iowa and New Hampshire. Some
politicians say those states will be even more important because of
the shortened primary season; others say they will be overshadowed
by larger states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for California to make New Hampshire
even more important,'' said Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a
Democrat. ``One of the lessons to me about the primary process is
to be careful of unintended consequences. Trying to manipulate the
process to benefit certain ends does not always turn out the way
you expect it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1988, said he could not fathom trying to
campaign simultaneously in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least when I ran, it was a one-hour difference with Iowa
and New Hampshire,'' he said of the time zone. For candidates in
2000, Dukakis said, ``sleep patterns are going to be badly
disrupted _ I'll tell you that.''

<P>
   Q I'm responsible for running our departmental meetings, but I
feel like I'm trying to herd sheep! I have to round up everyone or
the meeting will never start. I may get most of the attendees in
the meeting room, but as I try to corral the last one, a couple of
others wander off to get coffee or make a phone call. The meetings
are regularly delayed by at least a half-hour because of the
wayward flock. What can I do? B.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before focusing on this disrespectful flock, look first at
the shepherd. Since you have to round up and corral the employees
every time you hold these meetings, it sounds like you need to give
the group some serious feedback regarding the necessity of
attending these meetings on time, as well as serious feedback
regarding the sanctions associated with failure to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Look also at the content, organization and usefulness of these
meetings, and whether they are being held at the best time and
place. Having properly placed meetings that are truly productive
can have a definite impact on the attendance and the attendees. You
should also consider soliciting the employees' suggestions
regarding ways to improve these meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fact is these are departmental meetings
and everyone is expected to attend on time. Although the employees
may view them as an opportunity to engage in some sort of power
play with you, they need to understand that employees who engage in
sheepish behavior can get sheared.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company runs ads for open positions, gets lots of resumes
and only responds to the few that interest them. I end up fielding
phone calls from applicants who heard nothing and this wastes my
time. My boss says it is standard procedure to contact the good
applicants and the rest will get the message. What do you think
about this? H.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: The rest will get a message, but it will be more than a
rejection. This practice can also send a message indicating that
the company is shortsighted, cheap, uncaring and places minimal
emphasis on goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   It is neither difficult nor costly to put together a
professional letter that thanks the applicants and informs them
that their skills, education or experience did not fit the
specifications for the given position. Not only is this a courteous
step, it is actually a cost-saving step. After all, there are
direct costs associated with the time that you spend on these
calls.
</P>
<P>
   And, by ignoring a rejected applicant, there will be one more
person in the marketplace who has something negative to say about
the company. With the large number of applicants being rejected and
ignored by your company, this can have a costly impact over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that are intent on ignoring applicants whom they
reject are often advised to use ads that provide a box number
rather than the company name. Short of this approach, companies
that fail to contact the rejected applicants are being unfair to
these applicants and to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our manager has this thing against job applicants who have
their resumes prepared by a professional service. He claims that he
can spot one every time, and he believes that these resumes point
to a lack of industriousness. Does this make any sense to you? A.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: It makes about as much sense as a consumer who refuses to buy
a particular product because the company used an ad agency instead
of developing the ad themselves. A resume is an advertisement for a
job applicant, and whether it was made by the applicant or a
professional service has nothing to do with the individual's level
of industriousness.
</P>
<P>
   It could even be argued, just as ridiculously, that an applicant
who has a professionally prepared resume is more industrious
because he or she had to find a resume service, put together a
draft of the resume, get all of the data to the service, and then
review and revise the final version.
</P>
<P>
   With so many resume books available and the outstanding printing
options on a personal computer, your boss is probably not as
proficient at spotting professionally prepared resumes as he
thinks. Not only is he making a mistake by screening out applicants
who used a resume service, he is compounding this mistake by
screening out those whose resumes look like they used such a
service.
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern is that your boss is letting some of his biases
and personal beliefs enter the hiring process, and this can spell
big trouble. He would be well-advised to focus more on the content
of each resume and less on who may have prepared it. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as if, as 1998 ended, some prankster turned A.H. Belo
Corp.'s stock chart upside down. Falling from $28 and change to
less than $20 last year, a stock that had long paced the newspaper
industry fell far behind, with its worst performance since Belo
went public in 1981. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cause that everyone points to is weak advertising at the
company's flagship, The Dallas Morning News, which regularly prints
more column inches of advertising than any other newspaper in the
nation. But total advertising volume dropped by 2.3 percent in
1998, and classified advertising _ the most profitable advertising
newspapers sell _ led the decline. Some company executives and
analysts say that the drop was fueled by the migration of
high-technology help-wanted advertising to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A quarterly earnings report due Thursday will show whether
Belo's efforts to control expenses in the last six months have had
results. Analysts, absorbing the company's cautions, have trimmed
their outlook to 20 cents a share, from 28 cents three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing represents about 45 percent of Belo's profits, and
The Morning News perhaps three-quarters of that. But those numbers
alone cannot convey the true heft of the newspaper as the symbol of
the financial and journalistic success of a media company that with
$1.2 billion in 1997 revenue is one of the nation's largest. When
The Morning News does well, Belo smiles and Wall Street smiles with
it. And when The Morning News suffers, Wall Street feels Belo's
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Belo's situation is stable, or even promising. At its
17 television stations, which now reach one of seven households
around the nation, advertising gains remain healthy. Its other
newspapers, including The Providence Journal-Bulletin and The
Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., had good results in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the company and its many acquisitions have been built on the
growth and profitability of The Morning News. Given the strength of
the Dallas economy, investors want to know what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Decherd, Belo's chairman, president and chief executive,
has confronted the reversals with the same bravado that has helped
him turn a business run by his family for more than seven decades
into a media giant. He contends that the current doldrums are
simply part of the normal cycle that every business goes through,
especially when digesting major acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's stock, which had outperformed the
newspaper industry for two years, beginning in the fall of 1994,
had already begun to slip behind the group just before Belo's $1.7
billion acquisition of Journal-Bulletin Co. in 1997. And the gap
between Belo and the industry increased, so that by the end of
1998, its stock was the worst performer in the group.
</P>
<P>
   But Decherd argues that the stock's downturn should not detract
from the underlying strength that he sees resulting from Belo's
heavy investments in its newspapers and broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a patient-money strategy,'' he said in an
interview. ``Crepe-hanging over the performance of The Dallas
Morning News in 1998 is the most ridiculous idea I can imagine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet underlying the advantages are some of the broadest
uncertainties Belo and Decherd have faced since they won a fight to
the death with The Dallas Times Herald, which Belo bought and
closed in 1991. Decherd, who became the company's president six
years before that, at age 33, must now find among his
contemporaries successors for the two top executives who _ besides
him _ are most responsible for Belo's growth and success: Ward
Huey, the vice chairman and broadcast division chairman, who is 60,
and Burl Osborne, the publisher of The Dallas Morning News and
president of the newspaper division, who is 61. Two other top
executives quit the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Huey and Osborne do not plan to leave before reaching
the usual retirement age of 65, preparing for their departures is
already a Decherd priority. ``The question you pose is one I take
very seriously and about which I have a lot of personal angst,'' he
said, finishing with a word that repeatedly creeps into his speech
these days.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Robert Mong, 49, who had come up through the
Dallas newsroom, as the newspaper's president last September
appears to put him in a position to eventually become its publisher
and the chief of the entire newspaper division.
</P>
<P>
   Mong is striving to establish his cost-cutting credentials. His
first memo in his new job began, ``I want to let you know that we
will not be having a company picnic this fall,'' and went on to
cite the newspaper's lagging performance.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter's travel has been curtailed, and new parking decks, for
the newspaper and an adjacent television station, have been
delayed. So has construction of a new building for the Riverside
newspaper. And the planned pace for adding high-definition
capability to the television stations has been slowed. All told,
Belo intends to cut capital spending this year from a planned $125
million to $98 million.
</P>
<P>
   Early retirement incentives offered to 300 employees of The
Morning News and the Dallas television station were accepted by
about 180, averting the need to begin the year with layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mong succeeded Jeremy Halbreich, who had been president since
1991. Halbreich had worked for Decherd since graduating from
Harvard, which Decherd attended at the same time, in 1974. Although
Halbreich's associates say he was offered other positions with
Belo, he decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Belo also lost Michael Perry, its chief financial
officer. Decherd described the resignation as voluntary. But two
people who know both men well said that their relationship had
grown rancorous. The separation agreement, which included
job-hunting services for Perry, reads almost like the terms of a
cease-fire in an armed conflict. One provision, for example,
commits each man to saying nothing negative about the other.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Perry's duties went to James Moroney, a 42-year-old,
Stanford-educated cousin of Decherd's and the son of a former Belo
chairman. Moroney had risen to second-in-command at the broadcast
division. As executive vice president for finance, with the new
chief financial officer reporting to him, he gave the company's
presentation last week at a Salomon Smith Barney investment
conference.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turnover and pending retirements, Decherd says that
investors should draw assurance from his own continuing tenure and
his status as Belo's largest shareholder. ``I'll be 48 in April and
have no plans to go anywhere,'' he said. Lest anyone doubt his
robust good health, he suggested with a laugh that an interviewer
meet him at the pool where his coach, a champion swimmer himself,
pushes him through hourlong workouts.
</P>
<P>
   At a newspaper generally considered one of the nation's best
regional dailies, Mong and Decherd pledge to continue the necessary
spending and investments. They cite the addition of yet another
weekly zoned section for the fringe suburbs this month and a
personal-technology section a few months ago, as well as the
purchase of new $36 million presses scheduled for installation in
the fall of 2000. The newspaper's reporters are also appearing on
the Texas Cable Channel, which Belo introduced Jan. 4 _ itself a
$15 million investment in plant and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even the newspaper's critics have noticed
improvements in The Morning News, which have brought in six
Pulitzer Prizes since 1986. ``The News is getting better, though we
hate to admit it'' said Molly Ivins, the popular columnist for the
rival Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-flow margins for the newspaper _ perhaps the best
measure of profitability _ peaked at 34 percent in 1997 before
dropping to 32.6 percent in 1998. Newspaper margins in the 20's are
more common.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morning News circulation, like that of other major
newspapers, has been sliding, it was the loss of advertising that
prompted analysts to turn negative. Double-digit growth in
advertising revenue in 1995 and 1996 had tailed off to 7.2 percent
in 1997. And beginning last August, these sales went into a steep
decline. The greatest losses came in what had been the newspaper's
most profitable category, help-wanted, which was off by 6 percent
in September and 3 percent in October, the company told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts blame rate increases of 32 percent from 1995 to
1998 for retail advertising, 47 percent for general advertising and
75 percent for classified employment ads. But Belo executives say
that advertisers' cost per thousand readers remains below the
average for the largest newspapers. They say that high-technology
employment advertisements may have migrated to the Internet, or may
have dried up with the loss of Asian demand for high-technology
products. Similar weakness in classified advertising dented profits
for newspapers in San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Decherd sees no broader Internet invasion. ``These are
computer-facile people,'' he said, working his fingers as if his
conference table were a keyboard. ``I don't think it means there is
some sort of broader secular change in terms of newspaper
advertising generally.''
</P>
<P>
   But Decherd sees an even bigger challenge _ demonstrating that
in journalism, high quality can bring high and growing profits.
``If it doesn't work for Belo, my opinion is it won't work for
anybody,'' he said, his voice falling to a distant murmur.

HANNA SULNER, 81, HANDWRITING EXPERT IN MINDSZENTY PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hanna F. Sulner, a handwriting expert who reluctantly
helped Hungarian Communists frame Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty on
treason charges in 1949, then promptly fled to the West and exposed
the sham, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 and
since 1950 had worked quietly in New York as one of the nation's
leading authorities on disputed documents.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, it seems surprising how much trouble the
Soviet-dominated Hungarian government took to fabricate the case
against Mindszenty. As an intractable opponent of the communist
takeover of Hungary in 1948, he was clearly an enemy of the new
one-party police state.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when other high-level foes were simply being shot
or jailed without fanfare, the cardinal's position as the primate
of a largely Roman Catholic country required special handling.
</P>
<P>
   That the political police turned to to Mrs. Sulner and her
husband, Laszlo, was anything but surprising. When it came to
determining whether a handwritten note, a typed letter or a
signature on a will or contract was real or forged, Mrs. Sulner had
few peers.
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 16, she had studied at the elbow of her father,
Professor Julius Fischof, a pioneer in handwriting analysis who
settled in Budapest after World War I and won a reputation as
Eastern Europe's foremost expert on questionable documents.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sulner also studied criminology and obtained a special
degree qualifying her to teach document examination at the
University of Budapest law school.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over her father's work after his death in 1944, she
quickly inherited his reputation as a meticulous professional as
well as his positions as official handwriting and documents expert
to Hungary's courts, police and military.
</P>
<P>
   Sulner joined the office in 1946. After their marriage in
November 1947, the couple were gradually drawn, unwittingly at
first, into the communist government's elaborate machinations to
discredit Mindszenty and frame him on treason and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Based on articles the couple wrote for The New York Herald
Tribune in 1950 describing their role in the case, it is clear that
Sulner was far more involved than his wife in forging incriminating
documents, some ostensibly in the cardinal's hand, others bearing
his supposed signature. But if Mrs. Sulner was able to remain
somewhat aloof, it had less to do with her fastidious devotion to
the integrity of her craft than with her husband's willingness to
do the dirty work. That willingness stemmed, he made clear, from
the knowledge that the couple's only choice was to cooperate or be
hanged.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was that Sulner had become particularly adroit in
using, or rather misusing, a device his wife's father had invented
for comparing handwritings. It allowed him to copy letters and
words from one document and rearrange them into a new,
incriminating one.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1974 memoirs, Mindszenty attributed his conviction after
a three-day trial in February 1949 to texts created with the device
by Sulner, and, more crudely, by police technicians he taught to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mindszenty trial was drawing to a close, the Sulners
escaped to Austria on Feb. 6, 1949. Four days later, they surfaced
in Vienna, denounced the trial as a farce and displayed microfilm
of the forged documents they had worked on.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, after the birth of a son, Sulner died at 30 in
Paris. He was said to have suffered from heart disease, but his
wife remained convinced he had been poisoned by communist agents.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing her infant son to New York, Mrs. Sulner quickly resumed
her career, testifying at more than 1,000 cases throughout the
United States, rarely for the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny woman once described as looking 6 feet tall in the
witness chair, she spoke with a heavy accent and with the absolute
authority of a woman who knew her stuff and had done her homework.
Once, testifying against three rival experts in a will contest, she
convinced a jury that an otherwise pristine signature had been
forged because the dots over three i's were misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   In a field whose experts must rely on copies of original
documents held as evidence, Mrs. Sulner, who published numerous
articles and an authoritative handbook, ``Disputed Documents,'' in
1966, became famous for insisting on having her own expert
assistants make the high-quality, precisely lit photocopies she
required for her detailed analysis under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son, Andrew, a document expert in
Manhattan; and a grandson.

<P>
   PARIS _ The fashion industry welcomed back Kate Moss, who was
widely reported to have been in a hospital in Britain last year for
what was described as exhaustion. Photographers at the Versace
Couture show on Saturday hooted approval for the model as she did
her turns on the runway. Last week, she appeared in Milan in the
Versace men's show in one of the few women's outfits shown. On both
occasions Ms. Moss appeared to be well.
</P>
<P>
   Following the couture show on Saturday, Donatella Versace was
host of a 25th-birthday party for Ms. Moss at Les Bains Douches, a
Paris nightclub, but the British model declined to discuss her
health. Among the many fashion insiders who attended were the
designers Azzedine Alaeia and Rifat Ozbek and the photographer
Steven Meisel, who has photographed Ms. Moss dozens of times. Also
on hand were Liv Tyler, the actress, and Goldie, a British deejay.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ms. Moss did a photo shoot for W magazine, and Joan
Juliet Buck, the editor of French Vogue, said she, too, had booked
the model for a shoot.
</P>
<P>
   A PLUCKY DESIGNER
</P>
<P>
   It is an unusually brave designer who ventures from the United
States to France to make a living. The few who did it successfully
include Patrick Kelly and Mainbocher.
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham Pelham is unusual. He moved from New York to Paris
18 months ago and showed his second collection of elegant slit
skirts and sexy organza blouses during couture week in the Place
Vendome. He applied to the organizing body for the French shows for
membership to show as a couturier but was turned down. He will keep
trying, he said. Pelham has spent his life overcoming the obstacles
that come with designing from a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage before his show begins, he wheels around, tucking in a
shirt on a model here, tightening a belt there. He calls for
Jean-Marc Benoit, his assistant. ``Jean-Marc acts as two more
hands,'' said Pelham, who must support his left arm with his right
hand as he adjusts a model's belt or takes a cigarette to calm
pre-show jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pelham developed polio at 2, he said he was never allowed
to think it was an impediment to realizing his dreams. He insists
on doing everything a designer who can walk does, like taking his
finale bow. He is wheeled out by an assistant to applause,
undoubtedly as much for his clothes as for his courage.

   POCKETS FOR RECORD BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   The apotheosis of functional fashion has arrived. The ``manteau
mobil home,'' available at Rooming, a modish home-accessories store
in the Carrousel du Louvre on the Rue de Rivoli, is a coat with no
fewer than 44 pockets. They are hidden in the hooded nylon coat by
an ingenious series of quilted rectangles.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the pockets, you unzip one of five zippers that run up
and down the coat and from shoulder to wrist. The unisex garment,
which is available in undercover black or screaming orange,
eliminates the need for a handbag or, for that matter, an overnight
case.
</P>
<P>
   Though the coat is made by Perigot, a French company, the source
of this innovation is none other than Issey Miyake, the Japanese
designer, whose name is not on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, said he
owns three Miyake coats that he bought in the last nine months,
which seem to be earlier versions of manteau mobil home. These
coats, including a clear nylon style bought at the trendy boutique
Colette on Thursday, bear Miyake's name and the Final Home label,
and they have at least three dozen fewer pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great for traveling,'' said Ruttenstein, who carries
show invitations and giveaways in his pockets. ``They're the style
of the millennium. Hands-free fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   He paid about $300 for his coats (which neither Bloomingdale's
nor the Miyake boutique in New York sells). But Final Home is sold
in New York at Antique Boutique and at Trash and Vaudeville. The
more extreme Perigot version costs about $295 at Rooming.

   ATLANTA _ A person can live with losing, David West knows, the
same way he lives with any other chronic pain. But imagine if, one
day, while sitting in his favorite recliner in front of a
wide-screen television, the pain of 33 years just slipped away, and
in its place was pride and joy.
</P>
<P>
   It happened Sunday. West, a 46-year-old driver for United Parcel
Service and an Atlanta Falcons fan since he was a child in Cairo,
Ga., was healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A miracle,'' he said, ``has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, the Atlanta Falcons, the National Football
League's doormat for a third of a century, wildly celebrated their
overtime victory over the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings as the
impossible dream of a Super Bowl suddenly became a reality. In his
home, West just sat there with his hands balled into fists, and
cried like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chill went through me,'' he said. ``I thought, `Is it true,
or is it a dream?' Tears got in my eyes. My wife came in and said,
`You all right?' And I was speechless. Then I got over it, and I
began to holler.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans used to winning, fans in cities where teams routinely make
a realistic run for the NFL championship, might not understand such
a quiet reaction to winning, but like so many other Falcons fans,
West had to recover from the shock of it before he could whoop,
stomp and shimmy. The Falcons, going into this year, had a record
of 182 wins, 293 losses and 5 ties, which is one of the worst
records in professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of got used to them being sorry,'' said Derrick Clark,
a 31-year-old UPS driver. ``We just never expected much. But it's
our team and you've got to pull with them, winning or losing. Now I
say, jump on the bandwagon and ride it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, people did not even have the nerve to say, ``Just wait
till next year,'' as losing seasons came and went, coaches came and
went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wretches,'' wrote Steve Hummer, a sports columnist for The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ``the way that Dickens used to make
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, whose Broncos will play the Falcons in the Super Bowl
in Miami on Jan. 31, it is just one more trip to the championship
game. But in Atlanta, it is a 14-2 regular season with playoff
victories over San Francisco and Minnesota, and that is ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to couldn't go to sleep, knowing they would lose,''
said Curtis Brown, 34, a furniture refinisher who is out of work.
``It used to give me a headache watching them play. But I knew,
someday, they would get on top.''
</P>
<P>
   They became a team a man could risk his paycheck on, and Brown
encouraged his friends to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them, `Take everything you have and put it on the
Falcons,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People here say it was all about believing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of faith,'' said West.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one seems sure why fate seemed to favor the Falcons
over the Vikings on Sunday, there were signs of Divine
Intervention. As the Falcons' kicker, Morten Andersen, lined up to
kick what turned out to be the game-winning field goal, several of
his teammates did not even look. They had formed a tight knot on
the sideline, and were in prayer. In the stands, people held hands
and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Praying, of course, later gave way to hard drinking. Drunks fell
all over themselves in sports bars all over Georgia, hundreds of
wild-eyed fans ran _ well, staggered _ through the streets of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands swarmed Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport to
greet the Falcons on Sunday night, as many as 6,000 by some
estimates _ so many that the airport closed its doors to all but
ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to have a different opinion of why and how all
this good fortune has befallen this team. At the American Lunch, a
buffet where downtown business types line up for collards and
squash and chicken wings, the people working the steam said it had
to be the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Falcons hired Dan Reeves, a Georgia boy himself,
whose drawl seemed to fit here. After going 1-7 at midseason in
1997, the Falcons won 22 of their next 26 games. Reeves had heart
bypass surgery last month, but returned to the sideline in this
post-season, further endearing himself to Atlanta fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hell of a coach,'' said Dexter Dawson, 45, mopping up after
the lunchtime rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hell of a man,'' said Hilda Reese, 48, standing over the
macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, said Dawson, ``made them believe they could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Willene Patrick always believed. ``I'm a native of Atlanta,''
she said. ``I always had faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Falcons were winning, disbelievers in this city
of migrants _ in Atlanta, it often seems as if everybody is from
someplace else _ said it could not last. They cheered for their
home teams, for San Francisco and New York and others, and waited
for the Falcons' legacy to catch up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Boe Richardson, 36, a waiter who watched the Falcons victory in
the All Star Cafe downtown, smarted under that talk all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sweet for us,'' he said. ``All through this year, we
still got a lot of flack, people saying it's just luck.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons lined up for their field goal try to win the game
that would send them to the Super Bowl, ``not one person was
sitting down'' in the All Star Cafe, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Now only the Broncos stand between the Falcons and history.
Atlanta has seen the Braves go to the World Series four times this
decade, and watched them win it in 1995. And the city has the
Olympics as part of its history. But now, in what would have once
been the least likely of chances, it has a shot at football
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said West, ``this day would never come.''

 &HT;    Atlanta coach _ and his team _ deemed fit for Super Sunday
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everybody knows the score and the impact. But how,
exactly, did certain key Falcons grade out after Sunday's gripping
NFC Championship? The doctors couldn't tell until they looked at
the film.
</P>
<P>
   So, they had Dan Reeves in first thing Monday morning for
another round of Piedmont Hospital probing. After a blood test,
X-ray and cardiogram, they perscribed one Super Bowl and plenty of
bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   They passed on one part of the routine exam, however. The stress
test seemed redundant. ''I think you passed that yesterday,'' his
doctor told him, on the theory that an overtime victory in hostile
territory for the ultimate NFL prize was at least as trying as a
few minutes on a treadmill. His insurance company will be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious aspect to Sunday's miracle in Minnesota was the level
of coaching that has gone into the making of a new and improved
Falcon. A little open-heart surgery was not going to interfere with
the leadership. The job Reeves and his staff did preparing the
Falcons for the NFL's loudest, most mind-rattling venue was
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ''As important as it was for us to do the Xs and Os, it was more
important for us to come up with what was the best way to handle
the crowd noise,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a flinch, not a buckle, not a twitch. Operating off a silent
snap count, the Falcons offense seemed to barely notice the
Metrodome's notorious din.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I was most impressed with was the way our football
team played with with the noise and there was not one single
illegal procedure, no false starts,'' Reeves said. ''And every film
you looked at there were at least six to eight by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice it like you want to play it _ as old school as Reeves
himself. All week before the trip to the Metrodome, they worked
under the assumption that game day was going to be one complicated,
violent pantomime. Eleven Charlie Chaplins couldn't have pulled it
off as well.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, they installed poise into the gameplan, the one
attribute that kept them viable when the purple crazies were
raging.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poise they had was the thing we talked about as being
really important. And it couldn't be four guys being poised (along
the offensive line), it had to come from all six guys. It had to be
six-out-of-six concentrating on every single play,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to go through practice without making a single
mistake. There more on Wednesay; we got better on Thursday; we were
a lot better on Friday, so you felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the roman numeraled orgy, which is nothing but two
weeks of distractions momentarily interrupted by a football game.
It is the World Series, cubed. The Final Four on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was there and won it just a year ago. It has a handle on
surviving the Super Bowl. Now the Falcons coaches and the few
veteran players must again attempt to make these Dirty Birds
unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   It is daunting, but so was trying to make sense in the
Metrodome. Two more weeks of work for Reeves. One more important
message: There is no reason the Falcons have to suffer a galloping
case of the Super Bowl yips.

 &HT;    For Falcons, even routine is surreal
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a Monday unlike any before at Falcon headquarters
in Suwanee, the sun shone brightly, and there was a general mood of
controled delirium _ if there is such a thing. The only thing that
kept it from being a perfect day was a very stiff breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the wind of change.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 24 hours after the Falcons beat the Minnesota
Vikings 30-27 in overtime to clinch the first Super Bowl appearance
in the 33-year history of the franchise, coaches and players tried
to follow a routine.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, though, was routine.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of autograph-seeking fans came and went over the course
of the day. Players worked out in the weight room, some got injury
treatment, and they met as usual at 2 p.m. to review film from the
game the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But things were out of whack. For one, coach Dan Reeves _ about
as punctual a person as one might meet _ was some 17 minutes late
for his usual Monday press conference, attended by perhaps three
dozen media.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another amazing development. He couldn't believe the
thousands of people who showed up at the airport Sunday night to
greet the team. He didn't get to finish reviewing game film Monday
morning like he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   Things just weren't the same for coaches and players of a team
that was 1-7 in the middle of last season before winning 22 of 26,
including 11 straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got four and a half hours sleep,'' he said. ''There were 38
messages when I got home last night, haven't had time to look at
them.'
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was more amazing that Sunday's win over the Vikings
(16-2), who were 9-0 at home, winning by an average of 25.6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored on its first four possessions to take a 20-7
lead, but then scored just seven points on its last 10 possessions.
Kicker Gary Anderson, who had not missed a kick of any kind all
year, missed a 38-yard field goal with 2:07 left that would have
given the Vikings a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons countered with an eight-play, 71-yard drive, tying
the game with 49 seconds left on a 16-yard pass from Chris Chandler
to Terance Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's defense held twice in the overtime, and the offense
went on a 10-play, 70-yard drive to history. It ended with a
38-yard field goal by Morten Andersen with 3:09 left in the
overtime _ from nearly the same spot Gary Anderson missed.
</P>
<P>
   Ball game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If . . . somebody was writing a script for a movie, I don't
think they could come up with one that's been like this season,''
said Reeves, who was 2-6 in previous Super Bowls as a player,
assistant and head coach with the Cowboys and Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my standpoint, this is as excited as I've ever been to be
in a Super Bowl because it's certainly not something you would have
thought was realistic when the season started. This team has been
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves got something in the mail from the NFL office Monday
regarding the Super Bowl. It was addressed to, ''The Atlanta
Falcons _ head coach Dennis Green.''
</P>
<P>
   Green coaches the Vikings, who were favored by 11 points over at
Atlanta team that had only once once in its history at Minnesota _
in 1966. ''They changed the team,'' Reeves said, ''but forgot to
change the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how big a shock Sunday was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I woke up this morning and pinched myself,'' said wide
receiver Tim Dwight. ''To go to the Super Bowl my rookie year . . .
that's just incredible. This place (Falcons training facility in
Suwanee, Ga.) was jacked when we got back last night, and thousands
of fans were waiting. It's been a different Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just goes to show you it doesn't matter what people outside
the walls (of Falcons headquarters) say; it's what's inside the
walls that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, the senior Falcons with 12
years of mostly miserable experience, was still floating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh man, it's been like a dreamworld,'' he said. ''I don't know
what the odds were (60-1 before the season against the Falcons
winning the Super Bowl), but we beat them. All the pieces of the
puzzle have just come together unbelievably.''
</P>
<P>
   There was controversy in Suwanee, however.
</P>
<P>
   At midseason, Reeves promised he would do the ''Dirty Bird''
dance downtown if the Falcons made it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed he did it Monday on Peachtree Street at 6:45 a.m.,
stopping his car as he was on his way to film a spot on ABC's
''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nobody on the road. No traffic,'' he said. ''That's
the reason I did it. I was good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle said, ''That don't count. There got to be people there,
cameras, witnesses''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis said, ''That's a copout.''

   ''I'm opposed to all that stuff,'' Reeves said, ''but I've seen

<P>
   LONDON _ Cricket, that languorous English pursuit, looms large
in the life of Christopher Charles Gent, chief executive of
Vodafone Group PLC, which agreed on Friday to pay $60 billion for
Airtouch Communications, the U.S. wireless phone giant, in
Britain's largest takeover ever.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he attended a school overlooking the Oval
cricket ground in South London, a premier site for the sport.
Vodafone, indeed, sponsors the English national cricket team, and
Gent's friends include the former Conservative prime minister, John
Major, whose first diversion after being ousted in elections in
1997 was going to watch cricket.
</P>
<P>
   His interests _ other than driving an Aston Martin sports car _
as listed in his company biography include ``playing tennis and
watching cricket.'' And, most recently, Gent, 50, acknowledged with
a tight kind of smile in an interview Monday that he was indeed at
the Sydney cricket ground, where England was playing Australia,
when he began his campaign on New Year's Day to thwart Bell
Atlantic in a battle for Airtouch, the American company he had been
coveting for months as part of his dream of building a global
wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent's fondness for cricket, in which it can take five days
just to reach a draw, does not signal a leisurely approach to
business. Working his cellular phone over the following three days
in negotiations that spread around the globe, his associates say,
Gent showed a decisiveness and resolution that helps explain why
Vodafone is Britain's leading wireless operator with appetites as
large as Gent's ambitions for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Chris' leadership and clear thinking on where he felt
Vodafone ought to be, there could have been a different outcome''
to the battle for Airtouch, said Scott Mead, a Goldman, Sachs
managing director who led the team advising Vodafone. ``The guy is
driven. Make no mistake about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gent said in the interview Monday, his ambition is not
simply to promote the use of wireless communications to complement
fixed-line telephones but to turn mobile phones into a substitute
for them. He wants to persuade half the people in the industrial
world to use a wireless phone by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   And, having acquired stakes in many European wireless markets,
complementing those of Airtouch, he signaled Monday that part of
his strategy was to export to the United States some of the same
marketing techniques that have made Vodafone Britain's top wireless
operator. These include prepaid services that drew in 755,000 of
the 933,000 new British customers that Vodafone says it acquired in
the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, Vodafone Airtouch, ``in the next decade
will become on of the top 10 companies in the world,'' he predicted
at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the ambitious forecast is an extension of
Vodafone's own rise, starting as a modest subsidiary of Racal
Electronics, formed in 1985, and spun off in 1988 at a time many
fixed-line carriers saw wireless phone communications as a passing
fancy. Gent, lured away from a computer services business as
managing director of the new company, took a different view,
proclaiming wireless the future of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   From then until 1996, he played a key role in building
Vodafone's British operations while Sir Gerald Whent presided over
the company as chief executive. ``Chris is a calm, collected
person,'' Whent said recently. ``I didn't believe he had the verve
tycoons are made of, but he has proved me wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of his critics say there is a ruthless streak to
Gent beneath his exterior of snappy shirts, bright suspenders and
apparent diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to take very cold and objective decisions
based on the facts,'' said an associate who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``He is definitely not shy, but he's not the
glad-handing type.'' One characterization after his elevation to
chief executive, British newspapers reported, was ``corn-jumper,''
meaning that he trod on business associates' toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not think that it's only American chief
executives who are hard-driving,'' a friend said, disputing the
idea that his presence at the Sydney cricket ground implied ``he
was out there on a complete boondoggle.'' Indeed, Gent stressed
Monday that he had been visiting Australia and New Zealand on
business _ with cricket as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Gent took over as chief executive in January 1997 just as
Vodafone was beginning to feel the pinch from such upstart British
rivals as Orange PLC and One2One. He changed the company's logo,
fought aggressively for market share, and in March 1998 presided
over a long-term strategy meeting of the company's board and its
advisers that resolved to make a major acquisition. The choice
facing Vodafone, he told associates, was ``to hunt or be hunted'' _
a perception that underpinned his refusal to let Bell Atlantic
outbid him for Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunities like that come up and either you take them or
they are gone,'' an associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Gent was born in Gosport, a southern coastal town, and his
formal education ended when he left school to work as a trainee
bank manager. His ambitions were initially political and in 1977,
at 29, he was elected national chairman of the Young Conservatives,
the youth wing of the Tory party. During that period, he formed
political connections that some have depicted as giving Vodafone an
edge when a Conservative government deregulated the
telecommunications business in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, his ties to the Conservatives have loosened,
though not to the point, he said, of switching to the Labor Party.
In the May 1997 national election, Gent urged voters to support the
Conservatives. Late last year, though, he was one of the signers of
an open letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government,
urging it to move faster toward adopting the single European
currency, in direct contradiction of Conservative policy.
</P>
<P>
   In taking over as chief executive of Vodafone Airtouch, Gent
will be moving into the U.S. telecommunications world, which, he
says, has been ``slightly disappointing'' compared with the surging
expansion of the wireless business in Britain and Continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only difference. By some estimates, Airtouch
chief executive Sam Ginn stands to make more than $300 million in
stock options from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compensation packages between the U.K. and the U.S. have
been very different for some time,'' Gent noted.
</P>
<P>
   But would he receive the same kind of windfall as Ginn?
``Absolutely not,'' he said.

IMF AND U.S. OFFER NO ADDITIONAL AID TO BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRAZIL-ECON) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund and the United
States said Monday that they were heartened by Brazil's pledge to
keep interest rates high and slash its budget deficit. But they
offered no new financial aid and made clear that Brazil's economic
fate is largely in its own hands.
</P>
<P>
   As they shuttled around Washington seeking to explain and build
support for their government's decision to allow its currency to
float in value, Brazilian officials said they had gotten the
message and were prepared to do what it takes to re-establish the
country's credibility in the ultimate court of economic policy, the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Brazil's central bank announced Monday night that it
was increasing overnight interest rates, Pedro Malan, Brazil's
finance minister, told a news conference here that President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration was determined to take
whatever steps necessary to avert a crippling new round of
inflation. And he said the government would intensify efforts to
push through a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended
to bring the budget deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know additional measures may be required'' to improve the
country's fiscal condition, keep the economy on track and maintain
the confidence of investors, Malan said.
</P>
<P>
   Malan met Monday with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, and Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there was a ``shared judgment that the most
important thing in Brazil was the pursuit of strong policies, which
especially meant carrying through on deficit reduction measures,
strong anti-inflation monetary policies and continued structural
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official said Malan ``made clear his own determination
and President Cardoso's determination in a very complex political
environment to carry through effectively. That was certainly
something we welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, also offered
encouraging words. ``I am personally very satisfied with the
conversations that IMF staff and management have had over the last
weekend with minister Malan and the Brazilian team,'' Camdessus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malan said after arriving in Washington on Saturday that Brazil
might ask the IMF and individual countries, including the United
States, to speed up planned aid payments due to Brazil under a
$41.5 billion assistance program negotiated last fall. The next set
of loans, about $9 billion, is scheduled for release next month.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian and U.S. officials said on Monday, however, that there
were no discussions about granting the loans ahead of schedule.
Economists said that since Brazil was no longer defending the value
of the currency, the real, on a day-to-day basis, the country had
less immediate need to bolster its foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil, which took the first steps last week towards
abandoning its old stable-exchange rate policy without informing
the IMF and the Clinton administration, will now have to accept
closer scrutiny by the international lending organizations and the
countries providing it with aid, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued here Monday, Malan said Brazil would
``intensify its dialogue'' with the organizations and countries
providing aid and would ``establish new and more intensive
procedures of continuous consultation'' with the IMF, including the
possible opening of an IMF office in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   With financial markets around the world reacting favorably again
Monday to Brazil's new currency strategy and with the United States
and the IMF providing their stamp of approval, Brazil appears to
have come through what could have been a disastrous collapse of its
old strategy without any serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   But the true test will come only when the country hits its next
economic bump, as it inevitably will, or when an outbreak of the
financial turmoil that has plagued the world since mid-1997 next
sweeps through the markets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economists and policymakers see two possible outcomes for
Brazil. Under the optimistic version, a temporary increase in
interest rates and quick action to rein in the budget deficit
restore confidence in the markets, allowing the currency to
stabilize without dropping much further. Interest rates then come
down, and the devalued currency allows Brazil to export more
easily, helping economic growth without fueling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pessimistic version, continued downward pressure on
the value of the currency forces the central bank to keep interest
rates cripplingly high. The economy stalls, forcing politicians
into an agonizing choice between weathering a painful recession or
reducing rates, a move that could send the currency plummeting and
inflation sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Britain abandoned a policy of keeping the pound stable
in value relative to the other main European currencies after a
speculative attack of the sort that has become increasingly common
in countries with underlying economic problems. Britain's finance
minister at the time said the collapse of the stable exchange rate
policy had him singing in the shower because it allowed him to
reduce rates and give a boost to the domestic economy without
worrying about the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Given its history of hyper-inflation and doubts among investors
about its willingness to deal with its fiscal deficit, Brazil does
not have that luxury. Malan, to the relief of the IMF and the
United States, explicitly said as much in his statement on Monday,
a message reinforced by the central bank's quick move to raise
interest rates to help prop up the currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new exchange rate regime, fiscal and monetary policies
will have to play an even more crucial role in ensuring price
stability and conditions for sustained economic growth,'' Malan
said.

ADVERTISING: PROGRESS CITED IN EXPANDING MINORITY-ORIENTED
ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The organizers of efforts to press advertisers and
agencies to devote more attention and resources to consumers from
minority groups _ and to the media aimed at such consumers _ say
they are generally pleased with the initial responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who
has been the most outspoken leader of the efforts to address
so-called markets of color.
</P>
<P>
   Progress on reversing what he called ``years of entrenched
problems'' can be achieved, he added, ``if we are consistent and
persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's conciliatory assessments were made at a news
conference during a meeting Monday on multicultural markets and
media at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan. The
meeting drew 250 to 300 participants, including, by Sharpton's
estimate, top executives representing 40 advertisers and 12
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in our judgment very significant, in fact historic, to
bring the advertising industry together to deal with this issue,''
Sharpton said. ``This is not a one-night stand at the Waldorf,'' he
added, smiling. ``This is a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   If wedding bells ring, it will be partly because advertiser and
agency executives quickly agreed to join Sharpton and his advocacy
organization, the National Action Network, as hosts of the meeting.
Among the participants were the American Association of Advertising
Agencies, the Association of National Advertisers and the American
Advertising Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem,'' acknowledged Wally Snyder, president and
chief executive of the federation, who added: ``And there are
opportunities. So let's get on with the solution that would allow
us to capitalize on the opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-debated issue of whether the amount of advertising
spending in ethnic media adequately reflects the size and spending
power of ethnic markets was revived last May with the publication
of an internal memo from the Katz Media Group unit of Chancellor
Communications. The memo suggested that a radio station aimed at
mainstream listeners try to sell commercial time by denigrating
stations with large black or Hispanic audiences, using the argument
that advertisers want ``prospects, not suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week by the Federal Communications
Commission concluded that radio stations aimed primarily at black
and Hispanic audiences drew significantly less ad revenue per
listener.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the disclosure of the Katz memo, Sharpton
threatened ``a long, hot summer on Madison Avenue'' if advertisers
and agencies did not respond to complaints that they were
discriminating against ethnic media.
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisers criticized by Sharpton were praised effusively
yesterday for agreeing _ ``in writing,'' as he repeated _ to
address those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   One was Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. and the other was
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of retail chains like
Macy's and Bloomingdale's. Pepsi-Cola agreed to spend more in
ethnic radio and magazines, Sharpton said, and Federated agreed to
spend more in ethnic radio.
</P>
<P>
   The attendees, who included celebrities like Don King and Isaac
Hayes, listened to presentations that ranged from dry recitations
of demographic data about black, Hispanic and Asian-American
consumers to fervent pleas to end what was portrayed as disrespect
for and discrimination against ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opportunity to get a fair hearing is all we ask for,'' said
Earl G. Graves Jr., president and chief operating officer at Black
Enterprise magazine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe Madison Avenue has a problem,'' Graves said.
``General market advertising agencies don't understand the
African-American market and don't take the market seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a 23-year-old white media planner put together
a plan,'' he added, ``and assume you are in touch with what the
African-American market is doing.'' Black Enterprise is published
by Earl G. Graves Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table is big,'' said Ana Maria Fernandez Haar, president
of the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies and president
and chief executive at IAC Advertising Group in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people we sit at it,'' she added, ``the better it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated references to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.; the meeting was timed to take place on the holiday
honoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us talking to each other and going forward,'' Sharpton
said, ``is what Martin Luther King would've wanted us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from today, we'll have the same summit,'' he added,
``but we'll be giving a report on the progress we'll have made in
the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were lighter moments, too, such as when Jeff Yang,
publisher of A. Magazine: Inside Asian America, published by Metro
East Publications in New York, began his presentation on the
Asian-American consumer market by declaring: ``Unfortunately, my
Chinese is pretty terrible. Buenos dias.'' The audience responded
with laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Graves recommended during his remarks that money devoted to
buying ads in black media ought to be significant sums rather than
``part of the `This should keep Sharpton from calling fund.'''
</P>
<P>
   And during the news conference, Sharpton compared his meetings
with top agency managers to discuss his complaints to visiting
``the Rocky Mountains: the higher up you get, the whiter it got.''

FLOUNDERING ISLANDERS LOSE JONSSON, THEIR LONE ALL-STAR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYOSSET, N.Y. _ Just when it seemed the Islanders' situation
could not get any worse, the team learned Monday it would be
without its all-star defenseman, Kenny Jonsson, for a month because
of a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, who was to be the Islanders' lone representative at
Sunday's All-Star Game, sustained a partial tear of the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee last Saturday in a light
collision with a Florida Panthers defenseman, Robert Svehla. It was
the same knee that Jonsson had twisted earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson will not be able to play in the All-Star Game in Tampa,
Fla. As a result, the Islanders will likely not be represented in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson was named to the World Team by the National Hockey
League's operations staff last week. But his replacement, to be
named by that same group, headed by Colin Campbell, does not have
to be an Islander. Because of the injuries to defensemen Uwe Krupp
(the Detroit Red Wings) and Roman Hamrlik (the Edmonton Oilers),
both expected to miss the game, Campbell has to pick another
defenseman. The Islanders' only other non-North American defenseman
is the rookie Zdeno Chara.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's news could not have come at a worse time for the
Islanders, who have not won in 10 games and have the league's
second-worst record at 13-28-3. Only the Tampa Bay Lightning
(9-30-4) is worse.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, did not
meet with reporters after Monday's practice at IceWorks. Jonsson
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Without Jonsson or his defensive partner Rich Pilon, who is also
out with a sprained knee, the Islanders have only five healthy
defensemen and must promote a minor leaguer. Ted Crowley, an
offensive defenseman just acquired from Colorado, is the leading
candidate, but the decision will not be made until after Gordie
Clark, the Islanders' assistant general manager, scouts their
American Hockey League affiliate, the Lowell, Mass., Lock Monsters,
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have also lost the enforcer Gino Odjick, who had
season-ending surgery Monday to repair a torn abdominal muscle. He
missed the previous 16 games.

<P>
   PARIS _ The shock of Yves Saint Laurent's beatnik-inspired 1960
collection for the House of Dior was proof of a rebellious nature.
That was before Saint Laurent made the journey that has brought him
to the stature of a classic in French fashion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jean Paul Gaultier is tracing a similar trajectory _
from being the designer once most likely to snub the fashion
establishment to one who has become a supreme practitioner of that
classic of French dressmaking called haute couture.
</P>
<P>
   In fashion history, the three pillars of the couture traditions
are Saint Laurent, Madeleine Vionnet and Alix Gres. And in his
spring 1999 couture presentation on Sunday, Gaultier brilliantly
evoked all three.
</P>
<P>
   The men's suits in metallic organza, the black tuxedo suits and
a sinuous tuxedo dress with a flamenco hemline all recalled Saint
Laurent. But the work was pure Gaultier. His jersey gowns flowed
like heavy cream from plate-shaped necklaces around the models'
necks. Hundreds, if not thousands of plisse tucks must have gone
into a delectable shirtwaist chiffon dress in opalescent white.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the show, in spirit and in person, was Countess
Jacqueline de Ribes, a long-admired couture client and a mainstay
of French society, who had already ordered the outfit Gaultier
called Confidence _ a brown stretch sweater and trouser set that
bares one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   For all the judicious gowns and suits the designer showed, a
Gaultier collection without a drop of irreverence would be like
``Seinfeld'' without Kramer. Gaultier provided several naughty
winks: a sexy jump suit with huge flamenco pants, scarves with
built-in handbags and a strapless sheath gown styled like a pair of
jeans in washed blue denim.
</P>
<P>
   All of Gaultier's pent-up classicism is being released: this
rabble-rouser of design is producing the most classical haute
couture, and it is stunning to see.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a drawback to this emerging side of the designer, it
is the evidence that commercial realities are being felt in couture
design, once the province of fashion for fashion's sake. So
Gaultier's show was laced with pants suits and conservative
shirtdresses.
</P>
<P>
   And he was not alone: from Gaultier to Christian Dior,
Valentino, Givenchy, Versace and Ungaro, there was an unfortunate
tendency to show too-perfect jackets over dresses and pants suits.
</P>
<P>
   At Valentino, there was scarcely anything else. Valentino,
famous for designs of great beauty, failed to get this collection
into the air. The parade of proper caftan jackets and somber sheath
dresses and skirts must have been a soporific to the designer's
fans who jetted in from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those calling for more reality in couture may want to think
twice if such clothes are the result. Suits are perfectly nice for
everyday wear, but couture begs for clothes that celebrate
dressmaking virtuosity or design creativity. Couture should be
sublime. There are already enough ``real'' clothes in the world _
maybe too many.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of growing realism, at least one couture designer,
John Galliano, has gone in the opposite direction, recalling the
Surrealist movement of the 1920s through the '40s, a period when
fashion was closest to an art movement, when dress designers,
photographers and artists like Schiaperelli, Man Ray, Dali, Cocteau
and Bebe Berard all fed one another's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to this period, Galliano created a marriage of artistry
and couture technique for Christian Dior. Wisely, the designer
draws upon the tamer aspects of Surrealism, marrying menswear
inspirations and femininity. In a brief but charming speech at the
start of the show, he talked about his fascination with Dali and
his wife, Gala.
</P>
<P>
   In Surrealism, Galliano reminded his audience _ which consisted
of clients like Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter), Nan Kempner,
Anne Bass, Veronica Hearst, Diane Von Furstenburg and her daughter,
Alexandra _ ``everything is not always as it seems.'' That could
have been license for boisterous kitsch, but Galliano turned this
inspiration into one of his most refined and wearable collections
to date.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes _ wearable fashion can still be art. Galliano drove home
the point with a Prince of Wales double-breasted pants suit, worn
backward. The power struggle he posited between the masculine side
of the collection (represented by Dali) and the feminine side
(Gala) was resolved creatively with the triumph of his dresses over
wide-leg trousers suits. Though they were beautifully wrought, the
man-tailored suits were outdone by styles like a delicate ecru
off-the-shoulder sheath with side buttons, and a stunning day dress
in Prince of Wales plaid, pulled tight across the bodice.
</P>
<P>
   In a great marriage of Surrealism and couture, Galliano posed
one model, in long black gloves and a glistening white gown,
against a black backdrop. The tableau rendered the model's arms and
hands invisible against the backdrop, thus highlighting the line
and drape of the dress.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint is a virtue that not all designers know how to use.
Alexander McQueen for Givenchy understands how to pull back but
still keep the action going. This designer, who is still in his
20s, recognizes the magic that couture can be. A skirt made of
woven ribbons in as many colors as a pinata and a black and pale
gold harlequin gown with ruffled skirt and a matching overcoat were
expertly rendered. So too, were three lustrous swag-tailored long
jackets over trousers and a remarkable butter-yellow unitard
covered in jeweled triangles. The overall effect was not always
sensational, but this was a purposeful, sturdy couture collection,
full of wearable clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wash of unremarkable jackets and pants suits in Paris, it
was sometimes hard to tell where ready-to-wear ended and couture
began. Couture has to be more than custom work: it must have an
element of transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Ungaro offered some of both schools. There were
faultless jackets and dresses, all girlish and sweet, like the
ivory and rose sheer blouse draped under a beige jacket.
</P>
<P>
   His dreams came to life in a top strung from beaded chains with
a rippling floral skirt, or in layers of seafoam over pale green,
in turn layered over antique plum.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery, however, does not abound in Donatella Versace's
designs. She seeks to bring a hard edge to couture. There were bold
ideas in her clothes, but some provocatively draped negligee
dresses she showed a week ago in Milan spoke better to the art that
the Versaces have perfected in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace concentrated on exploring unusual fabrics and
fabric-enhancing techniques, rather than on ways to use these
materials for a flattering effect. Among her interesting mediums
were cashmere pierced with needles of Venetian glass, rosewood
sticks woven with Swarovski crystals, and woven raffia. The
collection undoubtedly had some funk to it, but never found a a
groove.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping from long hems to short is a difficult maneuver, and
both Ms. Versace and Ocimar Versolato tried to span both sides.
Versolato's draped evening gowns strive to embody a kind of ancient
nobility, but with their angular planes they are more reminiscent
of Balenciaga than Mme. Gres.
</P>
<P>
   As the screen on the back of his stage revolved 180 degrees each
time a new model was about to appear, one never knew which
Versolato might make an entrance. Would it be the noble princess
clad in floor-sweeping chiffon or the flip go-go girl in a white
mini dress, the realistic couture or its more exciting and
progressive sister, fantasy?

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Tornadoes that cut through Tennessee on Sunday
killed at least 8 people and injured 105, officials reported
Monday, with the most damage in Jackson and surrounding Madison
County northeast of Memphis, where 6 people died and more than 60
buildings were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes were seen or touched down in 12 counties and damage
was reported in 16 additional counties from the unusual winter
tornadoes, which roared across the state's tornado alley with gusts
up to 100 mph in middle and western Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topographically, that is where Gulf moisture meets Canadian
jet streams, so it tends to be a breeding ground for tornadoes,''
said Cecil Whaley, director of natural hazards for the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most people in the area were not expecting tornadoes in
January. ``This is strange,'' said W. Jerry Smith, 64, president of
the George A. Smith and Sons funeral home. ``We never have storms
like this in the dead of winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley said, ``People get lulled into thinking this is ice storm
season, but you have to watch out because severe weather is a
threat now too as long as these conditions exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's funeral home in Bemis, a suburb south of Jackson, was
destroyed. ``I went out there last night after it was all over,''
Smith said, ``and there was only one wall left standing and a pile
of rubble. At 2 yesterday afternoon we had a large service
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Smith was back at work in his two other funeral homes in
the Jackson area, where part of his day was spent meeting with
three of the families who had lost relatives in the storm. ``I can
build a new funeral home,'' he said. ``But now I'm dealing with
people who have problems that can't be fixed. So that is what is
important.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fire station next to the funeral home was also damaged and
cleanup efforts continued Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson Sun newspaper lost power at its offices, causing
reporters and editors to pack up computers about 9 p.m. on Sunday
and move the newsroom to the basement of the executive editor's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were working off the Ping-Pong table in my rec room,''
said Richard Schneider, the executive editor. ``We made a portable
darkroom and were drying negatives with my 13- and 16-year-old
daughters' blow dryer.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Henderson County to the east, an elderly woman was killed in
her home and her husband was seriously injured, said Pam Tolley,
director of emergency 911 communications for the county. ``We were
very fortunate that most of the damage was to power lines and
structures and not people,'' she said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wells of the Tennessee National Guard said two helicopters
were destroyed and three others were seriously damaged at the
National Guard hangar at the Jackson airport. ``The odd part was,
the civilian airport across the street was not damaged at all,''
said Wells. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A propane tank and a second fire station were also damaged in
Jackson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to tour the area Tuesday.
Jackson is his mother's hometown and some of his relatives live
there.

CLINTON PROPOSES TAX BREAK FOR STAY-AT-HOME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, R.I.)   &HT;    (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will embrace an idea long favored
by conservatives and propose a tax break for parents who stay home
to care for their children, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit, up to $250 a year for each child under
age 1, is smaller than the tax breaks proposed by Republicans for
the same purpose. But the administration now accepts the Republican
argument that the government should recognize the value of services
provided by parents, generally mothers, who forgo paid employment
to care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes we should respect and support parents
in whatever choices they make, whether to work or to stay at
home,'' said Bruce N. Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy
adviser. ``Mothers or fathers who stay home to raise a child need
help, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton has offered several proposals to make child
care more affordable to working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton would probably
highlight his child care proposals, including the tax credit, in
his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday. Republicans
led by Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island proposed a similar tax
credit last year, and they intend to try again this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White House officials said, Clinton will propose a
tax credit to encourage small businesses to provide health
insurance to employees. Under the proposal, employers with fewer
than 50 workers could get the tax credits for two years if they
established or joined a purchasing coalition to obtain health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would receive a tax credit of $500 a year for each
family insured through a coalition, and $250 for each person
covered as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses are much less likely than big companies to
provide health insurance to their employees, in part because the
premiums are higher and the costs less predictable. Small
businesses have generated most of the nation's new jobs, and this
helps explain why the ranks of the uninsured are growing even as
the nation's economy expands and employment rises to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 million people are uninsured and work for companies
with fewer than 25 employees. They account for nearly half of all
uninsured workers and nearly one-fourth of all people without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the tax break for small businesses
would cost $44 million over five years. It would be available only
to companies that did not provide health benefits to employees in
1997 or 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit for stay-at-home parents is part of a
package of measures to subsidize child care that would cost more
than $18 billion over five years. The tax credit would cost $1.3
billion over five years and would benefit 1.7 million families, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in the package would give additional tax relief
based on income and child care expenses to working parents, to help
offset child care costs, and would expand the main federal program
that subsidizes child care for families so poor that they pay no
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the child care proposals, aside from the assistance for
parents who stay home, were included in Clinton's budget last year.
He announced the proposals with fanfare at the White House in
January 1998, but he did not fight hard for them on Capitol Hill.
The proposals died in Congress, in part because their financing was
linked directly to a big tobacco bill, strenuously opposed by the
tobacco industry. There will be no such link this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the president's proposals on child care and
health insurance were intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``We have two questions. Is the White House
inviting the Internal Revenue Service deeper into people's lives by
complicating the tax code? Is the Clinton administration paying for
its initiatives by raising taxes on the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans last year faulted Clinton for not proposing
assistance to parents who stay home to care for children. The
criticism came from moderates like Chafee and conservatives like
Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho. ``The government should not
discriminate against parents who decide to stay home and take care
of their kids,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the administration has decided to seek a
substantial increase in federal grants to the states for services
to people with severe mental illnesses. The grants would total $358
million, an increase of $70 million, or 24 percent, over this
year's level.

BRUINS EXPLODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Bruins8, Predators1 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By late in the second period, it turned into a mental
health day, a rare opportunity for the Bruins to ease back a few
inches on their bench, relax, take account of the embarrassment of
their riches. One day Internet terminals undoubtedly will be part
of every NHL bench. This would have been one to log on, look for
favorite places, maybe forward a recipe to Aunt Gert.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much easier than the Bruins' 8-1 thumping of the
expansion Nashville Predators Monday before a crowd of 15,586 at
the Fleet Center. Never before had they scored so many goals inside
the FleetCenter. Steve Heinze led the way with a couple (Nos. 12,
13), part of a balanced dismantling that acted as a
batting-practice tuneup to the visit here Thursday by the red-hot
Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept things simple, we tried not to be fancy,'' said coach
Pat Burns, his club recovering well from a sloppy, often
inattentive 2-2 tie with the Lightning Saturday. ``I just hope we
kept enough goals for Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Heinze's pair, the victory was encouraging on a few other
vital fronts:
</P>
<P>
   --Burns paired two rookie blue liners, Brandon Smith and Terry
Virtue, and wasn't afraid to roll them out, especially as the
winning margin approached a touchdown. They each played 16 minutes
34 seconds and finished plus-3. This was a sharp contrast to
Saturday night when Burns rolled out only four defensemen and kept
Virtue stapled to the bench as a black-and-gold accidental tourist.
</P>
<P>
   --The emergence of (drum roll, please) a No. 2 line. Jumbo Joe
Thornton played the pivot between Peter Ferraro and Heinze, and the
trio collected three goals and three assists. If the Bruins hope to
play beyond April 18 _ and no one is guaranteeing postseason
berths, especially with Pavel Bure now in Florida _ they have to
get some offensive action from something other than the Jason
Allison-Sergei Samsonov-Dmitri Khristich combination.
</P>
<P>
   --Rookie forward Andre Savage, showing a brushstroke of bona
fide big-league scoring touch, carried out from behind the right
post and zipped a forehander under the crossbar, reminiscent of a
John Bucyk roof job. It was Savage's first NHL goal. He has the
kind of knack with the puck that makes him a candidate for duty on
a No. 2 line. Four guys, three jobs: meet the new math.
</P>
<P>
   As for the struggling Predators (15-24-4 in their inaugural
season), their list of goods and bads was weighted heavily on one
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't deserve to be in the game _ and we weren't,'' said
coach Barry Trotz, his Predators devoured in a lopsided 37-17 shot
advantage rolled up by the Bruins. ``The score was every bit 8-1.
(The Bruins) won all the battles, because they wanted to win all
the battles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Predators this season typically have surrendered only 3-4
goals per game. With No. 1 goalie Mike Dunham sidelined with a
groin pull, their net these days is entrusted to the likes of Tomas
Vokoun and Chris Mason, a combination that doesn't measure up well
against Dunham, the longtime backup to Martin Brodeur in New
Jersey. Vokoun was yanked when the score hit 5-1 at the start of
the second _ a P.J. Axelsson one-time slapper _ and then Mason
allowed three more goals on 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this to give everyone a boost, confidence-wise,''
said the Bruins' Rob DiMaio, who set up Axelsson's slapper with a
pretty dish out of the left corner. ``And it came at the right
time, with a big game coming against Ottawa.''
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, a lopsided win over the Predators doesn't act
as an accurate guage of where the Bruins stand. Ottawa will be a
better read. The Senators are fast and talented and they're gaining
strength as their lead center, Alexei Yashin, gets older, wiser,
and a little tougher.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear halfway through the 1998-99 season, however, is
that every point in the bank will be extremely important. The
Panthers picked up Bure in a big swap with the Canucks Sunday
night, which means an also-ran in the Eastern Conference suddenly
becomes a playoff contender. The Bruins right now look like one of
a half-dozen teams that will spend the next three months battling
it out for the Nos. 7 and 8 playoff spots. It's not late in the
year, but already the squeeze is in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Points are precious, we have to realize that,'' said veteran
defenseman Don Sweeney. ``We were idle for about 4-5 days and we
lost ground in the standings. It makes you realize, when your games
are up, you have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Predators come bearing gifts, accept them graciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint,'' uttered Trotz, ``the best thing is that
the final buzzer went.''

PRO- AND ANTI-CLINTON LOBBYING BECOMES LESS INTENSE DURING TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Del., Maine, Pa., R.I., Vt., N.Y., Pa., R.I.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-REPUBS, IMPEACH-SANTORUM) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People for the American Way has organized
anti-impeachment forums in 21 cities for Tuesday evening, just
before President Clinton delivers his State of the Union speech.
The Christian Coalition's Web site is up and hyperlinking, allowing
its constituents to sign even more electronic petitions demanding
Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the letters, phone calls and e-mails are flowing again
here, this time directed at the senators who will vote on Clinton's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Senate prepares for the second week of the
impeachment trial, there is growing evidence that the lobbying
storm that swept switchboards, e-mail servers and post office boxes
during December's House debate is not as intense this time. Some
Senate aides say they have been surprised by what they describe as
a relatively manageable influx of calls and letters, and a number
of the grass-roots organizers even suggest that there is a
going-trough-the-motions element in this second round of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to keep our members inspired to pursue the
fight,'' said Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, which supports the president. ``Some of
them are war-weary from keeping it up so long. But they understand
that we have to keep doing the same thing: We have to keep making
those phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in tenor here is in effect an acknowledgment that the
dynamics of the Senate proceedings are different from those that
prevailed in the House. Among people following the trial, there is
a growing consensus that the senators are simply not so susceptible
to grass-roots lobbying as House members were in December. In fact,
said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
any such lobbying is ``having absolutely no influence.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of explanations for this. One is that by now,
the opinions of most senators, on a subject that has been fairly
well aired, may be all but fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These senators have fairly hard feelings about what they want
to do,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr., the author of a political report
that tracks congressional races across the country. ``And anything
that would change their mind is something that they heard inside
the chamber, not outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the very nature of the Senate proceedings _ a formal
trial, as opposed to the raucous political debate in the House _
tends to discourage the mass lobbying that has frequently made a
difference in legislative battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has far less effect in the trial setting than it
did in the House, where it was a more politically charged event,''
said Tony Bullock, chief of staff to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y. ``The feeling is that this is essentially a trial setting
and the senators are not going to be, and ought not be, swayed by
external input. The decisions should be made on the presentations
that were made and the evidence that was presented.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, aides to senators who are most likely to be a
target of any lobbying say the lawmakers disregard communication
that comes from outside their home state, especially if there is
any hint that it results from an organized effort.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the changed dynamic, the Conservative Caucus,
which has been a leading organization in the drive to oust Clinton,
is focusing not on large numbers of individual senators but on
Majority Leader Trent Lott. The group is calling 500 of its members
a night, urging them to demand of Lott that he resist any
Democratic proposal against calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott ``is the No. 1 target,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman of
the Conservative Caucus, who explained that by now, any lobbying
was not so much on the question of whether the president should be
convicted _ ``it's hard to change minds on that at this point'' _
as on what procedures to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Another anti-Clinton group, the Christian Coalition, has used
its Web site and phone banks to gather signatures demanding the
president's resignation. The group's executive director, Randy
Tate, said it now had about 300,000 names _ so many, he maintained,
that it has had to clear out furniture from an office to store the
printouts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Organization for Women, meanwhile, has sent e-mail
alerts asking members to demand that Clinton be acquitted. And
People for the American Way is preparing radio advertisements for
broadcast, beginning Wednesday, in states with senators whom the
organization considers less than decided: Delaware, Maine,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, some have noticed an increase in activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten tons of e-mails: over one weekend 2,200 e-mails,
which was astounding,'' said Nicholas Gramm, a spokesman for Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I. ``We're Little Rhodey, and we're not California
or Texas. That was a volume that we have never anticipated before,
or ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides in the offices of many other senators said they had
seen little or no change in the volume of ``contacts'' _ postal
mail, e-mail and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's none,'' said Robert Traynham, a spokesman for Sen.
Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``There's been no organized lobbying that we
know of to the senator's office on impeachment. I'm speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, interest organizations say they plan to push
ahead, if only to counteract what the other side is doing. ``Does
it have an impact?'' said Carole Shields, president of People for
the American Way. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shields said that when the House voted impeachment, she
heard ``several congressman who were undecided just before the vote
stating how many e-mail messages they had received.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tate, of the Christian Coalition, gave a more cautious
reading on the effectiveness of the lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things they will consider,'' he said of the
senators. ``It's important to hear from constituents. But at the
end of the day, this is going to be decided on the facts.''

EDITOR'S FIRING MORE TROUBLE FOR THE AMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association is under siege again after a
yearlong struggle to build back its membership base, regain its
political clout and, most of all, to extricate itself from scandal
and from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the retired Air Force general the nation's
largest doctors' group had hired to help restore its fraying
prestige generated unwelcome headlines when he fired the AMA's
top-ranking editor for publishing an article that touched on
presidential sex and impeachment politics. The episode has left AMA
watchers wondering whether Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. is up to
running the association _ and whether the AMA can regain the
prestige and power it enjoyed for most of its 152 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think the organization is in an amazing
tailspin,'' said Dr. Raymond Scalettar of Washington, D.C., who
chaired the AMA board in 1992-93 and has led unsuccessful reform
bids. ``Our aviator has literally flown the plane into the
mountain. It's a huge embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, a Harvard Medical School professor who edits a
monthly column in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
was equally distressed: ``The AMA is going to be viewed as simply a
lobby group for a bunch of angry doctors, and that's not going to
help anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But AMA President Dr. Nancy Dickey said in an interview Monday
that Anderson, who as executive vice president has day-to-day
authority over the organization, ``is committed to assuring that we
maintain the excellence of the things the AMA does well and that we
address effectively the areas in which we have concerns. I remain
supportive of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Anderson's firing of Dr. George D. Lundberg, the JAMA
editor, Dickey said ``anytime a key employee has lost the faith of
the chief executive in terms of his or her ability to function
within an organization, changes have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety over Friday's firing was heightened by memories of
the troubles that have plagued the AMA in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the deal, unveiled two years ago, in which the
AMA would have received millions of dollars for endorsing
humidifiers, blood-pressure monitors and other products made by
Sunbeam Corp. The deal was dropped after AMA members questioned the
ethics of the arrangement, but the brouhaha forced the resignation
of the then-executive vice president back. Sunbeam sued and won a
settlement of nearly $10 million, and a recent independent report
accused AMA trustees of failing to properly police the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling for the organization has been the continuing
decline in the percentage of US doctors who belong to the AMA _
from more than 90 percent in the 1950s, to barely 50 percent in
1975, to less than 40 percent today. ``The AMA had tremendous
leverage over the profession as a whole, but all that has broken
down'' and robbed the association of much of its legendary clout,
said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton University and
historian of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the firing of Lundberg, who over the last 17 years
built JAMA into one of the world's most esteemed medical
publications. The immediate complaint against him was the
publication in the current JAMA the results of a 1990 survey study
in which a substantial majority of college students agreed with
President Clinton's controversial contention that oral-genital
contact does not constitute ``having sex.'' Running the article as
Clinton's Senate impeachment trial is getting underway, Anderson
said, amounts to ``inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting
JAMA into a major political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA chief had had other differences with Lundberg,
reportedly including JAMA's special issue on alternative medicine
last year and Lundberg's advocacy on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' TV show of
the renewed use of autopsies to check on hospital performance.
Anderson declined to publicly discuss his grievances, and Dickey
would say only that Anderson had given Lundberg ``due process and
fair warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Others question the fairness of the firing and said Anderson has
a history of getting rid of subordinates who question his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparently what happened at the Truman Health Center in
Kansas City, a 500-bed hospital network where Anderson was CEO
before he was hired by the AMA seven months ago. He fired the
chairmen of the departments of radiology, pathology and medicine
after they signed a letter asking that he be replaced as dean at
the University of Missouri-Kansas City Medical School. In the
aftermath, Anderson was replaced as dean and the three chairmen
sued to hold onto their positions at the hospital, which is
affiliated with the medical school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most transparent case of retaliation I've ever been
involved with in 22 years of practicing law,'' says Michael
Manners, president of the Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys
and a lawyer for one of the department heads, whose case is due to
be decided in a Missouri court next month. ``There's certainly a
deja vu there'' with the Lundberg firing.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who served as Surgeon General of the Air Force, was
not available for comment Monday on the Kansas City events. Dickey
said ``we had studied carefully the situation in Kansas City before
the decision was made to hire Dr. Anderson. No, I didn't think it
was indicative of some administrative flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors worried Monday how Lundberg's departure would
impact JAMA and its affiliated journals, which are the one part of
the AMA empire that has thrived when the rest of the organization
was problem-plagued.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this clearly shows that political concerns of the
association are premiere and override editorial and scientific
independence,'' said Dr. Kenneth Arndt, chief of dermatology at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and editor of the Archives of
Dermatology, an AMA publication.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Webster, an AMA delegate from Wisconsin, said he
agrees with Anderson that the sex survey ``should not have come out
at this particular time in JAMA. Although whether this is a high
crime and misdemeanor for an editor to get fired over I don't
know.''

SUPER BOWL SUNDAY BEGINS EARLY ON FOX SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League conference championships on Sunday
concluded the normal part of your viewing season. The
Atlanta-Minnesota game began with Fox's hourlong pre-game show and
CBS's Jets-Denver game with a 30-minute show.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl, the next NFL game you see, will last half as
long as the excess that precedes it: seven hours before the game by
Fox Sports, the most since Fox perpetrated five hours at the Super
Bowl in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fox justifies starting Super Sunday at 11 a.m., Eastern time,
simply: money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can sell it, I'll produce it,'' said Ed Goren,
co-executive producer of Fox Sports, which is what he said two
years ago regarding pre-game activities that began at 1 p.m. ``What
are we pre-empting, infomercials?''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are at the heart of the network's Super Bowl programming
strategy. Fox expects to gross $180 million from advertising sold
for the pre-game show, the game and the post-game show on the Fox
network and on the 22 stations it owns. Early in the day,
advertisers are paying $60,000 per 30-second spot; during the game,
they will pay $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Fox makes on Super Bowl Sunday, the happier we'll be
since we have it in two years,'' said Sean McManus, the president
of CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Solomon, the president of national broadcast for SFM
Media, a media buyer, said advertisers buying spots in the seven
hours of pre-game programming can buy the reflected glory of the
Super Bowl, even if they are not buying time during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the promotion they get is almost as big as being
in the game,'' Solomon said. ``You can promote to retailers the
impression that you're in the game, even if you're really not, and
you may have only spent $60,000.''
</P>
<P>
   How will Fox fill its seven pre-game hours? From 11 to 11:30
a.m., Eastern, Terry Bradshaw, Cris Collinsworth, Howie Long and
others will discuss their Super Bowl experiences, followed by
``Hardcore Football'' through noon. Keith Olbermann will be the
host from noon to 12:30 p.m. of a behind-the-scenes look at Fox's
Super Bowl logistics and the planning for the halftime show,
followed by John Madden's 90-minute All-Millennium Team, a
1,000-year tribute to mud and mucus. From 2 to 6 p.m., Eastern,
Fox's usual hourlong pre-game show will be stretched to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl started as a game, then it became a day, now
it's a week,'' Goren said. ``The appetite for programming continues
to grow. And already, for the 2 o'clock show, we're 15 minutes over
in our planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann's half-hour show is his first contribution to the Fox
broadcast network since he signed to be the principal anchorman of
Fox Sports News on cable. If anyone knows excess, it is Olbermann,
who fled the MSNBC all-Monica network. ``If you're talking about
seven hours once a year on one topic, as a party mix to America's
gathering, it's not disproportionate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league would probably like its pre-Super Bowl
programming to start the week before the game, it isn't pushing the
networks to match Fox's long day's journey into Miami. ``It's up to
each individual network,'' said Dennis Lewin, the NFL's senior vice
president of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Not every network can clear out as much time as Fox will. For
example, when NBC did not carry the Super Bowl, it countered with
National Basketball Association games, which the post-lockout
season will preclude it from doing.
</P>
<P>
   McManus will be watching the results of Fox's excess, as will
ABC, the network of the 2000 game. ``If our people can generate
substantial advertising, we'll produce as many hours as they can
sell efficiently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McManus would not comment on a report last week in The Hollywood
Reporter, a trade publication, that CBS had nearly broken even on
the $500 million-a-year average cost of its NFL rights agreement.
Observers thought CBS was crazy for more than doubling NBC's
average $216 million annual payment for the American Football
Conference package. But the publication said the CBS network sold
$360 million in advertising, the 14 stations it owns and operates
generated sales of $80 million, affiliates paid $40 million to help
foot the NFL bill and $5 million came from DirecTV satellite
subscriber fees.
</P>
<P>
   NOT SO JETS CRAZY
</P>
<P>
   The Jets-Denver AFC championship game produced a 27.3
preliminary overnight Nielsen rating on Sunday, down a smidgen from
the 27.7 for the NFC title game last year in the same 4 p.m.,
Eastern, time slot. The Minnesota-Atlanta game generated a 26.2
rating, up from a 26.1 for last year's AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   The New York market generated a 30.0 rating and a 52 share for
the Jets game, meaning that more than half of the local households
watching television were tuned to the Jets-Denver game. That's a
dandy rating, but not as stupendous as those in the other markets
watching the two title games. The New York rating fell below Denver
(54.4), Atlanta (50.6) and Minneapolis-St. Paul (47.7); in
addition, more than 80 percent of the televisions in use in Denver
and Minneapolis were tuned to the games compared with 52 percent in
the New York market.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of the New York market meant more households _
about 2 million _ watched, compared with Denver's 652,000,
Atlanta's 847,400 and 690,700 in Minneapolis.

SPORTS COLUMN: BOTH SUPER BOWL TEAMS UNDERSTAND THE RUNNING GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Does successful passing create productive running? Or
is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   The entrants in Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31 in Miami cast a
vote for the latter. For the Atlanta Falcons and the Denver
Broncos, productive running creates successful passing.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams run the ball with vigor. Linemen and linebackers step
forward to stop them. Pass defenders begin to cheat toward the line
of scrimmage to support in run defense. Soon, all 11 defenders have
become immersed in stopping the run. Pow! Both teams then clobber
you with the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary. Basic. Old-school football with big-time runners in
Jamal Anderson for Atlanta and Terrell Davis for Denver. Offenses
with fancy formations, big-play receivers, high-powered
quarterbacks, but all of it founded on the basis of run production.
</P>
<P>
   This Super Bowl will not feature a pure West Coast offense in
which the focus is the passing game and short passes are the
equivalent of runs. The run-and-shoot passing offense, an offense
in which run is a dirty word, will not be the order. For Atlanta
and Denver, it is all about balance, a penchant for physical
football first.
</P>
<P>
   Two 16-2 teams in Super Bowl XXXIII. Two teams with versatile
offensive lines that have staying power and tremendous will. Teams
that fell behind and kept pounding away on the ground to set up big
passing plays in their conference championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta beat Minnesota on Sunday in part by outrushing the
Vikings by 110 yards to 102. The Broncos were even more decisive
against the Jets _ 178 rushing yards to only 14 by the Jets, and 38
carries compared with the Jets' 13.
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Reeves, the Falcons' head coach, came to Atlanta before
the 1997 season, the Falcons had employed the run-and-shoot as
their base offense. Small, Smurf-like receivers, four and five of
them in spread formations, with quarterbacks making half-rolls and
quick throws, passes, passes, passes and more passes. Reeves
chucked that. He wanted balance. Physical play. His style: run the
ball and stop the run, and throw play-action passes off the run. He
made the Falcons stronger in the weight room and mentally tougher,
more prone to dispense poundings than to absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think this game is so technical, but it's not,'' Reeves
said. ``Run the ball, stop the run and get turnovers. Every
football team that I've been around that's been any good does that.
Now, you can do some things as an offshoot from that, but, really,
that's what the game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what the Falcons are all about. Denver, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson weighs 234 pounds. Two hundred of that sometimes seems
to be in his legs. They keep churning, and his robust and powerful
thighs make him hard to tackle. Yet he is light, nimble on his
feet. Fast enough. In football jargon, he is a beast.
</P>
<P>
   Davis rushed for 2,000-plus yards this season. He weighs 210
pounds. Uncanny. Strong. Great vision. Great burst. Tremendous
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Both backs go nowhere, however, without skilled offensive
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   These are the two best offensive lines in football. Usually in
the Super Bowl, that is where you find the best of everything, but
especially offensive linemen. If the run creates the pass and
gifted running backs shine like silver, then offensive linemen are
the pure gold.
</P>
<P>
   Both lines are coached by dynamic teachers: for the Falcons, it
is Art Shell, for the Broncos it is Alex Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   Their pupils set the tempo. It was Denver's desire to use its
offensive linemen to break the will of the Jets' defense, to pound
the Jets over the course of four quarters with the run until they
broke. And the Broncos did that, both in the running game and then
in play action off it.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Falcons and the Broncos employ offensive linemen who
understand that their best work is done as a unit. The tight end
helps the left tackle. The left tackle helps the left guard. The
left guard helps the center. He helps the right guard. The right
guard helps the right tackle. And in a two-tight-end scheme, he
helps the other tight end. Down the line, they play off each other,
aid each other, double-team, triple-team, pull, spin and work like
a tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Falcons and the Broncos use a toss-pitch play where
both give the illusion of a sweep, but the idea all along is for
the running back to cut back inside in the equivalent of an
off-tackle play. Defenses (the Jets did it on Davis' 31-yard
touchdown run) overpursue. The offensive linemen seal them, pin
them toward the sideline, opening a lane. Watch the way the
Broncos' offensive linemen, in particular, block it. They get you
going, roaming one way, and then use your momentum to help block
you, sway you away from the play. An extra nudge, push and shove,
and you are out of the play, partly by your own doing. Zone
blocking at its best. Efficient. Masterful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the offensive lines of both Atlanta and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence alone makes for quite a Super Bowl, a test of
teams that understand the running game _ the knowledge, importance
and ability of running the football and defending the run _ and how
that parlays into the passing game and beyond. It will make for
quite a show in the Biggest Show, where the real fireworks, for a
change, will be well grounded. &QL;

<P>
   In a response to a faulty French plan to placate Saddam Hussein,
the Clinton administration has proposed lifting the ceiling on
Iraqi oil sales under the United Nations' oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
   The sole virtue of Washington's proposal is that it would not
permit Saddam to retain his weapons of mass destruction and rebuild
his conventional military capabilities, as the Paris proposal would
have done.
</P>
<P>
   The French are willing to scuttle the UN Special Commission,
which the Security Council created after Desert Storm to discover
and dismantle Saddam's biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons
and the missiles to deliver them. Instead, France would end the UN
embargo on Iraqi oil sales, abandon the search for Saddam's hidden
stocks of germs and poison gas, and establish a ban against arms
sales to Iraq in order to prevent Saddam from reviving his depleted
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   This plan would achieve for Saddam one of his two basic aims and
enhance his progress toward the other: It would lift the UN embargo
and allow him to retain his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's answer to this display of French frivolity is
little more than a stopgap suggestion that prolongs a policy of
muddling through.
</P>
<P>
   Since the equipment for Iraq's oil industry remains woefully
decrepit, Iraq is not able to pump even the limited amount of oil
permitted under the current ceiling of the UN oil-for-food program.
Couple this with oil prices that have plunged to $9 per barrel, and
the administration's gesture, meant to show compassion for Iraq's
people, looks like an empty exercise in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   This unproductive standoff between Paris and Washingon comes at
a time when Saddam has resumed his threats against other Arab
governments and they have responded by blaming him for the
cruelties imposed on the Iraqi people and calling for his
overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal of Iraq policy must be to resume inspections
of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. For the long term, there
is no alternative to the overthrow of Saddam's regime.

<P>
   Congratulations are due the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences for offering an honorary Academy Award to Elia Kazan, one
of the great film directors of the 1950s. Kazan, now 89 and ailing,
has been denied similar honors because he identified several
friends as members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan and a number of colleagues from New York theater were
party members themselves in the 1930s, when the Great Depression
caused many people to question the future of American capitalism.
By the early 1950s, the US economy was soaring, communism was
discredited, and Kazan and his friends were busy making movies.
Kazan produced his greatest works while Hollywood was embroiled in
the Red scare. The House Un-American Activities Committee, where he
testified, used hearings to advance its political agenda but did
nothing to advance national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, at the height of his artistry, was the committee's great
catch. In fact, like many of his friends, he was no hard-line Red,
having left the party after an 18-month flirtation. He was largely
apolitical thereafter, though as his career progressed he developed
great faith in the free enterprise system. His testimony was a
combination of political conservatism and career preservation.
</P>
<P>
   It would make the stuff of a great movie, and perhaps it already
is. Two years after his testimony Kazan directed ``On the
Waterfront,'' which starred Marlon Brando as the two-bit fighter
and longshoremen's enforcer who turns informer to clean up the
union local.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Waterfront'' endures as a masterpiece, as do ``Viva
Zapata,'' ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``East of Eden,'' and the
autobiographical ``America, America.'' Yet two years ago the Los
Angeles Film Critics Association and the American Film Institute
refused to give him the honors routinely bestowed on other masters
of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote by an academy committee to give him the Oscar
suggests that old animosities are fading. Kazan's achievements
transcend the vagaries of politics or the frailties of character.

   In 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois had a dream. He wanted to publish an
Encyclopedia Africana: a vast collection of Africa's land and
people written only by Africans that would sweep away flawed and
negative accounts of the continent. It was the wish of a scholar, a
man who had graduated from Fisk University and Harvard. And it
showed a deep faith that knowledge could lead to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Du Bois shook up the foundation of America arguing for and
writing copiously about civil rights. As an older man he moved to
Ghana, where Kwame Nkrumah, president of the Republic of Ghana,
asked Du Bois to supervise the production of an Encyclopedia
Africana. In 1961 the Secretariat of the Encyclopedia Africana in
Accra, Ghana, was established. Du Bois died two years later in
Ghana at the age of 95.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of his successors _ Harvard professors Henry Louis Gates
and Kwame Anthony Appiah _ have finished the encyclopedia. The
newly released Encarta Africana _ produced by Gates's Afropaedia
LLC and Microsoft _ is a CD-ROM version of Du Bois's
turn-of-the-century vision.
</P>
<P>
   The content is sprawling, featuring music, maps, video, history,
politics, and a 4-million-year time line. Lost voices _ Billie
Holiday, James Baldwin _ speak again. There are more than 3,300
articles, virtual tours, and filmed commentary that includes Whoopi
Goldberg and Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Will this knowledge move people forward? From education to the
news media, coverage of Africa is often sketchy: Events often end
up in news briefs or nowhere at all. History gets boiled down to
pyramids and European colonization.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta Africana's educational component should help. Teachers
have been asked to contribute lesson plans, some of which will be
published on Encarta's Schoolhouse Web page
(www.encarta.msn.com/schoolhouse/). For users with Internet access,
500 integrated Web links will facilitate on-line research. And if
it is used by children, the CD-ROM may help build a more educated
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The test of Encarta Africana will be how well it opens minds and
changes them.

FALCONS' JOY OF WINNING IS SHOCK FOR VIKINGS AND THEIR FANS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves was all smiles Monday
morning while chatting it up on ``Good Morning America.'' He made a
few jokes about his quadruple-bypass surgery, talked about the joy
of returning to the Super Bowl and politely sidestepped questions
about his stormy relationship with Denver quarterback John Elway.
It was a great morning because it followed a great afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Minnesota Vikings. After losing to the
Falcons in overtime, 30-27, in Sunday's National Football
Conference title game, a sense of dread filled the Minnesota locker
room and the entire city. On the front page of local newspapers
were photographs of crying fans. Many fans were trying to get
refunds from the airlines after they had booked flights to Miami
for Super Bowl XXXIII. The organization is in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Vikings players, they spent the day meeting with
coaches for the final time and cleaning out their lockers _
something they had not planned to do until after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' improbable victory was engineered by quarterback
Chris Chandler, who took the Falcons on a brilliant 10-play,
70-yard drive in overtime that ended with Morten Andersen's 38-yard
field goal. Reeves said the drive proved that Chandler deserved to
be considered among the great quarterbacks, which is interesting,
because the Vikings' focus was on stopping running back Jamal
Anderson _ not Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler admitted after the game that he was insulted by all the
stop Anderson talk, feeling that the Vikings did not respect him.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (16-2) had an outstanding season, setting the
single-season scoring record of 556 points. But many players feel
that the loss to Atlanta took away from some of their
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was our year,'' said Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock. ``It just didn't turn out that way. It was an
unbelievable experience out there. I just never saw it coming like
this. Never. I just feel empty.''
</P>
<P>
   What Coach Dennis Green must guard against is making sure such a
devastating loss does not have a lasting impact on his team. The
Cleveland Browns never seemed to recover from those killer John
Elway drives in the 1980's. If Vikings players, several months from
now, see Chandler in their dreams, that could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who will see Chandler in their dreams are the
coaching staff and players from the Broncos, who will study the
Falcons' offense every day for the next two weeks. What the
Minnesota game demonstrated is that the Falcons can win even if
Anderson has a subpar game. He had 67 yards on 23 carries, and
still the Falcons scored 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   That was because of the great efforts of Chandler, who was 12
for 17 on first-down plays, passing for 151 of his 340 yards and
one of his three touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who went with a pass-first game plan, put everything in
Chandler's hands and the quarterback didn't let him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of took some things personal when the Vikings mentioned
that all they had to do was stop the run,'' said Chandler, an
11-year veteran. ``I wanted to show that we had a passing game,
too, and you can't just figure you're going to stop Jamal and beat
us. I had a little more motivation going into this game.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Broncos also must account for is something less
tangible than Chandler's talent. It is the will of the Falcons, a
tough, stubborn team, modeled after their tough, stubborn coach.
How the Falcons kept battling back from three deficits of 10 or
more points at the hostile Metrodome was one of the most impressive
feats this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have a big enough lead to put us on the ropes,''
Atlanta defensive end Chuck Smith said. ``We've been down a lot of
times, but have they had a team come in here and fight back on
them? Every time other teams got in these situations, they folded.
We've had San Francisco come back on us, we've been down 14 to
Indianapolis, we were down to St. Louis. We just don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sportswriters and people on TV were writing stories
like Minnesota was like Dallas or a San Francisco, like they had
already won four Super Bowls, like these guys can't be beat.
Please. That's what they said about Green Bay.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was referring to Denver's upset of the Packers in
last year's Super Bowl, added, ``There's no team in this league
that can go out and win on name alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith then summed up perfectly the season of the Falcons: ``What
we've done sends shock waves through the league. A couple of years
ago, if you told me this would happen this quick, I'd have said,
`No, not in two years.'''
</P>
<P>
   And no one would have imagined these improbable scenes: Reeves,
only a matter of weeks removed from open heart surgery, accepting
the conference title trophy.

YUGOSLAVS ORDER DIPLOMAT TO LEAVE AND DENY ENTRY TO WAR-CRIMES
PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, defied
NATO on Monday and threatened a fragile cease-fire when he ordered
a top American diplomat, William Walker, out of Serbia after Walker
blamed the Serbs for the mass killing of more than 40 ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province last week.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the expulsion order, Serbian forces refused
entry to a United Nations war crimes prosecutor who arrived at the
border to investigate the killings.
</P>
<P>
   And despite warnings from NATO, Serbian forces on Monday once
again attacked the area surrounding Racak, the village where the
massacre took place last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's acts of defiance put the Clinton administration into a
difficult position of deciding whether the expulsion of Walker, who
heads a monitoring mission in Kosovo, would mean pulling out 700
unarmed monitors who have been trying to enforce a cease-fire in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the monitors, who are under the auspices of the
Organization for Co-Operation and Security in Europe, would mean
the formal collapse of the cease-fire and the almost certain
outbreak of new hostilities between the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador,
traveled to the massacre site and saw the dead and mutilated
victims. He called their deaths a ``crime against humanity.'' On
Monday, the Yugoslav authorities accused him of being an
``undesirable person'' and told him to leave Serbia within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The killings also brought Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of
the war crimes tribunal, to the region, but Serbian border guards
refused to let her cross into Serbia. Arbour, who has been denied
visas in the past, turned up at the border post between Macedonia
and Kosovo, seeking to collect evidence from the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Two top NATO military officials, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States and Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, were scheduled to meet on
Tuesday with Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the two men would be telling Milosevic that
he had to take seriously the warnings made on Sunday by NATO that
he must restrain his forces and reduce their numbers to levels
agreed to last October. The two generals will also try to persuade
Milosevic to back down from his order to expel Walker, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Monday evening
that Milosevic had no right to choose who would head the monitoring
msision. ``It is unacceptable for the Serbs to try to vilify the
monitors and expel those who are simply telling the truth at what
they saw,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's regime reacted quickly to what it saw as the
audacity of Walker to condemn the Serbs so openly. Walker's
criticisms carried extra force because he made them at the site of
the massacre in the village of Racak where mutilated bodies were
found with their eyes gouged out, faces slashed and, in one case,
decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   The official news agency of the Yugoslav government, Tanjug,
accused Walker of ``flagrantly'' violating his mandate. Other
government sponsored newspapers said that ethnic Albanians had
staged the massacre and accused Walker of being a stooge for them.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed crisis in Kosovo comes after several months of
inattention by the international community and after three weeks of
provocative military actions by the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last Friday, a day before the massacre became public, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright warned that the fragile Kosovo
agreement brokered last fall by the envoy Richard Holbrooke, was
about to fall apart, according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told the White House, the Pentagon and other agencies
that the administration faced a `decision point` in Kosovo, the
official said. She described the mission headed by Walker as good
at ``crisis management'' _ like winning the release of Serb
soldiers held as hostages by the guerrillas _ but insufficient for
addressing the long term. She acknowledged that negotiations on a
political settlement were not moving forward. She described the
Serbs as obstructionist and the Albanian politicians as fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had three choices Albright told her
colleagues, according to this account. She summarized them as:
stepping back, muddling through or taking decisive steps, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary did not advocate immediate reconsideration of air
strikes or the insertion of NATO troops to keep the two sides
apart, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But, it needed to be underscore to Milosevic that he faced a
real potential for NATO action, she told others in the
administration. If Milosevic did not get the message about NATO
action, he would not make any concessions, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels on Sunday stopped
short of reviving plans for NATO strikes against the Serbs in
Kosovo and Serbia itself. Air strikes were in their final stages of
activation last fall but were called off when Holbrooke completed
an agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there had been little talk in the
last few days of air strikes, but it was unclear what would happen
if Milosevic insisted on expelling Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If Walker leaves, it is likely that the administration will call
for the departure of the 700 unarmed monitors. ``A consensus is
emerging of one out, all out,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is likely to be another confrontation over Arbour, as
well, an administration official said. Arbour announced in Skopje,
the capital of Macedonia, that she would make another attempt to
get into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Arbour and forensic experts at the massacre site
is considered imperative for the collection of evidence against the
forces who committed the atrocities. But the likelihood of good
evidence dropped sharply on Monday after the mutilated bodies were
moved from the village to the morgue in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they took some heart from an
announcement by Russia that urged Milosevic to reverse his decision
on Walker. Russia has been Serbia's strongest supporter but is a
member of the OSCE, the 54-nation body Walker represents in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States failed to win Russian support in the U.N.
Security Council for the war crimes tribunal investigations in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know why she decided to go that way without
consulting the Security Council,'' the Russian representative to
the United Nations, Sergei B. Lavrov said on Monday.

IOC PRESIDENT SHOULD RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There could hardly be a more flagrant contradiction than that
between the spirit of amateur sportsmanship represented by the
Olympic Games and the bribing of International Olympic Committee
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt practices of committee members who vote on the
selection of sites for the Summer and Winter Games have long been
known to everyone involved. This widespread knowledge of the need
to bribe IOC site selectors became part of their scam. Each
would-be host city knew it had little choice but to outbid other
competing cities by lavishing more and better gifts on the visiting
dignitaries from the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Within such a corrupt structure, it is important to distinguish
the corrupters from their marks. The IOC bribe-takers did the
shaking down; the bid committees of the cities competing to become
host sites were the parties shaken down.
</P>
<P>
   This Olympic extortion system broke into the news when the Salt
Lake organizing committee disclosed how it bribed IOC officials to
secure its selection as the site for the 2002 Winter Games. It is
understandable that Quebec City, one of three other contending
sites for the 2002 Games, has sought compensation for the losers in
that rigged competition.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the Quebec 2002 organizing committee,
Rene Paquet, went further and called for the resignation of the
president of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch. ``When you are the
leader of an organization, you have to bear responsibility for what
happens,'' Pacquet said in a simple but compelling indictment of
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of resigning, Samaranch has indicated that the only
people forced to resign will be the two top officials of the Salt
Lake organizing committee and a few of the IOC members caught
accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to accept responsibility for systemic corruption
that has flourished for years under his stewardship, Samaranch
forfeits his right to commend the purity of the Olympic spirit. He
should be replaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does one get rid of the strong aromas in a microwave oven
from cooking bacon and similar foods? I have tried cooking
grapefruit and orange peels for a minute or two with partial
success. _H.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here are some remedies for eau de Oscar Mayer: 1. Try a
solution of baking soda and water (2 teaspoons to one cup warm
water), rinse and dry. 2. Boil a cup of water containing one-third
cup lemon juice in the microwave for a few minutes. Let cool. Wipe
dry. 3. Wipe the interior with a 50-50 solution of vinegar and
water using a coffee filter. (Abrasives are not good on microwave
walls.)
</P>
<P>
   Keep me posted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to costumes and props used for large productions
such as Olympic ceremonies and Orange Bowl festivities? _C.W.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Salt Lake City Olympic Committee is in the midst of
hiring a production director for these shows. Armed with the
committee-provided budget, the director provides (as in makes,
begs, steals, borrows, rents, whatever) costumes and props.
Retirement for these items can differ with each Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Many bowl games use the services of Bowl Games of America
(Orange, Sugar, Liberty and Gator). This production company has the
world's largest closet, with everything from pompoms to cannons.
Props belong to BGA, not the bowl committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Bowl began as the Palm Festival when Miami leaders
noticed the crowds enjoying the Rose Bowl in California. Hey _ warm
weather was available in Florida! All that was needed was a
football game on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I purchase a bag cover for a set of bagpipes? I
have an ugly tartan one and want to replace it with something a bit
more tame, like blue or black. _Susan Thickett
</P>
<P>
   A: You can have any kind of bagpipe cover you want by calling
Celtic Craft at (800) 535-5458 _ solid to tartan. Price? In the $70
range. Q: Does the Americans with Disabilities Act apply to people
who are unable to read the new Southwestern Bell telephone book
without a magnifying glass?
</P>
<P>
   _O.C.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your complaint about the type size of the new phone book is
not the first I have received, but it is the most entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The law applies to public accommodations, not products. Every
book in a bookstore, for example, does not have to be legible to
all customers, but the store has to provide access to its facility.
It is not required to modify all books. Southwestern Bell
spokeswoman Alicia Sankar says the new book saves paper and space.
Really want two or three books? Sankar admits SWB ``visits the
parameters of the book every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to be heard? Call (800) ICANTREADTHISTHING ... I mean, call
the SWB consumer relations at (800) 422-0499.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a book on the Old West, I read about a man named Ben
Thompson _ reputed to be a gunfighter and later a peace officer in
Austin. He acquired a lucrative concession to operate games of
chance upstairs in the Iron Front Saloon. The book also mentions a
banquet held at Simon's Cafe in Austin. Where were these businesses
located? _Mary Dees
</P>
<P>
   A: The Iron Front Saloon and Billiard Hall, 606 Congress Ave.,
was billed as the place to ``get the best of wine, liquors, ales
and beer, Havana and domestic cigars'' in an ad in the 1881-82 city
directory. Simon's Restaurant was at 609 Congress Ave. in the
1883-84 directory. Thanks to the staff at the Austin History Center
for the details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In studying our cats' front paws, we have discovered an extra
claw and pad that appear to serve no useful purpose. We have seen
TV programs about cats and their development, but none has
addressed this particular characteristic. Can you help us? _Paul G.
Griffith
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you mean the pisiform pad or another claw in addition to
the standard five? Cats have five digital pads on their front paws
_ one per claw. There's also a large pad (plantar pad) in the
center of the paw and a small wrist pad (pisiform pad). According
to the feline encyclopedia ``Cat World,'' by Desmond Morris, a
condition known as polydactylism s a common abnormality in which a
cat has extra toes. Teddy Roosevelt's cat Slippers, for example,
had six toes while some Hemingway cats boasted seven! The largest
concentration of many-toed cats? Boston, where 12 percent of cats
are so digited. Other cities' percentages varied directly with the
number of ex-Bostonians in their ranks. Too many baked beans?
</P>
<P>
   Q: In ``Jingle Bells,'' what is the name of the horse in the
one-horse open sleigh? As I understood it, it was the ``bells on
Bob's tail ringing,'' so the horse is named Bob. I recently
mentioned this to some friends, only to have one bring me a copy of
the lyrics reading ``the bells on bobtail ring.'' Can you confirm
the correct lyrics? _J. Tyree
</P>
<P>
   A: It's ``bells on bobtail ring.'' A bobtail is a shortened
tail, but is hauntingly close to ``Bob's tail.'' You are in good
company. There is a Web site for just this sort of thing _
www.kissthisguy.com _ named for the oft-misquoted Jimi Hendrix
lyrics in ``Purple Haze'': ``'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.'' The
informal name of a lyrical misstep is ``mondegreen'' _ from
mistaking ``laid him on the green'' for ``Lady Mondegreen.'' My
favorite is the CCR ``Bad Moon Rising'' lyric, ``There's a bad moon
on the rise.'' Sounds a lot like ``There's a bathroom on the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know the mailing or e-mail address for the
commissioner of the NFL? I have looked under NFL.com and do not see
any e-mail addresses listed.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim Alpern
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Paul Tagliabue in care of the National Football
League, 280 Park Ave., New York, NY 10017 or ask for the public
relations department at (212) 450-2000. Succeeding Pete Rozelle,
Tagliabue has been at the helm of the NFL since 1989. This New York
University School of Law attorney also served in the office of the
U.S. Secretary of Defense and presently is a member of the board of
directors of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the National Urban

UNLOCKING A LAND FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 20 years the Land and Water Conservation Fund has fallen
short of its potential to enhance the country's commitment to the
natural world. Now President Clinton has asked Congress to use the
fund for a $1 billion lands legacy initiative that can protect
millions of pristine acres from the violations of development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes $900
million from the fund, which draws its revenues from offshore oil
leases that have been accumulating since 1964. The money is split
between large federal acquisitions and local matching grants for
projects as small as a town pond or city playground. In past years
the fund has helped preserve beloved natural areas like the
Appalachian Trail and the Everglades as well as countless
fisheries, wetlands, and wildlife habitats in sensitive areas that
might otherwise fall to the implacable march of surveyors and
bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Each year some $900 million in oil leases is deposited in the
fund. But since 1978, Congress has refused to appropriate the full
amount, averaging only about $245 million a year. In 1998, the
Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, John Kasich, cut
the allocation to zero in an unsuccessful attempt to raid the fund
for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement elevates the fund from obscurity to a
presidential priority. It is a victory for the dozens of
environmental and open-space organizations that collaborated to
raise its profile.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is up to Congress to support the largest investment in
protecting America's natural treasures since the days of Theodore
Roosevelt, who knew the value of the land.

 &HT;    Atlantan taking bows in classroom and off-Broadway
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The author of off-Broadway's most lavishly praised
play these days is an Atlanta kindergarten teacher. And she
wouldn't have it any other way. Margaret Edson objects to the title
of playwright because, she says, all the royalties and show biz
offers in the world won't tempt her away from her beloved classroom
in downtown's Centennial Place School, where she's renowned for
setting her lessons to the tunes of George Gershwin and Cole
Porter.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the beginning of the improbable facts surrounding
Edson and her remarkable ``Wit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a play full of childhood and joy.
</P>
<P>
   In the drama at New York's Union Square Theatre, a woman's
battle with ovarian cancer climaxes with a breathtaking vision of
her soul breaking free from her doomed body. The patient _ a proud,
frosty, lonely literature professor _ steps silently from her
hospital bed, sheds her gown and reaches up into a shaft of
unearthly light.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Edson was asked, did she choose to show her 50ish heroine,
finally, nude?
</P>
<P>
   ``What else would you wear to a redemption? It's `Come as you
are!''' responds the playwright _ oops, sorry, teacher _ with a
chuckle. ``This is the first moment in the character's life when
she has truly, fully, revealed herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Edson, 37, who goes everywhere by Maggie, is a thin, 6-foot-tall
woman who today wears a blue cardigan and seems born for such
no-nonsense attire. She can appear as serious, even severe, as a
bird of prey. But now, discussing her unclothed heroine, her face
lights up with a mirth as out-of-nowhere as her play.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's even more (magical) that at that final moment her
hospital bracelet falls away,'' the laughing Edson adds. ``You
can't get those things off in real life, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Wit'' is one herself. This was evident during a
conversation in a Virginia-Highland coffee oasis not far from her
home. Edson's wit explains why a play that deals with terminal
illness has kept audiences laughing even as they struggle to hold
back tears.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine, professor Vivian Bearing (played by Kathleen
Chalfant), begins the evening by telling the audience
matter-of-factly, ``It is not my intention to give away the plot,
but I believe I die at the end.'' She proceeds to narrate the final
weeks of her life, using hard, polished plates of wit to fend off
the miseries and indignities of cancer treatments, isolation, fear.
Between the arrogance of the doctors (who see her as little more
than a test specimen for research) and the arrogance of Bearing
herself (who apparently has no love life or close family), there is
a silence at the heart of ``Wit'' that screams for a voice of
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play about kindness, the human touch,'' Edson says,
``and one way to show that is through its opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a friend of Edson's half-kiddingly described the play
as ``90 minutes of suffering and death mitigated ... by a pelvic
exam and a lecture on 17th-century poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was the lecture, not the nudity, that earned the play
rejection slips from dozens of theaters across the country. It's
but one chapter in a story that could be subtitled, ``How Things
Never Happen in the Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikeliest journey
</P>
<P>
   Edson, who has lived most of her life in Washington and has a
history degree from Smith College, never intended to write a play
before sitting down to pen ``Wit'' in 1991, when she was 30. She
was working as a bicycle store clerk at the time. Hers was one of
1,000 unsolicited scripts submitted to South Coast Repertory in
Costa Mesa, Calif., south of Los Angeles. Except for a half-hour of
cuts, few rewrites were requested. Edson was barely consulted by
South Coast and yet, she says, ``Every actor performed as if I'd
whispered in his or her ear _ it was completely thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   But no East Coast producer was interested, and it looked again
as if the play might disappear. Then, in 1995, Derek Anson Jones, a
high school classmate of Edson's who is an aspiring director, took
the script to New York free-lance director Doug Hughes. Together
they lobbied producers; again, no takers. Finally in 1997, when
Hughes was named artistic director of Long Wharf Theatre in New
Haven, Conn., he relaunched its second stage with ``Wit,'' directed
by Jones. The enthusiasm of New York critics paved the way for the
play's triumphant transfer last September to off-Broadway in a
co-production of Long Wharf and Manhattan Theatre Club. It reopened
last week in the larger Union Square Theatre. (Though its regional
production rights may not be released in time for the 1999-2000
season, ``Wit'' would work well in the repertoire of any number of
Atlanta theaters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a work that's deeply felt but utterly unsentimental _
and in that way it reflects Maggie's personality,'' Hughes says.
``Every step of the way, the conventional wisdom was that `the
people,' whoever that is, wouldn't sit still for this play, but
Maggie always proved them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery celebrity
</P>
<P>
   Edson was the closest thing to an overnight-sensation playwright
in years, but no one in Gotham theatrical circles had any idea who
she was. They had little chance to find out since she'd moved to
Atlanta to join partner Linda Merrill, who'd taken a new job as a
curator of American art at the High Museum of Art. And since that
arrival was only five months ago, the Atlanta theater community has
not been in touch with _ or perhaps even aware of _ Edson.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do all her fellow Centennial teachers know of her theatrical
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie is so quiet about the play, doesn't make a to-do about
it,'' says Leda Tatum, Centennial's assistant principal. ``I saw
the play over the holidays and thought it was wonderful. But all
you have to do is walk into Maggie's classroom and you know there's
a creative spirit. She puts so many of her lessons into songs!''
</P>
<P>
   In her own words
</P>
<P>
   Q: You obviously know something of the medical realities in the
play.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hospitals fascinate me for much the same reason as airports.
I wonder: Where all these people coming from and where are they
going? My mother was a medical social worker. In 1984 I took it
into my head to work in hospitals, first as a volunteer, then as a
unit clerk. I was struck by the bravery of the patients. One was a
science writer with three children, going through very aggressive
treatment for ovarian cancer. I used to bring her a newspaper every
day. Once we were in the elevator and I tried to tell her, in my
22-year-old way, that I admired her courage, and she said very
calmly, ``I don't have much choice, do I?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some great plays _ ``Angels in America'' springs to mind _
and movies deal with terminal illness but then so do a lot of
second-rate ones. Did this concern you?
</P>
<P>
   A: In my pile of rejection slips I see the phrase ``disease of
the month'' a lot. But remember, nobody expected this play. Nobody
was waiting for it. I was working in a bike shop. I wasn't trying
to set up a playwriting career. So I wrote exactly the play I
wanted to write, the way I saw it and even smelled it. I was free
as a bird.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I could tell that many in the Union Square had had
experiences like Bearing's with an insensitive doctor. It seems you
almost go out of your way to portray him as a fool.
</P>
<P>
   A: The most arrogant person in the play is not a doctor (it's
Bearing), so doctors shouldn't be so hurt. Everyone's arrogant:
That's the point. There were letters in The New York Times from
people who were disappointed that the doctors were not portrayed as
heroes, but the play is not about doctors or even about cancer.
It's about kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Having seen Chalfant in her role, it's hard to imagine anyone
else playing it.
</P>
<P>
   A: I know! And she and I have barely spoken! Our conversations
have been somewhat rushed and not even private; we're strangers to
each other, really. In a way I don't want to talk to her now!
(Laughs).
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've written another play, about country gospel music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's called ``Satisfied,'' it hasn't been produced, and
anybody who liked ``Wit'' would hate it! (Laughs). It's hokey, but
then I'm a hokey person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are you liking Atlanta so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: I love it! I like being outside. I'm taking a dance class at
the YWCA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You object to being called a playwright.
</P>
<P>
   A: I had to sit down and think about my future, and I decided
that I love being a teacher. ... I wrote a song to the tune of
``Anything Goes,'' called ``My Body is Me,'' and the kids picked it
right up. How can you beat that? ... If in 10 years I'm moved to
write another play, fine, and I may be a better writer for the life
experience. But at the end of the day, if your feet are tired _
you're a teacher!
</P>
<P>
   Q: You express that like a writer.
</P>
<P>
   A: You should hear me teach.

 &HT;    Panic attacks: `I was convinced I was going to die'
 &HT;    WITH BOX INFO at end of file
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She was only 19, yet she was sure she
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   She woke up perspiring, trying desperately to catch her breath.
She ran to the bathroom with diarrhea and surges of nausea. For
three hours, she suffered, certain she would never see morning.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of her grandmother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced I was going to die,'' recalled Lisa
Cvijanovic, now 34. ``I thought I was having a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't. Cvijanovic later learned she had the classic
symptoms of a panic attack: an unprovoked feeling of extreme fear
that produces intense physical sensations ranging from dizziness
and trembling to chest pain and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it starts when the human survival instinct _ that
fight-or-flight response _ goes haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is an easily treatable mental illness often triggered by
stress, such as the kind Cvijanovic experienced when her
grandmother died. But because the symptoms mimic physical problems
such as heart attacks, sufferers often have difficulty getting a
correct diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're stuck on a train track and can't escape,''
Cvijanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Even successful people like actresses Calista Flockhart (Ally
McBeal) and Kim Basinger are among those who suffer panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients with panic disorder are really frightened of the
internal feelings of anxiety _ the sweating, palpitations, the
bodily changes that can be normal in the course of everyday
activities,'' explains Dr. Cynthia Last, a Boca Raton psychologist
and director of the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to desensitize themselves because there are many
things that feel like panic, such as when you exercise hard, or get
angry, or even have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic disorder is one of several anxiety disorders, which
include post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. One in 10 Americans will suffer some form of anxiety, the
Anxiety Disorders Association of America estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Theories hold that people who develop anxiety and panic attacks
are predisposed to it biologically or environmentally: You might
inherit a gene for it _ although none has been identified _ or you
may be conditioned for it by seeing family members react to stress
with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic can't recall anyone in her family who had panic
attacks, but she vividly remembers her father dying at home of a
brain tumor when she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gasping for air; he was in a coma. I was experiencing
it all, all over again (with her panic attack).''
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic's symptoms disappeared after that initial attack, but
she feared they would return. They did, when she was 21. She can't
explain why. There was nothing particularly stressful going on in
her life. But suddenly she was having several attacks a day and
wound up in the hospital emergency room several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted someone to say that I wasn't dying. I needed
that reassurance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated, unprovoked attacks are also central to panic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors kept telling me it was panic, but I wouldn't
believe that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks became disabling, making it hard or impossible for
her to work, go shopping or otherwise live a normal life. She was
afraid of suffering attacks while she was out and of appearing
crazy to people around her. Left untreated, panic disorder can lead
to agoraphobia, the fear of being outside the patient's ``safe''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors eventually started her on a medication, Klonopin. ``As
long as I had the bottle in my hand, even, I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic sufferers often latch on to items that make them feel
safe, but that don't actually help curb the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Irrational thinking produces panic. Therapy is designed to ease
the catastrophic thoughts that produce fear and the related
physical feelings of anxiety. Patients can be treated with therapy,
medication such as antidepressants or tranquilizers, or a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Most therapists discourage drug treatment alone because the
patient never learns to control the thinking that causes attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research shows that cognitive-behavioral therapy is
equally as effective as drugs,'' says Dr. Andrew Rosen, a Delray
Beach psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the therapy has longer-lasting results because it becomes
part of the person. There is greater confidence the person can
control it. As soon as the patient is off medication, if they
haven't learned how to change their behavior, they're back to where
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic has experienced a roller coaster ride with panic, and
is back in therapy after years of going panic-free. The attacks
returned when she got divorced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She now has a flexible job that lets her work at home, but she
hopes to return to an office full-time someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discourage people,'' she said. ``I want them
to know that there's coping skills available. It's definitely not
easy, but I will not let panic attacks get me. I won't let it
conquer me.''

 &HT;    Women's chip off old block: Heart of Madonna lives on
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Art, politics and being a mother get mixed up in my
life and the lives of a lot of women at the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In medieval times, icons of Madonna and child sent messages
about the value of motherhood. In 1999, a Mormon artist, Maryann
Webster, in her ceramic ``Motherboard Icon Series,'' links those
religious icons of mother and child with subtle computer chip
designs, some imprinted on the Madonna's garment as she cradles an
infant.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Shelly, an artist and the mother of a new baby,
introduced me to Webster's art. Its powerful and discomforting
symbols _ sacred figures and computer circuitry _ forced me to make
new connections with ``old'' dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally for women and children at the state Capitol last
week, I was reminded again of the timeless questions raised by
Webster's powerful work. From the voices of female leaders to
chilling United Way data on state child care needs, I ran head-on
into the undervalued dimensions of motherhood in our
computer-driven world.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the rally _ coordinated in capitols around the
country by the nonpartisan Center for Policy Alternatives _ was
economic parity and policies to help balance work and family. About
20 Georgia female lawmakers joined urban and rural community
leaders to push for creation of a women's business resource center,
for contraceptive coverage in health care plans, quality child care
and expanded day care subsidies for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Women never leave those values behind no matter how long they're
in politics. Mothers or not, women are nurturers.
</P>
<P>
   I'd always hoped it would be easier for my two daughters to
juggle motherhood and careers than it was for me, but in some ways
it's harder. Sure, technology helps. Young mothers can telecommute
and start businesses out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But recent reports on childhood development run counter to
career and mothering demands. Research tells mothers to nurse
infants longer _ a year, if possible. It warns that the quality of
child care prior to age 3 determines the extent of intellectual and
social potential. True appreciation of ``mothering'' as essential
to the development of human creativity and potential is still
shallow. Mostly ``family values'' talk. Mostly political lip
service. Welfare mothers with infants and dubious child care
arrangements are mandated to take minimum-wage jobs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, due to female political power, there are signs of change.
The family and medical leave bill may well be the most
revolutionary piece of legislation of the late 20th century _
Congress' and corporate America's recognition that family and
workplace are linked.
</P>
<P>
   No icons pop up on my computer with Web site answers to the
motherhood conundrum. But everywhere I look, nurturing remains
undervalued. According to United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, child
care teachers make less money _ $12,340 on average _ than garbage
collectors or bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   The work-family conflict can't be solved by sheer economics or
computer technology any more than machines can take over for
humans. That is the issue Webster's contemporary art caused me _ as
art should _ to wrestle with anew. Central to the artist's
acclaimed exhibit in Dolores Chase's Salt Lake City Gallery is
Robert Brautigan's 1960s poem ``All Watched Over by Machines of
Loving Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Webster, in melding medieval mother-child images
with computer chips, drew parallels that span a thousand years. And
she hit on an eternal truth: Technology can't sub for motherhood,
now or ever.

 &HT;    OSU's Jacobs placed on leave after assault charges filed
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Hours after turning himself into authorities
early Monday morning after being charged Saturday with assaulting
his ex-wife, Ohio State University offensive coordinator Mike
Jacobs was placed on paid administrative leave by the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Head football coach) John (Cooper) and I have discussed
Mike's situation at length and we both feel that it is in the best
interests of The Ohio State University, the university's football
program and Mike Jacobs that he be relieved of his day-to-day
responsibilities to give him the time to work through his legal and
personal situation,'' OSU athletics director Andy Geiger said in a
statement released by the school's athletics department on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a member of the Buckeyes' coaching staff since 1995, was
being held without bond Monday in Franklin County Jail on
misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and assault. He is
scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. today in Franklin County
Municipal Court. Courts were closed Monday because of the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Jacobs accuses the 5-foot-10, 190-pound
coach of pulling Robbin Jacobs' hair, ``striking her across the
face and both eyes, causing swollen blackened eyes.'' The incident
happened at about 12:15 a.m. Saturday in Columbus, according to the
complaint. Jacobs, 49, has four sons.
</P>
<P>
   Through a statement released by his attorney, David C. Winters,
on Monday, Jacobs said, ``I did not do anything improper let alone
illegal.''

<P>
   He also said, ``I am convinced when the matter is resolved, the
public will conclude I have done nothing to discredit myself, my
family or the University.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was out of town on a recruiting trip and could not be
reached for comment. Geiger could not be reached for further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' problems come in the midst of a busy recruiting period,
when coaches are permitted to travel to players' homes and try to
persuade them to sign with the Buckeyes. It was unclear Monday how
Jacobs' absence will affect OSU's recruiting efforts and who will
fill in for him. The current contact period runs through Jan. 30.
National signing day is Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a Wittenberg University graduate ('72), joined Ohio
State's coaching staff in 1995 as offensive tackles and tight ends
coach. He was promoted to offensive coordinator at the end of the
1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs previously coached at West Virginia University _ serving
as the Mountaineers' offensive coordinator from 1986-95 _ Bowling
Green, Toledo and Ashland College.
</P>
<P>
   As a player at Wittenberg, Jacobs, a former offensive guard,
helped the Tigers to the Division II National Championship his
senior year.

 &HT;    Commentary: Parents `no' their stuff
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We all have different roles in life. Some we play
better than others. And in some roles, such as parenthood, the
script keeps changing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many parents, I learned my lines on stage as I went _
improvisation at its best, or worst. Some of the acts that should
have been high comedy, I turned into high drama, and nobody
cheered. A lot of the scenes were pure farce, some were melodrama
and there even were a few tear-jerkers.
</P>
<P>
   And the script just keeps changing. Take parenting teen-agers,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world are we supposed to know when to say yes and
when to say no? Children this age should be developing their
independence, and yet, they're at the incredibly precarious stage
when sense and reason have little meaning for many of them. ``So,
like what's the problem with going 60 in a 30 mph zone while
changing the CD and checking my hair?''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers know their role really well: They push the limits.
They ask and beg and plead in hopes they'll wear you down and tire
you out so that you'll say yes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your child, when told no, simply responds quietly ``Yes,
ma'am,'' but that doesn't happen often at our house.
</P>
<P>
   As parents, many of us don't seem to know our roles as well as
the teens know theirs. We've read just one too many contradictory
advice column or book so that we don't trust our own instincts. We
begin to waver.
</P>
<P>
   I mustn't be overprotective, we argue with ourselves. Well,
Johnny's mom must think it's all right or she wouldn't let him go.
So, I guess it's OK if my son goes, too.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no, no. Faulty reasoning all down the line. First thing
you do with teens is develop a Mommy Network. If you haven't done
it by sixth grade, be darn sure you have by ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think children blatantly lie about the details of their
comings and goings, but some do tend to have very selective
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Mommy Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I'm hearing from this end. What are you
hearing?'' You'll be amazed at the particulars that begin to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Details. Teens know them, they just don't always share them.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip for parenting teen-agers: ``When in doubt, say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Follow your gut instinct, regardless of what you're told every
other parent in the world is doing. If you don't like the idea of a
newly licensed 16-year-old driver taking your child to a dance on a
rainy Friday night, say no. If you want your child at home studying
all weekend before finals, insist on it.
</P>
<P>
   Parenting isn't about popularity or being your child's bud.
You're probably not going to be popular with your kids during their
teen years anyway, so just accept it and move on. They have plenty
of friends; they need parents.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we need to remember when all around us are being
permissive: Our kids are counting on us to know what to do. They'll
never admit it, they'll rail against us tirelessly, but when we
stand firm, they secretly heave a huge sigh of relief and then go
off and tell their friends how awful we are. Then we know we've
done our job well.
</P>
<P>
   I've even had a son come to me on rare occasion, after an hour
or two of pitching a fit, and say, ``Thanks for making me stay
home, Mom. I heard that party was supposed to be pretty wild. I'm
glad I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen often. It may never happen at your house, or
at mine again. Nevertheless that's our role: We say no. We trust
our instincts. We check with other parents. The kids push; we stand
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody around here has to be in charge. It had better be us.

 &HT;    Kelso: Writer will read your knees
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You never know when a bad astrology reading is
going to ruin your life.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, some psychic might tell you your financial future looks
bright. And you invest your money in widgets and you end up holding
a ``Will work for food'' sign next to the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   So there should be a market for psychic insurance to protect
people against incompetent clairvoyants, right?
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, my friend Edd O'Donnell and I went to a
Psychic Fair, posing as representatives from a fictitious psychic
health insurance plan _ Weknow HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover all of your past and future lives,'' Edd explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Psychic Fair consisted of a roomful of tarot card readers,
at least one face reader, Mother Earth Pillows for sale, a place
where you could get your aura photographed and a woman who for $35
would tell you about your past lives.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I thought the Psychic Fair flier said ``past wives,''
so I almost didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   What I couldn't figure out is why they had me fill out my name
and address for the door-prize drawing. I thought this was a
psychic fair. They should already know my name and address, right?
</P>
<P>
   To look like a psychic health insurance salesman, I wore a
headband decorated with a large piece of costume jewelry, my
tie-dye 1992 Lithuanian Olympic basketball team T-shirt, and my
purple jacket from Roy's Taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Edd, an Austin writer, was decked out in a sheik's headdress,
wraparound sunglasses, a pink-and-blue tie-dye shirt, matching pink
pocket hanky, black sport coat and tasseled loafers.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were going to set up a card table. But we decided
against that because when I looked into my crystal ball, all I
could see was the police coming. So instead, we circulated through
the crowd with our Weknow HMO Pre-screening Questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving the Psychic Community . . . but you knew that,'' it
says at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The form asks people to check off ``yes'' or ``no'' to a variety
of questions, such as: ``Natural crystals hum or change color when
I pick them up''; ``I receive messages from extraterrestrials
through my fillings''; and ``I have attended a seance and asked a
rich deceased relative for a loan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My deceased relatives won't give me loans; that's the
problem,'' said Kramer Wetzel, of South Austin, when I showed him
one of our forms.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who bills himself as the ``Fishing Guide to the Stars''
and wears a bass lure in his left ear as an earring, reads natal
astrology charts for $25 a pop. He was working the fair. Maybe if
one of his dead uncles would give him some money, he could have
taken the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman we approached with our forms had on a denim
shirt decorated with a Bugs Bunny insignia.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself and explained that my associate and I were
offering psychic insurance to fairgoers, to guard them against bad
readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't think I'm interested, thank you,'' the woman said,
walking off quickly. Maybe it was the cheap costume jewelry on my
headband that put her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like making telephone solicitations,'' Edd observed of
our heady task. But we trudged on anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Our next subject was a middle-aged woman who was going from one
reading table to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this now?'' she asked, looking at the form
suspiciously. ``If you fill this out, I will give you a free
reading of your elbows and knees,'' Edd told the woman, who had on
shorts. ``What in the world _ you want me to fill this out?'' she
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the free knee and elbow reading was an offer this
woman couldn't pass up. She dutifully filled out the form. Not
surprisingly, she checked off ``no'' to all of the questions,
including ``My primary care physician insists on being addressed as
`Swami,' '' ``Elvis or Liberace have visited me at home in the past
year,'' and ``Animals speak to me in a special language known only
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the woman filled out the form, Edd read the woman's elbows
and knees and gave her a free consultation.
</P>
<P>
   He told her that her life had been chaotic and that she needed
to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel a compulsion to do something else with your
life, sit down for 15 minutes and do nothing,'' Edd advised.
</P>
<P>
   I almost got my past lives read by the lady doing the past-lives
readings. But I changed my mind because I was afraid she'd tell me
I used to be a wise guy in 1427.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A fat lip in the clash of ideas
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ News that tells us something about the
profoundly goofy world we live in _ as opposed to who's-on-first
Washington political coverage _ usually is left for the briefs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in my career, I used to edit long strings of these
three-, four- or five-paragraph news stories. The strings would be
snipped like ribbon and pasted into pages as needed. Newspapers
have come a long way since then. Now, we keep briefs in computer
memory where they can be electronically snipped like ribbon. This
is huge progress.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable briefs are of the cat-in-the-microwave, dumb
criminals, freak-accident and new-fad-in-Japan variety. But another
kind recently warmed my heart. The headline was ``High school
journalist punched over editorial against violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the first two paragraphs:
</P>
<P>
   ``SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) _ Sam Claiborn wrote an editorial in
his high school newspaper decrying a culture of violence and
football heroes of today who become the `spouse abusers, drunks and
hamburger flippers of tomorrow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For his high-minded efforts, Claiborn says he got beaten up
last week _ by a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the dangers of commentary stripped to their high-school
essence. A bold moral and sociological insight is advanced and an
aggrieved special interest responds forcefully and with, uh,
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the give-and-take of public dialogue outside of high
school is framed in the language of wrasslin'. But despite the talk
about going to the mat, taking off the gloves and no-holds-barred
conflict until the last man left standing is finished fighting the
good fight, punches rarely get thrown. Even on cable. So reading
about the real thing seems refreshingly literal.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saguaro High School Principal Mike Carden said Claiborn should
have been more careful in his wording in the paper, the Saguaro
Sabercat.
</P>
<P>
   `` `People have a right to a viewpoint that's controversial, but
they also have to put it out there in an appropriate fashion,'
Carden said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `There were some inappropriate comments that were said that
people took objection to.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a familiar call for civility wrapped in administrative
passive voice.
</P>
<P>
   Young Claiborn had the ``controversial viewpoint'' that sports
and violence might be related. A notion that in the time of O.J.
Simpson and Mike Tyson does not seem wildly out of line. The inner
pages of most sports sections have become a mix of stats and police
blotter.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Claiborn got it all wrong when he wrote of the ``spouse
abusers, drunks and hamburger flippers of tomorrow.'' A few of
those high school athletes won't go on to low-paying jobs, they'll
go to professional sports where they will abuse women other than
their spouses and substances other than alcohol. Some may go on to
Congress. Clearly, he understated the extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As an editorial writer, I support civility. It keeps my nose
shapely and my face youthful.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of civility that keeps zoning disputes from
turning into Bosnia. People used to call it ``tolerance.'' I like
that word better than ``civility'' because it implies you don't
have to like anybody. Just tolerate them. Even I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   The principal, however, talked about civility of a different
kind. The kind in which someone with ``a viewpoint that's
controversial,'' who puts it out there inappropriately, is cruising
for a bruising. That kind of civility upholds a kind of bully's
veto.
</P>
<P>
   If such civility were restricted to high schools, we could laugh
it off _ loud and in an inappropriate fashion. But it's not.
Civility that asserts the right not to be upset and the duty not to
be upsetting is in great demand. You see it in campus speech codes
and asserted by lawyers in court and politicians on television.
Sometimes, ``civility'' is just a civil way to tell other people to
shut up.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uncivil truism that the cure for dumb and offensive
speech is to unleash more speech to growl at it in the open. And
anyone who thinks otherwise is asking for a fat lip.
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically speaking, of course.

 &HT;    NCR, Lexis-Nexis join forces in $1 data warehouse
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp. and Lexis-Nexis have co-existed in the
Miami Valley for decades, but have not done much business together
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But that situation has changed. On Monday, Dayton-based NCR
announced it has installed a $1.1 million data warehouse system
inside Miami Twp.-based Lexis-Nexis, a premium legal and business
information provider, to help that company's 400 salespeople
nationwide keep better track of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Data warehouses are computer database systems that let companies
tap large stores of information and get quick answers to complex
questions about their business.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Lexis-Nexis salespeople had to rely largely on
monthly summaries and the like to get that information. With the
NCR system, they can access a wide range of specific information
about customers in seconds, said Jack Knapp, assistant vice
president of industry marketing for NCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have thousands of sources of information in their
database. But they had no way to, on a real-time basis and in a
detailed fashion, see how these sources of information were being
used and by whom,'' Knapp said. ``They had no way to really
understand their customers' usage patterns and behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   With the data warehouse, a Lexis-Nexis salesperson can now
determine, for example, which contracts are set to expire in 60
days and see where there has been a rapid decline in usage, Knapp
said. ``That could be an indication that the customer is using
another source of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The system was installed in November and will undergo phased
testing throughout this year, said Keith Hawk, vice president of
sales for the Nexis division.
</P>
<P>
   If the data warehouse works as expected, the two companies might
do more business, Knapp and Hawk said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Harrah's Entertainment Inc. selected an NCR data
warehouse to run its international customer recognition and rewards
system for the more than 14.5 million guests who eat, sleep, watch
live shows and wager at the company's 18 casinos in eight states.
Financial terms were not disclosed.

 &HT;    It's a cold, crazy world
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This column is especially for my readers in
the sunny South. I know where you are, and I know what you're
doing. I would bet you a buffalo nickel that at this very moment
you are kicked back in a poolside lounger counting blue-tailed
skinks on the hibiscus-ringed, screened
</P>
<P>
   enclosure. From time to time, your reverie may be disturbed by a
distant, guttural rumble as the pool's filtration system kicks in
and sends pristine
</P>
<P>
   wavelets of tepid water lapping into the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside your glass of freshly squeezed (probably
homegrown) juice, you
</P>
<P>
   give the morning paper a shake, take one look at the
three-column picture above
</P>
<P>
   the fold, and mutter to your mate: ``Looka' here Fred, those
crazy Yankees are
</P>
<P>
   up to their butts in snow again.'' Old Fred just grins and rubs
a little more sunblock on his bald spot as he squints at the pond
out back for signs of the big 'gator that's been prowling the dock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, not far from Lake Erie's frigid shores, there's a
silence of another sort, broken only occasionally by the rumble of
the village plow as it scrapes deserted streets in a futile attempt
to budge the foot-and-a-half of snow that covers the layer of ice
that covers a layer of snow that just happens to be on top of three
inches of ice that covers the first half-a-foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   A warming fire crackles on the hearth and over in the corner
under the window
</P>
<P>
   seats, comes an occasional snore from the cats as they snuggle
in their quilt-lined baskets next to the radiators. At regular
intervals I can hear the grumble of the mysterious innards of the
basement boiler as it throbs its little guts out to keep this cozy
nest (and the seven miles of heating pipes running through its
walls) from freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Since alligators are seldom spotted crawling over snow banks, I
make do with
</P>
<P>
   studying the distorted shapes of the ice that gorges the
neighbor's gutters. Come the thaw, I know all of that stuff is
going to melt and be looking for a
</P>
<P>
   place to go - like maybe up under the eaves and inside. I don't
EVEN want to
</P>
<P>
   know what my gutters look like.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie, the undertaker across the street, has finished plowing
his parking lot and is working on my front walk. I motion a thank
you through the window and watch as he revs up the machine before
making a full speed head-on run at a
</P>
<P>
   particularly precipitous drift. Unique approach, I'm thinking as
he slams into the snowy equivalent of a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot to do when the snow's this deep. Sharon,
my ex-sister-in-law (we used to be married to brothers but now
we're not), has been on an ``earth mother'' spree ever since the
driveways drifted over. Every night she cooks supper and afterward
we lie on the couch hollering answers at Jeopardy and trying to
calculate how much money we would have made if only Alex
</P>
<P>
   had invited us on the show.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday I made it down the street to Dr. Sam's for my
semi-annual tooth
</P>
<P>
   scraping and buffing. As I lay back in the chair watching the
snow swirl outside the window and pile up on the big pines in Doc's
front yard, I began to suspect I was in imminent danger of coming
down with a severe dose of cabin fever. Moments later my suspicions
were confirmed when I found myself actually enjoying some guy on
the office radio wailing, ``Ya picked a fine time to leave me,
Lucille ... four hon-gry children and crops in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd part of it is, I'm thinking as I contemplate my isolation, I
grew up down there in 'gator country where the only lock-in we
endured was a hurricane which
</P>
<P>
   always went away in a day or two allowing my buddies and me to
go out and play
</P>
<P>
   in the flood and catch odd-looking snakes that washed in from
the Glades. And
</P>
<P>
   now here I am up to my Florida cracker backside in snow while
Fred, who's
</P>
<P>
   probably from Cleveland, languishes poolside. I tell you folks,
it's a world
</P>
<P>
   gone mad.

 &HT;    They love the deputy
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Shoot for the moon and you'll get some cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   These are words my son will remember for a long time. They're a
personal inscription from his favorite deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Words to live by? Actually, they're among many words to laugh by
for a group of fifth graders I know, laughing being a necessary
part of living in these overexerted times. The fifth-grader I know
best is quite a wit already, and I gather so are some of his
classmates. Put them in a room with Officer Will Stevens and watch
out.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of four McLennan County DARE officers _ Drug Abuse
Resistance and Education. Though he's a certified lawman he's also
a certifiable comic, or so says my son, who knows him from Stevens'
visits to his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   This is an officer who will pull out a nightstick and, rather
than whop you on the head, crane it to his mouth and croon bad '80s
pop into it. He's got a zillion one-liners, and he loves to draw
the kids into the kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Some mugwump might ask: What are the children learning from all
of this?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty. Such would be the assessment from their recent DARE
graduation and essays they read. DARE is a semester-long course,
not just about drug abuse but also about decisions in general.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 60 percent of America's fifth-graders get DARE. It
has its share of critics, who say the program doesn't yield results
in reduced drug abuse sufficient to what it costs. A few counties
have discontinued it on those grounds. Some critics also charge
that in some cases DARE officers have tried to enlist their
students as snitches on others, including their own parents.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that DARE, like any device for education, could
be ineffective or misused depending on who carries it out.
</P>
<P>
   But my experience thus far, with two sons going through DARE
classes, is that it's been a worthwhile investment.
</P>
<P>
   Principally, I feel that way because the DARE my sons have known
it is not just an anti-drug harangue. It's a lot about living and
growing up. And if Deputy Stevens is any indication, it hasn't been
an overbearing, sermonizing thing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it can't be if officers intend to make meaningful
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Connections alone are a benefit of DARE. It matters to have
symbols of authority, law officers, shed adversarial airs with
young people and show them they're just regular people who care.
Indeed, that's the best way to get a drug-abuse message across.
</P>
<P>
   I well remember the anti-drug films that were cued up for me and
my contemporaries in darkened high school auditoriums of the late
'60s. They were so preachy, melodramatic and overdone as to be
laughable. And, oh, yes. We laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, that's all we got out of those films _ a hoot.
Someone was frantic to scare us about drug abuse. We sensed that.
That didn't work. It never works.
</P>
<P>
   The difference about the laughter in Deputy Stevens' classes is
that it would appear the class is laughing with him, not just at
him, as he sets the stage for more serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a message to sink in with young people takes more than a
sermon or a warning. It takes real connections and shared respect.
Yes _ respect the fact that children are more worldly and skeptical
than we want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the best ways to get respect is to refrain from
preaching. And the best way to refrain from that is to get people
to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Those anti-drug movies are as vivid in my mind today and stand
as a case study in how not to influence young people to abuse
drugs. I'm gathering from my son's comments that Deputy Stevens
will re remembered, too, but not with disdain.

PARADISE FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Western mind usually considers planet Earth explored, set
down neatly in books and maps, while the frontier is outer space.
But explorers back from a National Geographic expedition to the
heart of the Tsangpo Gorge in southern Tibet sound as awe-struck as
Neil Armstrong did on the surface of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different dimension of space and time,'' said Hamid
Sardar in a telephone interview. The Cambridge resident has a PhD
in Tibetan and Himalayan studies from Harvard University. Last
November he followed guides down cliff paths to reach a roaring,
100-foot waterfall previously considered a myth. With him were Ian
Baker, an American writer and Tibetan scholar who led the
expedition, Ken Storm, a Minneapolis businessman, and Bryan Harvey,
a videographer.
</P>
<P>
   Explorers had speculated that a dramatic waterfall could exist
where the Tsangpo and Bramaputra rivers meet, but no one could
prove it until two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trek was mostly vertical. The walls of the gorge are formed
by two mountains, each with an elevation of more than 23,000 feet.
The falls, usually in shadow, thunder at the bottom of a 4,000-foot
cliff hidden by an overhang and a 90-degree turn in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lesson in going around the next bend,'' said Storm,
who described the surreal beauty as humbling. The barren cliffs at
the top of the gorge give way to subtropical gardens below,
bursting with huge rhododendrons, lilies, and orchids. ``We came as
pilgrims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Considered paradise by the Buddhists who live there, the gorge
can be hell to a Westerner. Sardar recalled hiking with his legs
full of leeches that could not be killed because of local belief
that they suck sin out of the traveler. He said the many poisonous
snakes in the area are also welcomed, for they teach
``mindfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is eager to go back, as he has for six visits. He and his
colleagues had the fortitude and spiritual vision that reminds the
rest of us to look for the unknown in what is believed to be known.

 &HT;    Autos built on shared platform are not identical
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The term ``platform'' is one frequently thrown around
in automotive circles these days. But if you ask most consumers
what it means when an advertisement or article states certain
vehicles are built on the same platform, most people are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The most common perception of the term platform is it means the
vehicles share the same floor plan or metal stamping that
constitutes the ``floor'' of the car. That may be the case on a
shared-platform vehicle, but not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The other most commonly held misconception is if vehicles are
built on the same platform, then they are essentially the same
vehicles with slightly different exteriors. That is most certainly
not the case.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the automaker that has most successfully adapted the
concept of shared platforms is Toyota. It is common knowledge in
automotive circles that Toyota's Camry sedan, Camry Solara coupe
and Sienna minivan, as well as the Lexus ES 300 sedan and RX300
sport-utility vehicle, are all built on the same platform.
</P>
<P>
   They are most assuredly not the same vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   So just what is a platform? What advantages does the concept of
shared platforms offer automakers as well as consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Lexus' national manager for product planning, Bruce Quisenberry,
explains it as the basis or foundation upon which the vehicle is
built. Consider you can pour identical house footings and,
depending upon how you complete the structure, you might end up
with a New England salt box, a California modern, a two-story
traditional or your basic box ranch. The concrete really doesn't
care what sits on it.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of a vehicle platform. Shared vehicle platforms
typically share the same engine configuration, transmission and
sub-frame mounts as well as braking systems and engine and
suspension cradle assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember the platform is only the starting
point. By sharing these hidden components, the manufacturer not
only reduces manufacturing costs, but actually enhances the
building process.
</P>
<P>
   The shared components also allow for a sharing of development
costs on the nonvisible components providing more extensive
research and development. Result: The consumer gets more for his or
her money.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry said about 25 percent of Toyota/Lexus shared
platform vehicles have a common effort. After that, each is
different.
</P>
<P>
   Shared platforms are sort of like identical gift boxes. They all
serve basically the same function, but what they hold can be as
different and varied as the imagination of those who fill them. A
full-length mink or a woolen blanket would fit in the same box, but
no one would mistake them for the same product.

 &HT;    `Junkland' worthy of a quick junking
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Junkland Jam,'' a PC musical adventure game by
Southpeak, hit a sour note for Makia McFarland of southwest
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure is designed to take kids to an imaginary world
filled with games, puzzles and experiments and let them interact
with kooky characters while learning about music in a fun,
entertaining way.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't do anything for our 8-year-old reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get into it,'' Makia said. ``It was boring.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, ``Junkland Jam'' is filled with potential. The CD-ROM
game promises to transport players to the animated world of
Junkland, where trash has been turned to treasure and transformed
into something new, useful and fun. There are 3-D backgrounds to
help immerse players into a fun-filled story line, hidden surprises
and colorful characters. There is also an on-screen notebook of fun
scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, theory differed from reality, and ``Junkland
Jam'' didn't strike a chord with Makia, who tried the game several
times but said she is unlikely to play it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures are good. The color is good. The sound hurt my
ears,'' Makia said.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the game that held Makia's attention was using
a magnet to remove a pile of trash that had fallen on the main
character, Simon Fehfer, whom players help as he travels through
Junkland looking for his missing harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part was fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the other thing about ``Junkland Jam'' Makia liked
was the harmonica that came bundled with the software. The
harmonica was also a hit with Makia's sister, Maya, age 5. The
low-tech musical instrument was included so players could sing and
play along with the game's original songs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sharon McFarland, the girls' mother, said neither girl
has mastered the harmonica, which is capable of many dissonant
sounds. She implied the real harmonica, like the virtual
instrument, may soon also be lost.
</P>
<P>
   `JUNKLAND JAM'

   Price: $29.95

 &HT;    Wired celebrities peek into the future
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Read what some leading technologists have to say about
the future in the January issue of Wired magazine. You'll find
comments from a wide range of people, including film director
Francis Ford Coppola, science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke and
Yahoo! co-founder David Filo. Songwriter David Crosby says, in
part, ``I want a computer I can talk to. One that would follow me
around with a part of itself and wouldn't forget anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of Wired, there's also a tribute of sorts to
the cell phone. It's actually a series of articles that look at the
device's social implications. Called ``The Big Schmooze,'' this
package includes articles on ``the gestalt'' of cell phones and on
the phones themselves. And there's an article about the best place
in the world to have a cell phone: Finland. In that Scandinavian
country, you can use your cell phone to activate a nearby Coca-Cola
machine. Now that, concludes the article, is cell phone nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   There's a dogfight under way among makers of combat flight
simulators, and the only sure winner so far has been consumers. The
latest entry to this battlefield is ``Falcon 4.0,'' published by
Microprose. This is the latest version of a popular combat
simulator that has been on the market for some time. This version
features F-16s battling over the Korean peninsula. Available only
for Windows PCs, ``Falcon'' retails for $55.
</P>
<P>
   At work, you may be a peon, but with the computer CD
``Capitalism,'' you can build a magnificent business empire from
scratch. The game, published by Interactive Magic, is a simulation
in which players build a business from the ground up. You'll do
everything from manufacturing to buying real estate and hiring
employees. According to reviewers, ``Capitalism'' is tough _ but
fun and educational, too. Available for both PCs and Macs, it
retails for about $40.

 &HT;    First rule of computer shopping: Try not to pay retail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I've got a friend who feels comfortable buying and
selling houses that sell for an amount roughly equivalent to the
gross national product of Peru, who drives such a hard bargain when
buying a car that the salesman is often tempted to quit and join
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   She's scared to death of buying a computer.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't going to be a technical column. This is the last
mention you'll hear from me today about megahertz or gigabytes.
There won't be a single additional mention of bus speeds, I/O cards
or terminal network adapters.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, and I'm discovering that my friend isn't
alone. There are highly intelligent, streetwise folks who seem
paralyzed by the notion of buying a computer. Some of the fears are
justified _ you really do need to know what to look for when
shopping, and that's what we talked about last week. But that's
pretty simple to figure out. Even if you didn't read my column,
there are magazines and other articles that do a good job of
covering those bases. But that feeling of ignorance (as opposed to
stupidity) seems to freeze a lot of brains when it's time to decide
where to buy the computer and how much to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say ``decide'' how much to pay? Wait a minute, these
suckers all have price tags.
</P>
<P>
   So do the cars in the lot; so did that last house have a
specific price. But you didn't feel tempted to just write a check,
did you?
</P>
<P>
   Now wait a minute all you computer retailers, don't start
cranking out a letter complaining that you don't bargain. Some
stores really won't bargain, I know that. But I can promise you
that, over the past few years, I have shopped for enough computers
to stock a mom-and-pop store ... simply because I end up helping
personal friends so often when they're shopping. And I've seen some
bargains struck, prices lowered, extra stuff like a scanner or a
software package thrown in to close the sale.
</P>
<P>
   So my first bit of shopping advice is the same as you'd get from
your Uncle Maxie. Don't pay retail if you can help it. First,
identify the specifications for the machine you want to buy. Then
go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take a checkbook or a credit card or enough cash to buy
it. Instead, find the hungriest-looking salesmen you can find and
show them your specifications. Tell them you're not browsing, that
you plan to buy a computer just like that. And explain that you'll
be shopping several stores and that you plan to buy from the place
that offers the best price on that specific machine.
</P>
<P>
   If the salesman says he can't bargain, that's fine. Write down
the list price. Some stores start out with their best offer and _
who knows _ your best price may be from a store that doesn't
discount. It happens. Then repeat the process as often as you can.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you've found the best price in town, or as close as you
care to come to it, there's still more to do. Obviously, all
computers (and all technical support) are not created equally. This
part is a personal choice. Decide how much a brand name is worth,
how much good technical support is worth and try to allow for that
in your decision. My own opinion is that _ especially for a
beginner _ the assurance of a brand name and good technical support
is worth several hundred dollars' difference in price. But mileage
may vary ... if you have a friend who is a computer whiz, you also
have a chance to save money by writing off those factors.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the point I am making is that you are already an expert
in the art of buying products. Just because you don't know a BIOS
from binoculars doesn't mean you can't do an expert job buying a
computer.

 &HT;    Be smart, be safe _ test your battery
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Teaching about batteries, starting and charging
systems often directs my attention beyond the normal textbook
theory portion of the class into trade journal publications
pertaining to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   As automotive electrical systems become more complex and
computer-dependent, the once relatively simple role of the battery
takes on a whole new dimension. While this unobtrusive component of
the vehicle's electrical network has remained basically unchanged
since its debut, it has earned the dubious position of being the
most overlooked component under the hood, even in the event of
electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
   How much trouble can that little black box cause? It doesn't
even have any moving parts. Well, I've seen a plethora of starters,
alternators and even computers replaced because of that little
black box.
</P>
<P>
   The battery is the heart and the stabilizing force in a
vehicle's whole electrical system. When it is ``sick,'' you can bet
the rest of the system is feeling the effects. I'm not talking
about something as apparent as a ``no crank'' on a cold morning.
That symptom is only the result of a weakened battery that has
finally reached the ``I quit'' point, much as a heart attack is the
result of extenuating health circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this situation is a human ends up in the hospital
with a team of medical people racing to save the heart. The patient
will subsequently undergo tests and treatments for the heart attack
until complete recovery. The battery, on the other hand, ends up on
the receiving end of a set of jumper cables that are disconnected
as soon as the engine sputters to life. It is immediately expected
to return to work full time, usually without even the benefit of a
check-up.
</P>
<P>
   Let me share a personal experience with you. A while ago, I met
my husband for supper at a restaurant. When I got into my car to
leave, it wouldn't crank. Neither of us could find any apparent
reason for the dead battery, so he jump-started my car and I drove
home. It seemed unlikely the battery was bad, as the car was only a
couple of months out of warranty and the battery's ``green eye''
was showing. We put the battery on the charger and went to bed. For
the next few days the car started fine. We figured the battery had
simply become discharged as a result of my short commute driving.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one afternoon it left me stranded in a parking lot.
Another jump-start, another charging session and a complete test of
the electrical system, including the starter revealed no problems.
However, when I ``stress tested'' the battery, it failed. I
replaced the battery. As it turned out, the battery had an internal
break that would work and then not work intermittently. Although
this is not a common problem, it wouldn't have been detected
without the proper test. Had I continued to drive the car with this
condition, it would have destroyed the alternator and very likely
caused other expensive electrical problems.
</P>
<P>

Don't ignore a dead battery and don't expect your car's charging
system to rescue it. Get it in to your mechanic and get it tested.

CHILDREN IN COMBAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report ``In the Firing Line,'' published last week by
Amnesty International's United Kingdom office, is a searing look at
children in war zones. It is a book almost too painful to read but
one that should be digested by everyone, particulary military and
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to serve as soldiers as young as age 10, tortured and
raped as prisoners and refugees, witness to the massacres of
marauding armies, millions of children have lost their lives, or
their minds, to adult destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International reports that in the past decade, 2 million
children have been killed in wars while 6 million have been maimed,
and 14 million are refugees or displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
   The most chilling statistic: 300,000 children serve as
combatants in armies. Most of these child soldiers are ages 15
through 18, but children have learned to kill at age 10 in Uganda.
In that country and others, including Rwanda, Liberia, Angola,
Sierra Leone, Guatemala, and Afghanistan, children have been forced
to perform ``initiation'' rites, killing friends, torturing other
children, or burning down homes.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of familial love and inhibitions, often pumped up with
drugs, the child soldier becomes a fearless killing machine or
willing cannon fodder sent ahead to draw fire or test for land
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, along with a coalition of human rights
groups, is calling for the nations of the world to raise the
military recruitment age to 18. Forty-four countries, including the
United States, recruit at age 17 or younger. (US soldiers are not
allowed in combat until age 18.)
</P>
<P>
   The United States should take the lead in the movement and
should start by ratifying the 1989 United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child _ a document that protects the civil and
emotional rights of children. Only the United States and Somalia
have refused to ratify the convention.
</P>
<P>
   A world that does not insist on the protection of its most
vulnerable members cannot call itself civilized and sacrifices its
future on the altar of grim expediency.

 &HT;    Let your mouse find that phone number
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Afew years back, the virtues of the then-new computer
CD-ROM drive found a real home with truly useful programs that
allowed you to look up telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot more useful than using a telephone directory,
because the programs harness the computer's ability to search
through a lot of information.
</P>
<P>
   So if you had an old friend named Fields who used to live in
Arkansas, you could try directory assistance, but you wouldn't get
very far. But, using the CD, you had a good chance of finding him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remembered his first name, or knew the city he lived
in _ information would help you narrow the search.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a big downside to these CD programs. For one
thing, they were enormous. Even the massive storage provided by the
CD wasn't enough to hold every telephone listing in the country,
all the addresses and all the phone numbers. So, if you had to
search for that same name in several regions of the country, you
might have to change discs three or even four times before finding
the right number.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the online world has made a real difference. There
are several fine Web sites where you can perform the same sort of
searches, looking for names, phone numbers, addresses, even e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Although using the Web to look up numbers can be slow, and if
you have only one phone line, you have to log off to place the
call, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, the information is stored in a giant database, so you
don't need to spend time changing CDs. Second, the information is
usually updated often. CD programs also offer updates but _ unless
you want to buy a new update a couple of times a year _ it's
unlikely the information will be as current. Third, since there are
several sites that offer this type of help, you can switch from one
service to another and search more records than you could with a
single program.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's take a look at some of these Web-based search
services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best is called Switchboard, and you'll find it at
http://www.switchboard.com. As you would expect, you can use it to
find a telephone number or an address. And it also is a good source
for e-mail addresses. (Be careful, though. People seem to change
e-mail addresses about as often as shirts and _ before sending off
a personal note based on what you find _ send a test note to make
sure you are reaching the correct person.)
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard is reasonably fast (although there will be times
when the load of a lot of simultaneous users slows things down).
And it's usually accurate. So just those attributes, coupled with
the fact that it's free _ unlike a CD program _ make it worth
using. But, as they say on those late-night TV commercials, there's
still more.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you don't know the name but do know that you need to
find a specific professional.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for doctors, lawyers, dentists, accountants or
Realtors, for instance, you can search the directory using those
categories.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially handy if you are in unfamiliar territory
geographically and need help.
</P>
<P>
   Another service that works much the same way is Bigfoot at
http://www.bigfoot.com/. While, subjectively at least, Switchboard
seems more likely to find a match, Bigfoot is a good service and
definitely worth bookmarking.
</P>
<P>
   That's because neither directory is as complete or thorough as
your hometown phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are missing from these services, and you can't beat
the convenience of searching both services.

 &HT;    Browse without leaving a cookie trail
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surfing the Web is getting to be a little like living
in a glass house _ much of what you do goes noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run Web sites use things called ``cookies'' and
``referrers'' to see what we search for, where we go and what we
buy. The cookies and referrers give the information to Web sites,
market researchers and ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most browsers let you control whether you want to accept
cookies. With Netscape's browser, you can find it under the
``edit'' part of the toolbar, then look in the ``advanced''
category.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, shutting off the cookie accepter shuts off your
access to some sites, or at least limits what you can do there.
</P>
<P>
   A software product from a Cambridge, Mass., company blocks
cookies for you, without limiting your access to different Web
sites. interMute which can be downloaded from
http://www.intermute.com, sells for $19.95. A 14-day trial copy is
free.
</P>
<P>
   The software also lets you restrict other things, including Java
applets (the bit-heavy applications that make Web site ingredients
flash, scroll and move), banner ads and background music.
</P>
<P>
   The program acts as a filter between your browser and the Web.
It works on most common browsers, including recent versions of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's browser. Once
installed, the program runs when the computer starts.
</P>
<P>
   interMute works on Windows 95, 98 and NT platforms, as well as
on UNIX and any Java-compatible system.
</P>
<P>
   Companies willing to pay to lure online shoppers
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Forrester Research predicts advertisers will spend $605
million to get you to do your car shopping online, $187 million to
convince you to house-hunt online and $460 million so you will
check the Web classifieds for job openings. That's up from 1997
totals of $16 million, $5 million and $48 million for car, house
and job shopping online ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   So far, those doing the shopping are mostly just browsing. A
Millward Brown Interactive study asked 527 Internet users about
online auto-shopping habits. The 1998 study found that while 42
percent of those surveyed used the Internet to research their car
purchase, only 0.6 percent bought their car online.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly attractive features are likely to increase
those numbers. Some auto-shopping sites let you place a free
classified ad, find trade-in and market prices for cars, check loan
and insurance rates, and check through a database of recalls.
http://www.autoweb.com, http://www.carpoint.msn.com and
http://www.autos.yahoo.com offer several of those features.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a home loan on the Web is also becoming more popular.
Myers Internet Services predicts 12 percent of all mortgage
applications will take place on the Internet by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Portal sites such as http://www
</P>
<P>
   .excite.com and http://www.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com offer features that let you calculate mortgage rates and
get credit reports as well as information about schools and home
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Time to get a printer as good as your photos
</P>
<P>
   So, you got your new scanner or your digital camera for the
holidays, and now you want to start printing the pictures. But your
poor printer quality makes them look like pulp comic drawings.
</P>
<P>
   It might be time to upgrade your color printer to match your
scanner and digital camera. Hewlett-Packard released the HP DeskJet
882C for the home market. The photo-quality printer has a suggested
retail of $299.
</P>
<P>
   The new HP DeskJet prints up to eight pages per minute. It uses
Hewlett-Packard photo resolution enhancement color-layering
technology to print photo-quality images. The feature creates the
photo-quality image by blending tiny drops of ink.
</P>
<P>
   The printer comes with a CD-ROM that lets you edit your photos
and create greeting cards, banners and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   The printers are available at most major electronics retailers
and online at http://www.shopping.hp.com.

 &HT;    It's easy to stay on time, anywhere in the world
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My computer runs at 400 MhZ (Macho 6, or 0.24 ounces
per thousand of blood testosterone). Nonetheless, it was 10 minutes
slow this morning.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this lamentable condition while examining a neat
little program called Time and Measures, from QM Labs.
</P>
<P>
   In its default configuration, T&AMP;M presents the user with a
two-frame window, the larger showing a pretty globe. You can rotate
it side to side, up and down. To do anything with it, you find the
country in which you are interested, zoom in until you find a city,
and click on the city.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller frame will then provide you with the correct date
and time in that city, as well as its longitude and latitude in
case you are navigating. If you don't want to go through all this
show and tell, you can just select a city from a long list.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the program's only trick. As the title indicates, it
will also convert measurements: Fahrenheit to Celsius or Kelvin in
temperatures, and English/metric in weights, volume, area and
distance. Type the number you wish to convert into the appropriate
box, click convert, and the conversions are shown instantly.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you type ``3'' into the ounce box, you get not
only what that amounts to at every level of metric weight, but its
portion of a pound and even a ton.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few disappointments in T&AMP;M. It doesn't have as many
cities as it should _ nothing is shown, for instance, between Accra
and Monrovia on the west coast of Africa. One assumes the
intervening countries and capitals are all on the same time zone,
but it seems as though they ought to be there nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   In the weight conversion feature, grains are not addressed.
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;M costs $35, and you can download a free demo from
http://www.qmlabs.com. However, if you are connected to the
Internet, you really don't need to buy a program for these
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Date and Time Gateway at http://www.bsdi.com/date/ will give you
the time _ OK, it's military time, but I know you can figure it out
_ for just about any city in the world. Local Times Around the
World at http://www.hilink.com
</P>
<P>
   .au/times/ does the same. Global Metric Time Service (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .globalmetric.com/time/) is a nice site intended to let you set
up a list of five cities and get the local time there every time
you log in.
</P>
<P>
   For measurement conversions, all you need _ more than you need,
probably _ is Megaconverter (http://www.megaconverter.com/). Here,
you can find that 1 U.S. gallon is equal to 15.68628 Danish paegl,
as well as 3.78541 liters. It will also tell you that 4.5 grains
equals 0.01029 ounces, or 0.00072 Polish funts.
</P>
<P>
   In checking on the time sites, I discovered my computer's clock
was running 10 minutes slow. At the National Institute of Standards
time page (http://www.bldrdoc.gov/timefreq/javaclck.htm), I found a
neat little program you can download, then run every time you log
onto the Internet. It will check with the NIS page, reset your
clock to conform with the atomic clock, and go away in the blink of
an eyeball _ 0.815 of a second, or 1.51 Moldavian grunts.

<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ After five years of trying to make peace in
Angola, having spent at least $1.5 billion and having seen 60 of
its staff members lose their lives, the United Nations is now an
unwelcome guest here.
</P>
<P>
   Both the government and the rebels have essentially indicated
that they want the peacekeepers to leave so that the two sides can
fight to the finish without interference in this country that is
one of the most troubled, and potentially one of the richest, in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United Nations seems set to give in. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended in a report to the Security Council on
Sunday night that after four years of operation, the organization
withdraw its peacekeepers. So far, some U.N. aid organizations have
indicated they will continue in the country, but it is unclear
whether they would be able to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we are not supposed to witness,'' Issa B.Y.
Diallo, the U.N. special representative to Angola, said Monday.
``That's why we're asked not to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't just leave a population that's suffering. And
tomorrow it will be worse. War is spreading all over this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has been rekindling for weeks. It is said to be fiercest
around the central highlands towns of Huambo, Cuito and Malanje.
There are reports that rebel troops are moving toward Soyo, a
northern oil area, and there have been attacks on diamond mines in
the northeast that the rebels are trying to retake.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be no particular nervousness on Monday,
though, in the capital, Luanda, which is part of the coastal strip
the government considers secure.
</P>
<P>
   After many years of guerrilla warfare in Angola, a peace
agreement was reached in May 1991 calling for elections in 1992. A
government victory at the polls led the rebel leader, Jonas
Savimbi, to renew the fighting. After government offensives in
1994, a peace treaty was signed with the rebels, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, known by its Portuguese
acronym, Unita.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called for demobilization of the rebels and the
formation of a joint government, but Savimbi has not joined the
government, demobilization did not succeed and fighting began anew.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the U.N. force has dwindled to 1,000 observers, from
nations as diverse as India, Portugal, Zimbabwe, Russia, Romania,
Bulgaria Sweden, Spain and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly spread across a country almost twice the size of Texas,
they were able to do little but report troop movements near their
camps and odd bits of gossip back to headquarters, and sometimes do
good works like help operate clinics. Unlike peacekeepers in
Kosovo, they did not even have the reassurance of a powerful NATO
force nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The hints that the United Nations should go had become viciously
unsubtle. Last week, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in his New
Year's address to foreign diplomats, said the United Nations had
``lost control over the peace process, whose derailment already is
a reality,'' and expressed his hope that Annan would fold up the
observer mission on its Feb. 26 expiration date. Annan has
recommended closing it by March 20.
</P>
<P>
   And in what some diplomats believe was a message from the
rebels, two U.N.-chartered planes were shot down, one on Dec. 26
and one on Jan. 2, with a total of 23 people aboard. Both crashes
are officially unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal by both sides to let the United Nations launch
prompt search-and-rescue missions only pointed out the
organization's helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there a message?'' said a diplomat, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Yes. It was: `Don't fly _ stay the hell out because
we want to kill each other in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But observers say that both sides are foolish to believe that
victory awaits them at the end of the fighting, aside from bringing
back the misery of war to a country that has had a respite after 30
years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, it doesn't appear that either side can
annihilate the other,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, the U.N. envoy, was asked if anything could end the war
short of the death or capture of one of the two chief antagonists _
the rebel leader, Savimbi, or dos Santos. Diallo answered with an
emphatic, ``Yes, yes, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People can learn from war,'' he said. ``The Angolans will. But
this one will be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. announcement came as no surprise to people in the
capital. ``When did it happen?'' Maria Manuela, 26, asked about the
announcement as she walked home from work. ``It's the same as it's
always been. Savimbi is crazy.'' One of her brothers died a
soldier, she said, and another is now of draft age.
</P>
<P>
   Some young men said they were nervous. Last week the government
said that all those ages 17 to 19 would have to register, and
``enlistment'' centers would open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the fighting was last at its height, military
press gangs set up roadblocks in the capital and the vast slums
south of it, stopped young men and carried any in the right age
group off to police holding cells until trucks could take them to
far-away boot camps. Many never came back.
</P>
<P>
   The road from the airport to a presidential residence was lined
Monday with armed soldiers spaced about 100 yards apart, but that
was apparently for an official visit by Presidents Laurent Kabila
of Congo and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the neighboring Congo
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown traffic, in what was once a lovely beachfront city
but now has shell-pocked buildings full of squatters interspersed
with its $200-a-night hotels, was, as usual, a necklace of traffic
circle melees on strings of jammed streets.
</P>
<P>
   There was no unified opinion among passers-by. ``Let them go,''
Walter Figuerrado, 40, said of the peace observers. ``In all the
years they were here, they did nothing. And they camouflaged the
fact that the disarming of Unita's troops wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But a 43-year-old man at a bus stop, who said he was a judge but
would give his name only as Pedro ``for security reasons,'' said he
lamented the departure. ``It's going to be a tougher war than
before,'' he said. He said he believed that Unita should have been
disarmed before the elections in 1992. The drift back into war has
been slow but steady. It became obvious months ago that Savimbi had
kept his bush army, sending old men and boys with rusty guns to the
demobilization camps.
</P>
<P>
   Then, saying he feared for his safety despite being offered a
bodyguard of 400 troops, Savimbi never moved to Luanda to join the
government. Some of his top advisers and generals did, though, so
his party has splintered into three factions.
</P>
<P>
   The government recently named another faction as the official
Unita. On the back page of the same issue of the party newspaper in
which that announcement was made, it printed a ``wanted'' poster of
Savimbi, calling him a war criminal and comparing him unfavorably
to Hitler, Idi Amin, Pol Pot and vampires.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who blames both sides for a ``lack of political will to
make peace,'' tried to keep dialogue open between the two sides,
but the government went to great lengths to prevent him. It
repeatedly refused him permission to fly to Savimbi's informal
capital, Bailundo.
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to Voice of America radio, government
representatives tried to scare Diallo by contending that Savimbi is
a drinker and drug abuser who would attack him or take him hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the observers are likely to pull out, many U.N. aid
agencies will remain. The World Food Program now feeds about
800,000 people, nearly a tenth of the population. The United
Nations is already worried about crises that may be on the way,
including swarms of refugees, famine and tribal clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we'll be here whether the observer mission
is or not,'' said Maria Flynn, a spokeswoman for the World Food
Program.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil said on Monday that it would continue
to allow the value its currency, the real, to be set by market
forces, abandoning a policy to support the currency, which was
draining billions from its reserves of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the currency from weakening further, the nation's
central bank raised interest rates on overnight loans on Monday,
and Pedro Malan, Brazil's finance minister, told U.S. officials in
Washington that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
administration was determined to take whatever steps were necessary
to avert a crippling new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move to allow the real to trade freely against
the dollar had lifted the Bovespa stock market index by 33.4
percent on Friday, and its announcement on Monday kindled a further
upswing, with the index rising 5.4 percent. Though U.S. exchanges
were closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, markets across Europe
rose. The real, however, fell an additional 10 percent, to 1.58 to
the dollar from 1.43 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Brazil ends a policy that had been geared toward
controlling chronic inflation by tying the currency to the nation's
dollar reserves, which kept a tight rein on the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's troubles having been raising fears of an Asian-style
collapse that could weaken economies throughout the region,
including in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A communique by the central bank said on Monday that ``as of
today,'' it would ``allow the interbank market (both free and
floating segments) to define the exchange rate.'' It added that the
central bank might intervene in the future ``occasionally and in a
limited way, with the goal of countering disordered movement in
exchange rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso told reporters on Monday in Brasilia that free trading
on the currency could lead to a resurgence of the real. Now, he
said, ``we are more dependent on ourselves,'' particularly on the
willingness of the Brazilian Congress to cut spending and special
benefits for vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Malan said Brazil would not ask the International
Monetary Fund to speed up the second stage of its $41.5 billion
standby loan, but he said that the Brazilian government would have
to redouble efforts to cut spending and would probably increase
interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am recommending that the committee on monetary policy
discuss a widening of the interest rate band to allow the active
use of interest rates, with an initial upward bias that may be
required to maintain low inflation,'' he said in Washington. In
Brazil on Monday, short-term interest rates rose to 42 percent from
37.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Arranz, who tracks international markets at Banco Patente
in Sao Paolo, said he expected the government to announce another
series of measures in the next few weeks to help it pay
dollar-denominated debts due in 1999, which he estimated rose by
$13 billion just with last week's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is not here yet,'' Arranz said. ``With the money
devalued, economic activity will shrink even more. Companies that
began to invest are going to put on the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso is insisting that Brazil has not abandoned controlling
inflation, which sank below 1 percent last year. Today, he called
on Brazilian businesses not to trigger instant inflation by raising
prices in response to the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Banking experts say that despite the devaluation, Brazil is in
better position to meet its external obligations than Mexico in
1994 or Korea in 1997, both of which devalued their currencies in
response to financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Across Latin America, markets rose modestly on Monday after
Brazil said it had abandoned its policy of spending down dollar
reserves to defend its overvalued currency. Only the Merval index
in Argentina closed down, dropping 2.4 percent, with business
leaders there calling for trade barriers to keep out a flood of
suddenly cheaper Brazilian imports.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian devaluation is exerting severe pressure on
Argentina, which backs the value of each peso with a dollar in
reserves and relies on a currency board to set monetary policy. &QL;

NEW YORK HONORS KING AND HIS IDEALS, NOT YET FULLY REALIZED
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-KING) 
(bl) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Glenn, a history teacher at John Jay High
School in Park Slope, Brooklyn, says he still treasures a
photograph of himself at the age of 14 with Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. Glenn was 14 and editor of his school newspaper at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was the first black family to live in our
neighborhood in East St. Louis,'' he said Monday. ``My father took
us to a cafeteria that wouldn't serve us, but we didn't leave until
the cops came.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 55, who was arrested 8 times and served a total of 55
days in jail during the civil rights struggles in the South, was at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where a host of politicians and
others turned out Monday to celebrate King's legacy. It was one of
several events to honor the civil rights leader, and many used the
day to reflect on how far the nation had come in seeking to correct
the inequalities King had devoted his life to ending, and how far
it has yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The day was studded with fiery rhetoric, jubilant gospel music,
religious services and political debates around the region. At one
event, Sen. Charles Schumer, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall discussed policy in a forum
organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   An ecumenical service organized by the Baptist Ministers
Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity drew former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Rep. Charles Rangel and former Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   And on the West Side of Manhattan, students from the Martin
Luther King Jr. High School painted walls at the 74th Street Senior
Home, an assisted-living center, and danced and played bingo with
the residents in honor of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music was so heavily
attended that the 2,100-seat opera house could not accommodate
everybody. There was, of course, a strong political backdrop, with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Borough President Howard Golden and Schumer
taking part.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that his first assignment after his election to
the House of Representatives in 1985 was to the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I co-sponsored the bill to make his birthday a national
holiday,'' Schumer said, ``and it is astounding the opposition that
bill garnered. The most pernicious amendment came from an Orange
County, Calif., representative who wanted to strike one word _
`King' _ and make it Martin Luther Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that although Martin Luther was a great man, he
didn't represent all of us,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one aroused the fervor of the overwhelmingly black
assemblage as much as Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and former chairman
of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which in the
1960s worked to end segregation in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion tinged the congressman's voice as he described a
childhood in the Alabama town of Troy, where he first tried out
preaching sermons to the chicks he raised on his family's farm and
where he was told that library cards were for whites only. When
Troy State University in Montgomery failed to even acknowledge his
1957 application for admission, he wrote to King, who promptly sent
him a round-trip bus ticket to meet him in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inspired me to take a seat at the lunch counter, and by
sitting down we were standing up for the best in American
tradition,'' he said. Together King and Lewis joined with other
leaders of SNCC in marching for voting rights and equal
opportunities, and Lewis vividly described being met with tear gas,
bullwhips, trampling horses and state troopers during the march
from Selma to Montgomery in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was the only speaker of the day to connect the impeachment
trial to issues of discrimination. ``If I was able to forgive Bull
Connor, George Wallace, the Ku Klux Klan, then we should be able to
forgive our president,'' he said, his voice rising with anger.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of his talk, he recalled a childhood incident in
which he and his brothers, sisters and cousins were playing at an
aunt's flimsy house (``a shotgun house because you could shoot a
bullet in the front and have it come out the back''). A sudden
violent storm arose, and he said, ``We ran from corner to corner of
the house trying to hold it down with our little bodies wherever it
was raised up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he continued, ``the lightning may flash, the wind may
blow, the rain may beat down, but we must never leave our house,''
he said. ``Maybe we all came to this country in different ships,
but we are all in one boat together.''
</P>
<P>
   That message was not lost on Kim Wanliss, 33, an assistant
principal at Intermediate School 232 in Brooklyn, who immigrated
here from Jamaica. As she listened to Lewis, she said, ``I realized
that they paved the way for people like me, where there are no
legal obstacles any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But as many others did, she noted that King's vision had yet to
be fully realized. ``There is still plenty of cultural bias,'' she
went on. ``Two years ago, my sister had a problem in the workplace
when she was told that wearing braids wrapped around her head was
not acceptable.'' She subsequently left her job, Ms. Wanliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the teacher in Park Slope, waited in a long line for
Lewis to sign his book ``Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the
Movement'' (Simon &AMP; Shuster). He said that to this day he presses
on with the cause by talking about King to his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's ancient history to them,'' he said. ``They don't
understand that those conditions of segregation existed only a
moment ago.''

PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR FALLS SILENT ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LOBBY, IMPEACH-REPUBS)

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. Rick Santorum, the conservative Republican
from Pennsylvania, has been a strident critic of President Clinton,
once accusing him of telling ``bald-faced untruths.'' But these
days, with Clinton's fate in the hands of the Senate _ and with
Democrats lining up to challenge Santorum for his job in 2000 _ the
junior senator's voice has fallen silent.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, a freshman known for his vocal opposition to an
abortion procedure that Clinton has kept legal, acknowledges that
he has softened his sharper edges. But he says he has done so
because he has sworn to be impartial about impeachment, not to save
his own political skin in a state that has voted twice for Clinton
and gives him sky-high approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm toning things down because this is not an issue where I
have an opinion going into it,'' Santorum said Monday, hustling
through a hotel lobby on his way to catch a plane.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption by his conservative supporters and liberal
critics is that regardless of what he says, Santorum will vote to
remove Clinton from office. But Santorum insists he has not decided
how he will vote. He says he is keeping his mind open, and his
recent public comments indeed betray no bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took an oath of impartiality,'' he said. ``The politics I'm
not going to worry about. You could argue the politics either
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Political watchers here say that he has moderated his tone and
to some extent his positions from his previously purist approach.
He supported a sales-tax increase in 1997 for certain counties in
Western Pennsylvania to build a new stadium to keep the Pirates in
Pittsburgh. (Voters opposed it.) He has also portrayed himself as a
protector of the steel industry, which is being hurt by cheap
foreign imports, although he was shouted down at a recent forum by
a crowd of angry steelworkers who doubted his sincerity. And he has
been active in seeking to shore up Social Security, an important
issue in a state with a heavy proportion of elderly voters. But few
seem convinced that, come reckoning day in the Senate, there is
even a chance that Santorum would vote in the president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's receding into a more procedure-oriented focus,'' said Sam
Katz, a Republican candidate for mayor and one of the few
Republicans attending a Martin Luther King luncheon here Monday,
where Santorum sat at the head table. ``But I can't imagine he
won't vote to remove the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's neutrality on impeachment had filtered through to
some in the audience of 2,500 people, many of them
African-Americans. Myrtis A. Gordon, 55, a manager of court clerks,
said his stance was ``kind of encouraging and somewhat
unexpected,'' and she told him as he left to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   But she said later that she still expected him to vote against
the president and added that despite his professed neutrality, she
would never vote for him because he was too conservative. ``I
wouldn't vote for him if he stood on his head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's dedicated conservative following here senses that he
will vote against Clinton on principle, even if he has to appear
more neutral now. Michael Geer, president of the Pennsylvania
Family Institute, a conservative group that focuses on state
issues, said: ``There's a distinction between what they say and how
they vote. If Senator Santorum were up in 2004, he might be more
outspoken than he is now. But he won't take a poll and say, `The
people in Pennsylvania like Clinton and won't support me if I vote
to convict him so I won't convict.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum was elected in 1994 with 49 percent of the vote,
ousting the Democratic incumbent, Harris Wofford. One Democrat,
state Sen. Allyson Schwartz, has already announced her candidacy
for Senate in the year 2000, saying that Santorum is too out of
step with mainstream Pennsylvania. Others in the wings include Rep.
Ron Klink, former Reps. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Peter
Kostmayer, and Tom Foley, the former state labor secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names in state Democratic politics _ Edward G.
Rendell, mayor of Philadelphia, and Bob Casey Jr., the state
auditor general _ are more likely to run for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   All of Santorum's likely opponents are on the liberal end of the
spectrum, which suits him just fine. ``If I was running against the
most popular, well-known moderate Democrat, it wouldn't affect my
decision,'' he said. ``I want my children to be able to be proud of
what their father did.''

   Gulp, gulp, gulp. Small fish in the corporate sea are swallowed
by medium fish, which are eaten by sharks, which devour each other.
The consumer paddles along nervously, watching the names change,
reassessing brand loyalties, and wondering who will be next.

JAPANESE INVENTOR WINS HIGH-TECH RACE WITH LASER BREAKTHROUGH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lone Japanese inventor has outrun some of the world's largest
and most advanced high-technology corporations in the race to
develop a new generation of short-wavelength lasers. The
achievement is likely to hasten the introduction of high-definition
digital video disks, higher-resolution laser printing and
inexpensive and highly efficient light bulbs for use in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor, Shuji Nakamura, is a semiconductor researcher who
has worked for more than a decade in relative isolation and has
excelled in finding innovations in material science. Last week his
small company, Nichia Chemical Industries, announced that it had
begun shipping samples of violet lasers to a variety of companies
planning to develop prototype products. The lasers have a life span
of 10,000 hours, the level of reliability required by consumer
electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such short-wavelength lasers, in the blue and violet part of the
spectrum, have been pursued for years by companies including U.S.
and Japanese giants like 3M, Hewlett Packard, Sony and Toshiba. In
digital storage such an advance is particularly impressive because
each time the wavelength of laser light is halved, the beam can
then store four times more data.
</P>
<P>
   That the race has so far gone to Nichia (nih-KEY-uh) is a payoff
for its long-term investment in pursuing this technology, which
many corporations deemed a high risk.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also indicate how Japanese and U.S. companies have
reversed roles in recent years. Officials of U.S. companies said
Monday that they still thought they could win the race to
incorporate the technology into products and bring them to market
first. From the 1950s through the 1970s Japanese companies
successfully commercialized technologies invented in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The next barrier will be reducing the cost of producing the
lasers and devising technical standards that will provide
compatibility with existing applications.
</P>
<P>
   Nakamura first burst onto the scientific stage in November 1993
when Nichia announced that he had succeeded in fabricating a bright
blue light-emitting diode, another kind of widely used light
source.
</P>
<P>
   His advance came just two years after IBM decided to scale back
its effort in laser research, partly in the belief that the market
would not be large enough in the near future. Monday, IBM
researchers said they were impressed by the Nichia achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call it a piece of technical work that is absoutely
remarkable, and it stands on its own,'' said Bill Lenth, manager of
science and technology at the IBM Almaden research laboratory in
San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But other American competitors said the international race to
commercialize the technology was still in progress and refused to
concede. And further breakthroughs in short-wavelength lasers _
such as blue lasers, which could lead to higher-resolution computer
displays _ have yet to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a leader in this field,'' said Waguih Ishak,
director of Hewlett Packard's Communications and Optics Research
Laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif. ``We still see that Nakamura is
ahead of us. He's ahead, but it's a marathon and we've just
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett Packard ramped up its multimillion-dollar research
program in lasers and light-emitting diodes (LED's) shortly after
Nakamura's breakthrough in 1993. Ishak said the company had now
caught up with him in the LED market, and he said he was pushing
hard to catch Nichia in the laser race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I can't fail in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial application of the new lasers is expected to have
substantial impact. For example, they will make possible
high-definition digital video disks, or HD DVD's, a step beyond the
current digital video disks. The new compact disk-size platters
will deliver HDTV-quality movies, concerts and stage presentations.
In addition, music publishers could publish entire anthologies on a
single HD DVD, carrying more than a dozen hours of music on each
side.
</P>
<P>
   Besides DVD applications, Nakamura said by e-mail that the
violet semiconductor lasers would enable a new generation of
digital tape recorders that will be similar to today's VCR machines
but able to store high-definition video images.
</P>
<P>
   While the most sought-after commercial applications for
short-wavelength lasers are in the area of digital storage, there
are a wide range of other practical uses, ranging from laser
printers with twice as much resolution as today's best-quality
products to a new class of household lighting that could be two to
10 times more energy efficient than today's fluorescent and
incandescent light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Nichia researcher's breakthrough came from exploring an
unusual class of materials known as gallium nitrides. Other
companies had previously tried to use other matierals to construct
blue semiconductor lasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took an unorthodox, high-risk route, and he won,'' said
Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering of Seaford, N.Y., a
computer and consumer electronics industry consulting concern.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to near-term digital storage applications, Doherty
and other researchers said that inexpensive short-length lasers
might make possible such futuristic technologies as optical
computers, laser-based computer or television displays and a new
generation of optical fiber communications systems or even
ultra-high-speed laser optical communications sent directly through
the air rather than by fiber optic wires.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Blue Laser Diode,'' a book about his technology
published in 1997, Nakamura wrote that the chairman of Nichia,
Nobuo Ogawa, originally invested $3.3 million in the laser diode
project, or about 1.5 percent of the company's sales that year. The
amount is much higher than what companies usually invest in the
work of a single researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread acclaim for Nakamura's breakthrough,
executives of one small American company that is a close competitor
of Nichia predicted that they would still win the race to
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still huge questions to be answered about
pricing and volume production,'' said Neal Hunter, chief executive
of the company, Cree Research Inc. of Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to build inexpensive LED's, Nichia was first to
market, but others ultimately managed to produce them more cheaply,
he argued, saying that the same economics might hold true in the
semiconductor laser race.
</P>
<P>
   Cree is gambling on a technology using silicon carbide, rather
than gallium nitride, and Hunter said the company believed that it
would make products easier to manufacture and afford better heat
dissipation _ properties that will be crucial in low-cost
applications.

HOW TO ENCOURAGE CANDIDATES?

<P>
   Each week now, another potential candidate for president signs
up for next year's election _ or signs off. The number choosing not
to run is worrisome and calls for action on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seem determined to field a good number of candidates
in 2000. Still, former candidate Jack Kemp and Senators John
Ashbrook and Fred Thompson have indicated that they will pass up
the honor. The Democratic field, meanwhile, is alarmingly thin.
Senators Bob Kerrey and Paul Wellstone abandoned campaign
preparations recently, and the House minority leader, Richard
Gephardt, is looking toward an extended career in the House _ he
would likely be speaker if the Democrats take back the majority
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those choosing not to run have no comparable
rationale. The forces working to deter them are neither sensible
nor healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most obvious is money. The very idea that the
presidential campaign carries an admission price of $20 million to
$30 million should be abhorrent to all Americans. The Supreme Court
outlawed the disgraceful poll tax for voters in 1966. But there is
now a frightening bar for candidates, who must raise $60,000 a day
every day for the next year if they want to remain competitive.
This limits the choice offered to voters, many of whom are
understandably turned off to the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's primary and caucus calendar has added another
serious impediment. With California and other large states seeking
early primary dates to augment their clout, it is likely that the
nominees of both parties will be decided in early March. This
schedule heavily favors the well-known and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Remedies for these problems are far easier to identify than to
implement. Campaign finance reform needs a Congress with less
self-interest. A better primary calendar needs states that will put
the nation's well-being above their own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For President Clinton, the event Monday offered an
apparently seamless blend of symbolism and substance, just the
right formula to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s life.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement home here, the president helped knock down a
wall to make room for a health clinic. Then he announced what he
called ``the largest settlement in history'' of a case involving
lending discrimination in housing _ $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But while the wall fell without much fuss, the mortgage company
accused of discrimination fought back furiously, declaring that it
had admitted no wrongdoing and had committed no more money than it
would have otherwise to help minority and low-to-moderate income
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Still dressed in his blue jeans and invigorated by his volunteer
work, Clinton noted at the Regency House retirement home that
Congress passed the Fair Housing Act, outlawing housing
discrimination, just six days after King was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had worked for years to outlaw discrimination in housing,''
Clinton said. ``And many who voted for the measure said they did it
in tribute to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the agreement, ``the Columbia National
Mortgage Co. will offer _ listen to this _ $6.5 billion in home
mortgages and extra effort to help 78,000 minority and low and
moderate income families unlock the door to homeownership.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Gallitano, the chairman and chief executive of
Columbia National, said he was shocked by any suggestion his
company had discriminated and was taking dramatic steps to reform
its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he was very poorly informed,'' he said of the
president. The agreement was reached between the company, based in
Columbia, Md., and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Housing department officials said the company signed the agreement
in November, and that the department signed it Friday. But it was
not disclosed until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did with HUD's concurrence was to take what we had done
over the last five years and reaffirm that it was what we would do
over the next five years,'' Gallitano said in a telephone
interview. ``This might all make good press on Martin Luther King
Day, but it sure as hell is taking a club to our heads when we
haven't done anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But a HUD official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Columbia had committed to new spending. ``To make the point
even clearer, in 1997, Columbia nationally made $1.4 billion in
loans'' to all borrowers, the official said. ``It is committing
almost the same amount over five years for low and moderate income
loans and other related benefits alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gallitano said that the agreement specifies only that
Columbia must make such funds ``available'' to qualified minority
and low-income buyers _ as step, he said, that regulations already
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Secretary Andrew Cuomo, HUD over the last
two years has stepped up enforcement of the anti-discrimination
law. As a result, Cuomo said, more people are becoming aware of the
law, and complaints are rising. But companies, he said, are also
taking more steps to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe we'll never be able to come together as a
nation if we can't live together as a people,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at Columbia, ``there were very few loans to
minorities and that was across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallitano called that statement ``grossly inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prided ourselves on our lending practices and we
preach _ and when I say preach I mean preach _ that we are in
business to serve the community,'' he said. ``ALL the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side supplied sharply different statistics, to support its
view.
</P>
<P>
   A HUD official said that in 1997, the last year for which
full-year numbers were available, Columbia made a total of $51.6
million in loans to low-and-moderate income borrowers _ just five
percent of its total volume.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallitano called that statistic ``grossly in error.'' He
said that the company, blindsided by the announcement, was
scrambling to analyze its data, and would not have it ready until
Tuesday. But he said that in Texas, the source of the complaint
that led to the agreement announced Monday, 36 percent of the
company's loans in 1997 were to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the retirement home, Clinton did not get into such details.
He seemed to prefer to talk about his renovation work, which he did
alongside Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did the vice president and me a lot of good to pick up
those hammers and crow bars and tear something down,'' he said.
``You know, we do this desk work all the time and we do this word
work all the time, and there's not always a beginning, a middle and
an end. There was a beginning to that wall, a middle and it is no
longer, it is over.''

MISTARGETING GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flush from victory against the tobacco industry, cities and
states across the country &UR;  &LR; are contemplating, or have initiated,
lawsuits against gun manufacturers, attempting to hold them
responsible for gun deaths and thereby achieving gun control
through litigation instead of legislation. This is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   We are firmly in favor of strict gun control and keeping guns
off the street. Yet using the courts in this way abuses the legal
system and derogates the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in New York is hearing a case in which the
families of seven shooting victims are suing major gun
manufacturers, including Colt of Connecticut and Smith &AMP; Wesson of
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' argument is that their youngsters died because
criminals have such easy access to weapons. They claim that the gun
manufacturers are negligently marketing and distributing their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   In six of the seven cases, no guns were found, so it is not even
certain that US-manufactured guns were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tobacco, if a gun is used the way it is supposed to be by
law and design, it is not harmful to the user. If the product is
being used by criminals or children, that is a matter for parents
and police, not the manufacturers. If the law allows too free a
distribution of guns, that is a matter for legislators and
regulators, who should not so easily avoid their responsibilities.
To blame the manufacturers for gun deaths is the same as suggesting
in a hit-and-run accident that Ford or General Motors or Mercedes
be made responsible, attorney David Gross told National Public
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ours is a country that is rapidly turning itself
over to rule by lawsuit. Political debate is abandoned in favor of
litigation. The courts are burdened with every social ill because
we cannot agree on the rules we should live by. Suing the gun
manufacturers to get guns off the street is bad law and bad social
policy.

DOSE OF ONE-ON-ONE IS NICE SPORTS-TALK FIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
((This the first in an annual four-part series on the best and
worst of Los Angeles' sports media. Today: The sports-talk radio
hosts.))
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given the choice, do you take generic over
name-brand at the pharmacy?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, as long as it does the job.
</P>
<P>
   If radio sports-talk can be considered an addictive drug, the
generic brand in Los Angeles these days might be the one that
doesn't cause drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Going up against what's considered the established two
Jacor-owned stations for sports-talk listeners, the Los Angeles
branch of Chicago-based One-on-One Sports on KCTD-AM (1540) has
become the alternative choice of medication for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   __ The melting pot of sports fans in the L.A. market who aren't
necessarily tied to local teams have found this as an outlet to
call in and talk about !ital!their teams.
</P>
<P>
   __ Those who've given up on locally produced shows have had this
spot on the dial since October '97. Some are finally finding out
its value.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, One-on-One is going one-on-two against KXTA-AM
(1150) and XTRA-AM (690) here. From a business proposition _ trying
to lure the 25-to-54 male demographic with cutting-edge programming
and a 50,000-watt signal at a minimal cost _ the station makes
sense. Now the question is whether L.A. will pick up on the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Arbitron ratings, to which One-on-One does not
subscribe, the playing field here is pretty level. So why not go
for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``This has proven to be the most economical way to do radio
here,'' said KCTD station manager Bob Bordonaro, who has run
stations in adult-contemporary, jazz and general talk before
getting into sports. ``This lineup is solid. The next step is to
get people to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our angle is we don't have to be sweet to the Dodgers because
we're not their flagship. We can tell it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the One-on-One staff in L.A. _ a five-person
operation working out of an office in Burbank _ is to be seen to
get heard. Distinctive orange-and-black billboards went up
immediately when the station started here.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing director Chuck Hayes, who knows about the difficulty
of making inroads in L.A. after working for the former
SportsChannel L.A. premium cable station, has been showing up at
L.A. events _ from pro to high school _ to give out prizes and be
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sports-talk listener in L.A. is intelligent, opinionated,
loyal as the day is long, and they're not fickle,'' said Hayes.
``We want to serve those people. We don't undervalue the Angelenos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really exciting to see the attention we've received
around the city the last two months.''
</P>
<P>
   The One-on-One Sports network began with 75 stations when it
purchased the Sports Entertainment Network out of Las Vegas in
1993. From 1997-98, One-on-One established beachheads in L.A., New
York, Boston and Chicago by buying stations. It has grown to more
than 400 affiliates in almost every major market as well as
maintaining a useful Web site (http://1on1sports.com).
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you won't run into hosts like John Renshaw, Peter
Brown, ``Papa'' Joe Chevalier and Arnie Spanier out at the Forum or
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the One-on-One lineup know its stuff. Just listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get more and more calls from Los Angeles all the time,''
said Chevalier, on from 3 to 7 p.m. in L.A. ``I think it's because
we're a refreshing alternative to local sports talk. L.A. and New
York are such cosmopolitan areas. And some days you have to battle
the Dodger talk, but at the same time, he have a national
perspective if Rupert Murdoch does something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordonaro's statistics show that 15,000 to 20,000 calls a month
to the nationwide shows come from the station's Southern California
region, which stretches from Santa Barbara to San Clemente and as
far east as San Bernardino County.
</P>
<P>
   The closest affiliate to Los Angeles is Palm Springs' KNWZ-AM
(1270) and there is none yet in San Diego or San Francisco, so KCTD
has juice in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of KCTD's signal strength, USC has used it as an
affiliate for its football and basketball broadcasts usually heard
on XTRA-AM (690) out of San Diego that has problems reaching parts
of L.A. and the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   KCTD has recently signed the Long Beach Ice Dogs for a package
of games and could be doing the Los Angeles Marathon radio
coverage. It will also likely carry other L.A. teams that have
scheduling conflicts with their flagship stations.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting the broadcasting rights to L.A. teams isn't part of
the strategy, Bordonaro says, because research shows they don't
make as big a ratings impact as they used to in this market.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bordonaro envisions KCTD airing a locally produced
show _ Joe McDonnell? He's been asked. But management is kind of
partial to the national focus it has got going at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we say around the office is, `Why do we need
an extra XTRA?' '' Bordonaro said. &QL; 
RADIO SPORTS-TALK HOSTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE TOP 10 &QL; 
__ 1. Vacant. Would have been Joe McDonnell for a four-peat, but
AM-1150 found him replaceable. Could have been Steve Edwards, but
AM-1150 found itself unable to pay him enough after a recent
tryout. Woulda, coulda . . let's just skip it. &QL; 
__ 2. (tie) John Ireland and Derrick Hall, AM-1150 weekday
mornings: Ireland's energy and Hall's sense of humor (a nice change
from the abrupt wake-up call that Steve Mason used to deliver) make
this a can't-lose combo. Thanks to Ireland for not bailing out at
the end of '98 and to Hall for taking the plunge into the exciting
world of radio after giving up his cushy day job shoveling Dodgers
propaganda. &QL; 
__ 4. Newy Scruggs, AM-1150 weekday afternoons: He works it nonstop
from the TV and radio end with an in to many athletes who matter. A
logical choice for the station based on his fill-in work for Jim
Rome. &QL; 
__ 5. Ross Porter, AM-1150 Dodgers talk: Last year put him through
the royal-blue test, and his commentaries, especially the
year-ender, pulled no punches. Longevity has its benefits. &QL; 
__ 6. Steve Hartman, XTRA-AM (690) weekday afternoons: You don't
realize how strong he is until you understand it's because he has
to carry his partner on his back three hours a day. &QL; 
__ 7. Brian Golden, KAVL-AM (610) weekday mornings: Gotta admit,
the switch to 4-to-6 a.m. doesn't give him much exposure, but he's
able to pull it off. &QL; 
__ 8. Irv Kaze, KIEV-AM (670) Friday evenings: Week in and week
out, the guests are top-notch. He's on Saturday mornings (11
a.m.-to-noon) the next few weeks. &QL; 
__ 9. (tie) Ben Maller and Dave Smith, AM-1150 weekday afternoons:
For a coupla going-nowhere buffoons, they'll grow on you.
Eventually. It is hoped. &QL; 
__ Honorable mention: Ron Kovack, AM-1150 weekend fishing show;
Chick Hearn, KLAC-AM (570) Lakers talk; Ira Fistel, KRLA-AM (1110)
overnights (back on the air to arbitrate Ted Williams-vs.-Joe
DiMaggio debates); Jeff Biggs, AM-1150 fill-in; Chris Elho, XTRA
fill-in (still doesn't get enough work), Steve Kim, AM-1150 fill-in
(what happened to the boxing show?); Sean Salisbury and John
Fricke, XTRA weekday mornings. &QL; 
__ Special recognition: Jimmy ``The Sports Guy'' Kimmel, KROQ-FM
(106.7) morning sports reports. &QL; 
SYNDICATED ALTERNATIVES &QL; 
__ 1. Jim Rome, AM-1150 and XTRA-AM (690) weekday midmornings:
``The Jungle'' has spawned a Rome CD and boosted the career of
comedian Jay Mohr. Rome's star, somehow, keeps ablazin'. &QL; 
__ 2. Peter Brown, KCTD-AM (1540) weekday afternoons: It's the
attitude paired with knowing what he's talking about that sells
it. &QL; 
__ 3. Scott Ferrall, AM-1150 weeknights: He's slowed down a bit _
and finally we're able to figure out what he's saying. &QL; 
__ 4. John Renshaw, KCTD-AM (1540) weekday mornings: Loud,
obnoxious and endearing. &QL; 
__ 5. Bob Berger and Bruce Murray, KCTD-AM (1540) weekends: During
NFL season, their whip-around-the-stadiums show is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
__ 1. Lee Hamilton, XTRA-AM (690) weekday afternoons: If you're not
part of the nitwit-protection program, why not just use your real
name and get over your phony self? &QL; 
__ 2. Bill Werndl, XTRA-AM (690) weekday afternoons: We've had our
fill of ``Phillie Billy'' and we're fed up. &QL; 
__ 3. Geoff Witcher, AM-1150 Dodger talk: Has already reached the
zenith of a mediocre run. &QL; 
__ 4. Dave Denholm, AM-1150 weekday afternoons: Soon as you're
through being star struck, let us know. &QL; 
__ 5. John ``The Coach'' Kentera, XTRA-AM (690) weeknights: His
radio career continues to defy logic. &QL; 
__ Horrible mention: Vic ``The Brick'' Jacobs and Karl Malone, for
their three-month abuse of the airwaves during the NBA lockout.
Jacobs, the Melrose Larry Green of radio, has been relegated to
updates; Malone has his old job back. Let this be a lesson to any
out-of-touch, publicity-seeking program director: Don't add to the
brain rot that can be sports-talk radio. &QL;

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   President Clinton's proposal to use federal education funds to
hold public schools accountable drew a mixed reaction from
Republicans and educators Monday. While almost all said they shared
his goals, some opposed his means: the increased role of the
federal government in local schools.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, expected to be prominent in Clinton's State of the
Union speech Tuesday night, would financially reward school
districts that adhere to federal guidelines that will be drafted on
the training of teachers, enforcing of classroom discipline and the
ending of the promotion of unqualified students, and financially
penalize schools that fail to meet the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability has become the focus of many politicians and
educators who favor increasing funding to schools that produce
results. But the president is likely to run into strong opposition
from many Republicans who argue that the federal government should
leave these matters to the states and local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has proposed a national school board,'' charged
Lamar Alexander, the former education secretary and Tennessee
governor, who is expected to seek the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000. ``But we should go exactly in the opposite
direction, liberating the schools, not regulating them. We should
send the money to the parents and let them choose where their
children attend school.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Chavez, president of the conservative Center for Equal
Opportunity and a former senior official in the Reagan
administration, disagreed. She said it was a fine idea to tie
accountability to funding since currently it is generally the
schools that fail that receive more aid, not those that succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see success rewarded and I say that as long as there
are federal dollars going in to the school system, keeping it
accountable is a good idea,'' she said. ``I don't see any point in
being overly ideological on this question of local control. I would
urge Republicans to do what they did with welfare control _ seize
on it and take it further.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton failed to persuade Congress to authorize
uniform testing of fourth and eighth graders and win money for
fixing up schools in disrepair, in both cases because Republicans
argued these should be handled locally. On the other hand, they
agreed on a plan to spend $1 billion to help local districts hire
100,000 more teachers by compromising on how the money would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aid to education is quite limited, amounting to some 7
percent of overall spending on schools. It comes largely through
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965
and due to come up for renewal this year. It is likely to be a
contentious debate. Some $8 billion is disbursed to poor schools
through the act and conservatives have expressed doubts about the
effectiveness of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alexander, some conservatives have been arguing that the
public school system needs to be drastically altered through the
introduction of charter schools and the use of vouchers, which give
public funds to parents who can use them to send them children to
private schools if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Urbanski, president of the Rochester Teachers Association
and a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers, said
Clinton's proposal, which he enthusiastically supports, was an
effort to combat the growing voucher and charter movements by
improving all public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers and charters are most likely to thrive when there is
no accountability, when there is no way to determine whether public
schools are succeeding,'' he said. ``President Clinton is sending
the message that public schools are salvageable. The best way to
restore confidence in public schools is to get better results in
public schools. And that comes about through tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal calls for schools to meet several
criteria or lose their grants under the federal aid program:
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools would have to end what is called ``social promotion,''
or moving pupils to the next grade irrespective of their
performance;
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools would have to increase the quality of teachers by
insisting on ongoing training for experienced teachers and high
scores on tests for new ones;
</P>
<P>
   _ States would have to identify low performing schools, work to
improve them through teacher training and focus on discipline and,
if all else fails, deprive them of funds;
</P>
<P>
   _ States would have to distribute to all parents annual report
cards for each school and school district;
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools would have to adopt tough discipline policies such as
uniforms, enforcing truancy laws and imposing curfews.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states have already adopted some or all of these
approaches and the president's advisors say his plan aims to
complement and enforce their efforts rather than supplant them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that states and school districts must be
accountable in helping all students reach high standards,''
Secretary of Education Richard Riley told journalists at a
Washington briefing Monday. ``It's really a way to help states and
school districts see that that's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and
the Economy, which has been a strong advocate of national
standards, said it seemed to him that the argument over local
control had little meaning as long as the federal government is
spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the federal government is providing billions of
dollars to schools, taxpayers will reasonably ask what they are
getting for their money,'' he said. ``This should be a proposal
that Republicans who are so interested in results can embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Glenn, a professor of education policy at Boston
University who for 21 years directed urban education for the state
of Massachusetts, said there was good reason to be concerned about
more federal regulations on local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a terrific idea but unanticipated consequences
crop up,'' he said. ``I consider federal funds to be an awkward
instrument for these policies. This will tie the hands of folks at
the local level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester E. Finn, Jr., an assistant secretary of education under
President Reagan, said he did not see how the federal government
could ``micromanage 15,000 school districts. The test of this
debate will be to see whether Republicans have a better idea how to
do this.''

INTERNET PROVIDER PLANS SERVICE FOR HIGH-SPEED WEB USERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snap, an Internet provider partly owned by NBC, has developed a
service that is tailored for the small but growing number of users
who have high-speed connections to the World Wide Web. An
announcement is expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed service, called Cyclone, has lined up partners
including telecommunications carriers like Bell Atlantic, GTE and
SBC Communications and online programmers offering a variety of
information on travel, personal finance and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed connections promise television-style video and
high-fidelity audio over the Internet, but fast communications
links have so far been expensive and scarce, confined mainly to
corporate users. At the end of last year, roughly 500,000
households had high-speed cyberspace connections using cable modems
or the telephone technology known as asymmetric digital subscriber
lines, or ADSL.
</P>
<P>
   Snap is now an also-ran among the so-called Web portals that
offer everything from search functions to e-mail to a wide range of
online programming. Yet though it trails well behind America
Online, Yahoo, MSN, Netscape and Excite, Snap has tripled its reach
since NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., bought a 19 percent
stake last June from Snap's parent company, Cnet Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Snap has forged close relations with some major phone companies,
and it is hoping to get a lift as the phone companies increasingly
offer customers connections 50 to 200 times as fast as is possible
using conventional phone lines. In the industry, high-speed links
are often called broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a heavy commitment to broadband because we think
this is the year broadband becomes real,'' said Cnet chief
executive Halsey Minor. ``We want to be there first.''
</P>
<P>
   All the major Web portals are working on developing high-speed
services, which are expected to be offered this year. But analysts
say that Snap's Cyclone, which plans to begin this quarter, is an
early stake in the high-speed niche of the Internet service market.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, America Online announced an agreement with Bell
Atlantic for offering high-speed connections to Bell Atlantic's
online subscribers for an additional $20 a month. High-speed access
typically costs an extra $40 or so a month.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, about 2 million of the nation's 100 million households
will have high-speed connections, according to projections by
Forrester Research Inc. ``As a mass market offering, broadband is
still on the fairly distant horizon,'' said Kate Delhagen, an
analyst at Forrester. ``But things like the America Online
announcement could speed up the adoption rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group,
estimates that it may take five years to enroll 8 million American
households in the use of high-speed services. ``But afterward,
usage will really jump quickly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The big regional phone companies have ambitious plans for
offering households high-speed connections. SBC, for example, plans
to offer high-speed service to 8.2 million residential customers,
mainly in the Southwest, by the end of this year. Bell Atlantic,
the local phone company in New England and the mid-Atlantic states,
says its high-speed service should be available to 7.5 million
homes by the end of this year and reach 14 million by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the most common benefit of high-speed access is not
having to wait so long for Web pages to appear. But with a service
tailored for high-speed users like Snap's Cyclone, Minor said that
consumers could get such things as video clips of travel
destinations or video previews of an evening's television programs,
delivered over the Internet.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON ADDRESS POSES THORNY PROBLEM FOR REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Miss., Wyo.) (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LOBBY, IMPEACH-SANTORUM) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A telling sign of the impeachment troubles
confronting the Republicans is that they are so fearful of ceding
the White House and the Democrats a political advantage that they
would not dare boycott President Clinton's State of the Union
address on Tuesday night, though some considered doing so. This is
no time to seem whiny or pettily partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders seem trapped. They are struggling to lure the
impeachment genie back into the bottle, but they have had no
success yet. Many in the party hope that by the 2000 elections,
voters will have long forgotten impeachment. But they concede that
the longer the matter drags out, the more the party is bedeviled.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, tried mightily to
avert a full impeachment trial, but failed. Lott's critics say his
predecessor, Bob Dole, a decided pragmatist, would never have let
the matter veer out of control that way. Others call that judgment
unfair, saying the maneuvering over the president's fate is so
huge, so politically complex, that its outcome is far beyond any
one person's control.
</P>
<P>
   Within the party, ``you've got the pragmatists who say, `Look,
we don't have the votes to convict this guy, so let's just stop it
before we do any more damage to the party,''' said Tony Fabrizio, a
Republican pollster. ``You've got the principled side, they're
saying, `This guy should go,''' and that shutting down the
impeachment case would only infuriate the party's base of
conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so who is right?'' Fabrizio said. ``They're both right.
The question is, Who wins the struggle?''
</P>
<P>
   The real winner _ if such a notion is possible _ may well be the
Democrats. For now, at least, it appears that a Republican in a
competitive 2000 race who votes to convict Clinton could suffer
more political damage than a Democrat who votes to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans liken their current circumstances to an
intractable and unpopular war: there seems no way out, and,
ultimately, no one can declare a satisfying triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dance that doesn't end,'' said Alex Castellanos, a
veteran Republican media consultant. ``The biggest price we're
paying for this is the failure to advocate our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that even if Clinton had never met Monica S.
Lewinsky, the Republicans would still be on the defensive in
matters of public policy. A survey released Monday by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press found that the
Democrats held a huge advantage over Republicans on the public's
top-priority issues, from improving education to protecting Social
Security to regulating managed health care. On the Republicans'
favorite issue, tax cuts, 45 percent of Americans say the Democrats
have the best ideas; only 32 percent say Republicans do.
</P>
<P>
   Some White House officials are boasting that the address on
Tuesday night could further lift Clinton's own already impressive
poll numbers. The Pew survey found that the public was no less
critical of the Senate Republicans' handling of impeachment than of
the House's. Americans gave congressional Republicans a 32 percent
approval rating for their conduct of the investigation; Democrats
got 44 percent on the issue. The survey, of 1,200 adults from last
Thursday through Sunday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond what seems to be a collective decision to show up for the
State of the Union, Republicans find themselves debating how they
ought to behave once they get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Clinton's chance to put the Republicans in a no-win
position,'' said John J. Pitney Jr., a former Republican Party
official who is now a political science professor at Claremont
McKenna College in California. ``If they cheer and applaud, they
look like wimps. And if they sit in silence, they look like
jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House seemed gleeful as it plotted to put the
Republicans' predicament _ and the president's political skills _
to their best advantage. One option that was considered was to ask
the parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was
slain in Wyoming last year, to sit in the box with Hillary Rodham
Clinton as a way to promote hate crimes legislation. But White
House officials decided that such a move would, as one of of them
put it, appear too much like an ``in your face'' dig at
Republicans, many of whom have opposed such bills.

DIMAGGIO LEAVES HOSPITAL FOR HOME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 99 days in a South Florida hospital and numerous
predictions of his hopeless condition and impending death, Joe
DiMaggio went home Monday. Since entering the hospital in Hollywood
on Oct. 12, he has undergone lung cancer surgery, nearly succumbed
to infectious pneumonia four times, received last rites, had a Do
Not Resuscitate order posted on his bed and awakened from a coma.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, hearing of the unexpected recovery, said he
was hoping to watch DiMaggio at Yankee Stadium, throwing the first
ball of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's recovery, together with my reconciliation with Yogi
Berra, are great news,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Personally, for me,
and for the New York Yankee fans, this is a great moment in Yankee
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, the player's lawyer and confidant, said
DiMaggio was also looking forward to throwing out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it won't happen,'' Engelberg said. ``But I want to
try.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, 84, barely skirted death several times during his stay
at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. Engelberg gave the
credit for the recovery to Dr. Earl Barron, who administered the
antibiotic Refampin intravenously. The doctor gave the credit to
Dr. Nelson Zyde, an infectious disease specialist, who suggested
the drug be administered intravenously, allowing it to be absorbed
into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved his life,'' Engelberg said of Barron. ``Joe was dead
on Dec. 11. I had my plane tickets to his funeral. He brought him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio is considered heroic by both baseball fans and many not
in the world of baseball. He hit in a record 56 consecutive games
during his career, and in 1969 was voted the greatest living
player. Among those too young or too uninterested in sports to know
about his playing, he is widely seen at a rare example of honesty
and decency.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nachio, DiMaggio's friend for 56 years, who has been in
Florida for the last two weeks visiting him, said DiMaggio was
still in a delicate condition. His doctors felt the move to his
home near Fort Lauderdale would ``boost his morale.'' But he will
need round-the-clock nursing care for the foreseeable future,
Nachio said. &QL;

LOUISIANA TECH EXTENDS CONNECTICUT'S MISERY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSTON, La. _ Svetlana Abrosimova, star of the second-ranked
Connecticut women's basketball team, sat weeping at an interview
table afterward. Shea Ralph, the Huskies' junior guard, talked
about the team's urgent need to play as cohesively as it practices.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Geno Auriemma knew this trip would be instructive, but
even he might not have been ready for the fallout from
fourth-ranked Louisiana Tech's 90-74 victory over the Huskies
Monday before a crowd of 6,949 at the Thomas Assembly Center. It
was Connecticut's second loss in four games after a 13-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma sought the game with Louisiana Tech, which, with three
national titles and nine Final Four appearances, is a staple of the
women's game. It was his version of tough love, wanting to toughen
his players for future playoff-caliber opponents. But in one way,
Auriemma did not learn much Monday. With three freshmen and a
sophomore in his starting lineup, he worried about his team's
immaturity. And he was still worrying afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are lacking that solid thinking that comes from
playing together a long time,'' he said. ``Like when it was 60-59,
nobody was saying, `Here's what we are going to run.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Huskies were giving the Lady Techsters (14-2) all
they could handle until 11 minutes 8 seconds remained in the
nationally televised game. Abrosimova, who had a team-high 24
points, scored on a drive but missed the free throw that would have
tied the game, leaving the score at 60-59. Louisiana Tech _ which
has now won 57 of its last 58 home games _ reeled off the next 8
points and did not look back.
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova committed two of her 10 turnovers during that
stretch. ``I make a lot of mistakes,'' she said. ``Two in a row,
three in a row, all easy layups. And I did not look for a screen on
my shots. I was trying to do things by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears trickled down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your fault,'' said Ralph, slapping Abrosimova's
thigh. ``We just didn't work together as a team. We have to start
playing more like we practice, and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech had centered a 25-year celebration of its program
around this weekend, and many former players attended Monday's
game. Venus Lacy, who most recently played for Nashville in the
ill-fated American Basketball League, was underneath one basket
shouting at Connecticut's players whenever they came within
earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma knew that many of his players were not accustomed to
facing such a talented opponent, but he said they had to see for
themselves what they could or could not do.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench during the game, Auriemma turned to his starting
point guard, the freshman Keirsten Walters, and said, ``You're
trying to be great before you become good.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters had been able to make long passes for easy layups
against most teams, but, as Auriemma said, ``She didn't have
Tamicha Jackson playing free safety.'' Louisiana Tech's Jackson
made five steals and contributed a game-high 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the heart and the energy today,'' Tech Coach Leon
Barmore said. ``In our games before this, we'd have two playing and
three taking the night off. We haven't had it from start to finish
from all five players all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma, whose team missed 15 of 35 free throws, is hoping his
players become more coachable now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these players want to believe in themselves so much
that they won't listen,'' he said. ``That's one reason we
self-destruct at times. But now they know I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Asjha Jones played just 14 minutes, because of foul
trouble and because Auriemma believed she had freshman jitters.
``She was out of it, hesitant,'' he said. ``You could tell by
looking at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma determined after the game that another starter, the
freshman Swin Cash, would no longer play until the stress fracture
of her right shin had healed. Cash started Monday, scoring just 3
points in 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done until she's 100 percent ready to go,'' he said.
``It doesn't do anybody any good to play two minutes here and two
minutes there.'' &QL;

RUSSIAN BIOLOGIST DENIES WORK IN IRAN ON GERM WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Russian biologist in Iran has denied conducting research that
could have helped the Soviet Union or Iran develop germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The biologist, Dr. Valery Bakayev, said in a brief telephone
interview that while he has worked at the Pasteur Institute in
Tehran for more than five years, his work has focused solely on the
civilian development of vaccines against diseases like tuberculosis
and on other nonmilitary research. He denied having worked in any
offensive germ warfare program for the Soviet Union or Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Dec. 8 that the government of
Iran is seeking to recruit Russian scientists to help it develop
biological, nuclear and chemical weapons, and that Iran had hired
several scientists once associated with institutes that were part
of the Soviet Union's germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The article mentioned Bakayev and Vladimir Rishinski as two
Russian scientists who had once worked for such institutes and who
are now conducting research in Iran. They could not be reached for
comment before the article was published.
</P>
<P>
   After the article appeared, Bakayev denied in an interview with
MSNBC any prior or current participation in the development of germ
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said he ``can firmly deny'' that any Russian scientists he
knows ``took part in any illegal activity related to germ warfare
production.''
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview, Bakayev said he could not elaborate
on his statement or provide more details about how he came to work
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Both a senior defector from the Soviet Union's germ warfare
program and Western officials identified the institutes for which
Bakayev and Rishinski once worked as having been part of the Soviet
Union's germ warfare effort.

   NEW YORK _ A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of millions of
women who have purchased Nine West shoes at the nation's large
department stores, claiming that the giant footwear company
conspired with the stores to illegally fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit _ which seeks class-action status _ alleges that
since 1988, Nine West Group executives have met with managers from
the department stores to agree on the prices they would charge for
the company's 12 brands of shoes. Nine West and the stores have
then monitored each other, the lawsuit alleges, so that prices are
not lowered from those agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to the suit filed Wednesday by the New
York law firm of Abbey, Gardy &AMP; Squitieri in U.S. District Court in
White Plains, N.Y., is that women paid more for Nine West shoes
than they would have if the hundreds of department stores and Nine
West's own retail stores had competed on price.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West, based in White Plains, said that it did not believe
the lawsuit would significantly affect the company or its financial
results based on its ``existing policies relating to resale pricing
and the limited information available.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that at least two state attorneys general
were investigating its pricing policies. It did not disclose the
states. The company had earlier acknowledged that the Federal Trade
Commission was investigating its pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Bedol, Nine West's general counsel, said Monday that the
company had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The department stores named in the lawsuit include Federated
Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bon
Marche; May Department Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor; Dayton
Hudson Corp., which owns Marshall Fields; Dillard's Inc.; and
Nordstrom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke White, a spokeswoman for Nordstrom, said that the company
would contest the suit. ``It is our policy to not have any
conversation about price or sale-date setting or other competitive
matters with any other retailers,'' Ms. White said. ``We play no
part in determining what vendor-suggested retail prices are.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated, said that the company
did not comment on pending litigation. ``We clearly, most
certainly, do not engage in price-fixing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at both Dayton Hudson and May Department Stores said
the companies did not wish to comment on the lawsuit. Officials at
Dillard's could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal antitrust laws, it is illegal for two or more
companies to agree on the minimum retail prices they will charge.
But several recent court decisions have weakened the law's
protections for consumers. For example, the courts have ruled that
it is not illegal for a distributor to demand that stores follow
its price list and then to cut off shipments to those stores that
do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells hundreds of millions of dollars of shoes to the
department stores each year. While it does not disclose sales to
each store, its 1997 annual report said Federated was its largest
wholesale customer, making up 12 percent of its net revenue, or
about $224 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells shoes at its own retail stores and to
other independent shoe stores. In shopping malls around the
country, the small shoe stores are often located near the
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which says it sells one of every 5 pairs of shoes
that American women buy, offers 12 brands, including Easy Spirit,
Enzo Angiolini and Bandolino.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, at least four times a year,
high-ranking representatives from the department stores meet with
Nine West's management in New York and agree on the minimum prices
they will charge. By the end of those meetings, the lawsuit claims,
Nine West and the department stores have agreed to a list of
minimum prices.

METS NEAR PACT WITH WATSON AND SIGN NOMO
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets on Monday virtually completed a deal with
Allen Watson, a free-agent pitcher, and reached agreement with
Hideo Nomo, one of their six players who had filed for salary
arbitration. They announced the Nomo signing and were expected to
announce Watson's Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A person with knowledge of the Watson negotiations said the Mets
and the left-hander agreed to a one-year contract with an $800,000
salary, part of it guaranteed, and a series of incentives that
could earn him a maximum of $1.75 million. Watson, 28, earned $2.9
million last year with the Anaheim Angels, who made him a free
agent last month when they did not tender him a contract. A starter
exclusively until last season, when he also relieved, Watson will
have to overwhelm the Mets in the spring to win a spot in a
rotation filled with Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, Nomo and
Masato Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Nomo will be better because he will be fully recovered
from elbow surgery he had in October 1997, the Mets gave him a
$2,925,000 salary for 1999, a raise from $2.8 million last season. &QL;

JARVIS CALM ABOUT ST. JOHN'S TOUGH 10-DAY SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis was sounding serene
Monday, not at all like a coach about to take his team into a
10-day stretch that could either vault it into the stratosphere of
college basketball or send it plunging in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup is a sadistic schedule maker's dream: Wednesday at
Providence, the surprise of the Big East season at 12-5 over all
and 5-3 in the conference; Sunday, Duke, the nation's No. 2 team
with the country's most terrifying player, Elton Brand, in Madison
Square Garden; Jan. 27 at Syracuse, a top-20 team and the Big
East's best defensive squad, in the cacophonous Carrier Dome; and
Jan. 30, Connecticut, merely the No. 1 team in the country, with a
New York fan base so large that it nullifies the home-court
advantage St. John's has in their matchup at the Garden. If that
isn't enough, Miami, the only Big East team to beat the Red Storm
this season, will be at the Garden on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's (15-3 and 6-1) is back in the top 10 this week and
playing, by Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim's admission, much better
than anyone in the Big East expected. Barring a calamitous
collapse, the Red Storm is headed to March Madness, a soothing
tonic for any coach. But Jarvis sounds so calm, even as fans snap
up tickets for the Duke and Connecticut games, you wonder if he has
willfully misplaced his copy of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great we're in this position, where we're going
to go through a stretch with such diverse teams,'' Jarvis said.
``Those are the types of stretches that turn young men into men and
prepare you for the real deal, which is the Big East tournament and
the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say the whole season hinges on these next two weeks.
That's totally ridiculous. Teams have gone through stretches like
this and won all the games and then got knocked out of the
tournament in the first round. You don't know what real effect
these games have on you until it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   And, these games may be less of a barometer than what they
seemed even a week ago. With the senior forward Tyrone Grant's
sprained right wrist still swaddled in a soft cast _ he was to be
re-evaluated Monday after the wrist swelled over the weekend _ it
was difficult to make an accurate evaluation of how St. John's
compares with the elite teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although Providence is small and quick with no true big men,
much like St. John's, the rest of the teams in the brutal schedule
have giants who are crucial to their teams. Duke's Brand, Syracuse
center Etan Thomas and Connecticut's Jake Voskuhl can all lord over
the paint, and if Grant is out or at best limited, St. John's will
have to get by on speed _ and some guile _ if it is to emerge with
at least a few victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find teams' weaknesses and expose them,'' St.
John's forward Ron Artest said. ``We'd love to have Ty. But if we
play smart, we can still win the games. They might try to expose us
without Tyrone, but they've got to stop the other four of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis isn't particularly cowed by a lack of size, largely
because St. John's took Stanford, with its towering post players,
to the wire before losing by 2 points in November, when the
Cardinal was ranked No. 2. That near miss and a 1-point loss two
nights later to Purdue, then ranked No. 11, began the talk at St.
John's of a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The talk will explode into a roar if the Red Storm upsets one of
the coming behemoths. The outcome against Providence, Jarvis
figures, will have almost no impact on the mood of his team
entering the three big games. While he concedes that neither he nor
his players will be able to view Duke in quite the same way that
they anticipate, say, Rutgers, Jarvis is trying hard to maintain
the balance of a fine sailor, not letting the winds of the next few
games blow his ship either too high or low. Right now, St. John's
is as even-keeled as its coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about going into the stretch,'' Jarvis
said. ``I'm thinking about a phase of the season. There are four
phases within a season: the preseason, the regular season, the
league tournament and the NCAA tournament. We're in the regular
season, and I'd give us a solid B. The professor would be pleased
with the progress. We're above average, I think. But B also isn't
good enough. You want to be better than above average.'' &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, lawyers for Swiss private banks and
Jewish Holocaust survivors and victims' families will probably sign
a legal agreement committing the banks to pay a settlement of $1.25
billion, with an additional $200 million in humanitarian payments
to indigent Holocaust survivors. The settlement will provide some
justice to survivors and close a long argument over the complicity
of Swiss banks, which helped finance the Nazi war effort and, when
it was over, refused to return deposits by Holocaust victims to
their families. It could not have happened without the efforts of
Stuart Eizenstat, a long-serving U.S. government official who has
brought a rare degree of energy and attention to these difficult
matters.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Eizenstat has spent the last few years
unearthing unpleasant but important truths about the Nazis'
financial dealings with the rest of the world, including the
handling of looted gold. First as under secretary of commerce and
more recently as under secretary of state, Eizenstat directed a
full exploration of Holocaust claims and has managed virtually
every aspect of a web of complex issues, from arranging diplomatic
conferences on looted art to supervising settlement negotiations on
Swiss bank dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, his office cut through a fog of Swiss disinformation
and denial to publish a report showing that the Swiss government
knew the Nazi gold in its possession had been looted, and that it
had deliberately kept it after the war even as victims' families
tried to get it back. A year later, drawing on previously
classified U.S. archives, another report traced how other neutral
nations profited by selling strategic metals and other war products
to the Third Reich, often working through Switzerland's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The reports did not ignore episodes that reflect poorly on the
United States. After the war, America made only perfunctory efforts
to recover the German gold held by neutral nations. Washington was
more interested in building good relations with European nations as
a Cold War bulwark.
</P>
<P>
   With the banking issue essentially settled, Eizenstat's office
is beginning work on the problems of unpaid insurance policies,
looted art and real estate, and slave and forced labor. Resolving
them will help needy and aged survivors and right several
longstanding wrongs. It is not often that U.S. officials make an
effort to explore the dark corners of history and help the victims
of old injustices. Eizenstat has done both, and the country should
be grateful for his work.

CLINTON PROPOSES TAX BREAK FOR STAY-AT-HOME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 7th graf to correct employer tax credit for individuals to
$200 from $250; subs 2nd graf to clarify language. No other

(ATTN: Idaho, R.I.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will embrace an idea long favored
by conservatives and propose a tax break for parents who stay home
to care for their children, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit, up to $250 a year for each child under
age 1, is smaller than the tax breaks proposed by Republicans for
the same purpose. But the administration now accepts the Republican
argument that the government should recognize the value of services
provided by a parent, generally the mother, who forgoes paid
employment to stay home and care for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes we should respect and support parents
in whatever choices they make, whether to work or to stay at
home,'' said Bruce N. Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy
adviser. ``Mothers or fathers who stay home to raise a child need
help, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton has offered several proposals to make child
care more affordable to working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton would probably
highlight his child care proposals, including the tax credit, in
his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday. Republicans
led by Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island proposed a similar tax
credit last year, and they intend to try again this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White House officials said, Clinton will propose a
tax credit to encourage small businesses to provide health
insurance to employees. Under the proposal, employers with fewer
than 50 workers could get the tax credits for two years if they
established or joined a purchasing coalition to obtain health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would receive a tax credit of $500 a year for each
family insured through a coalition, and $200 for each person
covered as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses are much less likely than big companies to
provide health insurance to their employees, in part because the
premiums are higher and the costs less predictable. Small
businesses have generated most of the nation's new jobs, and this
helps explain why the ranks of the uninsured are growing even as
the nation's economy expands and employment rises to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 million people are uninsured and work for companies
with fewer than 25 employees. They account for nearly half of all
uninsured workers and nearly one-fourth of all people without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the tax break for small businesses
would cost $44 million over five years. It would be available only
to companies that did not provide health benefits to employees in
1997 or 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit for stay-at-home parents is part of a
package of measures to subsidize child care that would cost more
than $18 billion over five years. The tax credit would cost $1.3
billion over five years and would benefit 1.7 million families, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in the package would give additional tax relief
based on income and child care expenses to working parents, to help
offset child care costs, and would expand the main federal program
that subsidizes child care for families so poor that they pay no
taxes.
</P>

   Most of the child care proposals, aside from the assistance for
parents who stay home, were included in Clinton's budget last year.
He announced the proposals with fanfare at the White House in
January 1998, but he did not fight hard for them on Capitol Hill.
The proposals died in Congress, in part because their financing was
linked directly to a big tobacco bill, strenuously opposed by the
tobacco industry. There will be no such link this year.

<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the president's proposals on child care and
health insurance were intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``We have two questions. Is the White House
inviting the Internal Revenue Service deeper into people's lives by
complicating the tax code? Is the Clinton administration paying for
its initiatives by raising taxes on the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans last year faulted Clinton for not proposing
assistance to parents who stay home to care for children. The
criticism came from moderates like Chafee and conservatives like
Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho. ``The government should not
discriminate against parents who decide to stay home and take care
of their kids,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the administration has decided to seek a
substantial increase in federal grants to the states for services
to people with severe mental illnesses. The grants would total $358
million, an increase of $70 million, or 24 percent, over this
year's level.

NBC'S NEW ENTERTAINMENT CHIEF LEFT HOLDING THE BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Let's say you've just been given the keys
to a new car and the wheels fall off, the doors spring loose from
their hinges, the hood and trunk fly open, the radiator spews a
gusher and a dead weight drops onto the roof.
</P>
<P>
   You might know how it feels to be Scott Sassa, hired in October
as president of NBC Entertainment. Regrettably for him, lemon laws
don't apply to the television business.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, a few weeks shy of his 40th birthday and the first Asian
American to rise so far in American television, is the front end of
an NBC executive switch.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced Warren Littlefield, but Sassa actually is in
training to take Don Ohlmeyer's job as NBC's West Coast president.
Garth Ancier, lately of WB notoriety, is expected to slide in under
Sassa as NBC's programming goat _ er, chief.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer is still around, but he seems to have burrowed into a
hole someplace in Burbank. Right now, Sassa is the only available
executive face on a deepening disaster created by his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Where to start? There was NBC's stunning largesse in agreeing to
pay $13 million an episode for ``ER,'' and in enriching Paul Reiser
and Helen Hunt to sustain the creatively exhausted and
ratings-impaired ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the '98-'99 season-to-date ratings, which place NBC in
an aerial state known as free fall: a 15 percent decline in
prime-time ratings; a 20 percent decline among viewers in the key
18-to-49 demographic bracket; a full-scale break in the dam on
Tuesday nights, where NBC removed ``Frasier'' and recorded a 25
percent ratings drop; a scary 16 percent post-``Seinfeld'' ratings
tumble on Thursdays, the night that pays the mortgages at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the National Basketball Association lockout wounded the
league's broadcast partner, NBC. And Michael Jordan decided to
retire, taking with him any of the NBA's remaining television
luster. And the National Football League said adios to NBC. And now
there's an Olympics scandal _ guess who televises the next five
Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   Hard times are closing in on the dominant TV network of the
1980s and 1990s. The general reaction within this sweetly
sentimental industry is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha, couldn't happen to a
more arrogant bunch of SOBs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has been the sole profitable TV network. To remain so, it's
been trying to horn in on the potential profits of its program
suppliers. You want to be on NBC? Then pay us tribute from your
``back end,'' post-network profits. Or take your shows someplace
else, like the filthy swine you are.
</P>
<P>
   Someplace else is exactly where Warner Bros. Television, the
progenitor of ``ER,'' ``Friends'' and other NBC goodies, says it is
going these days. Tony Jonas, the president of Warner Bros.
Television, says his company has ceased bringing new projects to
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Even the press, which used to adore NBC, has soured on the
network's high-handedness. Put it this way: In a popularity
contest, NBC would be in the line of succession to serve only if
Saddam Hussein were unable to fulfill his duties.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's Sassa's inheritance. Sassa, who built most of his
solid reputation at Turner Broadcasting _ cable, in other words _
began his maiden Television Critics Association press conference
with a slide show about how wonderful NBC is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hemorrhaging ratings points, and it has fallen behind
CBS in overall household ratings. But by God, he said, NBC is still
clinging to the top spot in that 18-to-49 demographic. Also, some
people are watching ``Jesse.'' Just ask around; sooner or later
they'll admit it.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest thing Sassa did was introduce the word ``sex'' into
his presentation. The word has a magical impact on the media. With
visions of plunging necklines and rapt readers flooding their
skulls, many reporters promptly forgot about plunging ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said he'd like to dial down the emphasis on sex in NBC
sitcoms, to ``use a few more words between `Hello' and `Will you
sleep with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. The ensuing hubbub ended with Sassa, appearing almost
desperate, assuring critics, in effect, that he's not outfitting
Jennifer Aniston with a sitcom chastity belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be very clear that I'm not saying no sex,'' said
Sassa, on a strange sort of Clintonesque note.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa also said he'd like to de-emphasize New York City as a
setting for NBC shows, reinstate a traditional dad-mom-kids show or
two on singles-happy NBC, and increase diversity in prime-time
programming.
</P>
<P>
   That last goal could prove interesting. Sassa said NBC shows
should ``accurately reflect the composition of the audience we're
serving.'' In the past few years, NBC has been whiter than Wonder
Bread in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa presumably has more in mind than sprinkling a few more
black actors onto the NBC landscape. In a conversation after his
press conference, he mentioned the huge Latino population in
California. And surely diversity should mean something for Asian
Americans, who are possibly the most neglected group on prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's own ethnic background is Japanese. He grew up in
Southern California, ``in a neighborhood where I was the only
Japanese kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sassa seemed to suggest that not too much should be expected
because of his own ethnicity. Someone in his position, he said,
requires two ``ears'' _ one personal, one professional _ in making
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Sassa will move up a corporate step and cede the
primary programming responsibility to Ancier, once Ancier is clear
of his WB contractual obligations. That will be in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier was at NBC in the early 1980s and was a protege of the
late Brandon Tartikoff. Later Ancier was programming chief at Fox,
and then at the WB. In his spare time, he invented Ricki Lake's
syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stretch to reconcile Sassa's call for more traditional
families and less sexual titillation on NBC shows with Ancier's
track record.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ancier's programming credits include ``Married ...
With Children,'' ``The Wayans Bros.'' and the steeped-in-sex
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a Sassa-Ancier team taking over for Ohlmeyer and
Littlefield, they'll be able to clean up NBC's programs while
simultaneously reversing a wild ratings skid and mending Hollywood
fences?
</P>
<P>
   That's not a parlor trick. It's a project, and one that could
take years.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Walking off Mission Street into the Beauty Bar
is a little like watching Dorothy emerge from her Kansas farmhouse
to find herself in the Technicolor Land of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   The bar's pink walls glisten beneath a light frosting of silver
glitter; its small reception area glows from lamplight bouncing off
bright, faux-leather furniture. A row of vintage hair dryers lines
the back wall, leading to an antiquated hairdresser's station,
complete with white swivel chair, mirror and an array of colorful
beauty products. Groups of well-coiffed Mission District hipsters
huddle in small groups, chatting quietly as the sound of Peggy Lee
singing ``A Hard Day's Night'' wafts delicately over the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Beauty Bar isn't a '60s hair salon that went through a
wormhole and ended up in fin-de-millennium San Francisco. It is
exactly what its name implies _ an over-21 bar that caters to
beauty, with an additional perk.
</P>
<P>
   For a mere $10, the discerning patron can sip a martini while
enjoying a manicure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we had four birthday parties in here. The place was
packed,'' says Laura Lowe, manicurist, bartender and self-styled
``girly-girl.''
</P>
<P>
   She dips a client's comely fingers into a dish of warm,
lotion-laced water. ``An Australian guy wanted a manicure, which
was kinda fun. I gave him a coat of clear polish.'' She selects a
frosty pink bottle from her supplies. It matches her client's
Cosmopolitan perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmos are a popular drink here,'' says Beauty Bar owner Paul
Devitt, 40. ``I think it's because they're so pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened two months ago, word of mouth and the occasional
ad have made the Beauty Bar a favorite hangout for young barflies
who prefer its comfortable kitsch to the frenetic clubs of 16th
Street. The enticing combo of manicures and martinis doesn't hurt,
either. Though if you want your cuticles cut, this is not the
place. They simply polish nails and massage hands.
</P>
<P>
   Devitt concocted the concept of a salon-theme bar years ago with
his partner, Deb Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beauty salon has always been a place where ladies could meet
and gossip, so it essentially serves the same function as a bar,''
he explains. ``We hoped the idea of combining the two would appeal
to women, because there are very few bars designed with women in
mind. We wanted it to be a safe, comfortable place.''
</P>

<P>
   The San Francisco Beauty Bar is Devitt and Parker's second. The
original opened three years ago in New York's East Village, in a
space once occupied by a bona fide hair salon. One of its
manicurists, an 89-year-old pro named Florence, even stayed on to
work at the bar after it was converted.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Beauty Bar was an instant success. Trend spotters
and fashion followers began packing the place on its opening night,
and it's been featured in the New York Times, the London
Sun-Herald, Vogue (``French, Italian, you name it,'' laughs
Devitt), Interview and a bevy of other fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   When Devitt decided to expand to the West Coast, he teamed up
with a San Francisco friend, Aaron Buhrz, who will take over the
new bar's operations when Devitt returns to New York in March.
After finding the perfect space, the two called for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and painter Gary Hayes, who designed the Beauty Bar's
interior, drove a U-Haul full of vintage salon equipment
cross-country from New York. After only a month of frantic
remodeling, the San Francisco Beauty Bar opened November 19. Like
its predecessor, it's enjoyed quick success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a strong connection between New York and San
Francisco,'' Devitt says. ``People are always moving back and forth
between the two cities, so there was already a crowd here who knew
about the original Beauty Bar. So they came to check out this one,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's had much trouble with the Mission District's
notoriously anti-upscale activists, Devitt shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaction has been mixed. People either love the place or they
hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Mclarney, the customer who had her nails polished to
match her Cosmopolitan, loves the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's darling. I think every beauty parlor should serve
alcohol.'' She sips her cocktail and looks around appreciatively.
``I feel like I'm on the set of `The Women.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though you'll never see the late Rosalind Russell or Norma
Shearer propped beneath the Beauty Bar's dryers, Devitt is already
expanding his concept. The Bar now offers Saturday night
mini-makeovers, body makeup and bindis, and an L.A. Beauty Bar is
in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect place to stop on your way out to the
clubs,'' Devitt says, watching another customer select a bright
vermilion polish to match her jacket. ``Just come in, get beautiful
and paint the town red.''

manicurists, an 89-year-old pro named Florence, even stayed on to
work at the bar after it was converted.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Beauty Bar was an instant success. Trend spotters
and fashion followers began packing the place on its opening night,
and it's been featured in the New York Times, the London
Sun-Herald, Vogue (``French, Italian, you name it,'' laughs
Devitt), Interview and a bevy of other fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   When Devitt decided to expand to the West Coast, he teamed up
with a San Francisco friend, Aaron Buhrz, who will take over the
new bar's operations when Devitt returns to New York in March.
After finding the perfect space, the two called for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and painter Gary Hayes, who designed the Beauty Bar's
interior, drove a U-Haul full of vintage salon equipment
cross-country from New York. After only a month of frantic
remodeling, the San Francisco Beauty Bar opened November 19. Like
its predecessor, it's enjoyed quick success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a strong connection between New York and San
Francisco,'' Devitt says. ``People are always moving back and forth
between the two cities, so there was already a crowd here who knew
about the original Beauty Bar. So they came to check out this one,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's had much trouble with the Mission District's
notoriously anti-upscale activists, Devitt shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaction has been mixed. People either love the place or they
hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Mclarney, the customer who had her nails polished to
match her Cosmopolitan, loves the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's darling. I think every beauty parlor should serve
alcohol.'' She sips her cocktail and looks around appreciatively.
``I feel like I'm on the set of `The Women.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though you'll never see the late Rosalind Russell or Norma
Shearer propped beneath the Beauty Bar's dryers, Devitt is already
expanding his concept. The Bar now offers Saturday night
mini-makeovers, body makeup and bindis, and an L.A. Beauty Bar is
in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect place to stop on your way out to the
clubs,'' Devitt says, watching another customer select a bright
vermilion polish to match her jacket. ``Just come in, get beautiful
and paint the town red.''

 Tycoon Trying Again  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
There is something very familiar about Thomas Weisel Partners, San
Francisco's newest investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The firm's Financial District headquarters crackles with the
same feverish energy as Weisel's last venture, Montgomery
Securities. Sleek young men and women dart purposefully through the
corridors, just like before. Even the contemporary American oil
paintings hanging from walls look like those at Montgomery. The
sense of deja vu is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Thom Weisel is trying to repeat the tremendous success
he had at Montgomery, the firm he started in 1971 and built into
one of largest and richest securities firms on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after leaving Montgomery, Weisel is off and running
with his new venture.
</P>
<P>
   He's raised about $65 million in capital, about half from
partners and half from outside investors. That makes the startup
about a third the size of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the city's biggest
independent investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   And he's recruited 16 partners and about 70 other employees,
with the goal of reaching 200 by next month. ``We're adding 10
people a day,'' Weisel said.
</P>
<P>
   About half, including his co-heads of investment banking and his
research director, are fellow refugees from Montgomery who
presumably will bring clients with them. Among them: star Internet
analyst David Readerman.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel sold Montgomery in 1997 to North Carolina's NationsBank
for some $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last September, he quit in anger after losing control of
the business to NationsBank's CEO, Hugh McColl, a man now well
known in San Francisco for his take-no-prisoners buyout of
BankAmerica. Under the terms of his departure, Weisel was released
from the usual prohibition on competing against his old firm.
</P>
<P>
   As Montgomery slipped from his grasp, the hard-charging Weisel,
a former bicycle and ski racer, lost his edge. Last summer, ``he
was subdued, quiet. He wouldn't say anything,'' recalled Frank
Dunlevy, a Montgomery investment banker who has joined him in his
new venture.
</P>
<P>
   The old Weisel is back. In an interview, he displayed the full
measure of aggressiveness and confidence _ qualities some have
called arrogance _ that made him perhaps the most powerful figure
in San Francisco's investment banking world.
</P>
<P>
   Bank takeovers of several of the city's leading securities
firms, including Montgomery, have caused them to neglect their
traditional clients among fast-growing small and midsize companies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Montgomery and other firms have shifted their sights to
the big, established corporations served by their banker parents,
leaving young computer, Internet, media and health care companies
ripe for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a huge opportunity,'' said Weisel, who has the
thick shock of hair, the athletic frame and set jaw of a man of
action. ``The space has been vacated by most or all the major
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Where will the firm get its business? ``I obviously have a very
long list of CEOs,'' he said slyly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising capital, doing other investment banking
work for corporate clients and selling securities to institutional
investors, Weisel's firm will run a private investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Using its own funds and money raised from clients, it will buy
equity stakes in young companies before they go public, typically
between the venture capital and IPO stages. Eventually, Weisel
said, the firm may earn up to half its profits from its
investments.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WEISEL19 (43671 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Thomas Weisel Partners doesn't have a real trading room yet _ its
state-of-the-art facility won't open until April. But it's already
doing deals.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will co-manage a $50 million initial public offering of
stock for an unidentified company in the next few weeks, Weisel
said.
</P>
<P>
   His competitors don't doubt Weisel will succeed. But they say
he's exaggerating his ability to establish his firm as a top
contender right out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they said, his limited capital will prevent him
from doing more than a few stock offerings simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always room for a very high quality player,'' said
BancBoston Robertson Stephens chief executive Michael McCaffery.
``But to duplicate the success he had at Montgomery, he has to have
a much larger organization with much more capital and much
greater'' ability to sell stock to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Weisel is already fabulously wealthy. He's
already built a business for which someone was willing to pay more
than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a wing of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
named for him. And, in September, in the midst of his showdown with
Montgomery, he married his woman friend of nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Why would he want to take on the aggravation of doing it all
again?
</P>
<P>
   Many in the gossipy world of San Francisco's Financial District
think he's out for revenge, that he's determined to punish McColl
for taking Montgomery away from him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Indeed, Weisel is free to compete with his old firm because
NationsBank allegedly broke contractual promises to let him control
key business lines. Those alleged contract violations put him in
position to get a release from the standard contract prohibitions
against competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weisel disputed the revenge stories. ``I wish them
well,'' he said about Montgomery. ``There's no animosity. I'd like
to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisel is not given to introspection. But asked why he threw
himself into his new business when there is nothing left to prove,
he turned reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I am,'' he said. ``I don't know what else to do.
I don't ever intend to retire.``

 &HT;    A day before taking office, Bush remembers King, meets with
childrenBy Ken Herman and Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who today steps into state
history and a growing national spotlight, travelled to Houston on
Monday to honor a man whose dream changed a nation and then
returned home to look out on the little faces of the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before they take the oaths of office at the Capitol,
Bush and Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry joined in a Martin Luther King
Jr. Day celebration in Houston and a children's program at Austin's
Paramount Theatre for an afternoon program of karate, science
experiments, song and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my missions as governor is to call people of good
faith, good heart and good will to unleash their compassion,'' Bush
said at a King Day celebration sponsored by the Black Heritage
Society at Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry didn't generate the applause of two hometown
Democrats _ Houston Mayor Lee Brown and local U.S. Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee _ but the crowd appreciated their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who today will become the first Texas governor sworn in
for consecutive four-year terms, said he wants individuals try to
improve their communities ``one heart, one soul, one conscience at
a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully realize one person alone can't do everything, but one
person alone can do something,'' Bush said. ``Let us remember
(King's) wisdom and his legacy. Let us remember that compassion can
overcome all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, Houstonian William Hines said he appreciated
the gesture: ``I thought what he said was good. Inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Donald Brown, a 46-year-old city worker and not a Bush
fan, said he respected Bush for coming but thought the governor had
ulterior political motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has to be other reasons for him to be here,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Bush said he went to Houston to pay tribute to
a great man, not to politicize the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his message is relevant to all of Texas. We are a
diverse state and we're going to get more diverse,'' he said. ``I
realize I didn't get a lot of the African-American vote, but I'm
still going to be everyone's governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then fielded another round of questions about his potential
presidential candidacy. He said he remains undecided, but said his
wife and twin 17-year-old daughters have understandable misgivings
about a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met one 17-year-old child who is eager to get
dragged through the national spotlight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, the first lady, followed up with the family's
standard answer to the persistent question: ``It's a huge decision
as everyone knows and we haven't made it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Undecided though he may be, Bush is planning to meet privately
in Austin Wednesday with influential potential supporters.
Spokeswoman Karen Hughes characterized the supporters as ``college
friends and old friends from Midland'' and others. She said a
similar gathering with similar guests was held a day after the 1995
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural events continue today, beginning with a private prayer
service and ending this evening with four balls. Hughes said she
had not heard if a final decision had been reached on what could be
the only mystery in a day that is scripted to the second. Bush said
recently he was undecided on whether he will hit the dance floor
tonight. He danced, briefly, at one inaugural ball in 1995, saying
it was the first time he had danced since his wedding and would be
his last dance for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush, Perry and other state officials will make
the rounds at the evening's four balls. The ``line of march'' for
the officials' grand entrance at each ball shows just how
Republican the former republic has become. House Speaker Pete Laney
is the only Democrat involved.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush takes the oath at noon today, he will become the first
Texas governor sworn in for consecutive four-year terms. Gov. Dolph
Briscoe, the last incumbent governor to be re-elected, served a
two-year term and a four-year term. The terms were changed to four
years in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But Briscoe's second inauguration day was a relatively low-key
affair, parade-free because of the energy crisis that gripped the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, energy prices again are a hot
topic around inauguration time. Now, however, the complaint is
about low prices.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas oil industry workers marched on Congress Avenue on
Monday to seek state help in boosting oil prices. They rallied near
the Governor's Mansion and called on Bush to order the Texas
Railroad Commission to limit production. Among the marchers was
Clayton Williams, the GOP's unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Herman and Dave Harmon write for the Austin
American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

 Wireless Rules At Showcase Trade Show  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Diego &QL; 
 &QL; 
If they remade ``The Graduate'' today, instead of ``plastic,''
Dustin Hoffman would be told that the word to think about is
``wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   With cellular telephone service fast becoming pervasive in
business, companies big and small are trotting out technology
designed to provide users of handheld devices with wireless access
to corporate data such as e-mail, calendars and address books.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies announced wireless products and services
yesterday at Showcase '99, an annual trade show here in San Diego
tries to spotlight the latest trends in computers,
telecommunications and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent new offerings at the show is Revolv,
the first fruit of WirelessKnowledge, a partnership between
software giant Microsoft and Qualcomm, one of the leaders in
cellular technology.
</P>
<P>
   Revolv, which is expected to hit the market this spring, will
let users of cell phones, pagers, laptop computers and personal
digital assistants such as the PalmPilot access e-mail, calendars
and contact information stored on their PCs at work over cellular
connections. They'll also be able to make changes to the data,
using what's called a ``virtual private network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time all of these different devices have
been integrated together into a single solution,'' said Tom
Clarkson, vice president of marketing for WirelessKnowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Revolv only will be able to tap into information
stored in Microsoft Exchange, a popular program for e-mail and
personal information used by many businesses. However, portable
devices don't need Microsoft software to receive the service. The
only requirement is the ability to display a graphical view. Some
cell phones and pagers as well as most PDAs and all laptop
computers can do that today.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SHOWCASE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Based in San Diego near Qualcomm, WirelessKnowledge was created
in November with $25 million each from Qualcomm and Microsoft,
which is based in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The new service will be sold by cellular carriers, including
AirTouch, AT&AMP;T, Sprint and GTE. Each carrier will set its own
pricing, which could be a flat rate similar to the $20 most
Internet services charge or on a per-minute basis, such as 10 cents
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say that affordability will be the key to
success of services such as Revolv.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who carry cell phones or pagers or
PDAs and they want to get information wirelessly,'' said Mike
Miller, editor in chief of PC Magazine. ``But they don't want to
pay ridiculous amounts for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is when will the industry reach critical mass
where the stuff works well and the price is low enough so that lots
of people will want it?'' he said, adding, ``It looks like that
will happen sometime in the next six to 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Also debuting yesterday at Showcase was a wireless network
system for small businesses from Intalk of San Jose. Dubbed InPoint
Pro, it uses a base station the size of a video game console to
connect computers within a local area network as well as letting
mobile computers link up to the network. Once connected, users at
home or on the road can have access to all the information and
applications on the network.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which is scheduled to ship this summer, will cost
about $900 for the base station and $350 for an antenna card for
each PC or laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the wireless trend is a combination cell
phone and PDA unveiled by Motorola. The six-ounce device is
actually a StarTac phone and a credit-card-size Rex handheld
organizer connected back-to-back. Motorola acquired the Rex
technology when it purchased its creator, Starfish Software, last
summer. At 4 inches tall and 1 inch thick, it's significantly
smaller than other so-called smart phones, like the Nokia 9000.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SHOWCASE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Other wireless products at the show include an appliance from
Sharewave of El Dorado Hills near Sacramento that establishes a
high-speed connection between a PC and a television. The link-up
lets you use the TV to surf the Web or play computer games.

 Sharper Image CEO Says E-Tailing Statement Wasn't Ploy to
Raise  Stock  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sharper Image chief executive Richard Thalheimer says he has every
intention of transforming his specialty retailer into a major force
in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a tremendous opportunity on the Internet for
retailers with unique content, including us,'' says Thalheimer, who
also took time to explain some insider stock selling at the San
Francisco retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Street Smarts was the first to report that Thalheimer
and other insiders had collectively unloaded nearly a half-million
of their Sharper Image shares during December.
</P>
<P>
   The insider sell-off happened to coincide with a barrage of
public relations dispatches by the company, touting Sharper Image's
e-tailing prowess during the holiday shopping season. The fact is,
less than 5 percent of the company's revenues are generated by
transactions via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Thalheimer returned telephone calls, but we
failed to connect before the column ran. When we finally caught up
with each other, he explained some of the reasons for the stock
selling and expounded on his company's plans for the Net.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Sharper Image stock had more than quadrupled from
its 52-week average to about $25 a share. The spike was triggered
by a Sharper Image press release announcing that the company
planned to launch an ``auction'' Web page. Of course, auction was
the magic word. True auction sites, such as eBay, have been
investor darlings. Part of the reason is that eBay was profitable
before going public.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image's auction is quite different, however, in that it
would merely use an Internet auction function to unload its excess
inventory. In other words, bargain shoppers can bid on Sharper
Image merchandise that has been set aside for clearance. On the
other hand, eBay is a live global auction selling a vast array of
personal wares and collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you have to hand it to Thalheimer. He cleverly helped
goose his stock higher, taking full advantage of the Internet
insanity that has enraptured the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we'll have to wait until after the end of this month
to find out if he and other insiders sold more of their holdings in
concert with that particular release.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors already seem to see through the veneer. Sharper's
shares closed down to around $15 at the close of trading on Friday.
As reported, investors and analysts applauded Thalheimer's sale
because too many of the small-cap company's shares are tied up in
his personal and family stakes, which together exceed 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CEO wanted to clarify why his top lieutenants opted
to sell. For several years, Sharper Image had struggled _ including
seven-straight quarters of losses racked up through October 1997.
However, during the past four quarters (the current period ends
January 31), Thalheimer seems to have righted the ship at the
seller of electronic gadgets and toys, steering his company back
into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he encouraged his officers to take some profits.
With Sharper's average stock price lingering under $5 a share
during much of the decade that it has been public (not including
the past two months), December's lofty stock prices offered a rare
chance for insiders to reap some rewards, Thalheimer argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people haven't had any opportunities to sell
their shares, (and) they haven't exactly received big bonuses''
over recent years, Thalheimer says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, while it is true that both the chief operating
officer and chief financial officer liquidated their entire
``vested positions,'' it was only 20 percent of their total stakes
when considering equity that has yet to vest, Thalheimer explains.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot: Certain insiders still sold every share they
possibly could, but we should wait until they receive more of their
shares to determine whether they are net holders or sellers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  And if you listen to Thalheimer, his management team could have
reason to be holders down the line. After several grueling years of
repositioning the company, which now makes and designs its own
merchandise at fatter profit margins, Thalheimer contends that
Sharper Image has the right stuff to lure cybershoppers to its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the core business has been shored up. Sales and profit
margins are up at its 90 stores (which account for about 70 percent
of revenues) and at its traditional mail-order business (which
accounts for about 25 percent of sales).
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that I have a soft spot for ``brick and mortar''
retailers in their bids to expand on to the Net. Time will tell how
earnest Thalheimer's effort is to make e-commerce the engine of his
retail operation.

   GEORGETOWN, Colo. _ Next weekend, skiers here are to inaugurate
the world's highest chair lift. Whisking 1,200 skiers an hour to a
12,700-foot ridge, the lift will offer sweeping views of the
Rockies and challenging runs down the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of changing times in the nation's most popular
skiing state, a Colorado environmentalist is suing, charging that
Loveland Ski Area, the owner of the lift, has violated its federal
permit for building on National Forest Service land.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting logging, mining and cattle grazing on National
Forest lands, environmentalists declared open season this winter on
ski areas, once a seemingly wholesome presence in the landscape.
The expansion of ski areas, mostly on public land, that once
aroused little opposition is now being fought by groups that are
angry over growing real-estate development on adjacent private
land.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly run by publicly traded corporations, ski areas are
turning to mountain real estate as a source for big profits in the
future. In contrast, the number of lift tickets sold nationwide
each winter has been stagnant for a decade, at around 53 million.
In that period, ticket sales in Colorado increased by about 20
percent, but the state has seen its ski ticket sales drop 11
percent this season as some resorts endured their scantiest
Christmas season snow in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about skiing, it is about real-estate development,''
said Jonathan Staufer, a shop owner in Vail who is chairman of the
Ski Area Citizens Coalition, a new environmental group.
``Industrial tourism is posing the next major threat to wild places
in Colorado and America.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the High Rockies, signs of growth abound.
</P>
<P>
   Directly below Loveland's new Continental Divide chair lift, but
muffled by a quarter mile of granite, traffic on Interstate 70
regularly slows to a crawl in the Eisenhower Tunnel, a major link
between Colorado's busiest ski areas and greater Denver's 2 million
people. In 25 years, traffic has quadrupled in the tunnel, 60 miles
west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the 75 miles between here and Eagle-Vail Airport, enough home
construction is planned to double the populations of several towns
in five years. A rural airstrip in 1990, the airport is Colorado's
second busiest this winter, offering direct jet service to 13
cities, including New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On public lands, recreation is shaping up as the new
battleground. In the last decade, while the volume of timber cut in
National Forests fell by two-thirds, the number of recreational
visitors jumped by 40 percent. The U.S. Forest Service predicts it
will record 1 billion recreational visits a year by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see lawsuits, not only against oil, gas and mining, but
also to stop recreational use,'' the chief of the Forest Service,
Mike Dombeck, said in Denver recently, after encountering
protesters objecting to a 2,000-acre expansion of Vail into
National Forest land.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where most skiing is done on National Forest land,
the conflict flared into the public eye in October when an
amorphous group, the Environmental Liberation Front, protested the
expansion of Vail's ski slopes by burning three buildings and
damaging four lifts.
</P>
<P>
   But in less dramatic fights, Colorado environmentalists are
lobbying federal agencies to block new ski trails at Keystone
Resort and Breckenridge Ski Resort. Nearby, at Arapahoe Basin, they
are trying to block the installation of a snow-making system that
would fulfill that area's dream of becoming the nation's first to
offer skiing year round.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, environmentalists are fighting
construction of a new ski area, Pelican Butte, in southern Oregon,
and the expansion of Snowbasin in Utah. In recent months, the
Forest Service overrode objections to the expansion of Santa Fe ski
area in New Mexico, but rejected a proposed ski area for Mount
Shasta in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Colorado, in the face of strong local opposition, a
consortium of Vermont and Colorado developers abandoned plans to
build a ski area 10 miles south of Steamboat Springs, which would
have been called Catamount. In addition to the ski slopes, the
developers planned 3,700 new homes and 1,000 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the resources and they had the permits,'' said Susan
Otis, executive director of the Yampa Valley Land Trust. ``But they
knew that in the community there no longer was a desire to have a
new ski area.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers gave the Yampa Valley trust conservation
easements preserving 3,296 acres of pasture and announced plans to
build 40 luxury houses and a lodge at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures show that Colorado has the third-fastest growing
population in the nation, after Nevada and Arizona. Now, defenders
of the fragile lands in the Rockies are also worried that
out-of-state demographic pressures will result in a proliferation
of second-home developments and swelling crowds at ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   On one end, the average age of a second-home buyer in the United
States is 51. Over the next 18 years, 78 million Americans are to
turn 51. Their children number 72 million and are expected to pack
ski areas again. The intermediate group now in their 20's and 30's
numbered only 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over land use is really just starting, because you
are talking of a burgeoning population of residents and visitors,''
said Diane Gansauer, executive director of the Colorado Wildlife
Federation, a conservation group composed largely of hunters and
anglers. ``I don't buy the view of wildlife that accepts deer as
lawn ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   At public hearings in Vail last spring, one resident drew
applause when he said, ``We want to look at trophy elk, not trophy
homes.'' At the hearings, most speakers spoke against the expansion
plans of Vail, the nation's largest ski area.
</P>
<P>
   Critics noted that within 40 miles of Vail, eight ski areas are
already operating, with 126 lifts and 850 trails covering almost
15,000 acres. Vail Resorts is expanding its ski terrain by 19
percent, even though lift ticket sales dropped 5 percent last
winter, to 1.6 million.

 Quake Insurance Shakeup  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Earthquake insurance will probably never be as cheap as it was
before the Northridge earthquake _ which was five years ago on
Sunday _ but prices are coming down this year and homeowners should
have more coverage options.
</P>
<P>
   David Knowles, incoming chief of the California Earthquake
Authority, says the prevailing view _ that coverage is grossly
overpriced and pathetically skimpy _ doesn't recognize recent
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, rates are down 18 percent since the CEA began
offering a ``minipolicy'' through two dozen member insurance
companies two years ago. In the Bay Area, rates that take effect
this spring will reflect cumulative reductions of 10 to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the CEA will unveil supplemental policies that will
let homeowners lower their deductibles from today's 15 percent to a
more palatable 10 percent and boost contents coverage to $100,000
from today's chintzy $5,000. Lastly, homeowners will be able to buy
emergency housing coverage of up to $15,000, up from today's paltry
$1,500. All these options will come at a cost, however.
</P>
<P>
   In short, prices remain higher than what homeowners want, but
the coverage is getting to look more like what the Bay Area had
before the Northridge quake lobbed a grenade into the lap of the
property and casualty insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   Premium sampler: A home east of Highway 101 in San Francisco or
on the Penisula, or across the Bay in Berkeley, Oakland, San
Leandro, Hayward or Fremont that's insured for the statewide
average amount of $194,000 (structure only) would cost $856 ($4.41
per $1,000 valuation) for the basic CEA policy, down from $1,019
($5.25/$1,000) two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Insuring that same home west of Highway 101 on the Peninsula or
in San Francisco would cost a bit less, $729 ($3.76/$1,000), down
from $1,019. In much of Marin County, the annual cost would be $369
($1.90/$1,000).
</P>
<P>
   A supplemental policy with a 10 percent deductible, $25,000
contents coverage and $10,000 living allowance would add another
$281 to the cost ($1.45/$1,000) of the minipolicy.
</P>
<P>
   Although costs for coverage have come down a bit, they remain
double what many people were paying before Northridge. The quake
produced such huge losses _ more than $12.5 billion _ that the
industry pulled back from writing homeowners insurance because
state law also required home insurers to offer earthquake
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the chaos, the CEA was created along with its elaborate
system of policy premiums, industry assessments and reinsurance _
that's insurance for insurance companies _ that are combined to
provide $7 billion worth of protection for some 950,000
policyholders today.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, a former state Assemblyman from Lake Tahoe who helped
write the legislation creating the CEA, makes it clear that there's
no going back to the good old days of broader coverage, low
deductibles and rock-bottom premiums. Farmers Insurance, for
example, thought its exposure in the Northridge area was about $100
million. It lost more than $1 billion, as it turned out, which was
more than it had derived from premiums the previous 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 99 percent of the California earthquake market consists
of the minipolicy offered through insurance companies that are
members of the CEA, or nonmembers that basically have replicated
the coverage on their own. However, two companies _ Pacific Select
Insurance Co. of Walnut Creek and Geo Vera of Concord _ have begun
offering stand-alone quake policies that depart from the
boilerplate coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Select is able to undercut earthquake authority rates by
only insuring homes that are bolted to foundations and have sheer
walls that prevent them from buckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect people to do what they can to prevent losses,'' says
Richard Campagna, chief executive of Pacific Select. ``People think
nothing of paying $1,000 or $2,000 to insure their cars, but it's
surprising how many won't spend the money to protect something 10
times as valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging competition from the outside is putting pressure on the
CEA to lower rates further, Knowles says. He knows that the CEA has
a problem on its hands. Prior to Northridge, 32 percent of Bay Area
residents had earthquake insurance. The CEA doesn't know what
percentage in the Bay Area is covered today, but industry sources
speculate that it's less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth anniversary of the Northridge quake, two days ago,
brings to mind something California needs, Knowles concludes.
</P>
<P>
   A shakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   Not a 6.7 quake like Northridge, of course. Nor a 7.1 rattler
like 1989's Loma Prieta quake that killed 64 people and cost
billions. But a ``smallish quake,'' Knowles says. ``Enough to
rattle the china and put an inexpensive crack or two in the
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles figures that a small quake would grab the attention of
California homeowners better than the television spots that the CEA
plans to introduce later this year.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to do more to improve the program, but a lot of what
happens hinges on the results of a geological survey in the fall.
The U.S. Geological Survey plans to release a lengthy
earthquake-probability study concerning the Bay Area on October 17,
the 10th anniversary of the Loma Prieta quake.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the earthquake authority must consider the ``best
available'' scientific information when setting rates. Currently,
Bay Area rates are based, in part, on a USGS presumption that
there's a 2-in-3 chance of a 7.0 magnitude quake in the next 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the new report very likely will show a greater risk of a
major quake. That's because the report will factor in faults not
even considered in 1990 report. In addition to the Hayward, San
Andreas and Rodgers Creek faults, the new study will include the
San Gregorio fault near Half Moon Bay, the Concord-Green Valley
fault, the Calaveras fault near San Jose and the Greenville fault
in the Livermore Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a big seismic stew in the Bay Area,'' says USGS
geologist David Schwartz. ``By adding more faults, we're adding
more ingredients to the stew. The bottom line is that I can't see
the earthquake-probability number getting any smaller.''

GEORGETOWN, Colo.: 1.6 million. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a company close to Vail Resorts, Turkey Creek
LLC, successfully bid $42 million for a 2,900-acre parcel of
private land that is a mile from the resort's new expanded area.
The ski company has an option to buy half of Turkey Creek.
</P>
<P>
   And Vail Resorts and Intrawest Corp., a Canadian company, are
partners in the construction of 4,600 housing units at the Keystone
ski area. Intrawest has a total $1 billion in construction planned
at the nine ski areas it owns in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is to focus on real estate, while quietly selling
some ski tickets on the side,'' said Sandy Shea, a director of High
Country Citizens' Alliance, a group that opposes a 300-home
development planned for private land next to Crested Butte Mountain
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Crested Butte offers free skiing early in the season
to fill company-owned hotel rooms, Shea added: ``I don't think any
ski area is making money off tickets. Most of the money is made
from real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Forest Service approves ski slopes near private land,
the value of the private land jumps. Looking at ski lifts that
serve mediocre slopes near vacation homes, some Colorado
environmentalists derisively call them ``real estate lifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ski-in, ski-out real estate commands a 25 percent premium,''
said Neil Adams, a real-estate broker in Crested Butte. ``When you,
your wife and your five kids decide to go skiing, do you want to
play taxi driver? Your kids can come home for lunch, no problem.
Just ski right up to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The ski industry describes as minuscule the 20,000 acres of ski
area expansions planned on National Forest lands around the nation.
About one-quarter of the nation's 525 ski areas operate on Forest
Service land, leasing about 190,000 acres out of total National
Forest holdings of 190 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that on one-tenth of one percent of Forest Service
land, 30 million people enjoy a winter recreation experience,''
said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry group based outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of a Forest Service policy in Colorado to favor
expansion of existing ski areas over the construction of new ones,
and fights waged by environmentalists against new ski areas, the
last one to open on National Forest land in the state was Beaver
Creek, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While ski areas are magnets for growth, not all of the growth in
second homes in the Colorado high country is tied to skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to other areas of Colorado, where there are no ski
areas, and trophy homes are being built,'' said Lyle Laverty, the
Forest Service's top official for Colorado. ``Part of the
attraction is being close to a National Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit against Loveland, the environmentalist, Steven
Hannon, asserts that the Forest Service awarded permit for a
1,700-foot surface lift and then allowed the ski area to nearly
triple the length of the lift and to change it to a chair lift.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Abrahamson, the general manager of the ski area, which is
fighting the suit in Federal District Court in Denver, said: ``The
Forest Service approved putting skiers on top of the ridge. We
followed the process from A to Z.''
</P>
<P>
   While ski area operators say they can work with mainstream
environmentalists, they say they are worried that the fight is
being escalated by fringe elements.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Earth First Journal, a radical publication,
applauds the arsons at Vail as ``a rational, overtly political and
defensive act undertaken by Mother Earth's freedom fighters, not
terrorists, in face of overwhelming odds.'' The newspaper also
devoted a full page to instructing readers how to make the kind of
Molotov cocktails that caused $12 million in fire damages at Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Walcher, Colorado's newly appointed director of the state
Department of Natural Resources, has watched the Rocky Mountain
economy shift dramatically to tourism from mining, grazing and
logging, partly because of environmental opposition to extractive
industries on public lands. Now he worries, he said, that: ``Some
people want to slow tourism down, then shut it down. It would be a
horrible mistake not to take them seriously.''

 How Sales Taxes Work On Internet  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently wanted to buy something by mail order, but
backed off because the retailer, which is not based in California,
insisted that I would have to pay the California sales tax. When
can a retailer do that _ and does this apply to sales on the
Internet as well?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer:  &LR; Any retailer engaged in business in California must
collect sales taxes from California customers. That includes those
that sell via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer doesn't necessarily have to be based in California
to be engaged in business here, notes Laureen Simpson, a technical
adviser with the state Board of Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   If it has a tangible presence in California, such as a factory,
warehouse or sales office, it must collect the sales tax. The rule
even applies if the seller has no people or buildings of its own
here, but contracts with a vendor in California to assemble or
install merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy from a company that is located entirely in, say,
Mississippi, that company won't have to collect sales taxes from
you.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in such cases you are legally required to pay
California a so-called use tax, which is exactly equal to the sales
tax. The only distinction between the sales tax and the use tax is
that the seller is responsible for the collection of sales taxes,
while the buyer is responsible for the use tax.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Simpson acknowledges, only a tiny fraction of
consumers actually pay use taxes. The tax is ``very difficult to
track and enforce,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Gift Tax
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to give my son $200,000 this year toward the purchase
of a house. I know I can do this without paying the federal gift
tax, because there is a $650,000 lifetime, tax-free exclusion. I've
read that the exclusion will increase in stages to $1 million in
the next few years. If I make the $200,000 gift this year, will I
be stuck with a remaining exclusion of $450,000 in future years, or
will I be able to take advantage of the future increases?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me make a nitpicking correction before I answer your
question.
</P>
<P>
   Tax law allows you to give up to $10,000 per year each to as
many individuals as you wish, without depleting your lifetime
gift-tax exclusion. That means the first $10,000 of your $200,000
gift to your son won't be deducted from your exclusion. After you
make the gift, you will have $460,000 in exclusions left, not
$450,000.
</P>
<P>
   The really good news is that you can take full advantage of
future increases in the lifetime exclusion. There is no need to
delay that generous gift to your son, if that's what you have in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The lifetime exclusion is scheduled to increase by $25,000 next
year _ to $675,000 _ so the balance of your exclusion will increase
to $485,000. The lifetime exclusion jumps again to $700,000 in
2002, $850,000 in 2004, $950,000 in 2005 and $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG (88019 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  That, at least, is what the current law mandates. There has been
talk among the Republican leadership in Congress about raising
those limits further, or eliminating the tax entirely.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Penalty
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know there is a 10 percent penalty if I withdraw money from
my Individual Retirement Account before age 591/2, and I also know
that withdrawals are mandatory starting after age 701/2. What are
the rules for people between those ages? Can they withdraw money at
random, or are they forced to follow a fixed schedule?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Random withdrawals are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   People between ages 591/2 and 701/2 can take as much or as
little as they need from their IRAs, as often or as infrequently as
they please, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
There is no fixed withdrawal schedule and no penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the first April after you turn 701/2, you must
begin withdrawing the balance of your IRA funds according to a
fixed schedule based on your life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the table in IRS Publication 590. You can order a
free copy of the publication by calling (800) 829-3676. You also
can order a copy _ or simply read it online _ on the IRS Web site
at  &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov &LR; .

 Net Shoppers' Satisfaction Slipping  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
More shoppers than ever flocked to online stores over the holidays,
but fewer were happy with their experience, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The number of satisfied Web shoppers slipped 14 percent during
the past six months _ to 74 percent _ as online consumers faced
many of the same challenges found in traditional stores: crowds,
traffic and poor service, according to the study released yesterday
by Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers surveyed cited problems with merchandise availability
(15 percent), the additional costs of shipping and handling (14
percent), and slow site performance (13 percent) as their top three
reasons for dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of retailers that launched or relaunched their
sites within weeks of the holiday season, combined with the
significant, unanticipated increase in traffic, led many sites to
under-perform,'' said rNicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst at
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   In a result that doesn't portend well for future growth of
e-commerce, only 37 percent of online shoppers indicated that they
would spend more next holiday season, 58 percent said they would
spend the same and 5 percent said they would spend less.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt said e-commerce companies, many of which spent
heavily to win over customers, will lose those customers if they
don't improve customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter said 44 percent of households with Internet access
bought products online during the holiday season. Other surveys
have pegged that number at 8 million consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter and NFO Interactive of Greenwich, Conn., surveyed more
than 2,300 Internet-connected households.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter said shoppers spent a record $3.1 billion on the
Internet in November and December. That's nearly triple 1997
spending and more than most analysts, including Jupiter, had
predicted that they would spend.

AT HOME IS EXPECTED TO ACQUIRE EXCITE IN MAJOR INTERNET DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Home Corp., a high-speed Internet service
aimed at cable television subscribers, intends to announce on
Tuesday that it will acquire Excite Inc., one of the leading
Internet destinations, in a stock transaction valued about $6
billion, according to a person involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would be one of the biggest in a flurry
of recent Internet acquisitions, exceeding even the $4.2 billion
purchase of Netscape by America Online announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies met on Monday night to work on
last-minute issues. Barring last-minute snags, an announcement is
planned in New York before the opening of the stock market. Any
deal would have to be approved by the shareholders of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies refused to comment on reports about their
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would the deal strengthen's At Home's position in the
competition for destination sites, known as portals, that is
increasingly defining the commercial Internet, but it would sharpen
the position of A.T.&AMP;T., which is now concluding its acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., At Home's major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Excite's shareholders are expected to own about 30 percent of
the combined company, which would be named At Home. George Bell,
Excite's chief executive, would take an executive position in the
merged company and join its board.
</P>
<P>
   The value of At Home's stock outstanding is about $10.4 billion,
while Excite's shares are worth a total of about $3.5 billion.
Specific details of the deal for shareholders could not be learned
Monday night. Excite's stock closed at $67.50 on Friday, while At
Home closed at $102. Stock markets in the United States were closed
on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has more 330,000 customers for its service, which
provides high-speed Internet data via cable networks. The deal
would give it access both to Excite's more than 20 million
registered users and to the company's content-development
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Both At Home and Excite! are based in Redwood City, a San
Francisco suburb on the Northern edge of Silicon Valley. The
offices of Tom Jermolak, At Home's chief executive, and Bell are
separated by a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A report of a possible deal between the two companies appeared
in The Sun Jose Mercury News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to strike a merger agreement was heightened in
recent weeks because there were several other companies interested
in bidding for Excite!, including Yahoo!, a competing large portal
and search engine, and the Microsoft Corporation, according to
people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective transaction, which is one in a series of moves
by Internet players and telecommunications companies to position
themselves for the expected next wave of Internet development based
on high speed cable and phone links. The most prominent was the
recent acquisition of Netscape Communications Corporation by
America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Snap, an Internet provider partly owned by NBC,
announced a high speed Internet service with its partners Bell
Atlantic and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T the At Home-Excite deal could ultimately help shape its
strength in a wide range of Internet services, including dialup
access via its AT&AMP;T Worldnet service, which the TCI and At Home
offering that will permit it to offer both high speed Internet as
well as local telephone services. and a new Excite brand which
could serve as both a portal and an important content brand to
rival other major Internet players such as Microsoft, Disney and
America Online.

REALTORS GROUP EXPECTS SLOWDOWN IN L.A.-AREA'S HOUSING MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bouyed by a strong economy brimming with confident
consumers, the real estate market of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley
area caught a $4 billion wave in 1998 that seems ready to break, a
trade group has announced.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be an ugly wipeout like the one that occurred in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, sales of single-family homes jumped14.7 percent to
13,242 units from the 1997 level, said the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors' report, released Monday. And the median
housing price, the point at which half the homes sold for more and
half for less, soared 14.6 percent to $190,117 from last year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the largest volume since the 15,263 units sold in 1988
and prices increased the most since the median skyrocketed $41,250
in 1989. Including condominiums, Realtors sold $4 billion worth of
properties in the Valley last year, the trade group said.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller but red-hot Santa Clarita Valley market, sales of
both single-family homes and condominiums soared 33 percent to
3,594 properties. The median single-family home price was $204,575,
up about 13 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Realtors said 1998's pace, fueled in part by low interest rates,
could be hard to maintain. So this year's sales total may end up
looking a lot like 1998's with little or no percentage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a little flatter,'' Jim Link, the
association's executive vice president, said of the 1999 market.
``My best guess is that sales will run about the same or maybe a
little less.''
</P>
<P>
   Nima Nattagh, an analyst at First American Real Estate Solutions
in Santa Ana, Calif., said that while this year will bring a
slowdown compared to 1998, it will remain a strong market
nonetheless with prices appreciating in the 5 percent to 6 percent
range. Any sales increase would be slight.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, though, continue to remain favorable and
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest rate environment is one of the things that will
remain favorable for the housing market and there is no suggesting
they will go up anytime soon,'' Nattagh said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's sales could have been even higher had there been
more properties on the market, said Beth L. Sommer, president of
the Valley's Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have been on a steady climb for the last six years, yet
no one fully predicted last year's incredible activity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the kind of year that may be in the offing arrived
during December.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, escrow closed on 1,015 single-family homes, down 12
percent from a year ago, while the median price climbed to
$198,500, up 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Realtors sold 270 condominiums, a 10.2 percent
dip from December 1997. The median price jumped 19.5 percent to
$119.500.
</P>
<P>
   While the dip is seasonal, it was the first time in 19 months
that single-family home sales fell from the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pending sales of both single-family homes and
condominiums, a leading indicator of what the months ahead will
bring, fell for the third consecutive month on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   And the market dynamics are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Sale increases during the last several years have been fueled by
first-time buyers snapping up properties at the low end of the
price scale. Last year saw sales gains across all price points,
Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the volume of sales may slow, homeowners should
continue building equity.
</P>
<P>
   When the real estate market collapsed during the early and
mid-'90s, home prices lost about 25 percent of their value.Link
estimated that up to 70 percent of that lost equity has been
recaptured in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   More ground should be gained this year, he said, but not as much
as in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see some of the breaks being applied,'' he
said of the market. ``We've reached a point where values will
continue to increase but it won't be as fast as last year.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil said on Monday that it would continue
to allow the value of its currency, the real, to be set by market
forces, abandoning a policy to support the currency, which was
draining billions from its reserves of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the currency from weakening further, the nation's
central bank raised interest rates on overnight loans on Monday,
and Pedro Malan, Brazil's finance minister, told U.S. officials in
Washington that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
administration was determined to take whatever steps were necessary
to avert a crippling new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move to allow the real to trade freely against
the dollar had lifted the Bovespa stock market index by 33.4
percent on Friday, and its announcement on Monday kindled a further
upswing, with the index rising 5.4 percent. Though U.S. exchanges
were closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, markets across Europe
rose. The real, however, fell an additional 10 percent, to 1.58 to
the dollar from 1.43 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Brazil ends a policy that had been geared toward
controlling chronic inflation by tying the currency to the nation's
dollar reserves, which kept a tight rein on the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's troubles having been raising fears of an Asian-style
collapse that could weaken economies throughout the region,
including in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A communique by the central bank said on Monday that ``as of
today,'' it would ``allow the interbank market (both free and
floating segments) to define the exchange rate.'' It added that the
central bank might intervene in the future ``occasionally and in a
limited way, with the goal of countering disordered movement in
exchange rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso told reporters on Monday in Brasilia that free trading
on the currency could lead to a resurgence of the real. Now, he
said, ``we are more dependent on ourselves,'' particularly on the
willingness of the Brazilian Congress to cut spending and special
benefits for vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Malan said Brazil would not ask the International
Monetary Fund to speed up the second stage of its $41.5 billion
standby loan, but he said that the Brazilian government would have
to redouble efforts to cut spending and would probably increase
interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am recommending that the committee on monetary policy
discuss a widening of the interest rate band to allow the active
use of interest rates, with an initial upward bias that may be
required to maintain low inflation,'' he said in Washington. In
Brazil on Monday, short-term interest rates rose to 42 percent from
37.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Arranz, who tracks international markets at Banco Patente
in Sao Paolo, said he expected the government to announce another
series of measures in the next few weeks to help it pay
dollar-denominated debts due in 1999, which he estimated rose by
$13 billion just with last week's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is not here yet,'' Arranz said. ``With the money
devalued, economic activity will shrink even more. Companies that
began to invest are going to put on the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso is insisting that Brazil has not abandoned controlling
inflation, which sank below 1 percent last year. Today, he called
on Brazilian businesses not to trigger instant inflation by raising
prices in response to the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Banking experts say that despite the devaluation, Brazil is in
better position to meet its external obligations than Mexico in
1994 or Korea in 1997, both of which devalued their currencies in
response to financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Across Latin America, markets rose modestly on Monday after
Brazil said it had abandoned its policy of spending down dollar
reserves to defend its overvalued currency. Only the Merval index
in Argentina closed down, dropping 2.4 percent, with business
leaders there calling for trade barriers to keep out a flood of
suddenly cheaper Brazilian imports.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian devaluation is exerting severe pressure on
Argentina, which backs the value of each peso with a dollar in
reserves and relies on a currency board to set monetary policy. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHERE A NEW YORK MINUTE LASTS FOR HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GAIL COLLINS 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York City may have turned its back on nature, but it still
lives by seasonal cycles. Alternate-side-of-the-street parking
rules are as relentless as the tides. Street fairs are our
harbingers of summer, arriving with the numbers and general
irritation quotient of mosquitoes. Jury duty has always been our
version of the plagues of locusts. Every two years a summons to
serve arrived in the mailbox and the spirit sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every two years,'' chanted the woman who sat next to me in
Manhattan Civil Court last week when a lawyer asked her whether she
had ever served on a jury before. ``Like clockwork, every two
years.'' The rest of the room laughed. It came as a shock later
when the clerk who dismissed us announced that we would not be
called back until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans regard jury duty like public opinion poll surveys
_ something that never happens to anybody they know. But having
four years off between summonses is a big deal in New York City,
almost as good as getting a certificate from the Department of
Transportation saying that you can leave your car parked in front
of your house. This reprieve is the work of the state's current
chief judge, Judith Kaye, who is trying to make jury duty less
painful.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye is doing battle with layers of time-honored if
totally loopy legal customs, and the war is still half-won at best.
Thanks to the vigilant lobbying of the court officers' union,
jurors in many types of felony cases are still automatically
sequestered in hotels during their deliberations, no matter how
obscure the crime. Defense attorneys in New York still have more
opportunities to reject potential jurors on a whim than anywhere
else in the country. Every single felony trial requires a grand
jury indictment, by jurors who may wind up spending four straight
weeks deciding issues like whether to try a guy for stealing a
delivery man's pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, things are getting better. The court facilities
are cleaner, the bathroom doors have locks, and the Manhattan
courts just got a $10,000 grant to buy potted plants for rooms in
which jurors presently enjoy a virtually oxygen-free atmosphere.
(This is a city where photosynthesis does not come cheap.) But the
most Herculean achievement was eliminating jury duty exemptions,
which the eager-to-please state legislature had expanded to include
everyone from lawyers to undertakers to podiatrists. About one
million New Yorkers had been let off the hook before Judge Kaye got
the exemptions repealed, which left the remainder in incredible
demand, particularly since only about 15 percent of the eligible
New Yorkers actually responded to the summonses.
</P>
<P>
   The stolid minority who showed up every two years ran into a
legal system so bizarre that a local magazine editor once told me
the most common topic of articles that came in over the transom was
``My Incredible Jury Duty Experience.'' In civil court the judges
were not required to supervise the jury selection, known as voir
dire. The panels of prospective jurors were locked up alone with
the lawyers, each of whom had been taught in school that a case is
won or lost when you pick the jurors. They regarded the panels as
boxes of candy, and their mission was to reject the masses of
caramels and nougats in the elusive search for that one perfect
chocolate-covered cherry, even if it took all winter.
</P>
<P>
   My most unforgettable voir dire involved a plaintiff who had
been injured in a fall. (Falling down seems to be the single
highest cause of litigation in Manhattan. People come from all over
the world to trip over things here.) The lawyers on this particular
case had gone through one panel of potential jurors after another,
examining their backgrounds with extraordinary zeal, and delivering
commercials posed in the form of questions. (``You would not have
any trouble, would you, Ms. Collins, in giving my client a really,
really,  &UR; really &LR;  big settlement if you thought the facts required
it?'') The people who were chosen during the early rounds were
forced to stay in the small, windowless (and plantless) voir dire
room, listening to day after day of questioning until they knew the
medical and legal history of every other person in the courthouse,
as well as _ I swear this was a question _ everybody's favorite
character on ``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Now judges have been assigned to keep the lawyers on a leash.
The attorneys questioning my panel last week each got half an hour.
We barely had time to learn everybody's birthplace and to promise
to give a really, really, really big settlement if the facts
required. Then it was all over. My neighbor, the ``like clockwork''
woman, was so familiar with the routine she whispered the answers
before the lawyers could finish talking. She was picked yet again.
``Four years _ I'll believe it when I see it,'' she said as the
rejects beat a hasty retreat.

KNIGHT SEEMS SET FOR RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tony Battie, we hardly new ye.
</P>
<P>
   Battie, whom the Lakers obtained from the Denver Nuggets last
June, will be an ex-Laker by the time training camp opens. The
Lakers plan to ship Battie to the Boston Celtics in exchange for
former Laker Travis Knight, NBA sources told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers acknowledged their interest in obtaining Knight but
would not confirm the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in stone yet,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight deal might be the only one the Lakers make, despite
their efforts to land a marquee name. It's being reported the Bulls
will sign and trade Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets, while
Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta is heading for Phoenix or Denver.
</P>
<P>
   No trades or free-agent signings can become official until the
NBA completes its new labor agreement, but the Battie-Knight swap
would work under current rules. They are due to make nearly
identical salaries this season _ Knight $2.4 million and Battie
$2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was a Laker in 1996-97 and averaged 4.8 points and 4.5
rebounds in 71 games, making the All-Rookie second team. His hustle
and rebounding skills endeared him to the Lakers and he wanted to
make a career here. But the Lakers couldn't offer a long-term deal
and Boston grabbed him with a seven-year, $22 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears he'll return to shore up the Lakers frontcourt.
It should be a welcome change of scenery for Knight, who was
considered a disappointment in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Battie, a bust in Denver in his rookie campaign last season, was
acquired on draft day, along with Tyronn Lue, in exchange for Nick
Van Exel. Battie has not attended the Lakers' voluntary workouts at
Southwest College since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who last week hinted at ``surprises'' to come,
sounded less optimistic about a big Lakers trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know nothing,'' he said Monday. ``They asked me who I
wanted. I said a couple names, but then I look around, and those
couple names signed somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hurry up and wait: Rookies Sam Jacobson and Ruben Patterson
made their first appearance as almost-Lakers on Monday at Southwest
College.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, a guard from Minnesota, and Patterson, a forward from
Cincinnati, can't sign their rookie contracts until the lockout is
lifted. But they attended voluntary workouts for the first time and
were eager to get to camp _ whenever it eventually starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good playing with Shaq and Eddie (Jones) and (Derek)
Fisher and all the other guys,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up pretty early in the morning, I was very excited,''
said Jacobson, who arrived in L.A. on Sunday night. ``It was
frustrating (waiting for the lockout to end). It's tough to keep
your motivation going day after day by yourself working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson proudly wore a purple Lakers sweat shirt and said
stepping onto the court with a trio of All-Stars in O'Neal, Jones
and Kobe Bryant ``is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were like idols to me a few years ago, and coming
in and now I'm a teammate of theirs, it's outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting Jacobson, Patterson and Lue, seven Lakers practiced
Monday. Missing were Sean Rooks, Elden Campbell _ the subject of
trade rumors _ and Robert Horry, who remains in Houston with his
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   __ One more day: Another day, another delay in New York. The NBA
pushed back the start of training camps to Wednesday as lawyers
worked to complete the new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will take physical exams today or Wednesday, then
head to UC Santa Barbara for a five- to six-day camp.
</P>
<P>
   __ Free ride: Fans are invited to watch a Lakers practice and
scrimmage Jan. 27 at 6:30 p.m. at the Forum. Admission and parking
are free. Doors will open at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will be available beginning Wednesday at 10 a.m. at the
Forum box office and Ticketmaster outlets.

PHILIPS, SONY AND SUN TO JOIN IN INTERNET LINK FOR APPLIANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's two largest consumer electronics companies Tuesday
will announce an alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. to create a
generation of networked entertainment devices and appliances that
will communicate with each other and with humans via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Philips Electronics NV, the Sony Corp. and Sun will
announce plans to link two developing software standards to forge a
global computer network that stretches from the living room to the
corporate computing center. Virtually any kind of electronic device
built with the combined standards, including televisions, stereo
receivers and videocassette recorders, will interoperate with and
be controlled by the network.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's technology, known as Jini, is based on the company's Java
programming language for Internet applications. A new kind of
computing environment, Jini (pronounced JEEN-ee) enables
programmers to develop software for an entire network of dissimilar
machines rather than for just a single computer. It is a
``distributed'' design, meaning that each device on the network can
contribute processing power to the network and can participate in
the distribution of information and instructions to all the other
attached devices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Jini will be combined with the Home Audio
Visual Interoperability, or HAVI, architecture, developed by a
consortium of consumer electronics companies led by Sony and
Philips.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting network, a new kind of computing platform for the
anticipated post-PC era, might make it possible, for example, to
program a VCR while away from home or to seamlessly route a
television program to a computer disk drive or recordable DVD for
later playback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good marriage,'' said Mike Clary, who heads
development of Jini, which Sun announced last year and plans to
introduce formally on Jan. 25. ``It will make possible a wide range
of new commercial services.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between the two consumer electronics giants and a
leading developer of Internet computing equipment also represents
an alliance strong enough to take on the Microsoft Corp. in a
standards battle for the consumer market. Microsoft, which controls
the personal computer market with its industry-standard Windows
family of operating systems, has made aggressive moves into new
consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., earlier
this month, Microsoft unveiled a new alliance built around its
Universal Plug and Play standard. Major personal computer makers,
including the Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer and the
Hewlett-Packard Co. have already announced support for the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also attempted to forge an alliance with the Intel
Corp. and a variety of consumer electronics companies to push a
standard known as Home Application Program Interface, or Home API,
which is intended to create links between the personal computer and
consumer electronics world.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sun Jini initiative and the new Microsoft Universal
Plug and Play alliance appear to be attempts to do roughly similar
tasks: make it possible to control myriad devices in the home and
office, ranging from digital cameras and entertainment devices to
ventilation and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two technologies also represent deep philosophical
differences. Microsoft and the personal computer makers are
developing standards for a PC-centric vision of the home of the
future, in which a personal computer controls everything from
energy efficiency to telephone messaging and video delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Jini-HAVI alliance is a radical decentralized
approach to computing in which control is spread throughout a
network with no central point. In the Jini-HAVI vision of the
world, the consumer could control of all the appliances in a
networked home from a personal computer but could also use a
television or even some all-in-one infrared remote control device.
</P>
<P>
   ``With HAVI and Jini, we are laying the foundations for new
applications and, secondly, creating ways for consumers to control
their appliances the way that they want to,'' said Eddy Odijk,
Philips' general manager for systems architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitched battle between personal computer makers and
consumer electronics companies for control of consumer devices will
likely be for control of the next generation of cable settop boxes.
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable-television
company, wants to start delivering interactive television services
later this year, and Microsoft, Sun and Sony are all competing for
inclusion of their software in the standard adopted by TCI for its
settop box.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's executives said the company was focusing its development
efforts on the ability to move audio and video through home
networks with its HAVI standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very tied to streaming audio and video media
through the home,'' said Roger Lea, a vice president at Sony's
distributed systems laboratory in San Jose, Calif. ``Now, that is
being expanded to the entire world.''

NICKLAUS SLATED FOR HIP REPLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jack Nicklaus will be in Boston next week, but it will
be medical business, not golfing pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum confirmed Monday that he will perform left
total hip replacement surgery on Nicklaus Jan. 27 at New England
Baptist Hospital. Nicklaus, who will celebrate his 59th birthday
Thursday, told reporters last week that he had decided on the
surgery after a strenuous strengthening program failed to alleviate
chronic hip pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Nicklaus, his family and business partners,
reportedly urged him for months to have the surgery, but golf's
most celebrated champion said last fall that he would stick with
his fitness program. But late last year Nicklaus was unable to play
and was seen at times using a cane.
</P>
<P>
   When the decision for surgery was made sometime around the first
of the year, Nicklaus began exploring a choice of surgeons. Sources
said Nicklaus, at home in West Palm Beach, Fla., is friendly with
an orthopedic surgeon who trained under and recommended Bierbaum,
who is generally regarded as one of the foremost hip-replacement
specialists in the world. Nicklaus met with Dr. Bierbaum Jan. 10 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The operation will keep Nicklaus out of competition for several
months; most notably, he will miss the Masters, which he has won
six times and played in every year since 1959. He also will miss
his own Memorial Tournament in June, as the rehabilitation is
expected to take four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Nicklaus was eyeing a return to the US
Open at Pinehurst No. 2 (June 17-20), but that seems unlikely,
especially since his record of playing in the majors ended at 146
when he did not take part in last summer's British Open or PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 season was unspectacular, soured by the hip problems.
Though he stirred fans' emotions last April when he became the
oldest player, at 58, to ever finish in the top 10 at the Masters,
Nicklaus did not take part in any tournament after the US Senior
Open in July.

LENI RIEFENSTAHL'S `WHITE HELL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The ``u'' in ``Palu'' carries an umlaut.)  
 By EDWARD GUTHMANN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ To some, she's the greatest female filmmaker
of all time. To others, she's the face of evil _ a lingering
reminder of the horrors of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At 96, Leni Riefenstahl still bears the stamp of her association
with Adolf Hitler and ``Triumph of the Will,'' which documented his
massive 1934 rally at Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   In Ray Muller's 1993 documentary ``The Wonderful, Horrible Life
of Leni Riefenstahl,'' she insisted that she wasn't a Nazi and that
she made ``Triumph'' under duress, approaching it as an artist and
not as a propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of ``Triumph of the Will'' is so great that
Riefenstahl's early career as an actress and director is scarcely
mentioned anymore. But in the 1920s she was a popular German star
in a series of ``mountain films'' directed by
geologist-turned-filmmaker Arnold Fanck.
</P>
<P>
   The best of that genre, ``The White Hell of Piz Pal &LR; u &LR; '' (1929),
screens Jan. 20 at San Francisco's Castro Theatre as part of the
``Berlin &AMP; Beyond'' film series. The silent film, co-directed by
Fanck and G.W. Pabst (``The Threepenny Opera''), will be shown in a
newly restored print with live organ accompaniment by Dennis James.
</P>
<P>
   Riefenstahl stars as a young bride who braves a mountain
expedition in the Swiss Alps and endures avalanches, her husband's
fall from a mountain and a dramatic search-and-rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Although Riefenstahl, a former dancer, had become a skilled
mountaineer in two previous films _ and even scaled mountains in
bare feet and without ropes for the camera _ the making of ``Piz
Pal &LR; u &LR; '' required her to risk her life in freezing temperatures
without the benefit of a stunt double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film was very hard to make, very cruel,'' Riefenstahl said
recently from her home in Poecking, a village south of Munich. The
crew worked in minus-28-degree weather, and Fanck, a harsh
taskmaster and stickler for detail, thought nothing of tying
Riefenstahl in ropes, hoisting her up the side of a mountain and
allowing a real avalanche to engulf her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed, my eyes and ears hurt,'' Riefenstahl said in the
documentary about her life. ``Fanck kept the camera rolling on and
on. I really hated Fanck.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite frostbite and countless other risks, Riefenstahl made
three more films with Fanck, including ``SOS Iceberg,'' in which
she played a daredevil aviatrix, before she directed and starred in
her own mountain film, ``The Blue Light,'' in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Riefenstahl once said that, in person, Hitler ``seemed a modest,
private individual. You couldn't imagine him stirring the masses.''
Speaking at his political rallies, however, ``he had a kind of
hypnotic effect that frightened me a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Riefenstahl said that when Hitler proposed that she direct
``Triumph of the Will,'' she didn't want to take on such a large
task _ ``I wanted to act'' _ and strongly suggested another
filmmaker for the job, Walter Ruttmann. But Hitler had made up his
mind. ``It was not possible to refuse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoirs, published in 1987, in the documentary about her
and in countless interviews, Riefenstahl has always pleaded
political naivete and claimed to be an artist just doing a job on
``Triumph of the Will.'' As for the horrors of World War II, she
has said, ``we didn't foresee the danger.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 30-minute phone conversation, Riefenstahl repeated
those claims and frequently handed the phone to her companion of 30
years, Horst Kettner, asking him to translate. Kettner, 56,
proceeded not only to translate but also to offer his own
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding ``The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl,''
Kettner said, the film was edited in such a way that ``the audience
has the feeling Leni is lying'' about her personal relationships
with Hitler and minister of propaganda Paul Joseph Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will never escape,'' Kettner said, ``because there are
always people not even interested in the truth. They have made up
their mind, and they will always be against her ... This will
continue till her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Riefenstahl wish she could erase the period of her life
when she worked with Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   Kettner turns to Riefenstahl, translates the question into
German and returns to the phone, suggesting that the interviewer
refer to her memoirs for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ```Triumph of the Will' is a stamp on her body,'' Kettner said,
``and for this she will have to suffer. Naturally, she would like
to erase it as you say, but there is no way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guilty or not, Riefenstahl has lived one of the most amazing,
resilient lives of the 20th century. Despite the criticism, she
thrives and continues to find new means of expression. In the '60s
she turned to photography and made two highly praised but
controversial books about the Nuba tribe of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In her 70s, Riefenstahl turned to deep-sea diving. ``She is
still diving,'' Kettner said, ``but she is very unhappy because
since the end of May, after we returned from Papua New Guinea, she
couldn't dive because she got pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dives because underwater she has no pain, and underwater
she is fantastic, like a fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the interview, a fax was sent to Riefenstahl
and Kettner with follow-up questions. On Monday, Riefenstahl's
secretary replied with a fax saying, ``Mrs. Riefenstahl is heavily
fallen ill with pneumonia.''

   BRAZIL CURRENCY TO CONTINUE TO FLOAT AGAINST THE DOLLAR
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has decided to continue to allow the value of its
currency, the real, to be set by market forces, ending its
longstanding monetary policy of anchoring the real to its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the real from weakening further, Brazil's central bank
raised interest rates on overnight loans, and the administration of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said it was determined to take
whatever steps are necessary to avert a crippling new round of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel
Camdessus, and the United States said they were heartened by
Brazil's pledge to keep interest rates high and slash its budget
deficit. But they offered no new financial aid and made clear that
Brazil's economic fate is largely in its own hands. The finance
minister of Brazil had been meeting with American officials in
Washington since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   LOAN PAYMENT MISSED BY CHINA PORT
</P>
<P>
   Dalian International Trust and Investment, the finance arm of
one of China's biggest ports, missed a payment on a loan. The
missed payment comes less than 48 hours after the Guangdong
International Trust and Investment filed for bankruptcy. And it
underscores growing concern over loans to investment companies
across China.

SIX DAY BERRY LAWYERS JOIN CHICAGO FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six lawyers at Day Berry &AMP; Howard, one of New England's
largest law firms, have left to join the new Boston office of
Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &AMP; Geraldson, a Chicago-based practice
specializing in employment and labor law.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus temporarily leaves the employment and labor group at
Day Berry's Boston office with one third-year associate. It also
comes one month after prominent Day Berry lawyer Deval Patrick,
formerly the nation's top civil rights enforcer, quit to join
Texaco Inc. as general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The new office of Seyfarth, Shaw, a leading 400-lawyer practice
with nine domestic offices and one in Brussels, is headed by former
Day Berry partner Joseph Ambash.
</P>
<P>
   Other ex-Day Berry staffers include partner Lisa Damon, four
associates, and one counsel, all of whom specialize in labor and
employment. The counsel left Day Berry late last year, before
deciding to join Seyfarth, Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Ambash, 50, and Damon, 48, took over 20 client accounts to their
new employer, including a major New England retailer, a renowned
educational institution, and a prominent insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had developed an experienced regional and national practice
and we felt we needed a national law firm to better serve some of
our clients,'' Ambash said of the move.
</P>
<P>
   Ambash and Damon traditionally defend corporate management
against employment and labor-related charges, such as age
discrimination, wrongful discharge, and union issues, but they also
conduct unique managerial training programs and company
``diversity'' audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're saddened by Joseph and Lisa's departure, we're
confident that we'll continue to have a significant presence in
employment and labor,'' Day Berry chairman Robert Siegel said from
Hartford, where the firm is based.
</P>
<P>
   Day Berry now has six partners and 20 associates in its
employment group, spread out over various offices, and will
maintain an employment and labor practice in Boston. The law firm,
New England's fifth largest, has a total of 220 lawyers and offices
in Stamford, Conn. It is expected some Stamford staffers will move
to the Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   But Day Berry will no longer focus on human resources training
and instead will concentrate on traditional dispute resolution,
Siegel said.

   Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum confirmed Monday that he will perform left
total hip replacement surgery on Nicklaus Jan. 27 at New England
Baptist Hospital. Nicklaus, who will celebrate his 59th birthday
Thursday, told reporters last week that he had decided on the
surgery after a strenuous strengthening program failed to alleviate
chronic hip pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Nicklaus, his family and business partners,
reportedly urged him for months to have the surgery, but golf's
most celebrated champion said last fall that he would stick with
his fitness program. But late last year Nicklaus was unable to play
and was seen at times using a cane.
</P>
<P>
   When the decision for surgery was made sometime around the first
of the year, Nicklaus began exploring a choice of surgeons. Sources
said Nicklaus, at home in West Palm Beach, Fla., is friendly with
an orthopedic surgeon who trained under and recommended Bierbaum,
who is generally regarded as one of the foremost hip-replacement
specialists in the world. Nicklaus met with Dr. Bierbaum Jan. 10 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The operation will keep Nicklaus out of competition for several
months; most notably, he will miss the Masters, which he has won
six times and played in every year since 1959. He also will miss
his own Memorial Tournament in June, as the rehabilitation is
expected to take four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Nicklaus was eyeing a return to the US
Open at Pinehurst No. 2 (June 17-20), but that seems unlikely,
especially since his record of playing in the majors ended at 146
when he did not take part in last summer's British Open or PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 season was unspectacular, soured by the hip problems.
Though he stirred fans' emotions last April when he became the
oldest player, at 58, to ever finish in the top 10 at the Masters,
Nicklaus did not take part in any tournament after the US Senior
Open in July.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said on
Monday that it ``appears to be inevitable'' that the Senate will
vote, probably along party lines, to depose witnesses in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And if Senate Republicans push to hear live testimony, Daschle
added, Democrats might object to placing any strict limits on which
witnesses the prosecutors could summon &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Many Republicans have indicated that they want to hear from
witnesses, but not many and not for long. Virtually all the
Democrats have indicated that they do not want to hear from any
witnesses, but since they do not have the votes to impose their
view, Daschle's comments suggest that he would encourage a
drawn-out process aimed at embarrassing Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to give them wide latitude about what witnesses
should be called,'' Daschle said in telephone interview. ``I don't
think it's appropriate to dictate to either side how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle's only real leverage is to threaten to allow the
Senate proceedings, which continue on Tuesday with the start of the
president's defense, to become as partisan as the impeachment vote
was in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial procedures agreed to by the two parties, the
Senate will take two votes in late January after opening arguments
and questioning from senators. Those votes will be on whether to
dismiss the case and whether to depose witnesses. After taking
depositions, if they are approved, the Senate would vote on which
witnesses, if any, should give live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and the House Republican managers have
narrowed their differences on the quesioning of witnesses after
senators warned the prosecutors to keep their witness list short.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle repeated his view, shared by most Democrats, that
witnessess are unnecessary. Before last week's trial arguments, the
45 Senate Democrats held on to a slim hope that they could stay
united and muster six Republican defections to dismiss the case or,
failing that, defeat a vote to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors' presentations, which even many
Democrats acknowledged were more effective than they had expected,
dashed any Democratic hope of dismissing the case. Some influential
Democrats said on Monday that Republicans would probably use their
majority to push through a vote to depose a limited number of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the case,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said, ``Given the comments of Republicans, it appears to
be inevitable that witnesses will be deposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's comments suggest that the Democrats will try to turn
their tactical retreat on witnesses into a fresh partisan assault,
accusing Republicans of dragging out a scandal with little chance
that witnesses will clear up conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, welcomed
Daschle's comments on witnesses, but disputed the notion that
hearing witnesses would unduly prolong the trial. ``If everyone
works hard,'' said the spokesman, John Czwartacki, ``there's no
reason this will have to extend beyond February, unless someone
decided to play partisan politics and drag this process out''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House lawyers were putting the final touches on
their opening arguments, set to begin when the trial resumes on
Tuesday. President Clinton's defense has been alloted three days,
after which senators will have 16 hours over two days to ask
questions of both sides through Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said on Monday that the
White House remained opposed to calling witnesses but added that if
the Senate allowed House prosecutors to do so, the president's
lawyers might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boggles the mind a bit to try to understand how someone
testifying for the 10th time or the 23rd time or the 9th time can
provide any more clarity,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House managers insist on witnesses and the Senate
approves them, certainly we will look at calling witnesses,''
Lockhart said. ``Either way we are looking at a process that is
extended and delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House confirmed on Monday that Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel, would open the president's defense on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruff is a wise choice because he comes across as totally
honest, very shrewd and very smart,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
heads the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House is considering asking Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee, including Thomas Barrett of
Wisconsin, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Rick Boucher of
Virginia, to argue in Clinton's defense at the trial, congressional
aides said. House Democrats refused to join the 13-Republican House
prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers are expected to mount a vigorous
challenge to the House prosecutors' case on the facts, on the law
and on the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans warned in interviews that the managers'
strong showing increased the pressure on the White House. ``It's
important for the White House to recognize that this is their
opportunity to refute the case laid out by the House managers,''
said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. ``They can't treat this
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, added, ``This atmosphere is much
more serious and somber and has allowed the House managers, in the
eyes of even some Democrats, to come across no longer as being the
partisan harpoon-carriers out of the black pit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, senators will question the opposing counsels. Lott,
the majority leader, and Daschle, the minority leader, have agreed
to divide the 16 hours equally between Republicans and Democrats,
switching back and forth every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Each caucus will review its questions in advance to reduce
repetition. Before each query, Rehnquist is expected to name the
senator who wanted it asked, Czwartacki said. Senate Republicans
were preparing a data bank of questions, and so far, had collected
about 50 from lawmakers for consideration, Hatch said.

RANGERS RE-SIGN HELLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Rick Helling, who this past season
emerged as only the third 20-game winner during the Rangers'
27-year existence, signed the most lucrative contract awarded to a
first-year, arbitration-eligible pitcher.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers and their 28-year-old pitcher yesterday avoided a
February salary arbitration hearing after the two parties reached
agreement on a three-year contract worth $10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement surpassed the three-year, $8.5 million contracts
right-hander Shane Reynolds and left-hander Kirk Rueter received
from the Astros and Giants as first-year, arbitration-eligible
pitchers before the 1997 and '98 seasons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who this past season earned $216,500, joined
right-handers Roger Clemens and David Cone and left-hander Tom
Glavine as the major leagues' only 20-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who went 20-7 with a 4.41 earned-run average, will
receive $2.25 million for 1999. That compares favorably to the
one-year contract right-hander Jose Lima, 26, signed Sunday with
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, an arbitration-eligible pitcher who this past season
earned $240,000, went 16-8 with a 3.70 ERA during 33 starts for the
Astros. Those two parties avoided an arbitration hearing after
reaching agreement on a one-year contract worth $2.15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Helling also will receive $3.75 million for 2000 and $4.5
million for 2001, but the three-year contract represents a gamble
for the pitcher and the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Helling likely would earn much more through a series of
arbitration hearings the next three years should his future
performance approximate this past season. Helling and his
representative, Jeff Moorad, took security in the form of the
multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers likely will benefit from the contract should Helling
remain healthy and approximate his 1998 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's give and take there, and both sides have to be willing
to give up a little to get something,'' Helling said. ``I'm
perfectly happy with the deal. I wouldn't have signed the deal if I
didn't think it was fair. The one-year contract I would have signed
\Rthrough arbitration\S for whatever amount would have been enough
for me to live off of for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I didn't sign the long-term contract just for more money.
It didn't have anything to do with the money. It was the fact the
organization was willing and believed in me that much just to offer
the deal made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling's contract also includes performance incentives that
include bonuses of $100,000 for becoming the American League's most
valuable player or Cy Young Award recipient and bonuses of $75,000
or $50,000 should he finish either second or third in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Helling also will receive $50,000 for being selected MVP of the
AL Championship Series or World Series and can earn an additional
$25,000 for being selected to the All-Star Game or capturing a Gold
Glove Award.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, whose ERA ranked only 26th among AL qualifiers,
benefited from the Rangers' run support. Helling's support of 6.61
runs per nine innings ranked fifth among AL qualifiers, but the
right-hander also emerged as the Rangers' only pitcher with a
winning record in games which the offense produced 2-5 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Helling went 7-3 with one no decision in those games while the
remainder of the rotation went 7-24. It serves as one reason why
general manager Doug Melvin called Helling ``a model of
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason in the world, with our offense and improved
defense why Rick Helling can't win 20 games again,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. Briefly Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez,
who assured the organization that he would not play this winter in
the Puerto Rican League, kept his word.
</P>
<P>
   That also prevents the seven-time Gold Glove Award recipient
from being eligible to represent his native Puerto Rico during the
Caribbean World Series next month in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers yesterday signed right-hander Joe Hudson to a
minor-league contract and assigned the 28-year-old pitcher to
Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson made his only major-league appearance of 1998 with the
Brewers and spent the remainder of the season with Triple-A
Pawtucket and Louisville of the International League. Hudson, who
owns a 6-7 record with a 4.82 ERA during 102 major-league
appearances, will report to early minor-league camp in February.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Coley joined the organization as a member of the Rangers'
professional scouting staff. Coley spent the past five seasons as
the Twins' major-league advance scout.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 19,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   By tradition and the tense circumstances of the moment, this is
President Clinton's day. In the evening, Clinton will march into a
House chamber torn by emotion and partisanship over impeachment to
deliver his seventh State of the Union speech. The address is to
follow, by a few hours, the opening of Clinton's defense in the
Senate. The president is not the only figure on the spot, however.
Today the Republican congressional leadership must begin a year of
engaging a president with high approval ratings on something more
than his personal scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always seemed most at home in these addresses, and
the White House has skillfully leaked details in advance. There
will be aid for the elderly, disabled and schoolchildren, with tax
credits the preferred mechanism. Projected budget surpluses should
be set aside to ``save Social Security first,'' a mantra that
proved effective last year in fending off Republican tax cuts. The
speech is to call for more teachers, more strict federal education
standards, more police and more money for military readiness and to
preserve open spaces, but not too much more money. It all has a
familiar centrist ring. Riding the crest of a gravity-defying
economic boom, Clinton must feel that there is no sense in
abandoning what works politically.
</P>
<P>
   As they brace for an address centered on these issues, the
Republicans are a picture of fractious internal dissent. Dennis
Hastert, the genial but untested House speaker, has yet to
articulate his priorities, beyond declaring that he is not Newt
Gingrich. In the last couple of weeks, alarmed Republican leaders
have been hit by new polls and complaints from top fund-raisers
that voter impatience with the impeachment process has sent the
party to its lowest standing in a generation. They know that they
must put together their own legislative agenda as soon as everyone
can agree on what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists say they want this Congress to
concentrate on five broad areas: tax cuts, primary and secondary
education, crime and drugs, national defense and Social Security.
But the word is that they will try, at least at first, to be
conciliatory to the White House and see if some agreements can be
reached on things like school construction and aid for special
education. Some party leaders seem to fear that the wounds will be
so raw after the Senate trial and verdict on Clinton that they must
seize on something, anything, to show they can cooperate with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will be in a mood to cooperate and compromise is
another question. Some Democrats will advise the White House that
more confrontation with Republicans will better position the
party's candidates in the 2000 election. Social Security is certain
to be the early test. Last week Democrats and Republicans said a
Social Security deal, leaving the system basically intact but
making room for voluntary private investment accounts, is already
being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, would like to prove wrong those who are
predicting that the impeachment process will leave him politically
immobilized even if it leaves him in office. He seems to want to
settle the Social Security problem first, rescuing the system from
insolvency as baby boomers start to retire in 15 years. The
administration wants a commitment on using some of the projected
budget surpluses _ $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, by some
measures _ to keep Social Security functioning, and later decide
whether to make additional surplus money available for other
priorities, like tax cuts. Republicans are likely to want tax cuts
to be a part of any Social Security deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has an excruciating balancing act to pull off Tuesday
night. But so do the Republicans. They are now at war over
impeachment. Soon they will have to decide whether to continue that
war on the legislative front.

PARCELLS TAKES FIRST STEP TOWARD IMPROVEMENT BY SIGNING MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells started to work on next season
barely 12 hours after the Jets came within 30 minutes of going to
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, still trying to sort his emotions after Sunday's 23-10
loss to the Denver Broncos, said Monday he would return for a third
season as the coach. While the 57-year-old Parcells admitted being
tired as he contemplated starting a playoff run again _ ``I feel
I'm behind already'' _ he said he &UR;  &LR;  was proud of his players.
</P>
<P>
   So was Leon Hess, the club's 84-year-old owner. When the team
arrived back in New York at 1:15 Monday morning, Hess was there to
greet them. He shook each player's hand. Hess has not traveled with
the team since the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who has had four heart procedures, gets practically no
sleep after a game, win or lose. But he met with his players, held
a 45-minute news conference and began to retool his roster for
1999. Among his announcements Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ He surprised nearly everyone by signing Johnny Mitchell _ yes,
that Johnny Mitchell. He was the club's first-round draft pick in
1992, a tight end who played four seasons but ultimately symbolized
the failure of much of the 1990s. He has been out of football since
1996, spending part of the time in Rio de Janeiro and also trying
some modeling roles.
</P>
<P>
   _ He gave Bill Belichick, his highly regarded assistant head
coach and defensive coordinator, permission to speak to the Kansas
City Chiefs and Chicago Bears regarding their head-coaching
positions. Belichick, however, is the heir apparent here. Parcells
also said &UR;  &LR;  his entire coaching staff had been rehired, as was all
the front-office personnel that came with his new administration in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ He told the starters Kyle Brady (tight end) and Matt O'Dwyer
(right guard), whose contracts are up, that he would like to have
them back _ but not at any price. He imparted the same information
to linebacker Dwayne Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he was proud of the job that he did, pointing out
how the Jets had ``made a lot of strides that the team hadn't done
before _ winning on the road, big games, winning a division _ the
deciding game.''
</P>
<P>
   He characterized his players as a ``hard-working, 90-percent
attentive team. I like this team. I've got kids that know what we
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those ``kids'' such as 35-year-old quarterback Vinny
Testaverde said he ``lay in bed, wide awake, thinking _ if we would
have made this play or converted that first down things would be
different and we'd be going to Miami. But it's not the case today.
We have something to be motivated about coming back next year and
trying to make another run at it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of second-guessing in the aftermath of Denver's
victory. The Jets led by 10-0 early in the third quarter, moving
the ball well while the defense tied up John Elway and his
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Jets had overcome first-half fumbles by Curtis
Martin and Keith Byars, it still was &UR;  &LR; n &UR; o &LR; t enough to push Denver
to the brink. Parcells said Monday that with that 10-0 edge, he was
about to start running ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're going to see the running attack, but by the time we
got the ball back it was tied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets were up by 10 points, the Broncos struck quickly,
getting a good kickoff return and then a touchdown from Elway to
Howard Griffith. When Meggett was unable to field the ensuing
kickoff &UR; ,  &LR;  the Broncos recovered it and kicked the tying field
goal. It all happened in 3 minutes 33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put it on the pressure of the game,'' Parcells said.
Two of his veteran playoff performers, Martin and Byars, dropped
the ball. Parcells said he could not remember the last time he saw
Byars fumble _ ``maybe nine years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And Testaverde said the mile-high altitude wasn't the reason
that the team faltered in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all that is all a myth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells dismissed Testaverde's two interceptions as
meaningless. They came late in the game with Testaverde throwing on
every down. One was a deflection.
</P>
<P>
   If things work out, the Jets will have a more varied offense.
Parcells said that he wanted Mitchell because the Jets were looking
to install plays designed to send tight ends downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' team has been the repository of revived careers with
Testaverde and Bryan Cox, the linebacker, reaching high levels of
play. The volatile Cox has been a stabilizing influence on the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell becoming a Jet again might not be such an odd idea. He
was known for his undisciplined routes and for blurting out
whatever was on his mind. Parcells explained that the signing of
Mitchell had been in the works for some time. He said that
Mitchell, who lives in South Florida, has spoken to several current
Jets whom he knew, asked about Parcells, and then called him.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell caught 154 passes in his four seasons, scoring 16
touchdowns and averaging a 13.5 yards a catch. He left the Jets
after 1995 as a free agent, went to Jimmy Johnson's first summer
camp and decided he had had enough of the torrid Miami heat within
a week. Later that season he signed with Dallas and got into four
games, catching one pass. But signing Mitchell is just one step for
Parcells in preparing for yet another season. There are, after all,
at least seven areas on the team to improve, he said. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ San Jose's Marcus Reese, the state's No. 1-rated
linebacker, gave UCLA an oral commitment. He is 6-2, 210 pounds and
attends Oak Grove High School, which produced UCLA's senior tight
end, Mike Grieb.
</P>
<P>
   Reese chose UCLA over Cal and Tennessee and has a chance to play
next season. The Bruins have just five experienced linebacker:
Santi Hall, Robert Thomas, Ryan Nece, Tony White and Ramogi Huma.

LOWEY GAUGES SUPPORT IN TENTATIVE BID TO SUCCEED MOYNIHAN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid growing concern among New York Democrats over finding a
candidate to run for the U.S. Senate in 2000, Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester County said Monday that she was considering a race for
the seat and that she had begun calling Democrats and contributors
to measure potential support.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, Ms. Lowey, 61, would have the field
essentially to herself if she sought the job held by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, even though she is barely known statewide. Many Democrats
said Monday that the thin ranks of potential candidates pointed to
a troubling weakness in the party as it approached the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Several prospective candidates _ including state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and
urban development _ have ruled out the contest, leaving Democratic
leaders worried that potential candidates are being scared off by
the possible Republican candidacy of New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Some state Democratic leaders have urged Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the first lady, to move to New York next year and run for the
Senate. Ms. Lowey said Monday she would immediately abandon her
prospective campaign if Mrs. Clinton ran. Mrs. Clinton has not
publicly ruled out the idea, although her friends describe it as
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Ms. Lowey said she had spent the day
calling Democratic leaders and contributors to measure how well she
would do in lining up support. She also said she would spend the
next few months traveling the state to discuss her prospective
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm seriously, actively exploring the Senate race,'' she said.
``I'm going to make a definitive decision in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's decision not to seek a fifth term in 2000, which he
announced three days after the election of Rep. Charles Schumer, a
Brooklyn Democrat, to the Senate, has underlined the absence of
formidable statewide candidates in the party.
</P>
<P>
   The party's inability to recruit a strong candidate has been
chilled as well by the prospective candidacy of Giuliani. The
two-term mayor presumably would have no trouble drawing Democratic
votes in New York City and raising the money needed for the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the vacuum in the Democratic Party has, it seems, created an
opportunity for Ms. Lowey, a five-term member of Congress who is
barely known outside her district, which includes parts of
Westchester, the Bronx and Queens. Several Democrats said that she
would, if by default, be the front-runner if she decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey's aides said Monday that she had $800,000 in her
campaign account that could go toward the race. Ms. Lowey said that
a Senate race would be expensive, but she said she did not believe
she would have any difficulty financing a campaign. ``You have to
raise a huge amount of money, and I think I can do it _ I think
between $15 million and $20 million,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The main promoter of a Clinton candidacy in New York, Rep.
Charles Rangel of Manhattan, said Monday he would welcome Ms. Lowey
into the race if Mrs. Clinton ultimately decided not to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think outside of Clinton, she would be the most outstanding
candidate that we have,'' Rangel said. ``If Hillary Clinton doesn't
run, I cannot think of any candidate who has a better chance to
win, who is better qualified, than Nita Lowey.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also said he believed that Ms. Lowey would be ``a strong
candidate'' and that ``she has a strong record in Congress.'' The
new senator said he did not believe that Giuliani was necessarily
as a fearsome political force as many Democrats have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani is not a pushover,'' Schumer said. ``But we're a long
way away from the election. I had 1 percent in the polls at about
this time, and no one thought I could win the primary, let alone
beat D'Amato.'' He referred to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican
who sought a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lowey decides against running, the field as of now would
include Rep. Carolyn Maloney and the Rev. Al Sharpton.

EXPERIMENT IN RECYCLING AND RENEWAL UNFOLDS AT JAIL COMPLEX
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As weekly pickups of recyclable trash spread to all
the neighborhoods of this city, there is one eco-friendly urban
corner that is way ahead of them, already providing pickups twice a
week.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the city, composting is confined to the odd
backyard, but gardeners in this place compost six tons of food
scraps a day. The $5 million plant where they do it, said to be the
world's largest devoted to composting only food, has a roof made of
photovoltaic cells, making it one of the city's most ambitious
efforts to turn sunlight into electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 30,000 pounds of vegetables were harvested here in
the city's largest community garden. There are daily classes on
garden design, plant care and other horticultural topics. There is
a Zen meditation pond, an ornamental grass garden and a native
woodlands area. Birds peck at suet in feeders as observers keep
lists of species.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists visiting this spot might think they had died
and gone to eco-heaven, but this New York City address is nobody's
idea of paradise. It is Rikers Island, home to 10 jails and 16,000
inmates, to tall fences, miles of menacing razor ribbon and ominous
guard towers.
</P>
<P>
   But the experimental jail farm here is also a strikingly
unexpected laboratory for solving one of the city's most
intractable problems: getting rid of garbage. As Staten Island's
giant Fresh Kills landfill prepares to close in 2001 and the city
scrambles against mounting opposition to sending its trash out of
state, environmentalists say the jail complex is demonstrating how
to deal with more waste at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rikers experiment is explicitly part of a waste-management
plan the city drafted in 1992 and updated last year. Ultimately,
experts say, if the city meets its recycling goals, all of its food
waste _ which at that point would be one-fourth of the city's total
garbage _ could be composted within the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose here is to remove the word waste from the
dictionary,'' said Thomas McCarthy, a spokesman with the city
Department of Correction. ``To take what used to be called waste
and find a use for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater self-sufficiency is also the main benefit of the other
environmental programs at Rikers. The farm last year raised 30,000
pounds of fresh vegetables for use in prison meals, an amount that
would have cost $8,111 to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, officials here say, are the practical and
psychological benefits inmates gain from learning new, possibly
money-making skills as well as from the simple pleasures of
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like serenity,'' said Frederick Lewis, 45, an inmate who
finds that the rewards in his job in the landscaping program go far
beyond the 15 cents an hour he is paid. ``There's a sense of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   From the prison authorities' perspective, the benefit is greater
control of potentially unruly inmates. ``You hardly have any
violence at all,'' said Gary Pereira, a correction officer for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Only inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses are allowed to
participate in the program at Rikers, a maximum-security prison
complex. But given that inmates work with pitchforks, shovels and
shears, security concerns are paramount and gardeners are
pat-searched coming and going. ``No one's going nowhere until all
the tools are counted,'' said Manuel Monserrat, a correction
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Terrariums are made with unbreakable plastic rather than with
glass, and garbage compactors must be searched to make sure inmates
are not trying to escape with recyclable material.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hands-on work, the program involves daily classroom
instruction: a blackboard has two dozen words, like
``chloroplast,'' ``anther'' and ``mulch.'' Inmates learn how to
cultivate house plants and design outdoor gardens. In the native
plants area, they have planted dogwood, juniper and plum trees.
They make their own decisions on garden design. Women in prison
made the biological symbol for female the centerpiece of one
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, inmates collected worms for a nestful of baby
mockingbirds. They scattered ladybugs about as a weapon against
aphids that were attacking the plants. They were amazed to learn
that tulips grow from bulbs, not seeds. In the farm program, which
runs from April through September, they grew zucchini, tomatoes,
peppers and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nurturing,'' said Frederick Lewis, 45, a former
construction worker from East Harlem who would not specify his
offense. ``Planting a seed and seeing it grow is more satisfying
than just eating the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   David Brown, 41, of the Bronx, who was convicted of stripping
automobiles, said: ``I knew my cars. Now I know my plants.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day-to-day basis, the Rikers program, operated by the
Horticulture Society of New York, is run by James Jiler, 39, who
quit his job as a Wall Street commodities analyst and joined the
Peace Corps. He advised the government of Nepal on organic farming.
He picked up a master's degree in urban forestry from Yale
University. He works with prisoners five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 inmates have participated. For the women, Jiler
teaches a course on house plant care, encouraging them to think of
themselves as doctors nurturing patients. For the men, he is
beginning a program to raise plants for use in landscaping grounds
next to city bus garages. Other plants have gone to the median
islands on upper Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to encourage a sense of creativity,'' Jiler said.
</P>
<P>
   In helping to make things grow, Rikers Island is returning to
its roots. It began as a 90-acre farm owned by the Riker family,
and through the dumping of waste was expanded to 450 acres. It
became a prison in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Horticulture Society started a greenhouse and
landscaping program, but the administration of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani ended it for budgetary reasons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The society returned in September 1997 partly because the
gardening program fit into other programs. For instance, the
society uses plants from Rikers Island to beautify the lawns of
landmark Carnegie libraries. And the new society president, Anthony
Smith, is also a director of South 40 Corp., which helps former
inmates find jobs. The society has promised to pay all of the
program's bills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith contends that the program is more than worth the cost.
``Inmates may be seeing something for the first time that is going
to live or die based on what they do or don't do,'' he said. He
added that in the program's first incarnation, 25 percent of
participants returned to prison after they were released, compared
with more than 60 percent of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The recycling and composting operations would seem to involve
inmates the least, but their participation is actually crucial. It
is the job of one correction officer, Sandra Simmons, to get the
prisoners' attention; they must sort food waste into the right bins
for the program to have any chance of working.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very demanding to be taken seriously,'' said
Ms. Simmons, whom inmates have dubbed the Garbage Queen. ``If you
ask for 100 percent, you get 50 percent. It works.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simmons got her appreciation for recycling from her mother,
who took her to a recycling and redemption center near their Queens
home when she was a little girl. She found that few inmates had the
same background. Most thought the waste was being taken to hog
farms to be used as swill. ``Some couldn't care less and some were
confused,'' she said. ``But for some, it was like the circle of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the composting operation is to take the process from
backyards to a much larger part of the population. If composting
can be shown to be economical in the large Rikers Island project,
other composting centers might be constructed around the city. The
compost could be used in parks, golf courses and botanical gardens
and for other uses, both within and outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to do anything beyond backyard composting in New York City
becomes very, very complex,'' said Thomas Outerbridge, who
originally planned the project as a Sanitation Department official
and now works as an environmental consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first idea was that the project must be big enough to
catch the attention of the people at sanitation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The composting center cost $5 million, mostly from state money,
and is on an isolated corner of the island unlikely to be used for
a new jail. It enables the Correction Department to avoid using
hundreds of garbage trucks that otherwise might pose a security
risk, and the department pays nothing to the Sanitation Department
for running the program.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the residue of 60,000 meals is mixed with recycled
cardboard into a yeasty substance that smells like manure. The
final result is high-grade fertilizer for use in the gardening and
farm programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest composting facility in America used strictly
for food waste,'' said Robert LaValva, the Sanitation Department's
chief of composting. ``This is the point of reference for the rest
of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Neighbors have been known to complain about the
odor from composting. Nobody had to ask the prisoners for their
view.

CONFIDENCE IS ON THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's confidence has taken a hit during its
current three-game losing streak, but the Trojans are not ready to
write off the season, especially with UCLA visiting the Sports
Arena on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost three in a row, so maybe guys are losing a little
confidence,'' guard Quincy Wilder said. ``But we're not done. We're
not going to quit. We'll turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, who transferred to USC from Highline Community College
in Des Moines, Wash., is experiencing the longest losing streak
since he began playing organized basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life have I lost three games in a row,'' he said.
``But the Pac-10 is the toughest conference in the country. It's
not unbelievable that you can lose three games; you just have to be
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Home-court disadvantage: After winning nine straight games at
the Sports Arena, USC has dropped three straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts because we tried to establish in the preseason that
home is home and we didn't want to lose any home games in the
Pac-10,'' forward Greg Lakey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lakey, who scored a career-high 17 points against Cal, said he
hasn't been discouraged by his lack of playing time recently. He
entered the Cal game averaging just seven minutes of action in
Pacific-10 Conference play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be sad,'' Lakey said. ``I've had good
confidence throughout the year and I've just tried to be ready to
give the team a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shooting woes: Center Brian Scalabrine thinks one reason the
Trojans have shot poorly the past two games is the team has played
at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   USC's starting guards were 4 for 26 from the field the past two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys like Larry (Ayuso) and Adam (Spanich) shoot
better when we play on the road, because they get fired up when the
crowd is against them,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Clark apparently finished: USC women's guard Kristin Clark
has not had surgery, but her career is apparently over after she
tore knee ligaments. Clark has almost nothing of the anterior
cruciate ligament in her knee remaining, and though she has
considered wearing a brace, the chances of her playing this season
are extremely unlikely. She has sat out USC's past four games.
Clark needs one more 3-point field goal to become USC's all-time
leader.

DEVILS' OFFENSE TURNS COLD IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Unable to get their offense in gear, the
Devils began a three-game trip to California on &UR;  &LR; Monday afternoon
with a 3-1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Even though they took 34
shots at goalie Mike Vernon, the Devils managed only a power-play
goal by Brian Rolston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to start a trip a lot better than we did,'' Coach
Robbie Ftorek said after the Devils' fourth loss in the last five
games. ``But we've got to play 60 minutes in each of the next two
games. We didn't execute as well as we needed to in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (23-14-5), who have won twice in eight games this
month, will play at Anaheim on Wednesday and at Los Angeles on
Thursday. The Devils will need forwards Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias
and Vadim Sharifijanov, all of whom missed Monday's game because of
the flu.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (15-18-10), who entered the game with their power
play ranked 25th among the 27 National Hockey League teams,
capitalized on their first power play of the game. Jeff Friesen,
who found himself alone to the left of goalie Martin Brodeur,
converted Marco Sturm's pass from the other side for his 12th goal
of the season, 8 minutes 49 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston tied the score three minutes into the second period when
his blistering shot from the high slot passed through a crowd, hit
the left post and then caromed off Vernon before going into the net
for Rolston's 12th goal of the season. The power-play goal was the
fourth in the last seven attempts by the Devils, who had three
power-play goals in five attempts in their previous game, a victory
over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to shoot the puck on net with people in front,''
Rolston said afterward. ``We just want to have traffic in front to
distract the goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Marleau regained the lead for the Sharks just over two
minutes after Rolston's goal when he outmuscled Kevin Dean with a
move from left to right and flipped the puck over Brodeur's left
shoulder for his ninth of the season. Stephane Matteau closed the
scoring with 2:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo and Bobby Holik had great chances for the Devils
after they pulled Brodeur for an extra attacker with 1:43 left in
the game, but Vernon came up with fine saves both times.

AT HOME IS EXPECTED TO ACQUIRE EXCITE IN MAJOR INTERNET DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: SUBS to restructure, CORRECT garble in last graf, ADD
Monday's announcement by Snap about high-speed Internet service.) 
 (fe) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Home Corp., a high-speed Internet service
aimed at cable television subscribers, intends to announce on
Tuesday that it will acquire Excite Inc., one of the leading
Internet destinations, in a stock transaction valued about $6
billion, according to a person involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would be one of the biggest in a flurry
of recent Internet acquisitions, exceeding even the $4.2 billion
purchase of Netscape by America Online announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies met on Monday night to work on
last-minute issues. Barring last-minute snags, an announcement is
planned in New York before the opening of the stock market. Any
deal would have to be approved by the shareholders of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies refused to comment on reports about their
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would the deal strengthen's At Home's position in the
competition for destination sites, known as portals, that is
increasingly defining the commercial Internet, but it would sharpen
the position of AT&AMP;T, which is now concluding its acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., At Home's major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Excite shareholders would
receive about 30 percent of At Home in a stock transaction
involving the issuing of new shares. The resulting company would be
named At Home, and George Bell, Excite's chief executive, would
become an At Home board member as well as take an executive
position in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of At Home's stock outstanding is about $10.4 billion,
while Excite's shares are worth a total of about $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has more 330,000 customers for its service, which
provides high-speed Internet data via cable networks. The deal
would give it access both to Excite's more than 20 million
registered users and to the company's content-development
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Both At Home and Excite! are based in Redwood City, a San
Francisco suburb on the Northern edge of Silicon Valley. The
offices of Tom Jermolak, At Home's chief executive, and Bell are
separated by a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to strike a merger agreement was heightened in
recent weeks because there were several other companies interested
in bidding for Excite!, including Yahoo!, a competing large portal
and search engine, and the Microsoft Corporation, according to
people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A report of a possible At Home acquisition of Excite appeared
Monday in The San Jose Mercury News. Excite's stock closed Friday
at $67.50, up $2.375, while At Home closed at $102, down 62.5
cents. The proposed deal values each share of Excite at more than
$116, more than 72 percent above its Friday closing price of
$67.50.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one in a series of moves by Internet players and
telecommunications companies to position themselves for the
expected next wave of Internet development based on high speed
cable and phone links.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the recent acquisition of Netscape Communications
by America Online, Snap, an Internet provider partly owned by NBC,
Monday announced a high-speed Internet service with partners
including Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the At Home-Excite deal could ultimately help shape
its strength in a wide range of Internet services, including
dial-up access via its AT&AMP;T Worldnet service; the At Home offering,
which will permit it to offer both high-speed Internet as well as
local telephone services; and a new Excite brand that could serve
as both a portal and an important content brand to rival other
major Internet players such as Microsoft, Disney and America
Online.

 &HT;    Former state representative to head HMO for convicts
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former state Rep. Allen Hightower, the powerful
and longtime chairman of a legislative committee that oversaw
Texas' prison system, is going back to work for the state _ this
time as head of the huge state-run HMO for convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower, a sponsor of the law that created the health
maintenance organization program six years ago, became executive
director of the Correctional Managed Health Care Program on Jan. 13
_ a day after leaving the House seat he held 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 22-hour retirement,'' Hightower said Monday. ``My
replacement (as a legislator) was sworn in on Tuesday, and I was at
work in my new job at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new $120,000-a-year job, Hightower will oversee medical
care for Texas' 145,000 convicts _ a $290 million system run under
contract by the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and
Texas Tech University's Health Sciences Center.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, lawmakers are not prohibited from taking state
jobs after they leave office. Some prison officials suggested
privately Monday that Hightower, reportedly one of three finalists,
was the natural choice _ because he helped form the system and
because of his long history in shaping Texas criminal justice
policy.
</P>
<P>
   While he was a lawmaker, Hightower chaired the House Corrections
Committee. He also worked as the Huntsville operations chief for
Brazos Valley Transit, which operates rural and urban bus systems
in numerous East Texas communities. Hightower said he resigned that
job to accept the new post.
</P>
<P>
   The Correctional Managed Health Care Program was created in 1993
to save money and has been the target of frequent complaints by
convicts about inadequate care. Those complaints are expected to be
the focus of a federal court hearing on prison conditions scheduled
to begin Thursday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   State officials hope the hearing before U.S. District Judge
William Wayne Justice is a first step to ending more than two
decades of court supervision of Texas prisons. Convicts' attorneys
hope Justice will retain supervision of the state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower said he has no doubt the prison medical system is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Dr. James Riley, who announced his retirement Jan.
1. Prison officials said Riley, who had headed the program since
its inception, has agreed to stay on through May to ease the
transition. In recent years, the prison health care system has
pioneered use of video exams to allow doctors at one unit to treat
sick convicts at another. The managed care idea was proposed by
former Comptroller John Sharp as part of his once-very-two years
performance review of state government. The idea drew criticism at
first from prison officials and others worried about state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I represented Huntsville, I had a lot of constituent
concern about what would happen to prison jobs,'' he said. ``But I
now think John Sharp was right on this one. This has saved a whole
lot of money, a lot more than we thought it would.''
</P>
<P>

Texas.

DESERT DOESN'T DETER 88-YEAR-OLD FROM CAMPAIGN REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Arizona editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Striding across the sun-baked desert in eastern
California, Doris ``Granny D'' Haddock was finishing a particularly
lonely leg Monday in her cross-country trek to promote campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock, 88, is weathering the remote, rugged area between
Twentynine Palms and the Arizona border with help from volunteers
whose ranks have grown since she started her crusade after the
Tournament of Roses parade on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in a difficult spot right now in the middle of the
desert. If we take it slow, it's just a nice walk every day of the
week,'' said Dennis Burke, executive director of Arizona Common
Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on decades of activism, Haddock wants to generate a
groundswell for campaign finance reform. She said she was furious
when the U.S. Senate last year killed a measure that would have
banned the use of unlimited, unregulated large donations to
political parties, known as ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try to educate the people about why they should
care. This is a social issue because our system is breaking down.
We're losing our democracy, we're giving it away to the
corporations,'' Haddock said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive great-grandmother from Dublin, N.H., is following
Highway 62 as it wanders between mountain ranges, with the Colorado
River Aqueduct in frequent view.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and a handful of his Common Cause members are driving a
9-year-old donated camper van alongside Haddock. It provides a
comfortable rest stop, and a haven for meals and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   They took over assisting the pilgrim for political change in
Twentynine Palms on Wednesday. Ralph Langley, an Upland, Calif.,
retiree and Common Cause member, found homes for Haddock and drove
her to speaking appearances for the first 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy, but this woman is just unbelievable,''
Langley said. ``She deserves it. Here's a lady who's putting her
life on the line with this journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest in a Parker, Ariz., motel is on Haddock's itinerary this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The hiatus also will feature an 89th birthday celebration for
Haddock. The desert location is fine with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful birthday present,'' she said in a
recent interview. ``God has been good to me to make me as healthy
as I am at my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Any stop also is an opportunity to make a pitch for her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock is equally earnest about her journey, counting on
strangers to provide meals and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing such help would be as sparse as vegetation in the
desert, Haddock was prepared to bear a backpack with camping gear
for nights under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent in the camper van took that weight off her
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets pretty tuckered after eight (miles), takes a nap, and
then she walks the last two miles for the day and calls it quits,''
Burke noted. ``The only thing that can stop us is her health or her
feet. We're urging her not to stretch herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke has Common Cause members across Arizona ready to take in
Haddock. He noted she will need five or six weeks to reach New
Mexico, where that state's chapter is organizing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disappointed that they're not along her route.
Those who are are really getting jazzed,'' Burke said. ``She's a
remarkable lady.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil said on Monday that it would continue
to allow the value of its currency, the real, to be set by market
forces, all but abandoning a policy to support the currency, which
was draining billions from its reserves of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With the government still seeking some control over the
currency, the nation's central bank raised interest rates on
overnight loans on Monday to keep the real from weakening further.
And Pedro Malan, Brazil's finance minister, told U.S. officials in
Washington that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
administration was determined to take whatever steps were necessary
to avert a crippling new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move to allow the real to trade freely against
the dollar had lifted the Bovespa stock market index by 33.4
percent on Friday, and its announcement on Monday kindled a further
upswing, with the index rising 5.4 percent. Though U.S. exchanges
were closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, markets across Europe
rose. The real, however, fell an additional 10 percent, to 1.58 to
the dollar. It has plunged 24 percent since the government first
moved to devalue the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Brazil ends a policy that had been geared toward
suppressing once-crippling inflation by pegging the currency to the
dollar, which helps keep a tight rein on the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   That was a key feature of the so-called Real Plan, which
Cardoso's government introduced in 1994. But the country could no
longer afford to defend the currency with its diminishing reserves,
which must also be used to pay foreign debt. Brazil's economy has
been stagnating; unemployment is at near-record levels; exports are
falling and the trade deficit is way up, and the nation's troubles
have aroused fears of an Asian-style collapse that could weaken
economies throughout the region, including in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said on Monday that ``as of today,'' it would
``allow the interbank market (both free and floating segments) to
define the exchange rate.'' It added that the central bank might
intervene in the future ``occasionally and in a limited way, with
the goal of countering disordered movement in exchange rates.''
</P>
<P>
   With the currency disconnected from the dollar, editorial
cartoons in one newspaper pictured Malan and the new central bank
president, Francisco Lopes, flying in a red purse in search of
solutions to Brazil's difficulties. On Saturday, the handbag was
shown taking them to Washington for talks with the International
Monetary Fund, which has promised to lend $41.5 billion to help
Brazil weather its crisis. Brazil has already received $9 billion
from the package, and another $9 billion is to be released at the
end of February. Brazilian and U.S. officials said on Monday that
there were no discussions about granting the loans ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga said the president was
``extremely impressed with the reaction of the markets'' to
Friday's devaluation, during which the real did not lose the 30
percent in value that economists had predicted. He said there would
be ``a period with moments of tension, certainly'' but added, ``The
floating of the currency has had a very positive result.''
</P>
<P>
   A weak currency can help stimulate exports by making them
cheaper abroad. But a weak currency also reduces the purchasing
power of consumers, particularly when buying imports, and puts
downward pressure on the currencies of neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso told reporters on Monday in Brasilia that free trading
on the currency could lead to a resurgence of the real. Now, he
said, ``we are more dependent on ourselves,'' particularly on the
willingness of the Brazilian Congress to cut spending and special
benefits for vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   The attention of investors is turning to Brasilia, where
Congress is expected to take the second of a series of votes needed
to extend and increase a tax on financial transactions. The tax is
part of an austerity plan, estimated at $23.5 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts before the devaluation, that was a
condition for Brazil to win IMF backing for a standby loan last
fall. The austerity plan is intended to reduce a huge budget
deficit and restore international confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also sending a bill to Congress this week that
would make civil servants contribute to the public pension system,
which Congress has already rejected four times. Public workers
enjoy generous lifetime pensions equal to, or higher than, their
salaries when working, and benefits for an estimated 1.8 million of
them are expected to produce a $30 billion deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress acts decisively, said William Cline, chief economist
at the Institute for International Finance in Washington, a
research institute for major banking, financial and investment
groups, ``chances are relatively good that confidence will rebuild,
and that will allow the central bank to reduce interest rates and
take a lot of the severe recessionary pressure off the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Malan said Brazil would not ask the International
Monetary Fund to speed up the second stage of its standby loan, but
he said that the Brazilian government would have to redouble
efforts to cut spending and would probably increase interest rates
further.
</P>
<P>
   As investment specialists here braced for a possible new round
of austerity moves from the government, short-term interest rates
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Arranz, who tracks international markets at Banco Patente
in Sao Paolo, said he expected the government to announce another
series of measures in the next few weeks to help it pay
dollar-denominated debts due in 1999, which he estimated rose by
$13 billion just with last week's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is not here yet,'' Arranz said. ``With the money
devalued, economic activity will shrink even more. Companies that
began to invest are going to put on the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso is insisting that Brazil has not abandoned controlling
inflation, which sank below 1 percent last year. Today, he called
on Brazilian businesses not to trigger instant inflation by raising
prices in response to the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Banking experts say that despite the devaluation, Brazil is in
better position to meet its external obligations than Mexico in
1994 or Korea in 1997, both of which devalued their currencies in
response to financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Across Latin America, markets rose modestly on Monday after
Brazil said it had abandoned its policy of spending down dollar
reserves to defend its overvalued currency. Only the Merval index
in Argentina closed down, dropping 2.4 percent, with business
leaders there calling for trade barriers to keep out a flood of
suddenly cheaper Brazilian imports.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian devaluation is exerting severe pressure on
Argentina, which backs the value of each peso with a dollar in
reserves and relies on a currency board to set monetary policy. &QL;

JANKOVICH: FUND RAISING IS CSUN ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Six weeks as interim athletic director has taught
Sam Jankovich something:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything wrong with the Cal State Northridge athletic
department can be solved by overhauling its lackluster fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Offering an in-depth assessment of the oft-troubled program for
the first time, Jankovich said CSUN athletics receive plenty of
money from the state, the Big Sky Conference is ``the right fit''
for the school and none of the 20 sports programs is in jeopardy of
being cut.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich _ who six weeks ago replaced Paul Bubb, who was
pressured to resign in the wake of Michael Abraham's drug arrest _
believes the university must drastically improve its outreach to
the San Fernando Valley. There it is the most significant
intellectual and one of the most important economic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I found is there are a lot of resources available to
the athletic department that might not have been used but that will
be used as far as the future is concerned,'' Jankovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Jankovich _ the former Washington State and University
of Miami athletic director who was brought out of retirement by
president Blenda Wilson to lay the foundation for a permanent
replacement he will help hire this summer _ is emphasizing
individual performance and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to make rash decisions, but people have to be
energetic and enthusiastic,'' Jankovich said. ``The bottom line is
everybody's got to perform. And everybody's got a scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich said he was shocked to learn how athletics at CSUN
operated, including such basics as communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, somebody saw a need, but it wasn't met,'' said
Grace Collins, associate athletic director/business. ``Either three
people tried to fill the need and you had three people working on
it, or everyone saw the need and thought someone else was taking
care of it, and nothing got done.''
</P>
<P>
   That Jankovich has such a grasp on the situation comes as no
surprise to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very quick study, a delight to work with and he's
getting his feet under him,'' Wilson said. ``His insights will be
good for us. The people in the community have reached out to Sam in
a very generous way.'' &QL; 
Fund raising: the linchpin &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is Jankovich's highest priority and it's his area of
expertise. When he arrived at the University of Miami in 1983, the
athletic program raised $300,000 annually. It surpassed $3 million
when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Many CSUN coaches have cited state-funding cuts as the reason
behind their tight budgets. However, Jankovich said, that's
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997-98 athletic season, CSUN received $5.2 million
from the state and an additional $1.6 million in student fees,
according to Collins. By contrast, CSUN raised $302,798, including
$100,000 by an outside party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this program has more potential than people think in
terms of getting outside support,'' Jankovich said. ``We have to
work with all of the club people who are so adamant that they want
these programs, and then we have to see if we can get them involved
to really assist us.''
</P>
<P>
   Community outrage saved four men's sports _ swimming,
volleyball, soccer and baseball _ from budget cuts two summers ago.
The outcry resulted in overwhelming emotional support, but CSUN
never capitalized financially.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich wants to increase activity in the Matador Athletic
Association, which has 649 members _ a staggeringly low figure
considering more than 100,000 CSUN graduates live in the Los
Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody did this job for two years and I'm trying to rebuild
it,'' said assistant athletic director/development Michael Rehm, in
his second year of heading CSUN's fund-raising department. ``There
were no board members and now we have a board. I need to depend on
my board to help me get this thing done.'' &QL; 
Becoming known &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Key to these efforts is getting the persuasive Jankovich, and
CSUN's name and ideas, into the business community. Jankovich is an
accomplished and captivating speaker capable of seducing an
audience. He's been touring the local Rotary clubs and attending
meetings of various chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wilson has held dinners at her home for local
community leaders, and more are scheduled as CSUN tries to tap into
a Valley it's neglected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a big part of the Valley, and to be a big part of the
Valley you have to be out there,'' Rehm said. ``We have to try to
meet the right people, show them our vision and see if they want to
get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is working on several promotional agreements with
area businesses, including a prominent grocery store, Jankovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN received more than $300,000 through corporate support last
year, according to Brian Swanson, assistant athletic
director/external affairs. But that includes trade dollars, for
either advertisement or services provided, and is well beneath what
Jankovich projects the school could attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with some businesses to try to make a more
visible appearance in the community,'' Swanson said. ``We've made a
real concerted effort to get out there more.''
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start might be with the student body. Student
attendance for games at the commuter school is typically mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   So Jankovich charged Brooke Michelle, CSUN's director of
marketing and promotions, with establishing a student board of
directors. These students will be responsible for on-campus
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind it is the more people that have a personal
investment in the program, the more people will be interested,''
Michelle said. ``It's very successful at other universities, but I
haven't tried to launch it here because I question whether it can
be successful implementing a program run at bigger schools.'' &QL; 
Facilities &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, fans, corporate sponsors and possible donors will
arrive at a Matadors athletic event.
</P>
<P>
   And see the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   They'll sit in the aging 1,600-seat gym for basketball, or visit
the high school-style football stadium or an unkempt track and
field complex.
</P>
<P>
   Jaknovich certainly has seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has to be a significant improvement as far as
the workplace, the environment, the facilities,'' Jankovich said.
``We have to improve the training room, the locker rooms, so kids
don't have to shower at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Jankovich, a major facilities overhaul was
already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-member comittee is holding its final hearing on Thursday,
and is expected to vote in favor for an 8,000-seat stadium on the
North Campus, near the present field.
</P>
<P>
   That would kickstart the building of a $2 million softball
facility and a new baseball field. The second phase in the
renovation to CSUN's gym could take place in the summer. Adding
seats to the second level of the gym would bump capacity to more
than 3,000. &QL; 
Substance-abuse policy &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich likely would not be at CSUN if it weren't for the
arrest by the FBI of former women's basketball coach Abraham on
cocaine-trafficking charges, which eventually led to Bubb's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, consulting with CSUN faculty athletic representative
Tom Shannon, has formed a ``blue-ribbon committee'' to review the
school's substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also an extensive employee-assistance program that
includes a monthly seminar,'' Jankovich said. ``I feel that's going

N.Y. COLUMN: CULTURE CITY TALKS TRASH TO UNIMPRESSED
VISITORS  (bl)  
By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a way to keep the Great Trash War from
spinning out of control and landing in court as Giuliani vs. All
States:
</P>
<P>
   Insist that visitors to New York take their garbage with them
when they go back home. The city could even make money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   This and other revenue-generating ideas percolated Monday, the
holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. No disrespect,
but on the day of tribute to the martyred civil-rights leader, many
New Yorkers were more interested in tax deals that they could get
on clothing purchases than in his reflections on the human
condition.
</P>
<P>
   They took advantage of another week of tax-free shopping, and
looked forward to a permanent reduction of more than 50 percent,
scheduled to go into effect in December on sales under $110. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani would like to eliminate every last tax on
clothing, and it is hard to imagine many New Yorkers' putting up an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   But since pendulums tend to swing, what will happen when the
economy heads south, causing store sales to slump, retail jobs to
shrink and municipal revenue to sag? The day may yet come when city
and state governments wish they had not waved goodbye to that sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Although recommendations on fiscal policy are not normally the
province of this department, the battle over New York's garbage
exports inspired a thought or two, offered here free to municipal
planners.
</P>
<P>
   Virginians, as you may have heard, got their noses out of joint
just because the mayor said they should be thrilled to bury our
trash in their soil. We give the outlanders Broadway and the Met,
and what do they do? They add to our mountains of garbage. There
should be more give and take, Giuliani suggested, a call for a
``reciprocal relationship'' that fell on many deaf ears in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   How about a different tack?
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia and other states refuse to help out, why not impose
a garbage-handling fee on the 32 million visitors a year to the
city? You could start with a small surcharge, say, $3 a day, on
each of the city's 60,000 hotel rooms, which are filled these days
almost to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Three dollars would entail no hardship for guests already paying
close to $200 a night on average. But the fee could produce about
$65 million, roughly 10 percent of the Sanitation Department's
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   True, it does smell like a new tax, which may cause the mayor to
wrinkle his nose. In that case, to return to the idea at the top,
why not make visitors cart their garbage home?
</P>
<P>
   Trash bags could be handed out at airports and train stations,
with prominent signs informing arriving out-of-towners what is
expected of them. Since most Americans consider themselves more
polite and, over all, more virtuous than New Yorkers, they could be
counted on to comply. They could be charged 25 cents or so per bag,
an inconsequential sum that should cover the cost of the program
and just might yield a profit.
</P>
<P>
   And if the city only breaks even, there will be other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When the guests are ready to return home, many will inevitably
ask hotel attendants, apartment-house doormen, taxi drivers and
airport skycaps to help them carry the filled bags. That means
extra tips and more money for New Yorkers. The result could be an
income-tax bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they do not declare these tips, thousands of workers
will have more to spend, which means more sales-tax revenue and
smaller municipal budget deficits in hard times. Everyone benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Please note that New Jersey, too, has crudely told New York what
it can do with its trash. ``Drop dead,'' Gov. Christie Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Does she not know that two can play that game?
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey drivers are notoriously aggressive, and every day
thousands of them bring their road rage into Manhattan, blaring
horns and brushing back pedestrians in the crosswalks. They are
easily identified by their license plates. Why not order a police
crackdown? Public safety and the municipal treasury would both be
better off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vexing part of the trash wars is a suggestion
from some in Virginia that Giuliani has been acting a bit loopy.
That is a slur. Maybe it would help if an affirmation that the
mayor makes sense, and New Yorkers support him, were written into
any garbage-disposal contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Virginia, there is a sanity clause.
</P>

JETS NOTEBOOK: A GRATEFUL OWNER; PACKING IT IN; TESTAVERDE
BRISTLES; SAY GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets' flight home from Denver touched down
at 1:15 Monday morning at La Guardia Airport, and the players
walked out, tired and disappointed. There was no admiring group of
fans waiting; the combination of the late hour, the bad weather and
the season's frustrating conclusion kept the crowd away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as they left the plane they were amazed to find the team's
84-year-old owner, Leon Hess, standing and waiting for them. Hess,
who has not attended a road game since 1997, met the team's plane
and, dressed in a suit and tie, greeted each player, shaking hands
and thanking his players for their effort, despite the team
returning without the Super Bowl berth that he has wished so hard
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very classy move,'' running back Keith Byars said.
``If he hadn't been there, nobody would have taken offense. We know
he wants to get to a Super Bowl. He's not getting any younger and
he deserves it. He said he's very proud of us. He's a man of few
words. He shook everybody's hand. You can't help but love an owner
who does that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jason Fabini, a rookie offensive lineman, added: ``It was a
great gesture for him. At 1:30 a.m., he was there. Win or lose, he
stuck with us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hess, who was one of the original five owners that salvaged the
team from bankruptcy court in 1963 and renamed it from the Titans
to the Jets, became the sole owner in 1984. Although he calls the
team his greatest enjoyment, he rarely appears at a game. But he
makes an annual visit to the team's practice facility on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to come out and show his appreciation,'' Coach
Bill Parcells said. ``It was very nice. We didn't console anybody.
It was just to shake hands and say thank you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chad Cascadden agreed, noting: ``He didn't say much. He just
congratulated us. I thought it was an extremely nice gesture. It
shows his dedication to the team.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PACKING IT IN
</P>
<P>
   Not long after landing, the Jets gathered at their Hofstra
University training site under less memorable circumstances,
emptying their lockers into garbage bags and cans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pat on the back from Hess did little to soothe the Jets,
even on the day after. The team took little consolation in the
improvement the franchise has made in the last two seasons, getting
little sleep afterward and finding little solace in the encouraging
words during a team meeting Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants moral victories,'' Keyshawn Johnson said. ``What
are you going to say _ `We got to the AFC championship, that's
wonderful,' and everybody should smile and be happy about it? No,
that's not the case.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TESTAVERDE BRISTLES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde proved himself this season, earning a spot on
the Pro Bowl roster, and he was steady again on Sunday. Still, the
Broncos, particularly linebacker Bill Romanowski, verbally jabbed
at him after the game, saying that they believed that he could be
rattled and that he fell apart in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a history of doing that,'' Romanowski said after the
game. ``He gets hot at the beginning of the game. But when things
got tough, he struggled. To me, that's what he's shown over his
career.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde bristled at the remarks, replying only that: ``I'm
not surprised that they would say that. But for guys that got
ripped pretty good in the passing game, they just better prepare
for the Atlanta Falcons.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde finished 31 of 52 passing for 356 yards after
completing his first 13 passes. He did throw a pair of
interceptions, but on the first Wayne Chrebet slipped as the pass
was released, and the second was a tipped ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, a lot of things that were being said early in
camp, most of my career, I think I've hopefully put to bed, put to
rest, a lot of those ghosts,'' said Testaverde, who added that he
believed he would sign a contract that would make him a Jet for the
rest of his career. ``That was just something people had opinions
on, things that I never believed. I always believed I could come in
and be successful and help the team and make it as far as we
did.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAY GOODBYE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that he spoke Monday with the veterans Pepper
Johnson, Keith Byars and Dave Meggett, filling in each of them on
their status with the team. Johnson was told that the team would
likely look to go for a younger player who could contribute on
special teams in his spot, but that the decision to try to continue
his career would be left to him. Meggett and Byars were also
cautioned that the team did not want them to impede the progress of
younger players.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Byars said he believed he could play another year, physically,
but the decision will be whether he can commit to another season,
mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a rapid decline in skills,'' he said. ``I can
still play, despite what my birth certificate says. I can still
run, catch, and block. There's no question I still love the game.
But, like Brian Cox, my wife and family are away from me. It's hard
to be a part-time dad. I have kids that are 6 and 4, and they ask
me, `When are you coming home?' I tell them I don't know and they
don't understand. It's tough on them and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age, 35 years young, you have to ask yourself, do you
want to. I feel good. I'm healthy and happy. I want to play again.
It's going to take something to pull me away from this working
environment.'' &QL;

NBA GETS CAUGHT IN TRANSITION GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen appears headed for Houston, and Dennis Rodman may
be teaming up with Shaquille O'Neal in Los Angeles. As to where
Latrell Sprewell will land, no one seems to know.
</P>
<P>
   As the hot stove flares and reports of possible deals spin
wildly, only one certainty has emerged from the shortened National
Basketball Association season: training camps will not open when
originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the union and the NBA are still trying to define the
terms of the new collective bargaining agreement _ a process that
was supposed to be finished Monday night. With the possibility that
the deal could be reduced to writing by Wednesday, officials on
both sides were concerned that the lockout would not be lifted
until late this week. Camps had been expected to open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now the free-agent signing period may not begin until the
weekend, giving general managers more time to work privately in an
effort to improve their teams.
</P>
<P>
   The most tantalizing topic seems to be Sprewell, who, according
to two Eastern Conference executives, the Knicks are in the hunt
for along with Portland and possibly Seattle. The Knicks are said
to be interested in parting with Chris Mills and Chris Childs to
land Sprewell, the Golden State guard who sent the franchise and
the league into turmoil in December 1997 when he choked Coach P.J.
Carlesimo. Sprewell has not played an NBA game in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whom the Blazers or the Seattle SuperSonics would
trade for Sprewell, though Portland forward Brian Grant has been
mentioned in several reports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pippen's expected departure from the Chicago Bulls to
the Rockets may be getting closer. The Associated Press reported
Monday night that Pippen, 33, would sign a deal worth $67.2 million
for five years with the Bulls and then be dealt to Houston for the
forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both teams would not confirm the deal Monday night,
and on the surface it does not sound like a good trade for the
Bulls. But Pippen is a free agent and can leave the Bulls without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's acquisition should clear the way for Charles Barkley to
re-sign with Houston. That would give the Rockets a front line of
Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the Bulls are on their way to a complete
disassembling, Rodman's agent has spoken with the Lakers about
playing for the $1 million exception over the salary cap. It was
unclear how many other suitors were interested in the rebounding
leader's services, but Rodman's desire to market himself in
Hollywood does not hurt the Lakers' prospects.
</P>
<P>
   No deals can be signed until the contract agreement is reduced
to writing. Though the two sides have apparently ironed out a major
difference over midlevel exception contracts _ the league has
tentatively agreed that the contracts can be signed for up to six
years _ several minor issues need to be resolved before the union
and the league finish the process.
</P>
<P>
   One involves salary cap circumvention, or how to insure teams
and agents do not conspire to go around the agreement's terms in
their negotiations.

MUSLIMS TO END FAST OF RAMADAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: ``Today''in story refers to Tuesday, Jan. 19.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Muslims in Los Angeles and across the nation
celebrated the end of the monthlong fast of Ramadan on Monday with
communal prayers at mosques and special treat-filled meals at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan is the Muslim holy month of the lunar calendar, during
which, from the break of dawn to sunset, devoted followers abstain
from eating, drinking and engaging in sexual intercourse. The exact
date of the end of Ramadan is governed by the sighting of the new
moon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hundreds of L.A.-area Muslims broke their fast
shortly after 5 p.m. before heading to the Islamic Center
Northridge's Masjid Granada Hills to mark the start of the
three-day Eid ul-Fitr, or ``feast of fast breaking'' holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The masjid's Imam Qazi Fazlullah of Granada Hills said even more
people are expected to convene this morning for a special Eid
prayer and a daylong celebration that involves large family
gatherings, exchanging of social visits and sumptuous meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much great feeling because the Ramadan is the
month of blessing, of mercy and of forgiveness,'' Fazlullah said.
</P>
<P>
   He said fasting for Ramadan is not only among the highest
commands in the Muslim faith, but ``by doing so we feel some
spiritual development, improvement and satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Many worshippers will dress their best today _ often in
traditional outfits of their ancestral homelands. Some communities
will follow prayers with open bazaars.
</P>
<P>
   Eid ul-Fitr is the first of the two major Muslim holidays. The
second one is celebrated at the end of the hajj, or the pilgrimage
to Mecca. An estimated 2,350 Muslims live in Los Angeles and about
600,000 reside in Southern California. Worldwide, the population is
estimated at 1.2 billion, including some 6 million Muslims living
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to common belief, most Muslims living in this country _
an estimated 70 percent _ are American-born, according to Hussam
Ayloush, executive director of the Anaheim-based Council on
American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ayloush and Fazzlulah both said this year's Ramadan was a
particularly sad one for worshippers as they followed news of
violence against Muslims around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they noted that the month of Ramadan started Dec.
19, shortly after U.S. and British forces attacked Iraq, and
remarked on last week's massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serbs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is just going around to Muslim centers that
everyone has been feeling kind of down,'' Ayloush said. ``There is
a sadness among the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Muslim community leaders said, in addition to spreading
the word about Ramadan, their mission is to build greater
understanding of their faith to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the Muslims feel that there are people who are busy
spreading violence and prejudice (against Muslims), (saying)
Muslims are terrorists and disturbing the peace, when that is not
true,'' Fazzlulah said. ``Islam is the message of peace and
brotherhood. That's why we try every time to invite non-Muslims to
our mosques, and tell them we are a people who are very peaceful
and who respect humanity.'' &QL;

SOSA SKIPS A DINNER THAT WAS TO HONOR HIM

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs slugger who with Mark
McGwire electrified the baseball world last season, was a no-show
at Monday night's Congress of Racial Equality dinner at which he
was to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said that Sosa had agreed several weeks ago to attend
the event, a fund-raiser for CORE, on the national holiday
celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and that they expected
until the last minute that he would attend. About 2,500 people did
attend, including Sen. Charles Schumer and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Mel A. Sachs, the general counsel for CORE, said Sosa's
appearance had been confirmed three times, but then ``they kept
making more and more demands, until we were just unable _ and
unwilling _ to meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Roy Innis, national chairman of CORE, the
organization had agreed to provide Sosa with first-class airline
tickets from his home in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic, to
New York and back, a limousine in New York and a double hotel
suite. Innis said that the requests from Sosa's representatives
then began to increase, including a private jet to the Mike Tyson
fight in Las Vegas, then to New York and back to the Dominican
Republic. Innis said requests were also made for $50,000 in
contributions and an auction of Sosa memorabilia, all for Sosa's
charity in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Innis added that two first-class round-trip plane tickets for
Sosa in the Santo Domingo airport had not been picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Katz, Sosa's representative in Los Angeles, said that the
CORE statements about the Sosa negotiations were inaccurate and ``a
distortion.'' He would not comment further.

NETS GET A DEFENSIVE SPECIALIST IN MCILVAINE

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For the past two seasons, the Nets have
been trying to build themselves into a championship contender, and
Monday they took another step toward their goal. In a move they
believe will strengthen their defense considerably, the Nets traded
for Jim McIlvaine, one of the league's best shot blockers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league executive familiar with the deal, the Nets
sent the center Michael Cage, 36, and the forward Don MacLean to
Seattle for McIlvaine, a 7-foot-1-inch, 265-pound center who has
been among the league leaders in blocked shots a minute the last
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will not become official until the National Basketball
Association legalizes its new collective bargaining agreement later
this week, so officials from the Nets and the Sonics could not
comment on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine, entering his fifth year out of Marquette, figures to
improve a Nets defense that was among the most permeable in the
league last year. With the converted center Jayson Williams and the
aging Cage manning the middle, the Nets blocked just 314 shots,
fourth-lowest in the league and 201 fewer than their opponents
blocked against them. That was one reason their defense allowed
98.1 points a game, ninth-worst in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine will back up Williams and Rony Seikaly for the Nets,
so his minutes will be limited. But he is not suited to play more
than 20 minutes a game anyway. He has little offense and is not
much of a rebounder, so he is at his best when serving as a
defensive spark off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed his best season three years ago as a substitute in
Washington when, playing behind Gheorghe Muresan, he averaged 2.1
blocks in less than 15 minutes a game. That ability led Seattle to
sign McIlvaine to a lucrative seven-year, $35 million free-agent
contract despite his paltry averages of 2.3 points and 2.9
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   One Nets players, when notified of the deal for McIlvaine, said,
``He's just what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics envisioned McIlvaine as a full-time player who would
perhaps block twice as many shots as he had as a sub, but his lack
of an all-around game limited him to disappointing averages of 18
minutes a game two years ago and 15 minutes last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' hopes, however, are not as high. They don't need
offense or rebounding from McIlvaine, just blocks. If he can block
two shots a game in less than 20 minutes, he will have done his
job.
</P>
<P>
   In improving one of their biggest deficiencies, the Nets lost
little. Cage, though a voice of inspiration in the locker room, was
well past his prime. In Seattle, he will return to the site of his
best years, when he averaged 8.1 rebounds from 1988 to 1994. Still
able to bang, Cage will make the talented but soft Sonics tougher
both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-10 MacLean, who missed all but nine games last season
because of injuries, is in his prime, but with the Nets' abundance
of forwards, he was expendable. With Williams, who will play both
center and power forward, Keith Van Horn, Chris Gatling and Kendall
Gill ahead of him, MacLean, a 12-point scorer for his career, would
have seen little action.

WHITE HOUSE RELUCTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SCANDAL IN THE MIDST OF
THE  STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like other White House officials, Communications
Director Ann Lewis was asked over the weekend what effect the
impeachment trial would have on President Clinton's State of the
Union address tonight.
</P>
<P>
   None, she insisted. No impact on the speech. No impact on the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about doing the people's business,'' Lewis said,
repeating the White House's populist mantra. ``It is what makes the
biggest difference with people, this year, next year, and into the
next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress engages in a historic constitutional exercise
and the Lewinsky matter begins to eat into a second year of
Clinton's term, the White House steadfastly refuses to acknowledge
that the scandal has forced it into making any policy concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Monica. Forget impeachment. Forget ``lame duck-ness.''
The president's posture will be that everything is on track _ the
nation's well-being and the health of his presidency _ as he
delivers what promises to be the most awkward State of the Union
address in history.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 6 p.m. PST, Clinton will stride into the very
chamber where he was impeached exactly one month earlier. The
audience will include members of the House, who just impeached him,
and members of the Senate, who hold his fate.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Washington's most ritualized displays of political
pageantry. Even most Republicans say they will be there to politely
applaud the president _ the office, if not the man _ even if they
do so somewhat reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   The speech provides Clinton a rare opportunity to address a
nationally televised audience for more than an hour, without the
prospect of embarrassing questions or the taint of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides say Clinton relishes the opportunity. ``It is
probably his favorite day of the year,'' said Clinton adviser Paul
Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said it is very unlikely he will mention the impeachment
saga. Instead, he will focus on an ambitious domestic agenda, one
more fitting a new president than one six years into office, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is expected to be on Social Security and education.
Aides said Clinton will call on Republicans to work with him to
retool Social Security, but he is unlikely to outline a specific
proposal. On education, Clinton will announce a plan to hold states
and school districts accountable for the achievements of students
and teachers, and tie billions of dollars in federal aide to such
ideas as ending social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He is also expected to propose new school construction; a tax
credit of $250 per child for stay-at-home parents of young
children; a plan to improve health care for many of the nation's 32
million uninsured; and a $110 billion boost in defense spending
over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the end of the speech, people will look not at an
administration that has entered the last two years of office and is
slowing down, but an administration that is energized and is
looking forward to moving into the 21st century with an ambitious
and activist agenda,'' said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, Clinton's proposals will boost his
popularity. But even if the Senate quickly concludes his trial with
an acquittal, no one knows what effect his impeachment by the House
will have on his ability to move legislation. The only other
impeached president, Andrew Johnson, was virtually powerless after
he was acquitted by the Senate in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Johnson, Clinton remains quite popular with the public,
and the White House says his proposals will succeed. ``Those are
policies that are going to do well, and we're going to be able to
achieve some legislative agreement on,'' Lewis said, ``because that
is what the American people want us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars disagree over the extent to which Clinton will be
hobbled by his impeachment. Some argue that relations are so
poisonous with lawmakers that few of his initiatives will be
approved. Others speculate that Republicans will be eager to pass
substantive measures to convince the public that they are not
obsessed with investigating the president.
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus that the final years of a presidency tend
to be the least productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Monica Lewinsky had never flashed her underwear
outside the Oval Office, one would still have the reality of lame
duck-ness,'' observed Richard Haas, a scholar at the Washington
based Brookings Institution and a former national security aide to
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said he doubts the trouble will have enormous impact in
matters of foreign policy, but he noted that Clinton may have lost
opportunities for pushing initiatives such as a Middle East peace
accord or expanding international trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most precious resource for a president is often time, and
time spent with lawyers is time not spent with assistant
secretaries of state,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   Some evidence suggests that Clinton's effectiveness has been
eroded. A study of congressional votes conducted by the independent
Congressional Quarterly called Clinton's legislative year ``a
failure,'' noting that ``virtually all of of his major proposals
died.'' They said that just 51 percent of the 154 bills he
supported passed, the sixth worst record of any president since CQ
began tracking such things 46 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in his state of the Union address, for example,
Clinton called for a health care bill of rights, new restrictions
on tobacco sales, campaign finance reform, expanded Medicare
benefits, a higher minimum wage, expanded child care programs and
new school construction. No such measures were passed.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart noted that the president did succeed in what he termed
the two ``central economic challenges'' outlined in last year's
address: staving off tax cuts and preserving the budget surplus
until Social Security is reformed, and winning new funds for the
International Monetary Fund. He was also able to win funds for
after-school care, new teachers and other pet projects, Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Clinton's poll numbers rise and Congress' fall, it is
possible to make the case that a year of scandal has done little
harm to Clinton's standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Brookings Institution held a forum last week entitled ``Life
Under a Weakened Presidency,'' prompting the think tank's president
Michael Armacost, a former national security adviser in the Reagan
administration, to muse that ``perhaps one should put a question
mark'' after the title.

ELWAY NEEDS TO LET IT GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After John Elway finally won a Super Bowl on his fourth try,
some silly scribes advised him to call it a career and get on with
his charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about us.
</P>
<P>
   We admit it, we urged Elway to retire to that Barcalounger in
the skyboxes after the Broncos' 31-24 win over the defending
champion Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Our concern was
that by coming back for a 16th season, Elway was needlessly
fiddling with a perfectly Runyonesque ending.
</P>
<P>
   Our internal editing mechanism was in overdrive, as usual,
spewing its old, familiar refrain: No more tinkering. Let it go.
</P>
<P>
   We honestly couldn't see how Elway was going to improve upon his
San Diego ending. It would have been like asking Margaret Mitchell
to bang out a sequel to ``Gone with the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Great stories are not easily surpassed. If you don't believe it,
look at Bret Easton Ellis' career since ``Less than Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   We didn't think there could be a more stirring final sentence
than the one Broncos owner Pat Bowlen screamed loud enough for all
of Qualcomm Stadium and, thanks to the obsequiousness of
television, the whole world to hear after the Broncos beat back the
Pack: ``This one's for John!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's plain now that Elway had one more scintillating
chapter up his sleeve, one more story line that oh so neatly ties
up all the remaining loose ends of his Hall of Fame career. By
hanging around to help lead the Broncos to a second consecutive
Super Bowl berth, Elway has a chance to bury the Atlanta Falcons _
and the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are coached by Dan Reeves, who was Elway's boss in
Denver for 10 years. Back then Reeves was the Terry Donahue of the
NFL, rigidly espousing the system over any individual player. Elway
felt shackled by Reeves' run-oriented offense and he never forgave
Reeves for firing assistant coach (and Elway ally) Mike Shanahan
after the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' own contract wasn't renewed after the Broncos' 8-8
campaign of 1992. In his farewell press conference, he alluded to
the uneasy alliance he had with Elway, saying, ``I have a lot of
respect for John. . . . But I don't know that John has as much
respect for me as I have for him.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, he's had a funny way of showing it the past few
years. The characteristic graciousness that makes Elway an easy
target for every autograph seeker and charitable cause has ducked
out on him when talk turns to Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   The former Granada Hills High standout has described his years
under Reeves as ``hell,'' the Broncos' three Super Bowl appearances
in that span notwithstanding. Elway has been especially critical of
the conservative play- calling that set the stage for all of his
last-drive theatrics during the Reeves era in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The grudge does not become Elway, who in all other respects is a
refreshingly uncomplicated superstar. We're talking about someone
who last summer turned down a spot on a late-night television talk
show so he could spend the time hanging out with his high school
buddies during a brief stopover in Southern California to see the
Granada Hills stadium renamed in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: The fact that Elway has lashed out in anger and
frustration at a supervisor with whom he didn't see eye-to-eye
doesn't make him a bad human being, just a numbingly normal one.
The trouble is, for too many of us, such vitriol is like an
intravenous drip, nourishing our rancor and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is blessed with the perfect stage for cleansing. He has
the chance to let the healing begin right here, right now. Some
time in the next two weeks he can stand in front of a bouquet of
microphones and deliver a good-hearted soliloquy.
</P>
<P>
   He took a step in the right direction after Sunday's win over
the New York Jets when he said of Reeves, ``He's got (the Falcons)
playing great and Dan is a great football coach. When you look at
what he's done in the last two years with them, it's just
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few more respectful words about what Reeves did for an
overwhelmed, unsure quarterback in his younger years, Elway, in his
own indubitable way, can show beyond a doubt that he is a bigger
person than the game to be played before an audience numbering in
the millions on Jan. 31 in Miami.

A SWEET RENT DEAL FOR 3,000 MAY BE GOING SOUR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like just about every tenant in the twin red-brick
Ruppert Yorkville Towers, Marie Mitchell knows she has one of the
sweetest living arrangements in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For her one-bedroom apartment overlooking a rather desirable
slice of the Upper East Side at Third Avenue and 91st Street, Ms.
Mitchell, 54, pays just $603.34 a month. Her last rent increase _
an annual rite for thousands of the city's renters _ was in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it is an extremely good deal,'' she said, seated in
her kitchen, coaxing her rotund cat to her lap.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a deal that was to have ended on Jan. 1. Now, it
is part of a bitter court battle in which 3,000 middle-income
residents of the towers are trying to force their landlord to stay
in a rent-regulation program it is legally permitted to leave.
State and city housing officials say the lawsuit filed by the
Ruppert Yorkville Tenants Association is the first of its kind
involving the statewide program, known as Mitchell-Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord, Yorkville Towers Associates, appears intent on
imposing huge increases, some as much as 200 percent, to convert
its 1,258 units to market-value rents. Last Friday, the company
sent letters notifying tower residents of a countersuit and warning
that it would raise rents even higher if the tenants' association
pursued its case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Yorkville Towers Associates announced its intention
to withdraw from Mitchell-Lama, a state- and city-operated program
that regulates rent increases for about 125,000 apartments in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell-Lama program, named for the two state legislators
who sponsored it in 1955, Sen. MacNeil Mitchell, a Manhattan
Republican, and Assemblyman Alfred A. Lama, a Brooklyn Democrat,
was intended to spur the construction of buildings for
middle-income tenants while providing a 6 percent profit to
landlords. Under the program, landlords can only raise rents with
government approval, a process that usually takes months and often
years. But the law includes a provision that allows landlords to
buy their way out of the program _ by paying off the long-term
bonds that financed construction of their building _ after it has
been occupied for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To leave Mitchell-Lama, Yorkville Towers Associates would have
to repay about $63 million in mortgage and other payments to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   At first, when the company announced its departure from
Mitchell-Lama, many Ruppert Yorkville Towers tenants, including Ms.
Mitchell and her neighbor, Hazel Jordan, shrugged. They expected
marginal rent increases. But in November, the management disclosed
new rents that in some cases were triple what tenants were paying.
</P>
<P>
   The renters were furious. Many said the new prices were, in
effect, eviction notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones who made this area and now we have to get
out,'' said Ms. Jordan, 65, a retired law office administrator who
pays $606 a month for her one-bedroom apartment. When their leases
expire later this year, she and Ms. Mitchell, who lives one floor
below, must either agree to an increase to $1,596 a month or move
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified,'' said Ms. Jordan, who relies on a pension and
Social Security income to pay her bills. ``Where am I going to go
where I don't need a car?''
</P>
<P>
   Another tenant, Susan Nier, said she would refuse to pull her
11-year-old son, Sam, out of a school and neighborhood they both
love. ``The bottom line was, `Pay or get out,''' said Ms. Nier, 45,
a single mother whose rent for her two-bedroom apartment is
scheduled to jump from $753, to $2,280, when her lease expires in
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it turns out, is going anywhere for now. The tenants'
association's $280 million lawsuit, filed last month in state
Supreme Court, has forced Yorkville Towers Associates to delay its
departure from the program. Among other allegations, the lawsuit
contends that Yorkville Towers has unfairly hoarded rent money and
is obligated to remain under Mitchell-Lama until 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``They indicated there would be no accommodations made for
senior citizens, the handicapped, anyone,'' said Stuart M. Saft,
the tenants' lawyer. The standard Ruppert Yorkville Towers leases,
he said, do not stipulate management's right eventually to leave
the Mitchell-Lama program.
</P>
<P>
   And some tenants, like Richard Catrone, a tower resident named
as one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said the building's
management had assured tenants that their rents would never rise
without approval from the city's Department of Housing Preservation
and Development, one of the agencies that oversees the
Mitchell-Lama program.
</P>
<P>
   Albert A. Walsh, the lawyer for Yorkville Towers Associates,
declined to comment on the lawsuit except to say the landlord has
no obligation to remain in the program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of the 242 developments in New York City under Mitchell-Lama
rent restrictions, all except one are eligible to leave the
program. At a time when at least two other Mitchell-Lama complexes
have applied to buy out of the program, a court victory by the
Ruppert Yorkville Towers tenants could pave the way for other
tenant lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ruppert Yorkville Towers tenants are intent on winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all that anyone talks about,'' said Ms. Mitchell, who
is a shipping manager for a West Side printing company and is
considering taking in a roommate or moving to Harlem or New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she said, she asked an elderly neighbor how he
planned to pay higher rent. ``He broke down and cried,'' she said.
``I felt terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all faced with the plague, but this is serious,''
she said. ``We're losing our homes.''

AT HOME IS EXPECTED TO ACQUIRE EXCITE IN MAJOR INTERNET DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf to be more precise about attempts to reach
executives; ADDS estimated per-share price of deal , explainer on
portals, background.)  
(fe) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Home Corp., a high-speed Internet service
aimed at cable television subscribers, intends to announce on
Tuesday that it will acquire Excite Inc., one of the leading
Internet destinations, in a stock transaction valued about $6
billion, according to a person involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would be one of the biggest in a flurry
of recent Internet acquisitions, exceeding even the $4.2 billion
purchase of Netscape by America Online announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies met on Monday night to work on
last-minute issues. Barring last-minute snags, an announcement is
planned in New York before the opening of the stock market. Any
deal would have to be approved by the shareholders of both
companies. It is also possible that a last-minute snag could delay
the agreement, but most of the details have been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   At Home refused to comment on the reports about negotiations,
and Excite officials did not return phone calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would strengthen At Home's position in the competition
for destination sites, known as portals, that is increasingly
defining the commercial Internet. It would also sharpen the
position of AT&AMP;T, which is now concluding its acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., At Home's major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Excite's shareholders would
receive about 30 percent of At Home in a stock transaction
involving the issuing of new shares. The resulting company would be
named At Home, and George Bell, Excite's chief executive, would
become an At Home board member as well as take an executive
position in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of At Home's stock outstanding is about $10.4 billion,
while Excite's shares are worth a total of about $3.5 billion.
Excite's stock closed Friday at $67.50, up $2.375, while At Home
closed at $102, down 62.5 cents. At $6 billion, the proposed deal
values each share of Excite at more than $116, more than 72 percent
above its Friday closing price of $67.50.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has more than 330,000 customers for its service,
which provides high-speed Internet data via cable networks. The
deal would give it access to both Excite's users _ it is the sixth
most heavily trafficked site on the Internet _ and to the company's
content development capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Excite is attractive to At Home as a potential vehicle to market
its high-speed cable modem network to those dialing in with
conventional modems through telephone lines. In addition, Excite
offers a popular Internet brand name as well as the nucleus of an
expanded content development capability that would become the heart
of a future At Home service.
</P>
<P>
   Both At Home and Excite! are based in Redwood City, a San
Francisco suburb on the Northern edge of Silicon Valley. The
offices of Tom Jermolak, At Home's chief executive, and Bell are
separated by a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to strike an agreement was heightened in recent
weeks because several other companies were interested in bidding
for Excite, including Yahoo, a competing large portal and search
engine, and Microsoft, according to people close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A report of a possible deal between the two companies appeared
on Monday in The San Jose Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would represent the biggest play yet in the rush to
combine Internet access with portals, the starting point for
millions of users. In the last year, portals have evolved by
mergers and acquisitions of Web directories, or search engines, and
content providers, including everything from traditional forms of
printed news to audio and video entertainment, e-mail, and online
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the recent acquisition of Netscape Communications
by America Online, Snap, an Internet provider partly owned by NBC,
Monday announced a high-speed Internet service with partners
including Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T the At Home-Excite deal could ultimately help shape its
strength in a wide range of Internet services, including dialup
access via its AT&AMP;T Worldnet service, which the TCI and At Home
offering that will permit it to offer both high speed Internet as
well as local telephone services. and a new Excite brand which
could serve as both a portal and an important content brand to
rival other major Internet players such as Microsoft, Disney and
America Online.
</P>

   From a business standpoint, the object of a portal is to offer a
starting point to millions of Web users and then attract
advertisers to place banner ads on the Web pages those users see.
Depending on the sophistication of the portal software, these ads
can often be narrowly aimed just at users who have expressed
interest in certain subjects or products or who have demonstrated
desired buying habits or who fit narrowly defined demographics.
</P>
<P>
   And as America Online has proved by attracting more than 15
million members, providing a combination of access to the Internet
and content that will keep users hanging around the portal's pages
rather than moving out to other parts of cyberspace is a winning
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, At Home has followed that formula. The
difference is that its users are all accessing the Internet at
blazing speeds over cable modems _ in many cases faster than the
access they have over high-speed telephone lines at work. At Home's
cable modems can deliver data to home personal computers at speeds
in excess of 3 million bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   At Home has developed a portal that takes full advantage of that
access speed, offering colorful, animated pages packed with
multimedia content that other portals would not dare offer their
users, the vast majority of whom are using dial-up modems at speeds
less of than 50,000 bits per second.

JOHN GROSS: GIULIANI'S FRIEND AND CAUTIOUS FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John H. Gross is one of those people you've never
heard of. His name doesn't appear in the gossip columns. His
specialty is insurance law. He spends quiet weekends kayaking on
Sagaponack Pond on Long Island, or taking his two daughters on
nature walks. No one, it is safe to say, has ever called him a
character. But if you had a lot of money, you would let him take
care of it.
</P>
<P>
   So back in 1989, when Gross happened to wander out of the room
when the inner circle was divvying up jobs for Rudolph Giuliani's
first (unsuccessful) run for mayor, the gang made Gross treasurer.
Nobody else wanted it, and Gross was in any case perfect. ``You can
get in trouble if you don't do it right,'' said Peter Powers,
Giuliani's longtime friend and adviser, who described Gross the way
everybody does, as ``a very cautious person.''
</P>
<P>
   That year Gross helped raise $5 million. For the successful 1993
Giuliani campaign, he got up to $11 million. By Giuliani's 1997
re-election campaign, it was $11 million again, with big
contributions from the city's developers _ raised faster and in
larger amounts than for any other mayor in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   And now, over the next two years, Gross' job is to raise $10
million for Giuliani's campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war chest of $10 million would be easily sufficient,'' said
Gross, even though it cost Sen. Charles Schumer more than $15
million last year to run against the incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato,
who spent more than $20 million and lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Gross says Giuliani is known enough upstate to get away with
the discount cost: ``When I go up to St. Lawrence County on
business, and I turn on the news, the news is New York City news.
And the mayor is on those channels. So if you want to go all the
way up to the Canadian border, you see the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the mayor is only ``exploring'' the Senate race even
as his advisers march in that direction. To cover his options, last
spring the mayor formed three political committees _ ``Friends of
Giuliani,'' ``Solutions America'' and ``Giuliani for New York'' _
to raise money for travel, political seminars and potential
Giuliani races for president, senator and governor. So far the
committees have only $600,000 in hand, although more is pledged.
Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's former chief of staff, is the new
executive director at Solutions America. Gross oversees that
committee as well as the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Gross, 58, talked in his office at the midtown law
firm of Proskauer, Rose, then over lunch at a Japanese restaurant.
His friendship with Giuliani was forged during their good old days
as young prosecutors in the early 1970s at the U.S. attorney's
office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani, whose
aggressive work as a prosecutor inspired the book and movie
``Prince of the City,'' got the indictments. Then Gross tried the
cases, and others. A lot were for heroin smuggling. Life in the
criminal division was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all friends,'' Gross said. ``You've really got to get
this. It was an extraordinarily collegial place, where people were
having a tremendous amount of fun doing what they believed in, with
a lot of responsibility. And within that large group, there was a
subset _ Rudy, myself and a few others, who were really, really
good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have as much fun now? ``No,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Gross and Giuliani often went out to dinner in those days with
their first wives. ( Gross is now married to Judy Gross, a lawyer
who is studying to be a teacher.) Gross, who grew up in the Shaker
Heights suburb of Cleveland _ his father was a jeweler _ still
seems awed by Giuliani as lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people believe the people in the U.S. attorney's office
are the best and the brightest,'' Gross said. ``If that is true,
then Rudy was the best of the best and the brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'70s, they had parted _ Giuliani to the Justice
Department in Washington, Gross to the New York firm of Anderson,
Kill &AMP; Olick. But they stayed in touch when Giuliani returned to
private practice in New York, then when he worked with Gross at
Anderson, Kill in between his 1989 and 1993 campaigns. Gross moved
to Proskauer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gross is most proud of what he calls his cost-conscious
fund-raising, which matters in city races where there are spending
limits. (There are none in the Senate race, but the limit on
individual contributions is $1,000. In the city races, it was
$7,700.) Gross says Giuliani will raise money nationally. In recent
months, the mayor has been to California, Florida, Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gross is especially pleased with his bargaining over fees with
Adam Goodman, the 1997 Giuliani campaign's media consultant. ``That
way you have more money to give to the campaign,'' Gross said,
``and not to give to your media people to put paintings on their
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman confirmed that he negotiated with Gross for two days
over his contract. ``It was fair enough for me to feel loved and
rewarded, but it was also a no-nonsense, hard-driven contract that
is not one we would normally agree to in other campaigns,'' he
said. Then he added: ``The price is going way up in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said Giuliani could beat Hillary Rodham Clinton if she ran
for Senate from New York, but Gross doesn't think she will.

TRASH, GIULIANI TELLS VIRGINIA, IS A GOOD DEAL, NOT AN OBLIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va. )  (ms) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to politicians in Virginia who continue to
rail against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to export more of New
York City's trash, the mayor said Monday he never said other states
were obligated to take the city's garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a question of obligation,'' he said. ``This is a
very big business and it supplies lots of jobs for people. There's
a business here that goes on irrespective of the statements that
the politicians make.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the city pays ``a huge amount of money'' to send its
trash out of state, Giuliani said, ``There are more places that
want to do business with us than you could possibly imagine.'' The
city expects to spend $200 million a year on garbage export by
2002, after the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island is shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made his comments Monday after speaking at the 13th
annual tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music. But even as he softened his stand on whether
other states had a responsibility to take the city's garbage,
Giuliani emphasized that all of the city's 13,000 tons of daily
trash would eventually find its way out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   New York currently ships 2,400 tons of garbage a day to
Virginia, about 60 percent of that state's imported trash. The
current dispute arose last week when Waste Management Inc., a waste
disposal company, signed a contract with a barge company that would
allow up to 4,000 tons of garbage to be transported to a new port
that the company has been building.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York has not signed a contract to increase the
amount of trash it ships there, the possibility of that much more
New York garbage being barged into Virginia to be dumped in
landfills prompted Gov. James S. Gilmore III to say during his
state of the state message last week that he would try to ban
garbage barges on the state's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore and other Virginia politicians also labeled Giuliani
arrogant when he suggested that the rest of the country was in some
way obligated to take the city's trash in exchange for the cultural
and financial benefits generated by New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said last week that since people from across the
country benefit from the city's role as a cultural and business
center, the rest of the country should help the city with its
garbage problem as part of ``a reciprocal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that after Gilmore made his comments, three local
politicians from Virginia called the mayor's office ``saying the
governor is displaying his viewpoint, but at the same time about
four or five thousand jobs depend on this and we have a more
practical approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean every time somebody makes these statements _ some
politician trying to get on television _ we get five mayors and 10
communities to call us and to say, `Don't listen to him, we need
your business,''' the mayor said.

<P>
   W. Page Keeton, a leading expert on tort law who, as longtime
dean at the University of Texas Law School, brought the school to
national prominence, died Jan. 10 at his home in Austin. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   As dean from 1949 to 1974, he presided over the school's growth
in size and stature. After stepping down as dean, he continued to
teach his specialty until four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was the principal author of a 1,050-page tome, ``Products
Liability and Safety, Cases &AMP; Materials,'' and a somewhat slimmer
companion text, ``Products Liability and Safety, Cases and
Materials: Teacher's Manual'' as well as a case and statutory
supplement to them. All three, published as the University Casebook
Series by Foundation Press in 1989, 1990 and 1993, remain in print
and in use at scores of law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his expertise in torts, the body of civil law dealing
with recovery of damages for wrongful acts, he sat on many
government and professional panels. In 1966 he served President
Lyndon B. Johnson as a member of the President's Labor-Management
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Clarksville in northeast Texas, he worked his way
through the University of Texas and then its law school, whose
faculty he joined in 1932. He worked for the federal government
during World War II, then taught at the University of Oklahoma
School of Law and returned to the University of Texas to stay in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   Keeton is survived by his wife, Madge Stewart Keeton; his
daughter, Carole Keeton Rylander, a former Austin mayor who was
sworn in this month as Texas comptroller; a son, Richard P., of
Houston; a sister, Willie R. Keeton Spencer of Dallas; two
brothers, Judge Robert E. Keeton of Boston, and Morris T. of
Columbia, Md.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

HOME BUILDERS PRESERVE SPIRIT OF KING ON HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the nation and Los Angeles commemorated the
life and legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday,
16-year-old Beth Wilion spent the day building houses for poor
people in Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   And she bets King would've approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole civil rights movement that Dr. King helped was a
great thing for so many people. So it makes me feel good that I
could be part of something like this, which is something that he
probably would have supported and would have been a part of, if he
had been here today,'' said Wilion, a junior at Oakwood High School
in North Hollywood, a Los Angeles-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The national holiday was an observance of the 70th anniversary
of the birth of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize winner. King, who
advocated racial equality through peaceful means, was assassinated
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The home-building project was but one way that people marked the
birth of the late civil rights leader _ from parades, to speeches
and banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan and other leaders participated in the 19th
annual Kingdom Day Parade, which started near the corner of
Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards, and traveled a
two-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   And in Panorama City, an L.A.-area suburb, about 35 volunteers
clad in sweatshirts and faded jeans honored King's dream of
equality by helping nine families achieve the American dream of
home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers painted interior walls, plastered exterior walls
and hung drywall at a nine-house Habitat for Humanity project on
Willis Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer homebuilders in Panorama City _ including students
from high schools, AmeriCorps members, and active and retired
workers in the building trades _ said they could have spent the day
relaxing like some of their peers, but found it rewarding to work
for a good cause on a day that honors the late civil rights
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a good time,'' said Alissa Bloch, 16, an Oakwood
High School junior, as a group of volunteers cut drywall board.
</P>
<P>
   That combination of enjoyment and rewarding activity is just
what North Hollywood High School student Joshua Lehrer envisioned
when he helped found the High School Initiative in 1996. The
program, which started out with six campuses and has since expanded
to 14, provides opportunities for students to engage in meaningful
volunteer work, such as the Habitat for Humanity project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to provide a tangible outlet for kids, something
they could point to and say, I did this,'' said Lehrer, 17, as he
took a break from hammering. ``Students want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult volunteers expressed similar feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like helping out,'' said plasterer Butch Balle, a San
Gabriel Valley resident who has volunteered on several Habitat for
Humanity projects. ``It makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine two-story homes, each with a two-car garage, are slated
for completion by the end of April. The low-income families buying
the homes must put in 500 hours of work each, either by helping
with construction or working in Habitat for Humanity offices, as
``sweat equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Riordan was slated to attend the annual King
Week Festival Birthday Celebration Dinner hosted by the Martin
Luther King Legacy Association and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference at the Bonaventure Hotel downtown.

 BENNETT HARRISON, 56, URBAN ECONOMIST
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Bennett Harrison, a leading radical economist,
vocal critic of U.S. economic policy and the co-author of the 1983
book ``The De-Industrialization of America,'' died at home Jan. 17
of complications from cancer of the esophagus. He was 56 and lived
in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was professor of urban political economy at the New
School for Social Research and had just completed the latest of a
dozen books that shared one common message: the need, in his view,
for Washington to play a bigger role to counter what he saw as the
dark side of the Wall Street economy.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Jersey City, N.J., Harrison grew up in an atmosphere
of ethnic tensions; his father changed the family name from
Horowitz to Harrison to get a job at a radio station. An ambitious
student, he relied on scholarships _ first at Brandeis University,
then at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Ph.D. in
economics in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, though, he never entirely left Jersey City. His
academic career reflected an interest in the fate of cities and
their inhabitants, especially blacks.
</P>
<P>
   His first book was about economic development in Harlem, and his
latest academic research, mostly financed by the Ford Foundation,
concerned community development and job training.
</P>
<P>
   He helped found the Union of Radical Political Economists in the
late 1960s but revered the progressives of the 1930s rather than
Marx.
</P>
<P>
   A lively teacher and a popular thesis adviser, he spent most of
his career as a member of the urban studies and planning department
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He only gave up his
full professorship there to follow his then-wife to Carnegie Mellon
in Pittsburgh in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was very much a public intellectual. For upward of 30
years, he played this role mostly in a duet with his best friend
and frequent collaborator, Barry Bluestone, an economist at
Northeastern University in Boston. Harrison devised economic
development plans for a series of left-leaning Democratic
presidential contenders, starting in 1972 with Sen. Fred Harris of
Oklahoma. The plans addressed segments of the economy where in his
view government could play a greater role _ public works,
environmental clean up and mass transit. His prescription scarcely
changed in subsequent campaigns and with subsequent candidates.
While he believed that markets could produce wealth efficiently, he
doubted that they could share it equitably, and he believed that
government somehow could.
</P>
<P>
   A writer with a breezy style and an eye for big ideas, more
popular with readers of editorials than with members of the
economics fraternity, Harrison was one of the first to articulate
the middle-class malaise, a recurring theme of the 1980s. In ``The
De-Industrialization of America,'' written with Bluestone during
the deep recession of 1981-82, he argued that plant closings and
layoffs, not the strong dollar, were weakening American
manufacturing and the blue-collar communities that depended on
factories. By urging Washington to follow Tokyo's lead and adopt a
policy of subsidizing favorite industries like autos and aircraft,
he helped stimulate a national debate. The New York Times reviewer,
an economic adviser to the Carter administration, called the book
intensely irritating but important.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, in 1988, Harrison, again in tandem with his
best friend, turned his attention to inequality, a topic that was
to become hot during the 1992 Clinton-Bush contest. In ``The Great
U-Turn,'' Harrison argued that the gap between high- and low-wage
workers was exploding largely because of shrinking factory
employment and the collapse of the power of the unions.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrison's analysis was not widely accepted _ economists
pretty well agree that inequality reflects the growing demand for
educated workers by an economy increasingly dominated by services _
he had once again succeeded in striking a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his willingness to engage people of varying views in
friendly debate _ from the competitiveness guru Michael Porter to
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo _ Harrison was
not afraid to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Bluestone were routinely introduced as Drs. Doom
and Gloom in the 1980s, his penultimate book, ``Lean and Mean,''
celebrated the vitality of large corporations like IBM and Intel.
And his last book, which Bluestone was promoting in Europe last
week, is a paean to America's resurgent economy. Still, says his
co-author, a central theme is that only Washington, not the private
sector, can insure that the wealth is spread around.
</P>
<P>
   Besides economics, Harrison's passions were baseball and jazz.
In college, he pitched for Brandeis by day and played tenor
saxophone in cafes around Boston by night. At one point, he dropped
out of school for a year to tour jazz clubs around the country. He
was delighted to get a job offer from the New School in 1996 partly
because it meant he could immerse himself in the New York music
scene. When he learned he was dying, he arranged to donate his
instrument, a 1939 Martin, to the New School's jazz program to pass
along to a younger, impecunious musician.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is survived by his wife, Joan Fitzgerald, an urban
planner at the University of Illinois at Chicago, whom he married
just days before his death; his father, Leo of Springfield, N.J.;
his sister, Deborah Kuperman of Highland Park, N.J., and his former
wife, Maryann Kelly, a sociologist in Washington. &QL;

   David Dempsey, a reviewer, biographer, novelist, columnist,
fiction and magazine writer who as a Marine Corps combat
correspondent during World War II covered four Pacific landings
toting a rifle and a typewriter, died Jan. 13 at his home in Rye,
N.Y. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific author, his talents embraced a variety of topics and
mediums ranging from plays to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most versatile writers I ever knew, a
consummate craftsman in the way he could size up almost any subject
and get to its essence with ease and finesse,'' said Willard R.
Espy, an autobiographer and writer on language who has been a
friend and colleague of Dempsey's since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   While he was a Marine Corps sergeant, Dempsey won the first
prize of $500 in a one-act play contest sponsored by the Third
Naval District. The play, ``It Ain't Brooklyn,'' about an attack on
a troop transport in the Pacific, was begun just before the Allied
invasion of the Marshall Islands, but work on it had to be
suspended until the action was over. The judges included Moss Hart,
John Golden, Rachel Crothers and Russel Crouse, and the play was
included in an anthology, ``Best One-Act Plays of 1944.''
</P>
<P>
   With several co-authors, Dempsey later produced two books about
the Marine Corps: ``U.S. Marines on Iwo Jima'' (1945) and
``Uncommon Valor: Marine Divisions in Action'' (1946).
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's other books range from a novel, ``All That Was
Mortal'' (1978) to ``The Way We Die'' (1975), a report on new
approaches to the medical, psychological and social problems
associated with dying. In 1968 he collaborated with Raymond P.
Baldwin, a lawyer, on ``The Triumphs and Trials of Lotta
Crabtree,'' the story of a American actress who was a household
name toward the end of the 19th century and whose estate of about
$4 million was contested by more than 100 people at her death in
1925.
</P>
<P>
   With collaborators, he also wrote several books on psychology,
among them ``Psychology and You,'' with Philip Zimbardo (1978).
</P>
<P>
   He produced fiction and articles for magazines including the
Saturday Evening Post, The New Yorker, Playboy, the Reader's
Digest, The New Republic and Harper's. He completed another novel
shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   David Knapp Dempsey was born on Jan. 9, 1914, in Pekin, Ill.
From 1949 to 1953, he wrote a weekly column, ``In and Out of
Books,'' for The New York Times Book Review, to which he later
contributed many reviews. From 1954 to 1978, he also wrote articles
for The New York Times Magazine, ranging from a profile of the
anthropologist Margaret Mead to an article on runaway youths. From
1963 to 1970, he wrote a column on the publishing scene for The
Saturday Review.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former member of the board of directors of PEN, the
international organization of writers and editors.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's wife, Evangeline Semon, died in 1984. He is survived
by a son, Ian, of New York City.  &QL;

WIND AND RAIN DISRUPT TRAVEL AND DAMAGE BUILDINGS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fierce winds and lashing rains swept through New Jersey on the
leading edge of a cold front Monday, shearing roofs off buildings
and causing power failures that left more than 10,000 New Jersey
train commuters stalled in their tracks during the evening rush.
</P>
<P>
   The storms also briefly shut down all three major airports, left
6,500 New Jersey homes without power and forced the shutdown of
PATH train service between Newark and Jersey City for 40 minutes.
No serious injuries from the storm were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Between 5:20 p.m. and 7 p.m., 15 Amtrak trains on the Northeast
Corridor line were stranded, as were at least 20 trains on New
Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast and Raritan Valley lines,
railroad officials said. Service was restored by 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the Windsor Industrial Park in Washington Township in Mercer
County, 10 miles northeast of Trenton, a powerful wind peeled back
the sheet-metal roofs of several buildings and caused one
cinder-block building to crack, said Michael McCloskey, the park's
property manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very loud bang,'' McCloskey said, ``and then the
ceiling tiles were rattling. You could just feel the negative
pressure. That's when things started to fly around.''
</P>
<P>
   Car windows blew out from the pressure, McCloskey said, and
other cars were damaged by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherry Hill, N.J., near Camden, a concrete wall was blown
down, part of the roof of the Children's Discovery Museum was torn
off, and several buildings in an industrial park sustained roof
damage, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wanton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Mount Holly, N.J., said that while no tornadoes were confirmed,
winds probably exceeded 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of western New Jersey receiving up to 1.5 inches of rain,
meteorologists said. Temperatures dropped 10 to 15 degrees after
the front passed through, and skies began to clear.
</P>
<P>
   At Newark International Airport, some arriving flights were
delayed by two hours, said officials at the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey, which operates the airports.
</P>
<P>
   Across New Jersey, the winds loosened power lines and brought
tree limbs down, leaving 6,500 customers without power in
mid-afternoon, said Kathy Ellis, a spokeswoman for Public Service
Electric and Gas.

FINES SOUGHT AGAINST HEALTH CLUB OVER REFUSALS TO CANCEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Department of Consumer Affairs is seeking
$150,000 in fines against the Lucille Roberts health club chain
because of complaints from members who had been refused legitimate
refunds or who had not been allowed to cancel memberships,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jules Polonetsky said Monday that
the chain, which has branches throughout the city, would face an
administrative law judge in the agency's adjudication unit on Jan.
28 to answer 19 complaints, half of all the agency's current
complaints against health clubs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Veronica Latourette-Andrade, 28, of Brooklyn found
that Lucille Roberts would not cancel her membership, even after
she mailed in doctors' notes informing the health club that she had
a heart problem. Her membership was canceled only after the
Department of Consumer Affairs got involved and a local television
station told her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so glad it's over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Polonetsky said, ``If there is a physical
disability that keeps you from using the gym for six months, then
you're entitled to a refund'' for that period.
</P>
<P>
   The law also says that if you move 25 miles from the gym's
nearest location you are entitled to void the contract. Similarly,
you can void the contract if you change your mind about joining a
gym within three days of signing the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucille Roberts violated the law in their contracts, which
state that the contract can be canceled only if there is a
permanent disability,'' said Polonetsky, at a news conference. He
said complaints were also filed against Lucille Roberts by the
Better Business Bureau and the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The management at Lucille Roberts could not be reached for
comment. Employees at four Manhattan branches said they did not
know how to get in touch with executives at the health club by
phone, and offered only a mailing address.

EX-CONGRESSMAN TELLS BLACKS NOT TO BE VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-KING) (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before a cheering crowd at a state celebration marking Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a former member of
Congress and potential mayoral candidate in New York City in 2001,
urged listeners on Monday to stop ``talking like a victim, acting
like a victim, walking like a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a change of attitudes,'' declared Flake, a
Queens Democrat who is black but has in recent years drawn an
increasingly sharp line between himself and many other Democrats
and black leaders. Saying people should not turn to government for
special help, Flake added: ``Sometimes, you've got to work for it.
Sometimes, you've got to work overtime for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake's remarks, to a mostly black audience assembled for the
official New York observance of King's birthday in Albany, N.Y.,
responded with cheers, song and shouts of `Yes!'' and ``Amen!''
</P>
<P>
   He delivered his 30-minute message like a sermon, and it was in
many ways familiar to anyone who has attended one of his Sunday
services at the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Jamaica, Queens, where he is the senior pastor. Indeed, to the
distress of many of his fellow Democrats, he voiced similar themes
in a speech in Manhattan last July to a meeting of the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Flake's remarks Monday were notable for the venue in which
he chose to deliver them _ the annual observance of King's
birthday, at an event sponsored by the state to commemorate the
civil rights movement. His audience included Lt. Gov. Mary O.
Donohue, a Republican representing Gov. George Pataki, who did not
attend.
</P>
<P>
   That audience applauded and rose to its feet as Flake urged them
to rely on their own resources, rather than on government, and to
learn the processes of government, rather than resisting it.
``There are too many people who still think the solution to
America's problems is merely calling another march,'' Flake said,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Flake has become increasingly known in recent years for defying
both political and civil rights orthodoxy, breaking with concepts
about the role of government that have been held by many Democrats
and black leaders since the 1960s. He has established a reputation
as a political iconoclast: Although he is a registered Democrat, he
has in recent years been more apt to endorse Republicans than
Democrats, among them Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Pataki and Alfonse
D'Amato, the former senator.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many Democrats and black leaders view him with
either suspicion or hostility and assert that his Republican-themed
sermons and endorsements are designed as a reward to Republican
officeholders, like Giuliani and D'Amato, who have channeled him
grants for church and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad that we come so cheap,'' said Rep. Charles B.
Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, when informed of Flake's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Flake has suggested that he might run for mayor in 2001 _
presumably, but not necessarily, as a Democrat _ and the speech in
Albany offered a preview of what he might say in a political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to say that regardless of what color you are,
regardless of what background you come from, you can't spend your
life talking like a victim, acting like a victim, walking like a
victim,'' Flake said.

NAMES SURFACE FOR GUARD JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are free agents to be recruited, trades to
be unleashed, training- camp fires to build and one question that
captures the spirit of this slow-approaching NBA season:
</P>
<P>
   Are we there yet?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers stagger down the home stretch of the new
collective-bargaining agreement, the league has informed its
constituents that the ``drop alive'' date could be Wednesday. Or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The question that defines the Clippers' during the
lockout-imposed inertia is ``Who the heck is going to be the point
guard?'' The answer could be New Jersey free agent Sherman Douglas.
Or their own free agent, Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents Darrell Armstrong (Orlando) and Eric Murdock
(Miami), popular names on any point-guard acquisition list, were
expected to say put, but now Murdock is believed to be considering
the Clippers. Murdock is thought to be a solid defender, and
defense at the point has been a mandate of Clippers vice president
of basketball operations Elgin Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Another unemployed playmaker is veteran Phoenix guard Kevin
Johnson, whose marquee name has been linked to suitors with higher
profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Trading for a point guard is an option, but the salary cap
greatly reduces the odds of an equitable swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want to upgrade the point-guard position if we
possibly can,'' new coach Chris Ford said Monday, ratifying a plan
that Baylor began offering months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed the Clippers' competition for Douglas is supplied
by the Nets, who might use their $1.75 million exception to retain
the nine-year veteran. Because Douglas played for Ford in Boston
and Milwaukee, Clippersinterest would seem natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't really discuss free agents,'' said Ford, ``but he
(Douglas) is someone I'm very familiar with.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No Olowokandi-gram yet: If Bill Duffy has his way, Michael
Olowokandi, the team's and league's top draft pick, could be
leaving Italy for the NBA ahead of the scheduled escape-clause date
of Feb. 15. Duffy, Olowokandi's agent, is trying to persuade his
client's first employer, Kinder Bologna, to allow the 7-foot-1
center to ditch his European team for the Clippers one week ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy was not available for comment Monday, but a spokesperson
from his office said there was ``no new news'' on the Olowokandi
front.
</P>
<P>
   With Kinder scheduled to play archrival Benetton on Feb. 14, an
early departure might be tough to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA's sluggish progression in finishing its labor
agreement makes Olowokandi's absence seem less painful. According
to Ford, the rookie's reported intelligence and desire should make
the learning curve a bit less treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I hear from those who saw him at Pete Newell's camp
over the summer, I'm really optimistic,'' Ford said. ``After the
daily workouts were over, he stayed on the court, working on his
game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A nearly full house: The Clippers' other first-round draft
selection, Brian Skinner, was expected to arrive in Los Angeles on
Monday. The 6-foot-9, 250-pound Skinner, who has chosen with the
22nd pick, averaged 18.1 points and 9.5 rebounds his senior season
at Baylor.

EXPERT WITNESSES IN GUN LAWSUIT OFFERING TESTIMONY THAT HELPS BOTH
SIDES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Va., S.C., N.C., Fla., Pa., Ill., Mass.) ( nk )  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Brooklyn courtroom, lawyers are arguing a case
that could set a precedent on a fundamental national question:
Should the American gun industry be held collectively liable for
the blood spilled with illegally obtained handguns?
</P>
<P>
   A pattern has emerged in testimony in the suit, which was
brought by relatives of six people killed and a seventh wounded
with handguns in New York City and Yonkers, against more than 40
gun manufacturers and wholesalers: Lawyers for both sides have
elicited helpful testimony from the same experts in illegal gun
sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the plaintiffs last week called Joseph J. Vince,
who was until recently chief of the crime-gun analysis unit of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, to bolster one of their
basic contentions _ that the gun companies have saturated southern
states that have weak gun control laws with more new handguns than
the legitimate market there can absorb.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the excess weapons are sold to gun traffickers, who
resell them illegally in states with strong gun laws, like New
York, the plaintiffs contend. They maintain that this ``negligent
distribution'' makes the companies collectively liable for the
shootings in the case _ even if it cannot be proven which company's
gun was used in a given shooting _ an argument that legal experts
term novel in gun litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, you have a lot of firearms that come from these
Southeast areas simply because they are abundant down there,''
Vince testified, providing what the plaintiffs' lawyers say was a
factual basis for their accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The companies deny that they oversupply states that have weak
gun laws, and they maintain that they cooperate in every way they
reasonably can in the effort against illegal trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by the defense, Vince agreed that the
licensed gun retailers whom the manufacturers and wholesalers deal
with help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fight illegal
trafficking. ``If they see something that is suspicious, they will
contact their local ATF office and report that information,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a frequent occurrence?'' asked James P. Dorr, a lawyer
for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, it is,'' Vince said, adding that the bureau ``very
much'' relies on the licensed retailers as ``our eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the testimony of Kenneth McCann, a retired New
York City Police Department lieutenant who headed a joint city and
federal task force on illegal guns.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs elicited his opinion that one step the gun makers
could take would be to visit licensed retail dealers to inspect
their records and ``ascertain if there are unusual patterns of
sales'' to buyers who seem likely to transport the guns to states
where they are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But then a lawyer for the defendants, John Renzulli, got McCann
to agree that if gun makers did this frequently, it could interfere
with any undercover investigations of the retailers that might be
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   And, seeking support for the companies' position that they
cannot reasonably be asked to do the really effective work it takes
to combat illegal traffickers _ like operations in which undercover
officers buy guns from illicit dealers and then arrest them _
Renzulli asked, ``That is dangerous work, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' McCann responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it should only be done by law enforcement?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you consider manufacturers and distributors of firearms as
law enforcement?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which goes into its third week in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn on Tuesday, is being closely watched by the gun
industry, gun control proponents and lawyers for cities like
Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston, which have sued or may sue gun
manufacturers and distributors, much as the states have sued the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include giants of the nation's gun-making
industry, such as the Smith &AMP; Wesson Corporation, the Colt's
Manufacturing Company and Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   On the plaintiffs' side, in only one of the seven shootings was
the gun, a 9-millimeter pistol made by Cobray Firearms, recovered.
A plaintiffs' lawyer, Elisa Barnes, told the jury that Cobray had
defaulted in the case. But Ms. Barnes insisted that it did not
matter which companies made the guns used in the shootings because
the companies being sued ``were all negligent in the same way'' in
that they fed the underground gun market by oversupplying dealers
in states having ``lax gun laws,'' including Georgia, Florida,
Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Nearly half the guns
used in crimes in New York state in recent years have come from
those five states, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies' lawyers responded that more guns were
distributed in the Southeast because there was a stronger legal
demand for them there, not so illicit traffickers could get them.

CLINTON PROPOSES TAX BREAK FOR STAY-AT-HOME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS grafs 10&AMP;11 to add new info on Clinton request to Congress
for $1 billion to extend welfare-to-work grants. No other
changes.) 
(ATTN: Idaho, R.I.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will embrace an idea long favored
by conservatives and propose a tax break for parents who stay home
to care for their children, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit, up to $250 a year for each child under
age 1, is smaller than the tax breaks proposed by Republicans for
the same purpose. But the administration now accepts the Republican
argument that the government should recognize the value of services
provided by a parent, generally the mother, who forgoes paid
employment to stay home and care for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes we should respect and support parents
in whatever choices they make, whether to work or to stay at
home,'' said Bruce N. Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy
adviser. ``Mothers or fathers who stay home to raise a child need
help, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton has offered several proposals to make child
care more affordable to working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Clinton would probably
highlight his child care proposals, including the tax credit, in
his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday. Republicans
led by Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island proposed a similar tax
credit last year, and they intend to try again this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White House officials said, Clinton will propose a
tax credit to encourage small businesses to provide health
insurance to employees. Under the proposal, employers with fewer
than 50 workers could get the tax credits for two years if they
established or joined a purchasing coalition to obtain health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would receive a tax credit of $500 a year for each
family insured through a coalition, and $200 for each person
covered as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses are much less likely than big companies to
provide health insurance to their employees, in part because the
premiums are higher and the costs less predictable. Small
businesses have generated most of the nation's new jobs, and this
helps explain why the ranks of the uninsured are growing even as
the nation's economy expands and employment rises to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 million people are uninsured and work for companies
with fewer than 25 employees. They account for nearly half of all
uninsured workers and nearly one-fourth of all people without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Monday night that Clinton would
also ask Congress for $1 billion to help poor people move from
welfare to work next year. Labor Department officials said the
money could help 200,000 people by subsidizing jobs for school
dropouts, long-term welfare recipients and other people with few
skills. The plan was reported Monday evening by The Washington
Post.
</P>

   In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress provided $1.5
billion a year in ``welfare-to-work grants'' for 1998 and 1999. The
president wants to extend the program for one more year, on the
assumption that people who remain on welfare need extra help
getting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the tax break for small businesses
would cost $44 million over five years. It would be available only
to companies that did not provide health benefits to employees in
1997 or 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credit for stay-at-home parents is part of a
package of measures to subsidize child care that would cost more
than $18 billion over five years. The tax credit would cost $1.3
billion over five years and would benefit 1.7 million families, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in the package would give additional tax relief
based on income and child care expenses to working parents, to help
offset child care costs, and would expand the main federal program
that subsidizes child care for families so poor that they pay no
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the child care proposals, aside from the assistance for
parents who stay home, were included in Clinton's budget last year.
He announced the proposals with fanfare at the White House in
January 1998, but he did not fight hard for them on Capitol Hill.
The proposals died in Congress, in part because their financing was
linked directly to a big tobacco bill, strenuously opposed by the
tobacco industry. There will be no such link this year.

   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the president's proposals on child care and
health insurance were intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``We have two questions. Is the White House
inviting the Internal Revenue Service deeper into people's lives by
complicating the tax code? Is the Clinton administration paying for
its initiatives by raising taxes on the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans last year faulted Clinton for not proposing
assistance to parents who stay home to care for children. The
criticism came from moderates like Chafee and conservatives like
Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho. ``The government should not
discriminate against parents who decide to stay home and take care
of their kids,'' Craig said.

<P>
   On another issue, the administration has decided to seek a
substantial increase in federal grants to the states for services
to people with severe mental illnesses. The grants would total $358
million, an increase of $70 million, or 24 percent, over this
year's level.
