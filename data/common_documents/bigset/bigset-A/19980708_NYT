<P>
   THE CZECH REPUBLIC _ Michael Roguz is 19 and comes from a small
Polish village on the border with Ukraine. Educated, articulate and
fluent in English, he could have been a translator or entered one
of the professions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has chosen to take part in a unique experiment in car
production at the Skoda Auto plant at Mlada Boleslav, 60 kilometers
northeast of Prague.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of that experiment will appear in Britain this week
when the Skoda Octavia goes on sale. It is the most important Skoda
car launch since the Velvet Revolution swept communism away and the
Czech Republic's best-known export (after Budweiser beer) was taken
under the wing of Germany's Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the product which Skoda hopes will change its image
once and for all as the joke brand of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   If the car is as advanced as the method being used to
manufacture it, then Skoda has reason to be quietly confident.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, one of 3,000 ``guest'' workers at the plant, is paid
16,000 crowns a month for working an eight-hour shift with a
30-minute break. Although he only arrived at Mlada Boleslav three
weeks ago, he says he is enjoying life on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   VW, which took a big gamble when it paid DM1.3 billion for Skoda
in 1991, would probably appreciate his enthusiasm but dispute his
assessment. For the Octavia line is anything but typical and, while
it may look simple, it is a showcase for some of the most advanced
techniques the car industry has ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a conventional production line, where components are
fitted to the shell of the car as it moves along, the Octavia plant
has been designed using the ``fractal'' assembly concept.
</P>
<P>
   This means that large parts of the car _ such as the dashboard
and the seat assembly and the rear axle _ are pre-assembled as one
unit and then bolted on as one.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half of the work force on the Octavia line are not
employed by Skoda at all but work for component suppliers. The line
itself is only about a third of the length of that in the sister
plant next door which makes the Skoda Felicia.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that inventories are kept to a bare minimum. This
is one step beyond ``just-in-time'' manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the automotive world is watching the experiment with
interest. Mazda of Japan is said to be planning a similar plant
while Mercedes intends to use the technique at its Swatch car
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Skoda is coy about how well the experiment is progressing.
Although the Octavia went into production in late 1996, output is
still in the buildup phase. The plan is to raise production from
90,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farsky, director of communications, says: ``We had to have
a lot of discussions with the unions because they were afraid it
would take jobs away from them. Some people were against it because
they did not think it would work. But the experiment is succeeding.
We are producing the volume and the quality while cutting down on
lead times and costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the pudding is in Skoda's results. Last year it
produced after-tax profits of 1.9 billion crowns on sales of 90
billion crowns _ the first profit since VW took over _ and this
year the plan is to pay the first ever dividend to its German
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just down to advanced production techniques. Skoda
still has the lowest labor costs of virtually any car maker in
Europe. The monthly salary that Skoda workers earn is a third more
than the national average but it is still just one-eighth of the
wages in a German car plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lower labor costs are an advantage but they are not to
last forever,'' says Farsky. ``When we took over we assumed it
would give us a edge for 10 years. It looks like it will last
longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of man-hours per car we are not as efficient as we
might be but in terms of cost per employee per car we are ahead of
other European manufacturers and even the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   VW's priorities when it took over Skoda were to keep the name,
maintain the work force at its current size (22,000 people), raise
capacity and add another model.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved all that but some observers question how much is
left of Skoda that is identifiably Czech.
</P>
<P>
   The Octavia was designed by a Belgian brought in from VW's Audi
unit, 60 percent of its platform (power train, gearbox, engine,
drive shaft, suspension, floor pan) is the same as that on the VW
Golf and Audi A3 and many of the key components come from VW.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Van Braekel, who arrived at Mlada Boleslav as head of
design in January 1994 disputes that Skoda has become little more
than a ``badge'' company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you see, hear and feel here is 100 percent Skoda,''
he says. To prove the argument he points to the way he designed the
Octavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is create a bridge to the past,
before the bad days of communist control, and draw on the strengths
from Skoda's long tradition. So for instance the grille is inspired
by pre-war Skodas and the silhouette is based on the Skoda coupes
from the 1950s and 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   VW intends to invest a further DM2.4 billion in the next four
years on top of the DM2.1 billion it has already sunk in the
business with the aim of raising production to 500,000 a year _
triple the level in 1990. There are also plans for a third model, a
large car in the Audi A6 bracket.
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off will depend on persuading the Czechs that a Skoda
remains a Skoda (the marque still accounts for 57 percent of the
domestic market) while convincing west European buyers that beneath
the Skoda skin lies a body of pure German technical sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for instance, Skoda has set itself a target of more
than doubling sales from 16,500 last year to 37,500 by the
millennium.

`PRESIDENTIAL SANTA' GETS LOVING TRIBUTE FROM CELEBRITY MOURNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Robert George, Santa Claus to eight presidents,
was remembered at his funeral by family and friends -- including
Pat Boone, Casey Kasem and former President Carter -- as a man
utterly devoted to the role he played for nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   George, a suburban Sun Valley resident, began acting as a
full-time Santa in 1949 in Nebraska and was first appointed
Presidential Santa in 1956 by President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he also distributed toys with Los Angeles
firefighters. At his funeral, a contingent of Fire Department
officials honored his work by serving as pallbearers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wolfgang Krismanits of Sonora, Calif., who met George
in 1995, said that although he ``sat with so many presidents . . .
the people he really loved were the children.''
</P>
<P>
   A nephew, Larry George, recalled seeing his uncle in action once
in the San Francisco Bay Area. ``There was no one that wasn't
doubled over with laughter by the time they got off that sleigh,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   George died July 1 at a doctor's office in suburban Burbank. He
was 74 and had been suffering from health problems tied to heart
disease and diabetes, said his wife, Stella.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's home has been decorated year-round with Christmas
decorations -- a habit that had created a dispute with neighbors
and city officials when the Georges lived in suburban Glendale in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Boone and the other approximately 125 people attending the
morning funeral at the Church on the Way in suburban Van Nuys
remembered George especially for his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days, the Lord has called Roy Rogers and Santa
Claus to heaven,'' Boone told the mourners. ``There's something
going on up there,'' he added, to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Boone said he saw a television news story a few ago about George
being hospitalized in Burbank after a heart attack. He went to see
George, who he didn't know, and invited him to join his church, the
Church on the Way.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Robert and Stella George became front-row fixtures
at the church's 9 a.m. Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just brought joy to our lives,'' said Boone. He later
sang a hymn, joined by mourners, some of whom closed their eyes and
stretched their arms upward.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a congregant at the church, Rick Segall, sang ``Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gary Abke read a condolence letter he said Stella
George received from former President Carter, the president with
whom Robert George became closest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosalynn and I and our entire family are deeply saddened.''
Carter wrote. ``We cherish the relationship we have shared with
Santa.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview outside the church, radio personality Kasem said
he'd known George since the early 1980s, when he featured him on a
television show called ``The Top 10 Christmas Hits of All Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could be more devoted,'' Kasem said. ``There's an old
saying that service to others is the rent we pay for a room in
heaven. Robert deserves a suite.''
</P>
<P>
   George was buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in suburban
Mission Hills.

   WASH-CHERRIES (Zillah, Wash.) _ These are happy days in the
orchards of the Yakima Valley, the nation's premier cherry-growing
region. Last year's crop, over 90,000 tons, was the largest on
record, and the experts are predict that as young trees come into
production crops of 110,000 tons and more are possible over the
next five years. Still, the day before the harvest begins is a
tense time. Hundreds of thousands of dollars hang in the balance. A
rain storm, even a few unexpected gusts of wind, could wipe out the
work of a year in a matter of hours. By Frank J. Prial.

   NY-BRUNCH (New York) _ When the weekend arrives and the city's
daytime motor shifts into idle, New York prepares to greet its
favorite meal. It is called brunch, and it is weird. A linguistic
and culinry hybrid, brunch is a breakfast that begins with a
cocktail. Or a lunch that's organized around a stack of buckwheat
pancakes. It's neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring, although
all three can wind up on the same plate. By William Grimes.

   FLORIDA-CARIBBEAN (Miami) _ On a blistering South Florida
afternoon whose heat approximates a restaurant kitchen's, Norman
Van Aken, dressed from chin to cuffs in his white chef's outfit,
looks refreshed and cool as he cuts a path through sweaty shoppers
inside the Palacio de los Jugos market. It looks less than regal,
but for Van Aken, the fresh fruits and vegetables shipped here
daily from the Caribbean, Latin America and other tropical lands
represent the raw material for dishes fit for gastronomic royalty.
Van Aken is the head chef and partner in Norman's in nearby Coral
Gables, which is widely considered the best restaurant in South
Florida. A pioneer in the Florida-Caribbean fusion cooking that he
calls New World cuisine, Van Aken is perhaps the best known of the
Miami chefs collectively called ``The Mango Gang.'' By Jon
Nordheimer.

   ALLENDE-COOKING (Undated) _ The morning sun that flooded Isabel
Allende's kitchen was as innocent and unblemished as a perfect egg
yolk. It slid across the hand-painted ceramic tile counter, warmed
her back and made her dangling silver earrings sparkle. But the
56-year-old Chilean novelist was, for the moment, immune to the
poetry and the pleasure of the spring sun. Bent in her own shadow,
calibrating the flame under the omelet pan on her stove, Ms.
Allende, had surrendered to an atavistic ritual of the kind that
might have made a scene in one of her novels. By Molly O'Neill.

EXCERPTS FROM COURT RULING ON SECRET SERVICE TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (with CLINTON-SECRETSERVICE)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts of the decision by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denying the
Secret Service a special privilege to exempt employees from
testifying before the grand jury convened by Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr:
</P>
<P>
   During depositions conducted by the office of the independent
counsel as part of grand jury proceedings, officers of the United
States Secret Service refused to answer certain questions on the
ground that the information sought was protected from disclosure by
a ``protective function privilege.'' When the O.I.C. filed a motion
in Federal District Court to compel their testimony, the Secret
Service, through the Attorney General, again asserted a protective
function privilege, which by that time had been officially invoked
by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Cabinet officer who oversees
the Secret Service. The district court refused to recognize the
protective function privilege and granted the motion to compel.
</P>
<P>
   For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. We note at the
outset, however, that the question before the court today is
whether Secret Service officers can be compelled to testify before
a Federal grand jury. We express no opinion about the propriety of
asserting a protective function privilege in other legal
proceedings. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Asserted Privilege
</P>
<P>
   As described by the Secret Service, the protective function
privilege absolutely protects ``information obtained by Secret
Service personnel while performing their protective function in
physical proximity to the President,'' except that the privilege
``does not apply, in the context of a Federal investigation or
prosecution, to bar testimony by an officer or agent concerning
observations or statements that, at the time they were made, were
sufficient to provide reasonable grounds for believing that a
felony has been, is being, or will be committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The privilege is necessary, according to the Secret Service, in
order for the Service to carry out its statutory duty to protect
the President. That is because the Secret Service uses protective
techniques the effectiveness of which depends upon close physical
proximity to the President. Indeed, in the opinion of the current
director of the Secret Service, ``it is no exaggeration to say that
the difference of even a few feet between a President and his
protective detail could mean the difference between life or
death.'' The Secret Service has a tradition and culture of
maintaining the confidences of its protectees. The Service is
concerned that ``if any President of the United States were given
reason to doubt the confidentiality of actions or conversations
taken in sight or hearing of Secret Service personnel, he would
seek to push the protective envelope away, or eliminate some of its
components, undermining it to the point where it could no longer be
fully effective.'' In a letter to the director dated April 15,
1998, former President George Bush succinctly stated the case for
recognizing the privilege: ``What's at stake here is the confidence
of the President in the discretion of the U.S.S.S. If that
confidence evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly
protect the President.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Analysis
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has put considerable weight upon Federal and
state precedent when recognizing a privilege. . . . This appears to
be the first effort in U.S. history to compel testimony by agents
guarding the President. . . . Although analogies can be drawn to
state governors and their protectors, the consequences of
assassination (and hence the necessity of suitable protection) are
so much greater at the Presidential level that such analogies offer
little guidance. In these circumstances, we do not regard the
absence of precedent as weighing heavily against recognition of the
privilege. The result is simply that judicial recognition of the
privilege depends entirely upon the Secret Service's ability to
establish clearly and convincingly both the need for and the
efficacy of the proposed privilege. In other words, the Secret
Service must demonstrate that recognition of the privilege in its
proposed form will materially enhance Presidential security by
lessening any tendency of the President to ``push away'' his
protectors in situations where there is some risk to his safety. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service claims that insuring the physical safety of
the President is the transcendent public good that justifies the
protective function privilege. For its part the O.I.C. ``readily
acknowledge(s) the profound public interest in Presidential safety
upon which the Secret Service places so much emphasis.'' We
likewise agree that insuring the physical safety of the President
is a public good of the utmost importance. We do not think,
however, that the Secret Service has shown with the compelling
clarity required by Rule 501 that failure to recognize the proposed
privilege will jeopardize the ability of the Secret Service
effectively to protect the President. . . . As we have said before,
(w)hile courts must listen with the utmost respect to the
conclusions of those entrusted with responsibility for safeguarding
the President, we must also assure ourselves that those conclusions
rest upon solid facts and a realistic appraisal of the danger
rather than vague fears extrapolated beyond any foreseeable threat.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the proposed privilege to enhance the Secret
Service's protection of the President is further weakened by the
precise form of the proposed privilege: An agent may not testify
about the conduct of the President or anyone else unless the agent
recognizes that conduct as felonious when he is witnessing it; a
felony made apparent to the agent only by subsequent events _ and
any misdemeanor, regardless of the circumstances _ must remain
secret. The proposed exception for contemporaneously recognized
felonies strikes a strange balance between the competing goals of
providing sound incentives for the President and facilitating the
discovery of truth. On the one hand, because the President cannot
know whether an agent will realize he is witnessing the commission
of a felony _ which depends in part upon how much the agent knows
about prior events _ the President will have to discount
substantially the value of the protective function privilege (and
thus perhaps be tempted to distance himself from his protectors all
the same). On the other hand, the exception would prohibit
testimony (and thus thwart the search for truth) even in cases
where the evidence, viewed in the light of subsequent events, would
supply a key element in the proof of a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   We think it significant that the Secret Service does not require
its agents to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition of
employment; without such an agreement (or statute or rule), the
Secretary of the Treasury would find it difficult by invoking the
proposed privilege to prevent a former Secret Service agent from
testifying, for at least two reasons. First, a former agent who is
not bound by any agreement or rule will suffer no adverse
consequences by cooperating in an investigation of the President;
second, the Secretary of the Treasury has no way of knowing when
such a cooperative former agent is about to testify. If preventing
testimony is as critical to the success of its mission as the
Secret Service now claims, it seems anomalous that the Service has
no better mechanism in place to discourage former agents from
revealing confidences or at least to alert the Secretary when
testimony is about to be given. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We note also that Secret Service agents have given testimony in
the past about the functioning of the tape recording system in the
Oval Office and that some Secret Service agents have disclosed
observations from their protective experiences in books, apparently
without causing Presidents to distance themselves from their
protectors. As for efficacy, we suspect that even with a protective
function privilege in place, conscience might impel a President to
distance himself from Secret Service agents when engaging in
wrongful conduct, as might a simple desire for privacy at other
times. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the Supreme Court's caution that privileges ``are not
lightly created nor expansively construed,'' we are constrained not
to recognize any new privilege the need for which is less than
``clear and convincing.'' . . . Conclusion
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service has failed to carry its heavy burden under
Rule 501 of establishing the need for the protective function
privilege it sought to assert in this case. Consequently, we leave
to Congress the question whether a protective function privilege is
appropriate in order to insure the safety of the President and, if
so, what the contours of that privilege should be. The order of the
district court compelling testimony of Secret Service officers is
therefore affirmed.

FERRARO'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER QUITS; BOTH DENY TENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Democratic strategist running Geraldine Ferraro's
Senate campaign announced he was quitting Tuesday, saying only that
he wanted to move on and that he still believed Ms. Ferraro could
defeat Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in November.
</P>
<P>
   The strategist, David Eichenbaum, said that Ms. Ferraro had not
asked him to leave his job as campaign manager, but that she agreed
it was time for him to go. People close to the campaign said
Eichenbaum had complained privately in recent weeks that Ms.
Ferraro, a former representative from Queens, was not heeding his
advice. Eichenbaum said that was not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the right decision for me at this time,'' he said
Tuesday afternoon. ``I have discussed it with Gerry, we have agreed
on a course of action that is best for both of us, and we are doing
it in a friendly way.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Eichenbaum, who has been working for Ms.
Ferraro since late last year, came on the heels of several
potentially damaging incidents for Ms. Ferraro, who is the best
known of the three Democratic Senate candidates and has a strong
lead in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate last week, one of her rivals, Mark Green, questioned
her judgment in accepting a $20,000 speaking fee from a tobacco
company last year. Ms. Ferraro defended the fee, but the next day
announced that she would donate the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she called Green and her other Democratic rival,
Rep. Charles Schumer, ``liars'' for denying they had strong-armed
delegates at the Democratic state convention. And in May, when Ms.
Ferraro accused D'Amato of pushing breast cancer legislation that
served ``the interests of the insurance companies,'' she riled
breast cancer victims and several female lawmakers who supported
D'Amato's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Eichenbaum insisted his decision had nothing to do with the
recent incidents. But other political strategists, who said his
departure had been rumored for weeks, said it was the strongest
sign yet that Ms. Ferraro's campaign was adrift.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Ms. Ferraro dismissed such criticism
and said that Eichenbaum's departure would not ``impact one way or
the other on the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are saying the campaign is adrift don't have a clue
about what is going on with the campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ``I
get really annoyed at that. We are talking issues, we have great
things going, we are still 20 to 30 points ahead in the polls and
we are not adrift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro said her new campaign manager would be Beth Scully,
who joined the campaign in March and has been working as its
operations manager.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several strategists said that Ms. Scully, who also worked on Ms.
Ferraro's unsuccessful 1992 Senate campaign, has been close to Ms.
Ferraro for years. She is relatively unknown compared with
Eichenbaum, who was communications director for the Democratic
National Committee in 1996 and ran the successful 1994 re-election
campaign of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mr. Eichenbaum said he had been planning his departure
for several weeks, he said he did not have any immediate career
plans. He said he had waited until July, traditionally one of the
slowest months for political campaigns, to announce his departure
because he wanted to shepherd Ms. Ferraro through last week's
debate, the first of the primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a September primary, it made sense not to wait any
longer,'' Eichenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the State Democratic Committee,
predicted that although Eichenbaum's departure would create a buzz
in political circles, it would not hurt Ms. Ferraro because voters
do not care about the inner workings of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters don't know who David Eichenbaum is,'' she said. ``I
think this is of no consequence in the larger picture of retiring
Al D'Amato in November.''

   Keeping Her Eye On the News &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ E.R. Shipp, who won a Pulitzer Prize as a columnist
for The New York Daily News, has been named ombudsman for The
Washington Post. She replaces Geneva Overholser, who left The Post
last month after three years in the job, which is independent of
the paper's news-gathering operation and comes with a weekly column
and the responsibility to act as an in-house critic. Or, as
executive editor Leonard Downie Jr. put it, ``We can't control her,
and she can't control us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shipp, who is 43 and worked as a reporter and editor at The
New York Times for 13 years, will start at The Post on Oct. 1. She
will take a leave of absence from Columbia University, where she is
an assistant professor of journalism, and move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few weeks we've seen ample evidence of the need
for the ombudsman,'' she said, referring to an article on Chiquita
Brands International that The Cincinnati Enquirer said was based on
stolen voice-mail messages, a story on nerve gas that CNN and Time
magazine concluded was not supported by CNN's reporting and columns
that The Boston Globe said had been fabricated. ``But,'' Ms. Shipp
added with a laugh, ``I'd like to be an
ombuds-something-other-than-man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beat Goes On &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Greco, who rose from being a singing pianist with Benny
Goodman's orchestra to a solo career on the club, cruise ship and
casino circuit, has become the Cal Ripken of cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night at the Algonquin Hotel, he gave his 10,000th
performance as a professional entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been performing at local clubs and strip joints in South
Philadelphia when I was 16,'' said Greco, who was also a child star
on the radio in Philadelphia when he recorded ``Oh, Look At Her,
Ain't She Pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The record sold over a million copies,'' Greco said, ``but I
made pennies.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1949, he was hired by Goodman for $250 a week. He went
on to record nearly 70 albums and compact disks and more than 100
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tony Bennett, Greco has an autobiography in the works; his
is in the hands of the writer Janet Berliner. In poring over his
scrapbooks, reviews and letters, he calculated that his 10,000th
performance would occur during his 12 days at the Algonquin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said. ``It only feels like 9,000. But
I've been doing it such a long time. I'm 70. If I do 30 weeks a
year on average, it sounds like a lot, even to me. Too many
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving Pictures &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime Tuesday, a lot of art went on display on the Upper
West Side. Then some of it was packed in a trailer for a 12-city
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer departed from Broadway and 64th Street. It belonged
to the Children's Television Workshop, the producer of ``Sesame
Street'' and other acclaimed shows, which marked its 30th
anniversary by filling the trailer with paintings by celebrities
like Carly Simon, Katie Couric and Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes later and a couple of blocks away, at Tavern on
the Green, Leroy Neiman showed off the official poster of the
Goodwill Games, which begin July 19. ``There's never been anything
like this in New York,'' he said, ``so I did New York.'' Or more
precisely, the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only symbol of New York that he has worked on
recently. He painted Joe DiMaggio. ``Then,'' he said, ``we sat down
and signed the print. First time I ever co-signed a print with
another person. I think it's, I'm not going to say degrading, but
unnecessary for another person to sign it besides the artist.''

COUNTING HEADS (AND POTENTIAL WALLETS) TO HELP SELL MID-MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone walking through the intersection of Seventh
Avenue and 34th Street can see that there are a lot of other people
in the area. But how many? The answer is important to retailers,
who look at pedestrian traffic and see potential shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   To measure the crowds, officials of the Grand Central and 34th
Street Business Improvement Districts sent staff members to 14
major intersections to count the number of people passing by at
different times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   What they found were wide variations in the volume of pedestrian
traffic, even in locations that are close together.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the morning rush hour in April, an average
of 2,406 people walked along the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue
and 34th Street. During the same period, an average of 9,834 people
passed the northwest corner of the same intersection, most likely
because of the nearby exit from the Long Island Rail Road.
</P>
<P>
   The evening rush was even more congested, with an average of
11,856 people streaming by the northwest corner of the intersection
and 4,335 passing the southeast side.
</P>
<P>
   The size of those crowds is good news not only for retailers but
for real estate investors as well. Vornado Corp. chairman Steven
Roth cited streets ``teeming with people day and night'' as the
reason why his company has bought more than $1 billion in office
buildings, a hotel and retail properties along Seventh Avenue
between 31st and 34th Streets. With Madison Square Garden in its
midst, he said, Vornado hopes to develop the area into an urban
version of a suburban entertainment-retail shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   With its dense concentrations of relatively well-paid office
workers, real estate executives said, Manhattan presents new
opportunities for retailers who have developed their businesses in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Research has found that New Yorkers are walkers, willing to
tramp longer distances than people in other central business
districts to shop for what they want.
</P>
<P>
   They are also far more likely to walk to any destination, be it
work or shopping, than their counterparts in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Manhattan, like the heavily residential Murray
Hill ZIP code, more people walk to work than arrive by subway, bus
or taxi, according to the BID study. Accustomed to walking, they
will go farther during lunch breaks to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   N. David Milder, the president of Danth Inc., a consulting
concern that studies the relationship of pedestrian traffic to
retailing decisions, wrote that ``because of the amount of economic
activity found in the midtown area, its geographic density and the
propensity of New Yorkers to walk significant distances, one can
reasonably expect that retailers in the Grand Central district can
tap a much larger captive employee market than retailers in other
downtowns or suburban locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Milder said studies had shown that office workers in New York,
on average, were willing to walk 2,250 feet, or 0.43 miles, to do
midday shopping, compared with under 1,000 feet in other cities.
Discussions with researchers ``produced a general consensus that
people in Manhattan do walk twice as far as people in other
downtowns and that this is probably because of midtown's huge range
of retail choices and the large stretches of continuous retail
space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two BIDs have been doing pedestrian counts since 1995, said
Dan Pisark, director of retail improvement for the two business
districts, which are centrally managed. ``The retail companies are
quite interested in them, and the store leasing industry is
interested as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers want pedestrian counts, said Benjamin Fox, a partner
in New Spectrum Realty Services, a retail brokerage concern,
``especially in midtown where people are likely to shop in spurts,
because that will help them plan their staffing levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But although the counts are a useful tool, said Alan Victor, an
executive vice president of Lansco Corp., they do not show how much
people are spending. ``That's a question we get asked all the
time,'' he said. ``Retailers want to know what other people's sales
volumes are and who else is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with their limitations, pedestrian counts are popular with
retail brokers and store operators, Pisark of the business
districts said. The counters, he said, chronicle the passing throng
in the morning from 7:45 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., at midday from noon to
1:30 p.m. and in the evening from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. They also
record the peak traffic at each site, regardless of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The counts are conducted during what are considered normal
operating times in the city, like April and October, when the
streets are least likely to be thronged by visitors and tourists.
``We never count during Thanksgiving or Christmas,'' he said.
``It's too crowded then; a counter could not stand at a place like
42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   With rush-hour counts of more than 7,000 people an hour at that
location, Milder of Danth Inc. concluded that more than 2 million
people a year pass by that corner during the one-hour evening rush.

   Denver _ A classic it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Then again the All-Star Game is rarely a game to remember.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that seemed to last forever, where pitchers that
normally rely on control couldn't find the plate, where fielders
dove and came up with little, where Big Mac couldn't get the ball
out of the infield, the American League knocked off their brethren
from the senior circuit 13-8 before 51,267 at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game, the 69th version of this gathering of two leagues,
came down to the sixth inning, an inning that Montreal Expos closer
Ugueth Urbina and Atlanta Braves catcher Javier Lopez would like to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The National League had a one-run lead, thanks to a three-run
homer by Barry Bonds in the top of the inning. But when Urbina
finally was able to get three outs, the AL had scored three runs,
two on a wild pitch and passed ball. They also had stolen four
bases.
</P>
<P>
   But it was that kind of game.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching was for the most part awful and for more reasons
than just the fact that Coors is a hitter's park.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Urbina, the biggest culprits were Braves lefthander
Tom Glavine and Indians righthander Barolo Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine turned a 2-0 NL lead into a 4-2 deficit in the fourth
inning. In the fifth, Colon turned a 5-3 AL advantage into a 6-5
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then Urbina gave it right back and the AL pitchers
finally settled down to close it out, their second straight win
though the NL still leads the series 40-28-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that focused on power, and three homers were hit,
the first by Alex Rodriguez and then Bonds ripped a three-run homer
in the sixth off Colon before Roberto Alomar went deep in the
seventh. Mark McGwire, who had trouble in the home-run hitting
contest the night before, went hitless, as the only ball he put in
play in three plate appearances was a slow roller to short. Braves
first baseman Andres Galaragga did put a scare into the AL when
with two runners on in the sixth he drove a ball deep to center. At
first, the crowd, which adores the Big Cat, thought it was gone,
but it fell just short of the 415-foot sign in center field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that focused on Braves shortstop Walt Weiss, whose
3-year-old son has been so sick but miraculously got better in time
to be at the game. And Walt didn't disappoint Brody, going 2-for-3,
scoring a run and driving in another.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that focused on Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles'
second baseman who is not expected to be with the club much longer.
Scouts are watching his every move, and he certainly didn't
disappoint, going 3-for-4 with a stolen base and the homer. Where
will he land next?
</P>
<P>
   And it was a game that focused on the city of Denver as a great
baseball city. It did a marvelous job hosting the game and showed
why this place is packed every game despite their team not being
very good.

EDITORIAL: ABUSING THE CHARTER PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   Any pretense that New York City has an urgent need to rewrite
its charter evaporated Monday when Peter Powers, chairman of the
Charter Revision Commission, released a memo to the commissioners.
Powers told Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's hurriedly created commission
to limit their revisions to ``what can be attained'' in time to
make the November ballot. Translated, the urgency here arises from
the mayor's political need to get a charter item on the ballot in
place of Council Speaker Peter Vallone's referendum on Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani and Vallone are rivals, they have jointly
elevated their power struggle ahead of two civic questions that
deserve unhurried deliberation. The first is whether public funds
should be used to move Yankee Stadium to Manhattan. The second has
to do with what, if any, changes are needed in the structure of
city government.
</P>
<P>
   The commission scheduled its first public hearings over the July
4 holiday season, when many people are on vacation. It clearly does
not have time to draft a reasoned revision of the city's charter.
It exists to block Vallone's stadium referendum. Under election
rules, a charter referendum on this November's ballot would
automatically bounce Vallone's stadium vote (or any other
referendum) until the next election.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor opposes the Vallone referendum for a variety of
reasons, including the fact that it could boost Vallone's campaign
for governor. This page has argued repeatedly against the Vallone
referendum, which among other things would let the City Council
dodge rather than think its way through the stadium problem.
Nevertheless, reforming the charter to checkmate a political
mistake like the Vallone referendum is a hazardous business. The
charter commission should put its civic duty ahead of loyalty to
Giuliani and stop trying to restitch city government on the fly. If
Vallone really is gubernatorial material, he can show it by
shelving his politically tainted referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to look responsible, Powers has suggested that the
commission take aim at campaign finance reform and consider
nonpartisan elections and full-time council members. The latter two
subjects are so weighty they they require more than two months of
debate by a limited group.
</P>
<P>
   As for campaign finance reform, it can be accomplished without
changing the charter. In fact, Vallone last week proposed an
excellent bill to plug the holes in the city's 10-year-old campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   It would be refreshing to see the mayor and Vallone unite behind
a law the city needs rather than unnecessary referendums erected as
monuments to their political egos.

 &HT;    Glavine, All-Star game just don't mix
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It wasn't nearly as bad as 1992, when he gave up nine
first-inning hits and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the All-Star Game and Tom Glavine just don't jibe.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing teammate Greg Maddux, Glavine was able to escape the
third inning without any damage but not the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   He was tagged for four runs, never getting out of the inning and
for a while it appeared he might end up being the losing pitcher
but was let off the hook on the three-run homer by Barry Bonds in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, now with 13.50 ERA in four All-Star appearances (he has
made six teams), had some control problems. To open the third he
walked Kenny Lofton and then gave up a one-out hit to Griffey as
Lofton went to third. But major-league RBI leader Juan Gonzalez
failed again, pushing a ball up in the air to short right which
second baseman Craig Biggio ran down and Lofton could go nowhere.
Then Glavine got Jim Thome to hit a flyball to left.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's offense was another story. In the bottom of the
inning, Glavine came up to the plate and bunted Larry Walker to
third and Walt Weiss to second, the two scoring the first runs of
the game. Glavine, however, had trouble in the fourth, giving up a
two-run double to Ripken which tied the game. Damon Easley followed
with an infield single, but Glavine was able to get Lofton to
ground back to him for an out. Ripken never moved off third.
Glavine then walked Alomar and Griffey, a run coming home, and he
was replaced by Florida's Kevin Brown, who would let in a run
charged to Glavine on a flyball hit by Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   However, the other Braves players did fare better than Glavine:
</P>
<P>
   _ Maddux immediately found himself in trouble as Lofton opened
the game with a single, stole second and went to third on a bunt
single by Alomar as the relay from Mark McGwire to Maddux at first
was late. But then Maddux became Maddux again. He was able to get
Ken Griffey Jr. to foul out to McGwire. Then Gonzalez, desperately
trying to take the ball to right field, got jammed and rolled a
ball back to Maddux, who looked Lofton back at third and threw to
first for the out. Maddux worked the count full to Jim Thome and
walked him before striking out Alex Rodriguez on three pitches, the
last one a great fastball that stunned the Mariners shortstop who
was looking for something offspeed. In the second, Ivan Rodriguez
led off with a single before Cal Ripken hit into a double play and
the inning ended with David Wells grounding out to second.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chipper Jones hit into a double play on his first at-bat and
walked in the fourth, hustled to third base when Lofton bobbled a
ball in center and would score on a single by teammate Walt Weiss.
Jones grounded out to second in the fifth and was replaced at third
base by Vinny Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weiss went 2-for-2, scoring a run and knocking in Jones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andres Galarraga came on for Mark McGwire in the sixth and hit
a ball to deep center that was caught.
</P>
<P>
   _ Javier Lopez came on for Mike Piazza in the sixth and had
trouble behind the plate. Lopez was charged with a passed ball that
let in a run, and in the inning the AL tied an All-Star record by
stealing four bases. He also struck out to end the seventh inning.

EDITORIAL: THE BATTLE OVER HOG FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   Hogs used to be a staple of the small-farm economy. But as
American agriculture has grown more specialized, they have begun to
be raised in concentrated numbers in confinement systems. These
operations contain between 2,000 and 100,000 sows, which eat,
excrete and reproduce in metal barns with concrete floors. The
waste is stored in lagoons and eventually sprayed on fields.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock has always played an essential role in the biological
cycle of agriculture. But hogs raised in enormous confinement
systems no longer belong to the biological cycle. Their manure is
now a pollutant.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the fastest growth in hog production occurred in
North Carolina, but now the battle over the impact of hog
confinement systems is a national one. In Milford, Utah, the four
largest North Carolina hog producers have constructed a facility,
called Circle 4 Farms, that will eventually hold 100,000 sows. In
Colorado and South Dakota, ballot initiatives have been proposed to
limit large-scale pork producers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems with giant confinement systems are obvious.
There are the problems of odor and ground-water contamination from
leaking lagoons. When liquefied hog manure is distributed over
spray fields, it is done at a rate that far exceeds the fertilizer
needs of the soil to which it is applied, often causing further
contamination. Strong evidence has been gathered to show that the
nitrogen in manure lagoons evaporates and is redeposited in what
scientists call nutrient-sensitive waters, like those of coastal
North Carolina, resulting in oxygen depletion and fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over hog factories is really a battle over the
definition of farming and the legal consequences that follow from
that definition. Large-scale pork producers have always sited their
facilities where zoning is nonexistent or could be weakened. But
farmers, by any reasonable definition of the word, have nothing in
common with large-scale pork producers, except when they enter
corporate servitude and agree to raise hogs on contract. Consumers
are slowly learning that they have nothing to gain from factory hog
production either, except cheap pork chops, which by any realistic
measure of environmental or social value are far more costly than
they seem.

PLAYING RED CARD NO FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We'll remember the red-hot passion of Mexico's
fans here. And the red cards that defined all three of its
first-round matches at the World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember England's defensive stand against Argentina late
in their elimination grudge match. And how it was made necessary by
a questionable ejection and ultimately fruitless by a tiebreaking
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember Croatia's upstart success. And wonder if it's
mere coincidence that its three goals in the quarterfinal victory
over Germany all came with a man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember the World Cup, now in its final week, as the
best-played, most significant sporting event on the planet. And the
one in which, more than any other, the games are decided not by the
spectacular players but the referees, their red cards and their
capricious penalty-kick calls, and the despicable institution
called the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a discouraging World Cup for anyone hoping to break
down American resistance to the greatest international game, the
United States team's winless, drawless performance was only a
secondary reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a USA Today headline Monday: ``Mexican referee sets
ejection mark.'' Those are the memories this World Cup has
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just by showing up, the World Cup showcases more
talent than any other sports event.
</P>
<P>
   What's the United States' hottest professional championship? The
Super Bowl? The NBA Finals? Well, there you have teams representing
Chicago and Denver in sports that are among three or four choices
for young athletes in the only country in which it's played at the
major-league level. In the World Cup, you have a team representing
the entire nation of Brazil in that country's dominant sport, a
sport with major leagues all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   A goal like the Netherlands' 90th-minute game winner against
Argentina, in which Dennis Bergkamp used the instep, the sole and
the outside edge of his right foot to control the ball and shoot
it, makes the ``artistry'' of a fast-break dunk look like a
5-year-old's finger painting.
</P>
<P>
   But only a goal so brilliant saved that night's highlight shows
from endless replays of the two red-card fouls that controlled the
game's ebb and flow.
</P>
<P>
   The second red card, against Argentina two minutes before the
Bergkamp goal, punished Ariel Ortega for this: standing up striking
Edwin Van der Sar under the chin with his head; the Dutch
goalkeeper was leaning over Ortega and never tried to move out of
the way, and then put on the best knockout act since Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the lasting images of this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Two players charge hard and honestly after a loose ball, one
launches himself through the air like Chevy Chase, goes down
screaming and clutching a limb as if it's been severed. Other
player pantomimes a swan dive, pleading with referee, who probably
needs the help since he's one man watching 22 players.
</P>
<P>
   Replay shows the kind of foul that might or might not draw a
whistle in the final minute of an NBA playoff game. ESPN analyst
says: ``A clumsy challenge.'' ESPN play-by-play man says: ``This
portion of tonight's game is brought to you commercial-free by the
U.S. Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee whips out a red card, signifying an ejection. Writhing
player jumps to his feet, to the applause of the Academy, or at
least his countrymen. Shorthanded team goes into a defensive shell,
hoping to protect the tie and take its chances in a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of England, the red card that took David Beckham out
of the game for the second half was for a case of retaliation _ he
reflexively kicked Diego Simeone in the ankle after Simeone sat on
him _ that wouldn't have drawn a second glance if it happened at
third base.
</P>
<P>
   A stat from the 1998 World Cup so far: Nineteen players have
been shown red cards and expelled from games. Only two of them came
from teams that went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Another stat: Penalty kicks have accounted for 17 goals. Only
three of those were scored by losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Given the influence referees have, and the amount of ground they
have to patrol, it's amazing soccer doesn't use two of them. Or
none; a few games might have been better with the players making
the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the World Cup obviously needs a merit system for
choosing referees as the tournament goes on, instead of the current
system that takes one from each competing country but then sends
home the refs from countries alive in the late rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then it should raise the thresholds for meting out red cards and
awarding penalty kicks. A simple foul, just because it's in the
penalty area, shouldn't be worth the equivalent of a 1-point free
throw.
</P>
<P>
   THEN, do something, anything, about the shootout, a test of pure
luck that has been allowed to decide games in each elimination
round, including Brazil's ``1-1 victory'' over the Netherlands on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is exactly what the soccer world fears if
America assumes any power in the sport: We'll try to change the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Soccer is safe from the United States. It isn't our
game and, as this World Cup builds to a conclusion, there's no
public clamoring for that to change.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise if Americans think soccer is a silly game. For
much of the past month it has been.

</P>
<P>
   Of all the outrages committed by the Suharto regime, perhaps
none has produced more headaches for less profit than Indonesia's
engulfment of East Timor in 1975. Indonesia gained little but a
persistent public relations problem that mobilized Suharto's
opponents and cost him trade and military help. Now, as President
B.J. Habibie sorts through the Suharto policies, it should be
obvious that both politically and morally, the right course is to
allow the Timorese to vote on their future.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few years of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor,
some 200,000 people were killed, more than a third of the country.
Since then, soldiers have imprisoned dissidents and massacred
protesters. Timorese are forcibly sterilized and Jakarta has
flooded the island with immigrants to dilute its culture and
separatist politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since he replaced Suharto in late May, Habibie has blunted some
of the worst repression. Several prominent dissidents have been
released, and he told East Timor's Bishop Carlos Belo that he would
begin to withdraw Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Habibie has refrained from promising fundamental change in
East Timor's status. He appointed as a senior adviser a retired
general who oversaw a 1991 massacre that killed 270 in East Timor.
Troops, including those recently led by Suharto's son-in-law, have
shot protesters and seem to be trying to provoke the East Timorese
into violence. Habibie offered to release the imprisoned leader of
East Timor's independence movement and give the region ``special
status'' _ but only if the world recognized Indonesian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader Xanana Gusmao rejected the offer. He still
argues, as do the two Nobel peace laureates, Bishop Belo and Jose
Ramos-Horta, that East Timor's people must vote on their status.
They caution that it would take a few years to create conditions
for a free election, including a well-trained East Timorese police
force and an end to the climate of fear. What Habibie can do now is
release the political prisoners, withdraw Indonesian troops, commit
Jakarta to respecting a free vote and grant autonomy to East Timor.

EDITORIAL: HOME RUN FEVER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   Baseball aficionados are savoring this summer's three-man
assault on one of the game's most celebrated milestones, the
single-season home run record. At midpoint of the season, Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs
and Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners are hitting long balls
at a pace that, if sustained through September, would vault them
past Roger Maris' mark of 61, set in 1961. McGwire, the leader, has
already hit 37.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of computerized record keeping, when it is possible to
determine which left-handed hitter in history knocked in the most
winning runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the home run title
is the gold standard for power hitters. Because it was invented and
long owned by Babe Ruth, who hit 60 home runs in 1927, Maris has
always seemed an interloper to some. By 1961, the season had grown
by eight games, clouding Maris' achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Now come two proven sluggers, McGwire and Griffey, and a late
bloomer, Sosa, to tantalize fans with the prospect of a new record.
The question, however, is whether their power hitting is memorable
or the pitching they face is miserable. With the addition of two
new teams, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Arizona Diamondbacks,
major league pitching staffs are thin. Yet even suspect pitching
shouldn't diminish the excitement of the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one home runs do not sound like that many for a six-month
season with 162 games. Sosa hit 20 in June alone, a new one-month
record. But what often looks plausible in June seems unattainable
by September, after heat and fatigue have taken their toll. The
psychological pressure can be wilting as well. Maris was a nervous
wreck by the time he cracked the Ruth barrier.
</P>
<P>
   There is sure to be an exacting analysis of the parlous pitching
if the record is approached, but at least there ought not to be a
churlish debate about whether Ruth's record is the one that counts.
The time may just be right for a new mark. Ruth's record stood for
34 years. More time than that has elapsed since Maris exceeded it.

AMERICAN LEAGUE TRIUMPHS, 13-8 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr., the leaders in the
pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record, did not hit any home runs.
Juan Gonzalez, who drove in 101 runs before the break, did not get
a hit in four times at bat with a total of nine runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez did drive in a run with a sacrifice fly, and it
contributed, sort of, to the American League's 13-8 victory over
the National League on Tuesday night in the highest-scoring
All-Star Game. An A.L. single by Rafael Palmeiro in the ninth
inning drove in the run that eclipsed the previous highest-scoring
game, the Americans' 11-9 victory at Cleveland in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   This game, which lasted 3 hours 38 minutes, also surpassed that
game as the longest nine-inning All-Star Game. The game in 1954
took a mere 3 hours 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the star All-Stars did not hit home runs, that did not
mean Coors Field was big enough to hold all of the baseballs within
the playing field. Alex Rodriguez and Roberto Alomar, who was named
the most valuable player, slugged bases-empty home runs for the
A.L., and Barry Bonds whacked an impressive three-run blast for the
National.
</P>
<P>
   If the 51,267 fans, the largest to watch a game at the routinely
sold-out Coors Field, were disappointed that McGwire, the major
league home run leader with 37, did not hit one, he said he was
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm realistic about things,'' said McGwire, who did not add to
his total of home runs in the last five games before the break. ``I
can't do it every day at bat, can't do it every week. You go
through streaks where you hit some, get in a nice groove, then you
go in a streaks where I hit one every week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the teams combined for a record-tying 31 hits, the
tying run and the tie-breaking run, the one that gave the A.L. a
lead it never surrendered, were scored in the sixth inning without
a hit driving them in. The first came on a passed ball by Javier
Lopez, the second moments later on a wild pitch by Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationals threatened to disturb the A.L. lead in the eighth
when Greg Vaughn of San Diego lined a two-run single to left field
and Devon White of Arizona followed with another line single to
left. But when the Brewers' Fernando Vina tried to score from
second base, the Yankees' Paul O'Neill threw him out, firing a
perfect throw to Sandy Alomar Jr., who tagged Vina on the left knee
as he slid home.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon then induced the dangerous Andres Galarraga to ground
into an inning-ending double play. The Americans then added three
runs to their advantage in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   According to an ages-old baseball maxim, good pitching is
supposed to stop good hitting. But the notion that the All-Star
Game pitchers would enforce that view was dispelled in the middle
innings. Instead, the Coors Field maxim prevailed _ that is, when
at Coors, hitters beat up pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux's sidekick in Atlanta, suffered the
worst beating, allowing the A.L. four runs in the fourth inning for
a 4-2 lead. Maddux himself encountered a little trouble in the
first two innings, but he escaped unscathed by throwing a third
strike past Alex Rodriguez with two out and the bases loaded in the
first and inducing Cal Ripken Jr. to ground into a double play in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had no such luck with Ripken, holder of the longest
playing streak in history, at 2,566 games. After Alex Rodriguez and
Ivan Rodriguez began the fourth with successive singles, Ripken
ripped a fly ball to right field that missed the stands by inches.
It went for a double instead and tied the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley of Detroit then batted for Roger Clemens, whose
pitching produced the N.L.'s two runs in the third inning, and got
an infield single. Glavine made a good play on Kenny Lofton's
bouncer to the third-base side of the mound for the first out, but
he did not pitch well to the next two batters.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander walked Roberto Alomar and Griffey, the first
loading the bases, the second forcing in the tie-breaking run.
Kevin Brown became the new pitcher after that flurry of
uncharacteristic wildness, and Gonzalez hit a fly to center field,
driving in the fourth run.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, the perennial N.L. batting champion, drove in his
team's two runs in the third with a bases-loaded single. Alomar
dived for the tantalizing up-the-middle bouncer, but the ball
deflected off the heel of his glove. The Yankees' David Wells, he
of the perfect game, had pitched two hitless and scoreless innings
as the A.L. starter.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss of Atlanta, who singled against Clemens in the third,
singled again in the fourth against Brad Radke of Minnesota,
driving in Chipper Jones after Mike Piazza of the Mets singled him
into scoring position. But Alex Rodriguez restored the A.L.'s
two-run lead by leading off the fifth inning with a home run
against Andy Ashby of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The A.L., however, did not retain that lead for long. With
Bartolo Colon of Cleveland pitching in the N.L. half of the fifth,
White lashed a leadoff triple to left-center field and McGwire
walked. Bonds, who before the game was nursing a bad headache, then
swatted the ball high in the air toward the right-field stands, and
it crashed into the San Francisco Giants sign on the facade of the
third tier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first home run in eight All-Star Games and 20 at-bats
for Bonds, who with his father, Bobby, joined the Griffeys as the
only father-son team to hit All-Star Game home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The blow put the N.L. ahead, 6-5, but what else? The lead did
not last long. Only until the next inning, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   And what an ugly inning it was. Alomar and Griffey started the
problems for Urbina, Montreal's closer, by beating the ball into
the ground and getting cheap singles. Alomar's caromed off Craig
Biggio's glove near second, and Griffey's barely went beyond the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina struck out Gonzalez, but after the runners executed a
double steal, he walked Jim Thome, loading the bases. With Derek
Jeter batting, Lopez of Atlanta lost control of an Urbina pitch,
and Alomar scored the game-tying run on the passed ball, the other
runners also advancing a base each.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter struck out on the next pitch, but Urbina's second pitch to
Ivan Rodriguez was wild, and Griffey scored the tie-breaking run.
Rodriguez then singled home Thome with the third run of the inning
and gave the A.L. an 8-6 lead. Alomar made the score 9-6, slugging
a two-out home run against Trevor Hoffman of San Diego in the
seventh. &QL;

HEAT GOES UP AS BASEBALL RECORD CHASERS GO BACK TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sometime during the All-Star Game festivities, the
standard baseball cliches _ ``Good pitching beats good hitting''
and ``Pitching and defense wins games'' _ were apparently replaced
with something telling about what's to come in the second half
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball's new foolproof slogan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now, everybody knows it gets awfully hot in August.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means for baseball fans falling in love again with the
game formerly known as the national pastime is that in St. Louis,
where slugger Mark McGwire must toil under the shadow of the arch
and the Midwest summer sun, and in Texas, where RBI machine Juan
Gonzalez must battle flying insects the size of The Alamo and
body-numbing heat the likes of which no Swedish sauna could ever
produce, baseball's biggest records seem safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
   August is where good intentions for baseball immortality go to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   While none of the 1998 All-Stars spent a moment here making any
bold, Joe Namath-like predictions about what's going to happen in
the second half, no one exactly disputed the entertaining notion
that records could fall.
</P>
<P>
   And fall with a media-crushing, fan-frenzied thud that will make
Cal Ripken's breaking of Lou Gehrig's Iron Man record in 1995 feel
like high tea with the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   The high-octane performances of the first half have only served
to fuel gargantuan expectations for the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McGwire) is the big thing now in baseball. I'm trying to
drive in my RBIs, you know,'' said Gonzalez, whose 101 RBIs at the
break have been the envy of his All-Star peers, except maybe Ken
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   (`It's not really Juan that's impressive, it's the guys in front
of him. Those guys getting on base, being in scoring position,
that's what's impressive. He's only had 26 home runs but he's
driven in 101. The guys batting one, two, three, they're on base
all the time,'' Griffey said.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Gonzalez, he was optimistic great things could happen in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is to stay healthy all season. There's a good chance
at breaking the home run record. I'm in the race for the RBI
record, too. You know, I never pass in my mind any (thought) about
the record. I'm trying day by day, one at a time,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those of us with wildly hyperbolic imaginations, it's
difficult to believe that the luster of baseball's first half could
sustain itself for another 80-plus games.
</P>
<P>
   However, while watching Tuesday night's All-Star Game, somewhere
between the time Roger Clemens hit Houston's Craig Biggio with a
wild pitch and Montreal right-hander Ugeth Urbina heaved a few
one-hoppers past catcher Javy Lopez (total elapsed time: four
innings, two hours), an exciting thought did occur:
</P>
<P>
   Why not hurry up this high-scoring little Mid-Summer Classic and
let the record-chasing boys go back to the work of re-creating
history?
</P>
<P>
   (And, by the way: If Urbina can get a spot on Jim Leyland's NL
All-Star squad, what's the matter with the Cubbies' rookie
strikeout phenom Kerry Wood? OK, fine, Urbina has 20 saves this
season _ fifth best in the NL and roughly 100 times as many saves
than the entire Mariner bullpen. But, Mr. Leyland, ``We The
People'' wanted Kerry Wood pitching to Griffey and Cal Ripken and
Jim Thome.)
</P>
<P>
   What are the grand records up for grabs in the second half of
'98?
</P>
<P>
   A) Hack Wilson's 1930 record of 190 RBI, which Gonzalez is
attacking.
</P>
<P>
   B) Roger Maris' 1961 record of 61 home runs, which McGwire,
Griffey and Sammy Sosa are chasing with steamroller-like pace.
</P>
<P>
   C) The Cubs' 1906 record of 116 wins, which the red-hot Yankees
could approach, should their second half mirror their first.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra had not had his
consecutive-game hitting streak stopped at 24, Joe DiMaggio's
awesome 56-game hitting streak could have been on the line, too.
</P>
<P>
   The mind almost reels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine someone sitting on 50? Everyone's going to
want to know; `Can he get to 56?''' said catcher Mike Piazza,
himself trying to set a record for number of teams an All-Star
catcher has played for in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure would drive you nuts. You would have to be put in
an insane asylum. You would have to pull every TV out of the house,
every radio out of the car, just to try and block out all the hype
and attention. It wouldn't be easy, not in this age of instant
information when you can watch 10 games on satellite TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is right. It won't be the heat of August that will wilt
the hard-charging All-Stars in their pursuit of the record book. It
will be the crush of media and the unbridled mania of the fans that
could worse jeopardize the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to finish the season without any gray hairs in my
goatee,'' McGwire said Tuesday night before heading back to
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is all gray, then it's a sign the pressure got to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants Big Red to turn gray, but everyone is rooting for
big things come September. If the Mariners are beyond salvage and
the pennant races everywhere except the NL West pose little hope,
baseball still holds a crushing ton of promise.

BRILLIANT COLORS, BRILLIANT FINISH 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ The man in the orange Patrick Kluivert
jersey was reeling, beer-sodden from a day's worth of revelry, but
still crystal-clear on the truth as he chose to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hesitated,'' the man said. ``In life, you do not
hesitate.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the World Cup, soccer is life.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of justice behind Brazil's penalty-shootout
victory over the Netherlands in the semifinals Tuesday night,
something that speaks to the genius and relentless nature of this
great team. But like so many tortured affairs in this diabolical
system, there was not a losing side. Only tormented individuals.
Ronald de Boer hesitated, and more importantly he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Because he missed _ and Phillip Cocu, as well, in this 4-2
decision _ the Dutch must now hear the sweeping interpretations
they are not willing to accept. They have lost again, another
heartbreak in the tournament they have never won. They did not come
through. Perhaps, some will say, they choked.
</P>
<P>
   And if one of Kluivert's half-dozen shots goes in, during the
first 120 minutes, the Dutch have conquered the world.
</P>
<P>
   I watched this game from the streets. A World Cup credential
means nothing, really, especially to American journalists. A few
Euro-hardened veterans got seats in the press box, but dozens of us
were herded away like cattle, allowed only in a large workroom. No
matter. This is a game for the streets. I tossed a few down with
the Dutch and the Brazilians alike, in a scene that captured the
convivial nature of this great event. The evil hooligan forces of
Germany and England are long gone now, and it's the sporting party
to end them all.
</P>
<P>
   From the train station in Paris to the swirl of humanity on the
boulevards of Marseille, I learned one thing: Follow the
Brazilians. They are everywhere. The greatest traveling fans on
Earth, and they move in singing, swaying hordes toward their
destination. There is much to be said for a nation that makes its
every move to musical accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty cool thing, wearing the bright yellow jersey made
famous by Pele, Zico, Socrates and Ronaldo, but as I learned
Tuesday night, there are instant Brazilians. They come from
Scotland, Asia and Rio de Janeiro, Kentucky. You can spot them
immediately; their sense of rhythm is a little weak. In a sea of
sensuous Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz, they are Lawrence Welk's
rendition of ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.'' They are in that
frozen, black socks-in-Waikiki kind of mode.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch aren't big on style, but they make up for it in
orange. You spot these guys, and it's Tang all around. I saw one
man with a bunch of carrots on his head. Such is the power of
orange: Fresh vegetables grow right out of it. ``Anything in the
world is good,'' he told me. ``As long as it's orange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn straight,'' I replied, kicking myself for forgetting my
bright-orange pants.
</P>
<P>
   The major intersecting boulevards of Marseille are glorious to
behold, wide and arrow-straight as far as the eye can see. Glancing
above street level, you could see the real Marseille: flats and
apartments without a trace of World Cup decoration. Not a flag in
sight, only skeptical-looking women viewing the scene with disdain.
They missed the point, it seemed. For an entire day and night, the
Dutch and the Brazilians partied as one.
</P>
<P>
   I settled into a little cafe where the sentiment ran about
equal. The whole crowd was incredibly friendly and incredibly
drunk. You can tell a great soccer game by the number of thunderous
roars _ on the near-misses, right along with the goals _ and after
a dull first half, this was one noisy tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The second half began and Ronaldo quickly became Michael Jordan.
He did what the great ones do, scoring an artistic goal on the
highest stage. Dennis Bergkamp was strangely quiet for the Dutch,
but Kluivert's bullets pounded a drumbeat on the Brazilian
goalkeeper. Out of nowhere, songs would break out. Jaap Stam, the
Dutch defender, was in rare form after a shaky few games, and the
Dutch broke into his theme song:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Jaapy Stam!
</P>
<P>
   Jaapy Stam-Jaapy Stam-Jaapy Stam! (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; I felt proud to have quickly mastered the lyrics. The flip
side was dynamite, too: ``Hol-land-AH!'' forever.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old Brazilian kid wandered up to the bar, right into a
sea of weaving, belching Dutch guys. Even in that sorry state, they
warmed to the sight of him, tousling his hair. If anything, the
opposing factions grew closer as the night wore on, actually
singing together (``Ole!'' into eternity) at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert, that vision of defiant youth, kept firing away.
Finally he connected, incredibly, on a wicked header with just four
minutes to play. The room thundered in its orangehood. But as the
30-minute Golden Goal time expired, there was a growing silence.
Heads fell into hands and there was loud groaning in the awful
anticipation of it all. Somebody was about to enter the history
books here, in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't going to be Brazil, that's for sure. Ronaldo, Rivaldo,
the surprising Emerson Ferreira (where did (begin ital) he (end
ital) come from?) and finally Dunga scored, with the frightening
penalty-goal efficiency so often associated with the Germans. These
guys could have fired all night, with 100 percent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   For the Netherlands, the occasion was just too big. Cocu's drive
was stopped authoritatively by Taffarel, the Brazilian keeper
suddenly coming under the closest scrutiny. Where was Kluivert?
Maybe later; we'd never know. Ronald de Boer stepped up _ make this
thing or it's finished _ and for just a moment, he stopped to
survey the net. The shot was weak, as it had to be, for hesitation
is a terrible mistake in any language.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the press tent, we could see De Boer addressing the
media in Dutch. He was pulling a Dennis Eckersley, boldly standing
up to his failure. ``What did he say?'' we asked a Dutch journalist
standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is language of the street,'' the man said. ``Basically, he
said it sucks. That it's a (bad) situation. That it's over, and
it's a pity.''
</P>
<P>
   Taffarel was doing an interview at another corner of the
stadium. They praised his calm and anticipation, and he told
everyone they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was God helping me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In soccer and in life. Here, there is no difference.

A FRENCH TOUR WITH NO TIME FOR BRAKES 
BY DAN GIESIN
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the warm-up act is about to end, France is ready to go
all out for its annual showstopper, the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to the World Cup, which concludes Sunday in
Paris, this year's Tour will begin a week later than usual and a
10-hour ferry ride away from the shores of Brittany. Even though
the peloton will spend three days in Ireland, beginning with
Saturday's opening prologue in Dublin, don't expect any blarney in
this year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It could be one of the most hotly contested races in recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   The '98 Tour will be a much more competitive affair than last
year, when Jan Ullrich, the brash young Telekom team rider who
became the first German in the 94-year history of the race to win
the Tour, shredded the field in the two time trials and kept pace
with the climbers in the mountains to seize the title by more than
nine minutes over runner-up Richard Virenque of France.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, 24, since has gained a ton of weight hitting the
offseason rubber-chicken circuit after last year's victory,
ballooning to 185 pounds on his six-foot frame (one wag said
Ullrich will do his military service as a blimp).
</P>
<P>
   And the winter-long la dolce vita showed in the early-season
races, when Ullrich was more of a threat to the integrity of his
bike frame than to the top riders in Europe's spring classics. Even
though team officials insist Ullrich is rounding into shape, the
excess baggage could weigh him down.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ullrich expand must be sweet revenge for Virenque, who
dominated in the Pyrenees and Alps and had nothing to show for it
but his fourth straight polka-dot jersey signifying the top climber
on the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28-year-old Festina team leader, who finished the '96
Tour in third place, is not a lock to overtake his lumbering German
rival because he is only a better-than-average time trialist.
</P>
<P>
   This ``race of truth,'' as the great Bernard Hinault, the last
Frenchman to win the Tour (1985), called the individual race
against the clock, is where a rider either can make up time or put
distance on a rival, and Virenque does not figure to do either in
the 361/2-miler on July 18 or the 321/2-miler on August 1, the
penultimate stage of the Tour's 21 stages.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, look to the shaven-headed ``Pirate'', Marco Pantani, to
be wearing the yellow jersey when the riders make their final
parade down the Champs-Elysees on August 2. Pantani, whose elfin
physique belies his enormous heart, won last month's Giro d'Italia,
which he says gives him a huge psychological lift going into the
Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giro is great preparation for the Tour,'' he told VeloNews
last month. ``I'll go into the Tour this year with a team
(Mercatone Uno-Bianchi) entirely at my disposal, something I've
never had before. ... The most important thing now is that I raced
for three weeks (in the Giro) without having a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Pantani, who finished third in the Tour both
last year and in '95, showed the world during the Giro that tough
conditions in the mountains do not faze him _ he is easily the
purest climber among the 189 riders in this year's Tour, Virenque
notwithstanding _ and his time-trialing ability has steadily
improved.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latter quality that will serve Pantani well in this
year's Tour _ the half-dozen mountain stages are not the toughest
routes the Alps and Pyrenees have to offer. (Virenque has said they
are not demanding enough.) Thus the two races against the clock
could settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   And with Ullrich's fitness and Virenque's time-trialing
questionable, Pantani should be able to capitalize and slip into
the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as with any race covering 21 days and 2,392 miles,
something unexpected could happen, so do not be surprised to see
Bobby Julich, perhaps the United States' best cyclist now that
Lance Armstrong is working back into shape after a bout with
testicular cancer, slip into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Julich, a native of Glenwood Springs, Colo., and
co-captain of the French-based Cofidis team, finished 17th in his
Tour debut, and he could be ready for a top-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the San Francisco-based U.S. Postal Service team, the only
American-sponsored squad among the 21 Tour teams, could cause a
stir in its second Tour de France with Frenchman Jean-Cyril Robin,
a strong climber who finished 15th last year.

AMERICAN LEAGUE STOPS NL, 13-8, IN ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They talked much here the past two days about Mark
McGwire's power, Ken Griffey Jr.'s sweet swing and Juan Gonzalez's
pursuit of Hack Wilson's RBI record.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody paid much attention to the possibility that Rangers
catcher Ivan Rodriguez might become the first American League
catcher to ever win a batting title.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, hitting .350 for the season, reminded people of that
last night. Rodriguez had three hits in four at-bats, helping spark
the American League to a 13-8 victory against the National League
in the 69th annual All-Star Game before 51,267 at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles second baseman Roberto Alomar also had three hits,
including a home run, to steal most valuable player honors away
from Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an effort by the whole team,'' Alomar said. ``We wanted
to win this game, and we came out playing aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players were pivotal in the three-run sixth inning that
allowed the American League to take the lead for good. Alomar led
off the inning with an infield hit, and Rodriguez finished it with
a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are great pitchers, but I just concentrated on hitting
the ball hard,'' Rodriguez said. ``You know that I'm an aggressive
hitter. It's a good feeling to get three hits in an All-Star
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as missing out on MVP honors, Rodriguez said, ``I was
just having fun. I'm happy that Roberto won. He did a great job,
also. It could have been either one of us. It could have been a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field has a reputation for being a hitter's paradise, and
the All-Stars confirmed that. The combined 21 runs set an All-Star
Game record while the American League tied a record with 19 hits.
The 31 hits by both teams also tied a record.
</P>
<P>
   The balls didn't exactly go flying out of Coors Field. There
were only three home runs hit, the most memorable one being a
three-run blast by Barry Bonds in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both sides took advantage of another Coors Field factor
that makes it a great place for hitters. Coors Field has some of
the deepest dimensions of any ballpark in baseball, a concession to
the high altitude, that force outfielders to play deep. As a
result, 26 of the 31 hits were singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch baseball on television, you always see a lot of
runs scored in Denver,'' Alomar said. ``This was a little bit
different of an All-Star Game, but in this ballpark, that's what
you expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez, who batted four times with a
total of nine men on base, couldn't take advantage of the American
League's offense, going 0-for-3 with a sacrifice fly for his only
run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers reliever John Wetteland pitched a scoreless inning, but
Aaron Sele didn't get in the game. Hargrove was saving him in case
the game went into extra innings, but the AL pulled away in the
later innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' three-run homer, a 451-foot blast off the front of the
third deck in right field, gave the National League a 6-5 lead. But
the American League rallied with three in the sixth when the
National League got sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar reached on a single off second baseman Craig Biggio's
glove, and Griffey bat out a broken-bat roller past pitcher Uegueth
Urbina. Gonzalez struck out, but then the AL pulled off a double
steal. After Jim Thome walked, Alomar scored on catcher Javier
Lopez's passed ball. Griffey scored on Urbina's wild pitch, giving
the AL the lead, and Rodriguez scored Thome with a sharp single to
left.
</P>
<P>
   The AL defense was much sharper in the eighth when the NL,
trailing 10-6, threatened to tie it. Greg Vaughn's bases loaded
single off reliever Tom Gordon scored two runs, but AL left fielder
Paul O'Neill threw out Fernando Vina trying to score on Devon
White's single to left. Shortstop Omar Vizquel then made a slick
grab of Andres Galarraga's chopper up the middle to start an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Neill's play was the best of the game,'' Alomar said.

BASEBALL BY THE NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball at the break has more than a literal meaning for once.
Baseball is getting a break from fans who, for the first time since
baseball's suicide attempt in 1994, truly seem interested in what's
happening in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has stat freaks to thank, because we're waist-deep in
relevant numbers. It should also thank its tradition now there's a
concept because without Roger Maris, Hack Wilson and the 1954
Cleveland Indians, none of these numbers would mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here's a look at what's to come, by the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   190 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Before we get to Juan Gonzalez, one needs to explain how a guy
named Hack (Wilson) had 190 RBI and why this record is more
significant than 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was a product of his time, a high fastball hitter of the
mid-20s-to-30s, when everyone in baseball was following Babe Ruth's
power lead. For example, the batting average for the entire
National League in 1930 was .303.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had one of the all-time bad bodies. He was 5-6, weighed
195 pounds, and wore a size six shoe. His career was short, 12
seasons and 1,348 games. The 1930 season was his best, with 56
homers (the N.L. record) and 190 RBI. Stat man extraordinaire Bill
James wrote in his Historical Baseball Abstract that if Wilson were
alive today, scouts wouldn't bother sending in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is not chasing Wilson as much as an entire era. Home
runs are romantic, but they're not new. Sixteen of the 23 50-homer
seasons in baseball history have come since World War II, and six
of them in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   A player has finished a year with 162 or more RBI in a season
only 16 times, and the last time it happened was 1938. That's 61
years. Wilson's 190 has often been placed in the same untouchable
territory as Johnny Vander Meer's back-to-back no-hitters and Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez gets anywhere near 190, he'll deserve the A.L. MVP
award regardless of how many homers Ken Griffey or any one else
hits. This is a record for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   62.
</P>
<P>
   The home run race is always spoken in terms of how many homers
Mark McGwire (37), Griffey (35) or Sammy Sosa (33) have. But it's
more relevant when you flip the numbers around.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire only needs 25 home runs in his remaining 76 games to get
to 62. Rather than focus on whether he gets to 62, one might want
to chart whether he'll get 61 by Game 154, which would also one-up
Babe Ruth's 60 homers in 1927. It was Ruth's mark in eight fewer
games which led baseball to put an asterisk alongside Maris' 61 in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   If Las Vegas were to install a betting line on McGwire and they
will, if they haven't already it should include a proposition for
injury. He's played with back problems since 1989. Last year (156
games) was his first season since 1991 that he didn't miss a
significant part of the season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   756.
</P>
<P>
   While we're homer happy, now is as good a time as any to suggest
that we're ringside to mid-assault on Hank Aaron's career record of
755 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In nine-plus seasons, Griffey, 28, has hit 329 home runs. At the
same stage of his career, and a year older, Hank Aaron had
approximately 320 home runs. The DH allowed Aaron to extend his
career sum, as it will Griffey, and I doubt if baseball will do
anything to impact offense in the seeable future.
</P>
<P>
   122.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees check in at 61-20, a .753 percentage. If they
continue to win at that pace, they will finish the year 122-40,
which would break the A.L. record of 111 wins in a season, set by
the 1954 Cleveland Indians, and the major league mark of 116 set by
the 1906 Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time to inform the Yankees that both of
those teams lost in the World Series. The Indians were swept by
Willie Mays and the New York Giants, and the Cubs lost to the White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   2.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the 1996 season and the Angels have won two more games
over the last four years than the Dodgers. Even with the '96 season
included, the Angels are 281-273 the last four seasons despite
pitching best described as desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Al l things considered, the Angels have been impressive lately.
There is no shame in losing to the talented 1995 Mariners. Last
year, the Angels finished six games over .500 despite injuries to
Chuck Finley, Mark Langston and Mark Gubicza and a patchwork
pitching staff that featured a rookie (Jason Dickson), an import
(Getting-Shiggy-With-It Hasegawa) and a knuckleballer (Dennis
Springer).
</P>
<P>
   They're doing it again this year, with injuries to Ken Hill,
Allen Watson and Jack McDowell and the likes of a rookie (Jerrod
Washburn), a retread (Omar Olivares) and a knuckleballer (Steve
Sparks) holding them up.
</P>
<P>
   On spec, the Rangers look like the better team, but then someone
always does. The Angels have four everyday players hitting over
.300 and six with 40-plus RBI if you combine the totals of rotating
catchers Matt Walbeck and Phil Nevin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians are 1-2 in the A.L., but who's to say
the Angels aren't No. 3? And would it be too much to ask of Disney
to find Terry Collins an arm?
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) 13{ and 14. (end bold) That's how far the Dodgers
trail San Diego in the N.L. West, and the number of players left
from the opening day roster.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these numbers will increase. The only person who thinks
the Dodgers will close the standings gap ironically is the guy most
likely to pad the other, interim-for-life G.M. Tommy Lasorda, who
is making one last attempt to get Randy Johnson from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   It won't shock anyone if the only Dodgers left from Opening Day
at season's end are Raul Mondesi and Tom Prince, in which case you
can start calling them ``The Franchise Formerly Known As The
Dodgers.''

TEXAS ASSAULT LEAVES 5 DEAD, INCLUDING 2 IN BORDER PATROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A young man armed with assault rifles killed
a mother and a daughter, and then fatally shot two Border Patrol
agents pursuing him here on Tuesday, law-enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say the shootings in the lower Rio Grande valley,
in which the man identified as the gunman died and a local
sheriff's deputy was seriously wounded, illustrates the growing
risks Border Patrol agents face in a territory transformed into a
combat zone as officers pursue drug smugglers, as well as people
moving illegal immigrants across the border. The ranks of the
Border Patrol have swollen to fight these crimes and now its agents
are also summoned to aid the local authorities in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents, one of whom is the first woman slain while on
duty as a Border Patrol agent, were the third and fourth to die
this year, immigration officials said. Eighty-one agents have died
in the Border Patrol's 74-years.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, said at a
local news conference on Tuesday that she had attended a service
for another slain agent only a month ago. ``I had hoped that it
would be the last,'' she said. ``Now, so soon, two more courageous
and heroic officers have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the greatest risk to agents usually lies along the border,
they are increasingly being summoned by local police and sheriff's
departments.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:20 on Tuesday morning, deputies in the Cameron County
Sheriff's Department investigated a report that shots had been
fired in Rio Hondo, another Harlingen suburb. Sheriff Omar Lucio
said they had found Margarita Flores, 53, and one of her daughters,
Delia Morin, dead, and her son seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the gunman, whom they identified as Ernest
Moore, 24, had been looking for a woman staying in Ms. Flores'
home. Leaving behind what deputies said was an AK-47 assault rifle,
he fled before dawn in a white pickup truck, in which he was seen
with two other men, after the shootings at the house. The
authorities are investigating whether those men also played a role
in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Border Patrol, deputies spotted the pickup
in the driveway of a San Benito house the police said Moore had
shared with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies and agents were searching the home and then the
nearby cornfields, when they heard rifle fire. Ricardo Salinas, 24,
a Border Patrol trainee, and Susan Rodriguez, a 28-year-old agent,
were fatally wounded. Officers later found an AR-15, a civilian
version of the M-16 assault rifle used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who was wounded in the shootout, was taken into custody
and died early on Tuesday night at Valley Baptist Medical Center in
Harlingen, the police said, adding that he was the son of a police
officer in Harlingen, a larger city northwest of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Moore into custody, more than 150 law-enforcement
officials combed the fields and dusty roads for the two men spotted
in the truck. In 100-degree heat, assault teams from several
federal, state and local agencies advanced in helmets and flak
jackets, as a helicopter whirred overhead. Even the police from
Edinburg, a nearby city, rumbled up in an armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, the officers began wrapping up their search,
saying they had scoured the area and would pursue other leads.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded deputy, Raul Rodriguez, 32, was in critical
condition at Valley Baptist Medical Center. The wounded brother,
Danny Morin, 22, was reported to be in serious condition at the
same hospital.

CALIFORNIA HALTS FUNDING FOR BOYS RANCH AFTER `UNDENIABLE ABUSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California authorities dealt a potentially lethal blow Tuesday
to Arizona Boys Ranch by cutting off funds for juvenile delinquents
placed at the 49-year-old non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, accompanied by a scathing critique of Boys Ranch
operations, culminated a three-month probe into the death of
Sacramento teenager Nicholaus Contreraz at a boot camp for
delinquents in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was substantial abuse and neglect at Arizona Boys
Ranch,'' said Sidonie Squier, deputy director for the California
Department of Social Services. ``Line staff, as well as management,
knew about this abuse and did not stop it. For that reason, we will
no longer fund more placements.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch officials, including President Bob Thomas, could not
be reached for comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   California boys account for more than half of the Boys Ranch
enrollment base. Although the Department of Social Services has no
power to prohibit counties in that state from sending youths to
Boys Ranch, the funding cut is expected to eliminate placements.
</P>
<P>
   Squier said state and federal money has covered about 40 percent
of the $3,600 monthly cost for each teenager, making it
cost-effective to counties to export youthful offenders to Arizona.
Now, those counties would be forced to absorb the entire expense.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting off funding for new placements, Social
Services administrators announced that, beginning Aug. 1, they will
stop paying for 223 youths from 11 California counties who
currently reside at Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions were based on the findings of a nine-member
investigative team that reviewed records and interviewed juveniles,
their families, Boys Ranch employees and Arizona officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholaus' death was caused by prolonged and serious medical
neglect and openly conducted abusive treatment,'' says the
conclusion to a 600-page investigative report. ``He suffered
physical and psychological abuse and his personal rights were
continually violated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Eloise Anderson, director of the California
agency, said, ``If I had the authority to remove these kids, I
would bring them home or place them in a safe facility today. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation also found the stated philosophy of how
youth are treated at ABR is very different from the actual
practice. The investigation found widespread excessive use of
physical restraint and hands-on confrontation from ABR staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz, 16, died March 2 at the Boys Ranch boot camp in
Oracle of a severe infection in the lining of his lung.
</P>
<P>
   A coroner's report said the condition, complicated by pneumonia
and other ailments, was accelerated by work and exercise the youth
was forced to do. Medical investigators also listed dozens of cuts
and bruises on the boy's body.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have said that ranch staffers, who suspected Contreraz
of malingering, taunted and punished him relentlessly during the
final days of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the medical reports on Nicholaus, it's undeniable
abuse,'' said Squier. ``He was ill, and it was not difficult to
diagnose that he was ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has admitted wrongdoing by employees while denying that
the mistreatment stemmed from ranch policies or practices. Several
staffers were fired and the Oracle campus was closed after the
incident. However, Thomas has argued that subsequent allegations
from other boys are not credible.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz's grandmother, Connie Woodward, on Tuesday applauded
the California report and funding cutoff as ``fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my heart it will save lives,'' she said, adding,
``If they (Boys Ranch) don't get any money, they're not going to
get our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said last week that enrollment already had dropped from
540 youths to about 400 in the wake of Contreraz's death. He said
the Queen Creek-based agency, with seven campuses statewide, is
retrenching its budget and has laid some employees off.
</P>
<P>
   The California review is one of several probes into the
Contreraz case, but the first to be completed. A criminal probe is
under way in Pinal County, and a licensing decision is pending from
the Arizona Department of Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Los Angeles Times,'' ``Sacramento Bee'' and other
newspapers have published major stories on the exportation of
California boys and dollars to shock incarceration programs such as
Boys Ranch, which are prohibited by law in that state. The subject
has also prompted a series of hearings in the California
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Pinal County law authorities are contemplating
criminal charges against ranch employees, managers or the agency
itself. Prosecutors in the Pinal County Attorney's Office could not
be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Arizona DES gave the ranch a temporary extension
of its license to work with delinquent youths after regulators
announced they had not completed an investigation. A determination
on the license is expected by Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Child Protective Services officials are
reviewing more than 25 additional allegations of mistreatment. &QL;

   ATLANTA, GA. _ Jonathan Huff and Randy Brazee knew they had a
problem when someone hurled a brick through the window of their car
outside the house they own together in the Atlanta neighborhood of
Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around it was a note with a curt message. It read:
``Move out of Kirkwood now, snowflakes!'' Snowflake, they later
discovered, is a derogatory term some black Americans use for white
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   That was in March. Not long afterwards, Jonathan, a computer
systems manager, was listening to a radio show while at work at
Georgia Tech in downtown Atlanta. What he heard stunned him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone called Amos Moore, a black minister of the Baptist
Church, was accusing whites, and especially white homosexuals, of
invading Kirkwood and trying to take it away from its mostly black
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan, 28, understood at once. Months before, he and his
longtime partner Randy, 30, had successfully sued a black neighbor
for selling cocaine and other drugs out of her house, and this was
payback time.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was going on. This minister, whom he had
never heard of, was clearly trying to stir a black campaign to oust
all whites, gay and straight, from Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   The suburb remains at least 80 percent black. Of the whites who
have moved there, about half are homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore was airing a noxious mix of grievances. Among
them was his claim that the few gay households in Kirkwood _ there
are about 20 _ were setting about recruiting black youths to the
gay lifestyle by flying rainbow flags outside their homes, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   They were importing AIDS into the area, he went on, and by doing
up their houses they were driving up property prices and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This last point may have had some legitimacy. Just to the east
of the center, Kirkwood is an unassuming neighborhood of modest
turn-of-the-century homes that for decades has been almost entirely
populated by low-income blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A slow influx by prosperous young whites over recent years has
begun a gradual process of gentrification. An active neighborhood
association of blacks and whites has made strides in driving out
litter and crime. Rapidly rising house values have been an
inevitable consequence.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of an anti-white, anti-gay hate campaign was much
harder to stomach. Atlanta is a proud symbol of racial integration,
a city where almost all the political power lies with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jonathan and Randy and many friends were themselves
the victims of prejudice and discrimination by blacks _ a classic
case, it seemed, of the oppressed turning into the oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore has not gone away. In recent weeks, he has twice
distributed leaflets to black homes, asking them to rallies. ``Save
Our Neighborhood,'' the first once screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are concerned about the `white takeover' of Kirkwood,
come meet with us...to discuss how we can put an end to the
homosexual and lesbian takeover of our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A second leaflet called for an end to ``apartheid'' in Kirkwood
and declared: ``Don't let AIDS take over our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy, who works for a mobile-phone company, says it is the
racism that upsets him most, even more than the gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just in awe that this is happening in 1998. What he is
saying is just perpetuating racism and it's just plain scary.''
Jonathan adds: ``If his stance were a religious one, I wouldn't
care. But for him to viciously and publicly say these things is
frightening, and it's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Atlanta is appalled too. ``This city is what it is
because of all the people who are here, including straights and
gays,'' declared the city council president, Robb Pitts. ``We are
grateful and thankful to the gay community for their
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's defunct community relations board is to be
resurrected specifically to seek ways to defuse the tension in
Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, meanwhile, a special town meeting on the issue
was held at City Hall. At the meeting, Moore was unrepentant,
saying: ``The Bible says homosexuality has no place in the kingdom
of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gathering, he was heckled by Jimmie Scott, a gay man
who is black. ``How can you call yourself a man of God and preach
hate?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate you, because God hates you,'' the Reverend replied. ``I
don't have to condemn you, because God condemns you.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore's outbursts have helped to feed another debate
now getting widespread attention in the U.S. It is about the
alleged unwillingness of the black community generally, and
especially black churches, to come to terms with homosexuality and
to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   While inclusion of homosexuals has been vigorously discussed by
predominantly white denominations, it is not on the agenda of any
of the mainstream black churches.
</P>
<P>
   The head-in-the-sand attitude to gay sex and AIDS in most black
churches comes at a time when new statistics show that 57 percent
of new HIV infections in America are among black people, whether
caused by homosexual or heterosexual contact or through drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans account for only 13 percent of the whole
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that homosexuality is not a reality in our
church,'' said the Rev. Tim McDonald of Atlanta's Concerned Black
Clergy. ``That's a problem that white folks have.'' If there are
black ministers in denial about homosexuality, the Rev. Moore is
surely among them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his poisonous rhetoric will surely fade in time. If
there are many supporting him, they are not showing themselves: at
the City Hall meeting, there was barely a handful at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I find anyone in Kirkwood willing to speak up for him.
``It doesn't bother me at all,'' said Agnes Langston, 51, when
asked about the new gay households.
</P>
<P>
   A black resident in Kirkwood for 30 years and a close neighbor
of Jonathan and Randy, she celebrates their court action that
forced the closing of the crack house on Kirkwood Road. She has no
desire to meet the Rev. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Langston also agrees that since the whites started coming in,
the area has become more pleasant. ``It's calmer, there's no more
litter and no more drugs.'' But she also acknowledges the potential
downside of gentrification. ``Those taxes,'' she says. ``Someone's
got to fix that.'' &QL;

 By RICHARD LLOYD PARRY  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sumida-gawa, which divides Tokyo's east and west, is
among the ugliest of the world's rivers, but also one of the most
immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of colorless buildings are reflected in the grey-brown
waters; cars hum constantly along the concrete expressway suspended
above them. But the wide pathways, with their thoughtfully provided
picnic tables, are free of litter.
</P>
<P>
   The flotsam _ human and inanimate _ which usually accumulates
along urban river banks is nowhere to be seen. In fact you could
walk straight past without ever suspecting that this is the saddest
place in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   You might be puzzled by the neat cubes, the size and shape of
shipping containers, which line the walkway. They are made of
cardboard and carefully wrapped with string in waterproof blue
tarpaulins, like giant Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside one _ after removing your shoes _ and you would
discover that each contains a tiny home, with mattress and quilt,
and a makeshift shelf containing comics and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One occupant even has even rigged up a portable electric
generator. Pots and pans, salvaged from the garbage left for
collection on the street, hang from nails in the plywood wall.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is closer to that of a camp site than the
cardboard cities of London or Manhattan. But that is what this is:
the most extreme and pathetic manifestation of Japan's economic
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many homeless people there are in Japan, but
since the early 1990s, when the bursting of the ``bubble economy''
first began to set off redundancies and bankruptcies, their number
has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, there were no cardboard houses along the
Sumida; now there are an estimated 500, and the pattern is repeated
in parks, stations, and covered arcades around Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   To a European or American eye, the homeless of Japan are unique:
clean, neat and resourceful, and clinging to self-respect. But in a
society of insiders, their exclusion also brings unique sufferings.
</P>
<P>
   The career of Masami Kobayashi is typical of those who end up
living in the blue boxes by the Sumida River. In 1960, as a
30-year-old steeplejack, he came to Tokyo from his home in Kyushu,
Japan's southernmost island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Japan boomed, and no sector
benefited more than the building industry. Even without skills or
an education, an able-bodied man could always find casual work on
the construction sites _ a last resort for the unskilled or
unattached, many of them escaping divorces or business failure or a
spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the job market in day laborers was a few hundred
yards from the river, in the area known as Sanya. It was there,
after jobs in various parts of Japan, that Kobayashi arrived. Ten
years ago, there was enough work to go around, even for men of
Kobayashi's age, but all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced that male unemployment had
risen to a record postwar high of 4.3 percent and, since the
collapse of the property market in the early 1990s, construction
has been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters now pick only the youngest and fittest men.
``There are too many looking for work,'' says Kobayashi, ``and if
you're over 60 it's almost impossible. I haven't worked for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains the most striking characteristic of Japan's
homeless _ overwhelmingly they are older men.
</P>
<P>
   One survey, of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, found that more than
90 percent were over 40. The streets around Sanya are full of them,
sitting on the pavement, staring into space, and sipping cups of
cheap sake dispensed from vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that I have a place to live,'' says Hiroshi, a
62-year old, who lives in four square yards of tatami mat in a
cheap hotel paid for by the government. ``But I have no one to talk
to here, and I am a lonely person.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on the street until three years ago, when he was struck
by a car while drunkenly crossing the road. The permanent injuries
to his legs and arms guaranteed him a place to live, but put paid
to any hope that he will ever work again.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese social security is hedged around with conditions and
exclusions and many of the neediest people, like Kobayashi, fall
through the net. The blue boxes by the river are tolerated by the
authorities, but their occupants are acutely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yakuza gangs often employ the homeless as drug pushers or
messengers. Homeless women are a minority, but they are at the
greatest risk, from sexual assault and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer, however, is probably the cheap sake. ``Sanya
has always been a place for alcohol, but it's really getting
serious,'' says Megumu Mizuta, a voluntary worker. ``There's a big
difference between drinking after work, and drinking all day when
you have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical threats. Tokyo freezes in the
winter; now, and until September, it is baking hot. Apart from
common ailments, there have been cases of tuberculosis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fights and violence are common _ three weeks ago two homeless
men were stabbed to death by a third who was pursued across the
river by police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that,'' says Kobayashi. ``Fireworks. The schoolkids
come out in the evenings and throw them into the homes where people
are sleeping.'' Several men have been burned as a result.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mental suffering of alienation _ in a society based
upon groups, rather than individuals _ that is hardest to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these men have no families of their own,'' says
Professor Masami Iwata of Japan Women's University, who has studied
homelessness in the country. ``Their personal identity comes from
their role as workers, and now they have no work. They don't think
of themselves as victims, but as failures, and many of them are
very ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, compared to the population as a whole, the homeless are
few. Apart from a few isolated areas, like Sumida-gawa, they are
not a social problem, certainly not one that politicians or local
government officials are worrying about _ although that may change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, we noticed a few men wearing ties and business
suits,'' says another voluntary worker. ``We were very surprised,
but they didn't want to talk. They're a minority now, but in a few
years who knows how many of them there will be?'' &QL;

AMERICAN LEAGUE TRIUMPHS, 13-8
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In an All-Star Game that matched the offensive nature
of the season and fit the park that was host to it, the American
and National leagues produced the highest-scoring game in all-star
history on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The American League outlasted the National, 13-8, as the teams
also combined for a record-tying 31 hits and played for 3 hours 38
minutes, the longest nine-inning game in the 69-game run of the
contest that brings together the best pitchers and hitters in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   According to an ages-old baseball maxim, good pitching is
supposed to stop good hitting. But that notion was overmatched on
Tuesday night. It went up against the Coors Field maxim that says
when at Coors, hitters beat up pitchers, and that's the one that
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coors Field will keep its reputation, and so it should,'' said
Dante Bichette, a member of the hometeam Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of 31 hits might have been expected to generate more
home runs and extra-base hits, but the teams rattled 26 singles
around the generous park, breaking yet another record.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outbreak of hits, the tying run and the tie-breaking
run, the one that gave the A.L. a lead (7-6) it never surrendered,
were scored in the sixth inning without a hit driving them in. The
first came on a passed ball by Javier Lopez, the second moments
later on a wild pitch by Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr., the leaders in the pursuit of
Roger Maris' home run record, did not hit any home runs. Juan
Gonzalez, who drove in 101 runs before the break, did not get a hit
in four times at bat with a total of nine runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez did drive in a run with a bases-loaded sacrifice
fly in the fourth inning, and it contributed, sort of, to the A.L.
victory. More significant was the A.L. run Rafael Palmeiro singled
home in the ninth inning because that's the one that eclipsed the
previous highest-scoring game, an American 11-9 victory at
Cleveland in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Jason's Kendall pinch-hit single for the N.L. in the ninth was
the hit that tied the record for combined hits, set in 1954 and
tied in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although the star all-stars did not hit home runs, that did not
mean Coors Field was big enough to hold all of the baseballs within
the playing field. Alex Rodriguez and Roberto Alomar slugged
bases-empty home runs for the American League and Barry Bonds
whacked an impressive three-run blast for the National.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, before his seventh-inning home run, stroked two singles
and wound up as the game's most valuable player. Last year his
brother Sandy was named mvp after hitting a game-winning home run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Latin American player, one of a record 20 chosen for
the game, was the winning pitcher. That was Bartolo Colon of
Cleveland, who was the A.L. pitcher in the game when the team
scored three runs in the sixth and snatched an 8-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mike Hargrove, Colon's manager during the season and in
this game, noted, ``He had to give up a three-run home run to get
the win.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the Bonds blast in the fifth inning, a three-run
shot that hit the San Francisco Giants sign on the facade of the
third tier of right field stands and catapulted the Nationals into
a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   If the 51,267 fans, largest ever to watch a game at routinely
sold-out Coors, were disappointed that McGwire, the major league
leader with 37, did not hit a home run, he said he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm realistic about things,'' said McGwire, who did not add to
his total of home runs in the last five games before the break. ``I
can't do it every day at bat, can't do it every week. You go
through streaks where you hit some, get in a nice groove, then you
go in a streaks where I hit one every week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire grounded out and struck out in his first two at-bats,
then walked just ahead of the home run by Bonds. But the new N.L.
lead did not last long. Only until the next inning, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   And what an ugly inning it was. Alomar and Ken Griffey Jr.
started problems for Urbina, Montreal's closer, by beating the ball
into the ground and getting cheap singles. Alomar's caromed off
Craig Biggio's glove near second, and Griffey's barely went beyond
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina struck out Gonzalez, but after the runners executed a
double steal, he walked Jim Thome, loading the bases. With Derek
Jeter batting, Lopez of Atlanta lost control of an Urbina pitch,
and Alomar scored the game-tying run on the passed ball, the other
runners also advancing a base each.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jeter struck out on the next pitch, but Urbina's second
pitch to Ivan Rodriguez was wild, and Griffey scored the
tie-breaking run. Rodriguez then singled for his third hit of the
game and became the first catcher in all-star history to get three
hits. Thome scored the third run of the inning on the hit, giving
the A.L. an 8-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar made that score 9-6, slugging a two-out home run against
Trevor Hoffman of San Diego in the seventh. Sandy Alomar Jr.
singled home a run in the eighth, raising the lead to 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationals threatened to disturb the A.L. lead in their half
of the eighth when Greg Vaughn lined a two-run pinch-hit single to
left field and Devon White followed with another line single to
left. But when Fernando Vina tried to score from second base, Paul
O'Neill threw him out, firing a perfect throw to Sandy Alomar Jr.,
who tagged Vina on the left knee as he slid home.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon then induced the dangerous Andres Galarraga to ground
into an inning-ending double play. The Americans then added three
runs to their advantage in the ninth inning.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sumida-gawa, which divides Tokyo's east and west, is
among the ugliest of the world's rivers, but also one of the most
immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of colorless buildings are reflected in the grey-brown
waters; cars hum constantly along the concrete expressway suspended
above them. But the wide pathways, with their thoughtfully provided
picnic tables, are free of litter.
</P>
<P>
   The flotsam _ human and inanimate _ which usually accumulates
along urban river banks is nowhere to be seen. In fact you could
walk straight past without ever suspecting that this is the saddest
place in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   You might be puzzled by the neat cubes, the size and shape of
shipping containers, which line the walkway. They are made of
cardboard and carefully wrapped with string in waterproof blue
tarpaulins, like giant Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside one _ after removing your shoes _ and you would
discover that each contains a tiny home, with mattress and quilt,
and a makeshift shelf containing comics and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One occupant even has even rigged up a portable electric
generator. Pots and pans, salvaged from the garbage left for
collection on the street, hang from nails in the plywood wall.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is closer to that of a camp site than the
cardboard cities of London or Manhattan. But that is what this is:
the most extreme and pathetic manifestation of Japan's economic
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many homeless people there are in Japan, but
since the early 1990s, when the bursting of the ``bubble economy''
first began to set off redundancies and bankruptcies, their number
has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, there were no cardboard houses along the
Sumida; now there are an estimated 500, and the pattern is repeated
in parks, stations, and covered arcades around Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   To a European or American eye, the homeless of Japan are unique:
clean, neat and resourceful, and clinging to self-respect. But in a
society of insiders, their exclusion also brings unique sufferings.
</P>
<P>
   The career of Masami Kobayashi is typical of those who end up
living in the blue boxes by the Sumida River. In 1960, as a
30-year-old steeplejack, he came to Tokyo from his home in Kyushu,
Japan's southernmost island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Japan boomed, and no sector
benefited more than the building industry. Even without skills or
an education, an able-bodied man could always find casual work on
the construction sites _ a last resort for the unskilled or
unattached, many of them escaping divorces or business failure or a
spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the job market in day laborers was a few hundred
yards from the river, in the area known as Sanya. It was there,
after jobs in various parts of Japan, that Kobayashi arrived. Ten
years ago, there was enough work to go around, even for men of
Kobayashi's age, but all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced that male unemployment had
risen to a record postwar high of 4.3 percent and, since the
collapse of the property market in the early 1990s, construction
has been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters now pick only the youngest and fittest men.
``There are too many looking for work,'' says Kobayashi, ``and if
you're over 60 it's almost impossible. I haven't worked for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains the most striking characteristic of Japan's
homeless _ overwhelmingly they are older men.
</P>
<P>
   One survey, of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, found that more than
90 percent were over 40. The streets around Sanya are full of them,
sitting on the pavement, staring into space, and sipping cups of
cheap sake dispensed from vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that I have a place to live,'' says Hiroshi, a
62-year old, who lives in four square yards of tatami mat in a
cheap hotel paid for by the government. ``But I have no one to talk
to here, and I am a lonely person.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on the street until three years ago, when he was struck
by a car while drunkenly crossing the road. The permanent injuries
to his legs and arms guaranteed him a place to live, but put paid
to any hope that he will ever work again.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese social security is hedged around with conditions and
exclusions and many of the neediest people, like Kobayashi, fall
through the net. The blue boxes by the river are tolerated by the
authorities, but their occupants are acutely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yakuza gangs often employ the homeless as drug pushers or
messengers. Homeless women are a minority, but they are at the
greatest risk, from sexual assault and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer, however, is probably the cheap sake. ``Sanya
has always been a place for alcohol, but it's really getting
serious,'' says Megumu Mizuta, a voluntary worker. ``There's a big
difference between drinking after work, and drinking all day when
you have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical threats. Tokyo freezes in the
winter; now, and until September, it is baking hot. Apart from
common ailments, there have been cases of tuberculosis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fights and violence are common _ three weeks ago two homeless
men were stabbed to death by a third who was pursued across the
river by police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that,'' says Kobayashi. ``Fireworks. The schoolkids
come out in the evenings and throw them into the homes where people
are sleeping.'' Several men have been burned as a result.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mental suffering of alienation _ in a society based
upon groups, rather than individuals _ that is hardest to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these men have no families of their own,'' says
Professor Masami Iwata of Japan Women's University, who has studied
homelessness in the country. ``Their personal identity comes from
their role as workers, and now they have no work. They don't think
of themselves as victims, but as failures, and many of them are

not a social problem, certainly not one that politicians or local
government officials are worrying about _ although that may change.

LESLIE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT: A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks breathed a big sigh
of relief Tuesday night as they snapped a losing streak at five
games with a 86-79 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading
Charlotte Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika converted two crucial 3-pointers in the final two
minutes and Lisa Leslie celebrated her 26th birthday with 24 points
before 5,927 at the Forum. Tamecka Dixon had 19 points and Penn
Toler and Mabika had 15 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really were prepared,'' said a happy Sparks coach, Julie
Rousseau. ``Two days of practice really helped out. We can do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (3-7) found a way by reducing their turnovers (they
had 14) while being aggressive offensively and defensively. They
shot 52 percent from the field, had 12 steals and scored 20 points
alone on the Sting mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks held the lead from early in the first half, but the
Sting (8-3) tied the score twice in the final minutes. Andrea
Stinson (21 points) made a 14-foot jumper to give Charlotte its
last tie, 74-74, with 3:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie grabbed her own miss to regain the lead (76-74) and
Mabika hit a 3-pointer with 2:03 on the clock to make it 79-75. She
made another long one with 32.5 seconds left. Then the Sparks broke
the Stings' press, Sandra VanEmbrics made a layup and that was
that. The Sting scored two baskets in the last three seconds, but
it was too little and way too late.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a while the Sparks were in control in the
first half, leading 42-37 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few lapses, they were effective defensively, making
steals and creating problems for the Sting. And the Sparks got
better offensive production from their leaders with Leslie scoring
14 points, Dixon 10 and Toler nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks gained the lead for good on a Leslie free throw with
11:35 left. They were ahead by was many as 10 twice in the last two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, if we can put two halves together, we can win,''
Toler said. ``I thought everybody played great, even off the bench.
I thought that was a great, great team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sparks note: Mabika was fined $350 by the WNBA for throwing
an arm at Utah's 7-foot-2 Margo Dydek last week.

SPORTS COLUMN: COORS FIELD STEALS A BIT OF SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It takes a mile-high amount of hype for a ball park to
push its way to stardom among a host of major league All-Stars.
Coors Field did just that on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strange things were happening a mile above sea level. And when
they occurred, it certified the troubles the home team Rockies have
seen since they set out to prove that major league hitters can be
contained no matter how thin the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That things are different here was never more apparent than when
Baltimore's Roberto Alomar hit an opposite-field home run off of
San Diego's Trevor Hoffman in the sixth inning, this after
appearing to bail out on the pitch and swinging with his heart and
his back foot practically in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   As Alomar circled the bases and helped the American League flex
its muscles all the more in a 13-8 victory, his teammate, Cal
Ripken Jr., could be seen laughing in disbelief in the visitors'
dugout. The homer was the highlight of the night, not only for
Alomar, the most valuable player, but also for a ball park that
chopped down offensive record after record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a different kind of All-Star Game, with a lot of
scoring,'' said Alomar, owner of three of the record-tying 31 hits
and scorer of 2 of the record 21 runs in the game. ``In this ball
park, it's what is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager and an A.L. coach, was
thinking as much as he watched the runs pile up. For it was Torre
who aptly described just what kind of baseball this is when losing
many a game here while managing the Cardinals. ``Arena baseball,''
he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The last Ping-Pong shot over the fence usually decides the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland of the Marlins, who managed the National League
All-Stars, seemed to sense just that during the game when he could
not define his strategy, simply saying, ``In this park you never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove of Cleveland, the American League's
manager, who once managed a mile high while with a Colorado Springs
farm club, knew what might come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played pretty much as I expected,'' Hargrove said. ``The
one thing that I had forgotten is how deeply the outfielders play
to make up for the thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, the manager of the Rockies for all their six years
in the majors, learned those Coors Field nuances long ago. He has
also watched the track meet of scorers rounding the bases without
end. Once earlier this year, his Rockies scored 7 runs in a game _
only to lose by 11. On Tuesday night, Baylor, a coach for the N.L.
squad, watched the home team All-Stars score a half dozen runs by
the fifth, but still trail by four heading into the bottom of the
eighth in what would become the highest scoring All-star Game,
surpassing the record set in 1954 when the A.L. won, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez had three hits, a record for a catcher in an
All-Star Game. And the Texas Ranger played only six innings.
</P>
<P>
   And as always in Coors Field, the carnage could have been much
worse. For the A.L. stranded 11 runners, the N.L. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The fans love this kind of ball when Rockies' hides are not on
the line. So they came primed for action. No 2-0 games would do, as
Chicagoans had to settle for when the All-Star Game was played in
that other hitters' park, Wrigley Field, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The record Coors Field crowd of 51,267 cheered the approach of
every notable home run hitter, especially those chasing Roger
Maris' single-season record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   The masses groaned when Ken Griffey Jr. popped out with runners
on first and third and no outs in the first inning. They booed when
Mark McGwire was walked with a runner on third and no outs in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   They wished for heroics when the former local favorite Andres
Galarraga flied to the warning track in the sixth, just missing a
three-run home run. Even a reviled Rockies rival turned the cheers
around when Barry Bonds of the Giants hit his first All-Star home
run, becoming only the second son, after Griffey, to join his
father in the roll call of All-Star home run hitters.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of offensive mayhem that has sent pitchers
scurrying from the N.L. West club as quickly as they could and
caused observers to question the sanity of any pitcher who comes
here voluntarily. (Darryl Kile, what were you thinking?)
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby knows. An All-Star from the Padres, he had his nerves
worn here as a member of the original Rockies. When asked before
the game if he knew how to pitch well here, Ashby laughed and said,
``I didn't know when I was here.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys headed for the Hall of Fame didn't seem to have much of
a clue either. Roger Clemens of the Blue Jays was rocketed for two
runs in one inning. The usually unflappable Tom Glavine of the
Braves walked in a run, an unheard-of slip by one of the legion of
Cy Young pitchers from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Leyland could only lament and commiserate with the
full-time residents of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a Coors Field game,'' the Marlins' manager
said.

   DENVER _ Until a month ago, Juan Gonzalez had never heard of
Hack Wilson or of Wilson's major-league record of 190 runs batted
in. But for the Texas Rangers' slugger, it's now a magic name, a
magic number and a magic mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about Hack Wilson now, I know about the record,'' he
was saying. ``It's not easy. It's not impossible too.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about runs batted in to Gonzalez and his eyes glow, his
smile widens, his mustache twitches. Other sluggers are home-run
hitters. He's an RBI man. It's as if RBI were his real initials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job,'' he said. ``I've got to drive the guys in.''
</P>
<P>
   With 101 already this season as he batted cleanup for the
American League in Tuesday night's All-Star game, Gonzalez had the
second highest RBI total at the All-Star break to Hank Greenberg's
103 in 1935; the Tigers' first baseman finished with 170 that year.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had opportunities on Tuesday night, coming up with a
total of nine All-Star teammates on base, but he knocked in only
one run on a sacrifice fly as the A.L. won 13-8
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters sing solo, but RBI leaders need a chorus of
baserunners. Considering that Gonzalez has hit 26 homers, he has
already driven in the remarkable total of 75 teammates. In 1930
when Wilson had his 190 RBIs and hit 56 homers, still the National
League record, he drove in 134 teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to see home runs, they like to see the ball fly
away,'' Gonzalez said. ``But you have more chances for RBIs, the
guys on base are letting me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' batting order, leadoff centerfielder Tom Goodwin
has scored 58 runs while batting .273, second baseman Mark McLemore
has scored 55 runs while batting .287 and left fielder Rusty Greer
has scored 55 runs while batting .280.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them on base, I concentrate more,'' Gonzalez said.
``My adrenaline is more.''
</P>
<P>
   But until last Sunday night, the 28-year-old Puerto Rican hadn't
driven in a run in six games. He was stuck in neutral at 97 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shooting for 100 by the All-Star break,'' he said. ``I
didn't think I would get it, but then I had the best night in my
career and against one of the best pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a pair of two-run homers off Randy Johnson of the Mariners,
Gonzalez suddenly had 101 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More RBIs than games played,'' he said, alluding to his 87
games. ``That's what you need to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez now needs 90 more RBIs in the Rangers' 76 remaining
games to break one of baseball's most enduring records that was set
by one of its most enigmatic sluggers. Hack Wilson isn't even in
the Hall of Fame. After five big years for the Cubs, and one more
for the Brooklyn Dodgers, he drifted away.
</P>
<P>
   As a 5-foot-6-inch 195-pound rookie outfielder with the New York
Giants in 1923, Lewis Wilson got his nickname because his physique
resembled that of a popular Russian wrestler, George Hackenschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson didn't blossom as a slugger until he joined the Cubs in
1926, driving in 109 runs that year, then 129, 120 and 159 before
exploding with 190 in 1930 with those 56 homers and a .356 average.
That August he drove in 53 runs. He was the National League's
unofficial most valuable player that year.
</P>
<P>
   For each of his 56 homers, he received an Elgin watch. His
salary for 1931 was $33,000, lucrative for that era.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs manager, Joe McCarthy, was aware of Wilson's
reputation as a drinker. Wilson's lore includes the day that
McCarthy opened a gin bottle, dropped a worm in it and watched the
worm shrivel up.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the dead worm, McCarthy asked, ``What does this
prove, Hack?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves,'' Wilson supposedly said, ``that if you drink, you
won't get worms.''
</P>
<P>
   Traded after he skidded in 1931 to 13 homers and only 61 RBIs,
Wilson hit 23 homers and drove in 123 runs for the Dodgers in 1932
but that was his last big season. He died in 1948 at age 48 in a
Baltimore hospital. Ford Frick, then the National League president,
sent $350 to pay for Wilson's funeral in Baltimore and his burial
in Martinsburg, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Those 190 RBIs in 1930 have been Hack Wilson's monument, but now
Juan Gonzalez might approach it, if not surpass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stop on Sept. 27,'' the Rangers' slugger said, alluding to
the last day of the season. ``Right now I have a chance.'' &QL;

   DENVER _ For the first time, two brothers have not only earned
the most valuable player trophy in the All-Star Game, but they have
done it in consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   With a home run and two singles, Roberto Alomar, the Orioles'
second baseman, was voted the mvp on Tuesday night in the American
League's 13-8 victory. A year ago in Cleveland, his older brother,
Sandy Alomar, the Indians' catcher, hit the game-winning homer in
the A.L.'s 3-1 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a tough moment; our grandmother had just passed
away, and Sandy got the trophy,'' Roberto Alomar was saying now.
``This year, I won it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a disappointing season for the Orioles, who were
considered a challenger to the Yankees in the A.L. East. But with a
38-50 record, they have dropped 26{ games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Their owner, Peter Angelos, has talked of trading several
Orioles later this season. One possibility is that Roberto, who
will be a free agent after the season, will join his brother in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a dream for me to play with Sandy on the same
team,'' Roberto said, ``but we don't know if it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the A.L. starters, Roberto Alomar stayed in the game the
longest. Mike Hargrove, the A.L. manager, explained that Ray
Durham, the White Sox second baseman, and Scott Brosius, the Yankee
third baseman, were two of his most versatile backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep Ray out as long as I could,'' Hargrove said.
``Having Robbie Alomar in a ball game for a long time doesn't hurt
a winning effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar beat out a bunt in the first inning, popped out in the
third, walked in the fourth, singled off second baseman Craig
Biggio's glove in the sixth and soon stole third base and scored on
a passed ball, then hit a home run off the Padres' Trevor Hoffman
in the seventh for a 9-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be prepared to come and play the whole
game, especially when you're playing in a National League ball
park,'' Alomar said. ``You have to leave some guys behind, just in
case it's a tied ball game at the end. I was surprised I played
eight innings, but I was ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was not surprised by the highest-scoring game in All-Star
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always watched baseball on TV,'' he said. ``When you
watch the scoring in Denver, you're always seeing big numbers, 13
to 6, 13 to 7. This was a different kind of All-Star Game, a lot of
scoring. But in this ball park, that's what you expect.''

 AL rains hits in record All-Star slugfest  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When neither All-Star team scored in the first two
innings at Coors Field Tuesday night, you began to wonder if good
pitching still stops good hitting at a mile-high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Although the anticipated longball extravaganza never
materialized, the American League used homers from Mariner
shortstop Alex Rodriguez and Baltimore Orioles second baseman
Roberto Alomar, a barrage of singles and record number of stolen
bases to defeat the National League 13-8 in the highest-scoring
All-Star game ever.
</P>
<P>
   Also the longest.
</P>
<P>
   The 69th Midsummer Classic took an American League-like three
hours and 38 minutes to play. That is 28 minutes longer than the
July 15, 1954, game that also had been the previous
highest-scoring, nine-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, an Alomar won the MVP trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto picked up where his older brother, Sandy, left off last
season. Roberto's three hits, including a home run, earned him the
award Tuesday. Sandy won it last year in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back brother MVPs was a first, but just one of
several strange happenings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   How unusual was this game?
</P>
<P>
   The AL had more stolen bases (5) than home runs (2).
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians pitcher Bartolo Colo surrendered a three-run
homer to San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds in the fifth
inning and still was the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' 451-foot blast remarkably hit the ``SF'' logo on the
upper-deck facade in right-center field, right next to a ``Hit it
Here'' sign. A hit there would have made one of the 51,267 fans an
instant millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game that produced 31 hits and 21 runs, a throw from
left field might have been the key play.
</P>
<P>
   The National League, trailing 10-6 entering the eighth inning,
loaded the bases off Boston Red Sox closer Tom Gordon. The
right-hander, who leads the AL in saves with 25, found himself in a
bases-loaded, none-out predicament after Moises Alou singled, Edgar
Renteria reached on third baseman Scott Brosius' error and former
Mariner Fernando Vina walked.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Greg Vaughn slapped a two-run single to left and
Devon White also singled to left field. Vina chugged from second to
third and was waved home by third-base coach Rich Donnely.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, who normally plays right field for the Yankees,
charged the ball in left and came up throwing. Vina was nailed at
the plate for the inning's first out, and former Rockies star
Andres Galarraga bounced into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The blown opportunity to get back in the game stunned the
capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him (Donnely) about it,'' NL manager Jim
Leyland said. ``It might have been a situation, to be honest with
you, where he thought the ball might go to second base because of
the score. But (he) got burned by it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said Vina may have been fooled on the ball White hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a ball that was a sure hit, and I'm sure the guy
(Vina) had to hold up a little bit. When I got the ball, I saw that
he wasn't around third, so I figured I had a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just threw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vina, who played for the Mariners in 1993 and eventually matured
into an All-Star second baseman with the Milwaukee Brewers, was
tagged out at the plate by Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Being too aggressive backfired for the NL. It worked fine for
the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the game with the idea that we would be as
aggressive as we could be if we could get people on base,'' AL
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``We felt that if we could get our guys
like (Kenny) Lofton and (Roberto) Alomar on base early, steal some
bases and put on some pressure, we might have a better chance of
carrying it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofton singled and stole second in the first inning; Alomar and
Ken Griffey Jr. singled and pulled off a double-steal in a
three-run sixth; Ivan Rodriguez singled and swiped second in the
sixth; and Brosius singled, stole second and scored in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The previous All-Star stolen base record, four, was shared by
the AL in 1990 and NL in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The game's prophet turned out to be AL starter David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference on Monday, the Yankees' perfect game
left-hander said he envisioned a high-scoring game, but not when he
was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Wells tossed two hitless innings before the game became a
slugfest. But so did NL starter Greg Maddux, who worked out of a
bases-loaded situation in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Atlanta Braves teammate Tom Glavine, worked one
inning and didn't work out of trouble. The AL scored four runs in
the third inning to erase a 2-0 deficit and never trailed again.

NO MARTINEZ, BUT AL STARS SHINE
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-ALLSTARGAME-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Skipped over as the American League's starting pitcher,
Pedro Martinez went to AL manager Mike Hargrove before Tuesday
night's 69th All-Star Game and said that if Hargrove didn't need
him, he'd rather not pitch.
</P>
<P>
   A fit of pique, or a minor knot in his shoulder, as Hargrove
told a national TV audience during the game? It wasn't a knot,
Martinez said afterward, but judging by his frolics in the AL
dugout, clowning with teammates and bantering with fans, Martinez's
snit over not starting was a minor one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Red Sox ace had a foreshadowing of what was to come
in Coors Field, already a proven vineyard of bitter wine for those
who pitch for a living and no different Tuesday night, when
offensive records fell by the fistful in the American League's 13-8
win over their National counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather wait and take the real rest and go to Baltimore for
the second half,'' Martinez said. ``If I had been the starter, I
would have taken it ... But I'm not upset.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a couple of innings for them to warm up, but hitters on
both sides seized the occasion, treating double-digit winners on
the mound as if they had just arrived on the Pawtucket shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles second baseman Robbie Alomar gave the Alomar brothers
back-to-back MVP trophies, by hitting a home run, beating out a
bunt single, and reaching on an infield hit, and executing a double
steal with Ken Griffey in the sixth inning, when the AL Stars took
the lead for good, 8-6, with three runs scored on a passed ball,
wild pitch, and Ivan Rodriguez's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not quite as dramatic as brother Sandy's game-winning home
run on his home turf in Cleveland a year ago, but it will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Robbie Alomar, who is the subject of
trade rumors because of the Orioles' dreadful season and could have
a new address by the end of the month. ``I didn't come here to win
an MVP. I came here to play the game of baseball, to have fun, and
to try my best to help this team win. It's a great surprise. I'm
going to take the trophy home.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL Stars, beating the NL at their own game, stole a record
five bases, homered twice, and collected 19 hits before a Coors
Field record crowd of 51,267 that witnessed the longest nine-inning
game in All-Star history. It started at 8:42 p.m. Eastern time, and
ended at 12:20 a.m., 10 minutes before the late-night talk shows
were signing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coors Field type game _ you saw some balls bloop in, freak
hits, guys had to play deep, and then they hit some balls out of
the ballpark,'' said National League manager Jim Leyland, whose
team last led after Barry Bonds's three-run home run off
Cleveland's young fastballer, Bartolo Colon, in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland's team appeared on the verge of regaining the lead in
the eighth inning against Red Sox closer Tom Gordon until Rich
Donnelly, Leyland's third base coach in Florida, waved home
Fernando Vina on Devon White's base hit, even though there were no
out, two runs already in, and Gordon reeling from allowing five
straight base runners to reach on three singles, a walk, and an
error.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee outfielder Paul O'Neill, playing out of position in left,
made a strong throw to the plate to cut down Vina, and Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel, whose selection meant Nomar Garciaparra had
to stay home, turned the kind of acrobatic double play that led
Hargrove to pick Omar over Nomar in the first place, preserving the
AL's 10-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I played left field? Seemed like about 20 years
ago tonight,'' O'Neill said. ``I didn't come in on the ball real
well because I wasn't real comfortable. But as soon as I got it, I
had a little momentum going to the plate and I basically threw it
as hard as I could. It ended up in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams broke the record for most runs in a game scored by
both clubs, which was 20. The AL Stars tied their own record for
most runs in a game, 13, which they did twice before, the last time
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise offensively was that the expected long-ball
duel did not materialize. Only three home runs were hit, two by AL
Stars (Alomar, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez), one by the NL (Bonds).
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cy Young Award winners (Tom Glavine, Roger Clemens) nor
commoners were spared the offensive onslaught. Both starters, Greg
Maddux and David Wells, emerged unscathed, Wells having the easier
time of it while Maddux pitched out of a first-and-third, one-out
jam in the first. But after Clemens gave up two runs on Tony
Gwynn's two-run single in the third, Billerica's Glavine was raked
for four runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar touched off the AL's deciding rally against Montreal
reliever Ugueth Urbina in the sixth with an infield hit off the
glove of Houston second baseman Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey followed with a broken-bat bleeder that barely cleared
the pitcher's mound for an infield hit, and on an 0-and-2 count to
RBI king Juan Gonzalez, Alomar broke for third and easily beat Javy
Lopez's throw to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who came to the plate with nine runners on base but
delivered just one with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning,
struck out, but Cleveland strongman Jim Thome walked to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   The tying run came across when Urbina's fastball ticked off
catcher Lopez's glove for a passed ball, and Urbina's wild pitch
made it 7-6. Texas catcher Rodriguez, who came into the game second
in the AL in hitting with a .351 average, then lined an RBI single
to left, his third hit of the game, to make it 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's home run off San Diego reliever Trevor Hoffman, the
brother of current Dodger manager and former Sox infielder Glenn
Hoffman, made it 9-6 in the seventh, and three straight singles in
the eighth, the last by Sandy Alomar Jr., made it 10-6. The AL
salted the game away with three runs in the ninth on three singles,
an error, and a sacrifice fly.

VAUGHN BREAKS OFF TALKS WITH RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-VAUGHN-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Just as with Roger Clemens, who has gone to two
All-Star Games since leaving the team as a free agent, the Red Sox
apparently are prepared to take negotiations down to the zero hour
with first baseman Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich, said here Tuesday night that talks
have broken off until after the season with the Red Sox regarding a
new contract for his client but added, ``the door is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment whatsoever other than the fact that we
talked,'' said Reich, who refused to confirm that the Red Sox had
made the first baseman an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Club spokesman Kevin Shea would not confirm that talks were even
held here, with CEO John Harrington and general manager Dan
Duquette both in town.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was scheduled to participate in the game after being
selected an All-Star for the third time, but he bowed out because
of a strained right hamstring and remained in Boston. He said
before the All-Star break that he planned to work out at Fenway
Park before the team leaves Wednesday for Baltimore and a start of
a four-game series with the Orioles Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald, without citing sources, reported that the Red
Sox had offered Vaughn a four-year deal worth around $37 million.
That would be a substantial increase over the last offer the Red
Sox made this spring, a two-year deal in the neighborhood of $20
million, but well below what Vaughn's representatives consider
market value for premier first basemen.
</P>
<P>
   The average value of $9.25 million a year, if accurate, is less
than the reported three-year, $30 million offer the Red Sox made to
Vaughn last December, an offer he said he was close to accepting
until the team signed pitcher Pedro Martinez to a six-year, $75
million deal, whose average value of $12.5 million is the highest
given any player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' Reich said Tuesday night. ``The door is
still open. No other talks are planned until after the season. I am
not going to participate (publicly) with what's going on. It would
not have been productive in the first half of the season and it
won't be productive during the second half for the same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Another first baseman who knows Vaughn as a friend and a rival,
Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro, was asked before the game whether he
thought it possible that the Red Sox would not re-sign Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a mistake,'' said Palmeiro, who is also in his
free agent year and dealing with considerable speculation that the
Orioles will not re-sign him. ``I think Mo Vaughn is the Boston Red
Sox. He's one of the best players in the game and one of the most
colorful personalities. They would miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who has said he would like to stay in Boston, will have
15 days after the season to file for free agency. The Sox then
would have about another month to negotiate with Vaughn before
losing that right. The Clemens negotiations went down to the
December deadline before he said he had signed with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door's always been open and the door will stay open, but
that's it,'' Reich said. ``Mo is bound and determined not to let
contract decisions intrude into the second half. There aren't going
to be any further discussions until after the season.''

PATRIOTS DON'T HAVE TO ALL STAND ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday July 14)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I knew a man who wore a tiny flag pin in his lapel. The pin was
to show that he was all-American. And he was, in his way.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke of his country you'd think his heart would burst
with pride. But his heart didn't have enough room for all
Americans. He didn't like Mexicans or Jews or African-Americans, a
term he refused to use. He didn't care that much for Catholics,
either.
</P>
<P>
   But even bigots have a right to pin on the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, a Fallbrook teen-ager is in trouble for
refusing to say the pledge of allegiance. She said by refusing to
stand with her class in the morning ritual, she is protesting a
violent society and a corrupt government.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't heard about kids doing that in a while. Recently I
talked to some high school juniors and asked what cause would move
them to march in the street and none of them could come up with
anything. They're focused on mainly getting through high school.
</P>
<P>
   Political protest is kind of out of fashion in 1998. The
15-year-old, whose pulled back hair and wire rimmed glasses make
her look a little like pictures of the very young Hillary Clinton,
is rare in her willingness to stand alone on behalf of her
convictions. She had to know her act would be viewed as
disrespectful and draw the predictable heat, although it's
surprising how much national furor it's caused. It makes you wish
her issues about violence and corruption could whip up passions as
much as her simple protest.
</P>
<P>
   Those of the old ``Love it or leave it'' school were quick to
point out that there are countries far more violent and corrupt
than the United States, as if that somehow absolves us of our
slighter ills.
</P>
<P>
   I always wonder why those who want to banish dissenters to
another country don't just do the moving themselves. They'd fit
right in at a place that demands blind loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's flag burning. It would be hurtful, probably even
enraging, to see someone burn up an American flag. Personally I
think one of the best ways to show passionate disagreement in this
country is to share it in a letter to the editor, but some demand
more drama.
</P>
<P>
   That's one annoying thing about a democracy. You have to protect
the free speech of some pretty zealous ducks, including flag
burners, neo-Nazis and even the guys in suits who knock on the door
at dinnertime and want to save your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech is always easy to defend when you happen to agree
with it. The real test of being an American is tolerating those
things you don't personally like.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States you can ban noisy leaf blowers, but you can
do nothing to stifle the garbage sounds made on hate radio. Except
turn off the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Some people's words are really revolting, but we can only
control so much, or the precedent comes back to muffle all of us.
Celebrities seek stringent laws to keep the paparazzi away and this
seems reasonable. So do limitations on pornography. But
``reasonable'' leads to ``unreasonable.'' We already have school
boards banning Toni Morrison's words.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 15-year-old who protested the pledge say she has
offended those who went to war to fight for her right to free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what's the good of fighting for something if people don't
use it?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most patriotic things I've heard recently was when
Oprah Winfrey triumphed over the cattlemen who sought damages for
her show on mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment rocks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If people really want to get heated up on behalf of those who
protect freedom, they ought to consider how our military abandoned
Gulf War soldiers on the battlefield. Remember the flag-waving back
when they went to war?
</P>
<P>
   Flags and pledges and national anthems deserve our respect, but
they are just symbols. They don't make you a better American.
Refusing to say the pledge of allegiance doesn't make you a traitor
any more than wearing a flag pin makes you a patriot.

<P>
   When Edward Burns arrived in Ireland last summer to begin
filming ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he was feeling pretty good _ if
not downright cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? He had just wrapped his third movie as
writer, director and star, and Steven Spielberg had cast him in the
World War II epic without an audition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns had landed the part of a wisecracking soldier
without so much as taking a meeting with the most powerful man in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the set went off without a hitch. It was the
second day that knocked the wind out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it was absolutely terrifying,'' Burns
remembers. ``It was this big, long scene with me and Tom Hanks
going toe to toe. I had to sort of get in his face. We did a bunch
of takes, and it was great, and I felt really good, and then Steven
said, `I want to try one more angle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the take, and it's going great, and I forget my
line near the end of the scene, and I think, 'Oh damn,''' he
continues. ``We do it again, and I screw up the line. Now, I see
Steven's concerned because we're running out of light, and then it
hits me: Oh my god, that's Steven Spielberg, this is Tom Hanks, and
I'm screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On take three, Burns choked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks was just like, 'Eddie, calm down. You can do this,''' he
says. ``And then it was fine. I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns likes to joke that watching Spielberg at work on ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was his graduate degree in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was feeling like I knew anything about filmmaking,'' he
says, ``that sort of woke me up to how much I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he became an instant sensation at the
Sundance Film Festival _ shocking the movie industry by taking home
the Grand jury Prize for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen''
_ Burns has parlayed the hype into a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers McMullen,'' shot for a paltry $25,000, went on to
gross more than $10 million, making it, percentage-wise at least,
the most profitable movie of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 30-year-old actor has filmed ``She's the One,''
a kind of McMullen redux with one fewer brother and a $3 million
budget, and ``No Looking Back,'' about a 30-ish diner waitress
trapped in a small Northeastern shore town and torn between her
sweet-tempered boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and her no-good ex (Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Burns grew up on Long Island, the son of a New York City
cop. (He's Eddie to his friends _ Screen Actors Guild has been on
his back about press references to ``Ed Burns,'' a name already
phonetically spoken for by 1960s TV actor Edd Byrnes of ``77 Sunset
Strip.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his NBA dreams didn't pan out _ he still has the thin,
squeaky voice of a kid calling plays in a schoolyard game _ Burns
enrolled in SUNY Albany, thinking maybe he'd become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Never a movie buff, he was hooked by a film-appreciation course
he took for an easy A. Burns later transferred to Hunter College in
New York City, unable to afford the more prestigious film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a tale that has become modern-day movie lore, he spent
four years doing grunt work on ``Entertainment Tonight'' while
writing screenplays in his down time and piling up rejection
letters from agents and producers.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to quitting when his dad offered the seed money to
make ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which he shot over the course of
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack (Mulcahy, who played the oldest brother) was the only guy
who had been in front of a camera before,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were more rejection letters, this time from film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, he thrust a tape into the hands of Robert Redford _
the godfather of indie films _ after an ``ET'' interview. It was
the only time, Burns says, that he hit up a celebrity at work. Even
that approach failed.
</P>
<P>
   But by coincidence, Redford's Sundance accepted Burns'
submission. Only later _ after Burns won the top prize, Fox
Searchlight bought the picture and Redford called to congratulate
the young filmmaker _ did Burns remind the venerable actor/director
of their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Redford has since become his mentor, serving as executive
producer on his last two movies.
</P>
<P>
   For ``No Looking Back,'' Burns had a budget of $5 million _ more
than he was used to, but still far less than what your average
mega-star commands for one picture.
</P>
<P>
   He says he spent the extra cash on ``five more days of shooting,
my first crane shot and a rain machine for an afternoon. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I made less than half of what I made on `She's the One,'''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns says that was an easy price to pay for the opportunity
to make the ``tough little drama'' he wanted. Besides, he says,
``When you make a film for five, they leave you alone. Working with
a lower budget just gives you more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as shooting was to begin on his next film, ``No Looking
Back,'' Burns split from his girlfriend of eight years, Maxine
Bahns. Their relationship had become part of the Burns mythology:
They met working in a restaurant in the Hamptons, lived in his car
that summer and had been inseparable ever since. He had even cast
her, with no acting training, in his first two movies.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit for their breakup, he says, was not success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Max and I were together such a long time, and it
was a case of, was either of us ready to get married?'' he says.
``I certainly wasn't ready to say OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Bahns left the picture, Holly entered it. But
Burns denies having an on-the-set romance with his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he smirks, ``Jon and I were having the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains cagey about his relationship with Holly, calling the
two of them ``really good friends, underline really.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing ``No Looking Back,'' Burns has been working on
the script of ``The Long Blue Line,'' the story of an
Irish-American cop family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about my heritage,'' he says, admitting he's on
a quest to become the Irish-American Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Woody Allen and Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Again he intends to direct and star in the movie. At heart he
considers himself a writer, but he has always been afraid ``to
surrender (a script) to someone and let them potentially massacre
my vision,'' he says. ``I wanted control of it. So directing was
just an extension of my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He began acting for the same reason _ to maintain control of his
own work. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in fact, was ``the first time I
ever uttered a line of dialog that I didn't write.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never taken an acting class and doesn't have a coach. But
with his strong features and easy manner, he seems a natural for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach is from the gut,'' he says, ``and I guess it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns says he would gladly act again in someone else's movie,
particularly if it pays well _ eliminating the need to earn money
from his own films.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has already made more money than he expected to earn
in a lifetime, Burns insists his daily fife hasn't changed much. He
still rents an apartment _ he swears it isn't much bigger than his
last one _ and he hangs out at the same neighborhood bar and plays
basketball with the same guys.
</P>
<P>
   But he does eat out more often.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the clout he has gained, allowing him to hobnob
with his heroes, from Spielberg, Redford and Hanks to Tom Petty and
Bruce Springsteen, and to form Irish Twins Productions with his
younger brother, Brian. They co-created a sitcom, ``These Are the
Days,'' for ABC and are now developing a one-hour drama for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware that he is only three short years removed from his
peonship at ``Entertainment Tonight,'' Burns is savoring every
minute of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work _ I make movies,'' he says. ``Ten years from now
I might be working in a diner.'' &QL;

<P>
   When Edward Burns arrived in Ireland last summer to begin
filming ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he was feeling pretty good _ if
not downright cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? He had just wrapped his third movie as
writer, director and star, and Steven Spielberg had cast him in the
World War II epic without an audition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns had landed the part of a wisecracking soldier
without so much as taking a meeting with the most powerful man in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the set went off without a hitch. It was the
second day that knocked the wind out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it was absolutely terrifying,'' Burns
remembers. ``It was this big, long scene with me and Tom Hanks
going toe to toe. I had to sort of get in his face. We did a bunch
of takes, and it was great, and I felt really good, and then Steven
said, `I want to try one more angle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the take, and it's going great, and I forget my
line near the end of the scene, and I think, 'Oh damn,''' he
continues. ``We do it again, and I screw up the line. Now, I see
Steven's concerned because we're running out of light, and then it
hits me: Oh my god, that's Steven Spielberg, this is Tom Hanks, and
I'm screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On take three, Burns choked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks was just like, 'Eddie, calm down. You can do this,''' he
says. ``And then it was fine. I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns likes to joke that watching Spielberg at work on ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was his graduate degree in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was feeling like I knew anything about filmmaking,'' he
says, ``that sort of woke me up to how much I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he became an instant sensation at the
Sundance Film Festival _ shocking the movie industry by taking home
the Grand jury Prize for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen''
_ Burns has parlayed the hype into a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers McMullen,'' shot for a paltry $25,000, went on to
gross more than $10 million, making it, percentage-wise at least,
the most profitable movie of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 30-year-old actor has filmed ``She's the One,''
a kind of McMullen redux with one fewer brother and a $3 million
budget, and ``No Looking Back,'' about a 30-ish diner waitress
trapped in a small Northeastern shore town and torn between her
sweet-tempered boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and her no-good ex (Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Burns grew up on Long Island, the son of a New York City
cop. (He's Eddie to his friends _ Screen Actors Guild has been on
his back about press references to ``Ed Burns,'' a name already
phonetically spoken for by 1960s TV actor Edd Byrnes of ``77 Sunset
Strip.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his NBA dreams didn't pan out _ he still has the thin,
squeaky voice of a kid calling plays in a schoolyard game _ Burns
enrolled in SUNY Albany, thinking maybe he'd become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Never a movie buff, he was hooked by a film-appreciation course
he took for an easy A. Burns later transferred to Hunter College in
New York City, unable to afford the more prestigious film schools.

 By JAMES BROOKE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Coloradans sometimes feel they need a visa to visit Aspen. But,
behind the intimidating buzz of celebrities and high prices, Aspen
is a magical town where the beauty of the Elk Mountains combines
with an ever more stimulating cultural life.
 &HT;    Long known for winter sports, Aspen now reports its highest
hotel occupancies in August. Highlighting its increasingly cerebral
image, a survey by the Aspen Chamber Resort Association of last
summer's visitors found that half came for cultural events and only
one-fifth for outdoor recreation.
 &HT;    The survey also found that the average household income of
visitors was $131,000. But with almost two hotel beds (9,200) for
each of its 5,600 residents, it is possible to manage a stay on a
moderate budget.
 &HT;    A key to enjoying Aspen, an eminently walkable town, is to leave
your car behind. Parking is rare and expensive. Visitors who arrive
by air can take a van to town _ free from Aspen's airport, or $81
from Denver's airport, four hours away. Visitors arriving by car
can park free at the Aspen airport and take the 15-minute bus ride
into town.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The largest cultural draw of the summer is the Aspen Music
Festival, a miniature Tanglewood that draws as many as 1,700 people
to concerts under a blue-and-white tent set up across from Harris
Concert Hall, with seating inside and, free, on the lawn.
 &HT;    The festival began June 18 with the Starling Chamber Orchestra
performing Britten and Puccini, and will finish Aug. 16 with a
Prokofiev performance by the Aspen Festival Orchestra conducted by
James DePriest. Tickets are $8 to $50. Information: (970) 925-3254.
Tickets: (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    Saturday afternoons until Aug. 15 there is a free festival
concert atop Aspen Mountain. Gondola tickets, $18, are required.
 &HT;    In July and early August, the students of the festival's school
also perform at the Wheeler Opera House, a beautifully restored
1889 building. This season's offerings include Mark-Anthony
Turnage's ``Greek'' (July 23 and 25) and Carlisle Floyd's
``Susannah'' (Aug. 4, 5, 7 and 8). Tickets, $17 (for ``Greek''),
$24 and $48; (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    The opera house has also inherited events from Dance Aspen,
which went bankrupt last winter. A series of engagements July 22
through Aug. 15 features the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Les Ballets
Jazz de Montreal, the Parsons Dance Company and Ballet West.
Tickets are $15 to $48 from (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    Aspen Theater in the Park will offer a full summer season in its
white tent in Rio Grande Park. The season, June 28 to Aug. 29,
rotates ``Forever Plaid'' by Stuart Ross, Neil Simon's ``Jake's
Women,'' ``The Nerd'' by Larry Shue and a children's show, ``The
Magician's Nephew.'' Tickets, $25 and $30 ($7 for ``Magician'') are
sold through the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    This week, Snowmass, Aspen's modern sister city, holds Janus
Jazz Aspen at Snowmass, a distinguished small festival, in its town
park, with tent and lawn seating for 5,500. Appearing Thursday to
Sunday is a lineup including Wynton Marsalis, the Headhunters with
Herbie Hancock, B.B. King, and Earth, Wind and Fire. Tickets: $20
to $100 from the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    The Aspen Institute, the nonprofit educational organization,
offers free lectures at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays in July and August at
Paepcke Auditorium on its campus. Speakers include the playwright
Wendy Wasserstein, July 28, and Murray Gell-Man, Nobel Prize winner
in physics, Aug. 18; (970) 925-7010.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In Aspen, the mountains are accessible to all _ on an easygoing
gondola ride to the 11,212-foot-high summit of Aspen Mountain, a
moderately challenging bicycle ride down a secluded path, or a
crashing raft ride down the Roaring Fork River.
 &HT;    On busy summer weekends, the Silver Queen Gondola carries 2,000
people a day to the summit. It runs daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. At the
top, there are free, 45-minute guided nature walks daily, on the
hour from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., until Sept. 7.
 &HT;    The Sundeck restaurant is open for lunch every day, and for
dinner on Monday (Mexican) and Wednesday (barbecue), when the
gondola runs till 7:30. Gondola prices range from free for children
6 and under to $18 for adults on weekends. Dinner and gondola
combination is $8 to $25. For information, call (800) 525-6200.
 &HT;    Bicycle paths abound in Aspen. My family and I rented bikes at
Aspen Velo, one of at least nine bicycle renters in town. We rode
down a riverfront path to Woody Creek Tavern, about six and a half
miles one way. A four-hour rental is $22, helmet included; (888)
925-1495.
 &HT;    Hiking is another popular activity. A favorite route is the
two-mile Maroon Lake Scenic Trail, which is accessible by bus from
the Rubey Park transportation center in town. Information: Aspen
Chamber of Commerce, (970) 925-1940.
 &HT;    Rafting on the area's rivers is a fast-growing recreation sport.
Among the rafting companies in the area are Inland Drifters, (970)
963-7438, which charges $45 a person a half day or $75 for a full
day, and runs class 1 through class 4 rapids (6 is the most
difficult), and Blazing Adventures, (800) 282-7238, which charges
$65 to $78 for class 1 through 5.
 &HT;    Children enjoy exploring Ashcroft, a semirestored ghost town on
Castle Creek Road, 30 minutes from downtown. The Aspen Historical
Society gives free tours at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. every day but
Monday.
 &HT;    On rainy days, tours of Aspen's two silver mines, Smuggler and
Compromise, offer instructive insights into the city's origins (but
children must be 5 or older).
 &HT;    At Smuggler, visitors walk a quarter-mile into a mountain that,
in 1894, provided the world's largest silver nugget: 1,840 pounds.
Admission is $20, $15 ages 5 to 12. The Compromise tour, offered
only on Saturday after July 11, involves a Jeep ride to the mine,
then a rail ride into Aspen mountain. Fee: $30 and $20.
Reservations required: (970) 925-2049.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Among Aspen's several luxury hotels, two Victorian red-brick
standouts are on Main Street, the Jerome at 330 East Main, and the
Sardy House at 128 East Main.
 &HT;    Built in 1889, at the height of the silver boom, the Jerome
boasted the first elevator west of the Mississippi. Painstakingly
restored a decade ago, this central Aspen landmark is one of 16
city buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
 &HT;    With a fire in the parlor fireplace, elk heads on walls and
cherry wood throughout, a visitor feels like a silver baron. For a
night in one of its 93 hotel rooms, the Jerome's nightly charges
vary in the summer from $295 to as much as $1,190, for a suite;
(800) 331-7213, fax (970) 925-2784.
 &HT;    Two blocks down Main Street, half-hidden by towering pines,
stands another Victorian gem, Sardy House. This quiet hotel of 20
well-appointed rooms has a small heated swimming pool in the
garden. Summer room rates, including breakfast, vary from $180 to
$440; (970) 920-2525.
 &HT;    For a resortlike setting in town, the Aspen Institute has 98
guest rooms and suites on its 40-acre riverfront campus on the west
end of town. Guests can use the institute's six tennis courts,
gymnasium and outdoor lap pool, and have golf privileges at the
Snowmass Lodge and Club. Summer room rates are $195 to $395; (970)
925-4240.
 &HT;    Budget: The Limelite Lodge at 228 East Cooper Ave., was the
cradle of the 1950's folk group The Limeliters when it was a
nightclub. Now, it is a family-oriented hotel, with 72 rooms, some
with kitchens, starting at $98 in summer; (970) 925-3025.
 &HT;    The Boomerang Lodge at 500 West Hopkins Avenue has 34 sun-filled
units, each with a private balcony or terrace offering a view of
Shadow Mountain. Rooms in summer start at $131, including
Continental breakfast; (970) 925-3416.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Aspen's nearly 100 restaurants have spruced up their summer
menus and honed their service in anticipation of the Food and Wine
Magazine Classic, taking place this weekend. Among them is Pinons,
105 South Mill St., where entrees include sauteed Colorado pheasant
breast and elk tenderloin. Dinner for two, with wine, is about
$120; (970) 920-2021.
 &HT;    The Little Nell, in the hotel of the same name, at 675 East
Durant Ave. is a personal favorite. In the elegant dining room or
sunny courtyard, diners enjoy mustard crusted trout or
honey-soy-seared salmon. Dinner for two with wine is around $150;
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; (970) 920-6330.
 &HT;    Outdoor dining with a view of Aspen Mountain can also be found
down the block, at Ajax Tavern, 685 East Durant. On a terrace near
the ski area's gondola as well in the dining room, diners can eat
local foods like free range chicken and Colorado lamb. Dinner for
two with wine costs about $100. Lunch and dinner served; (970)
920-9333.
 &HT;    A midpriced standout is Campo di Fiori, 205 South Mill St., an
earthy grotto with well-prepared Northern Italian dishes, a strong
Italian wine list and rapid-fire service. Try the arugula salad and
the risotto giardinera (asparagus, tomato, spinach and bell
peppers). Open for dinner daily. Dinner for two with wine costs
about $80; (970) 920-7717.
 &HT;    On the second floor of a bookstore at 221 East Main, Explore
Bistro offers vegetarian meals _ breakfast, lunch and dinner _ on a
sundeck or inside. Dinner for two with a drink is about $40; (970)
925-5338.
 &HT;    La Cocina, 308 East Hopkins Ave., a local hangout with
Southwestern cuisine, draws everyone from ski lift operators to
Hollywood types. Margaritas, blue corn tortillas and chocolate
velvet, a mousselike cake, add up to about $35 for two; (970)
925-9714.
 &HT;    Woody Creek Tavern is a timeless joint held together with
cigarette smoke, country music and old wallpaper five miles out of
town, in Woody Creek. The burger of local Limousin beef goes for
$6.95 and the chicken fajitas are $8.95. No credit cards. Don't ask
for espresso; (970) 923-4585.
 NIGHT LIFE  
 &HT;    After serving surprisingly good cabaret food, the waiters and
waitresses at the Crystal Palace, 300 East Hyman Ave., transform
themselves into a hilarious satirical revue.
 &HT;    During their annual spring break, they undoubtedly wore pencils
to the nub reworking fresh material supplied from our nation's
capital. Dinner and one-hour show are offered Thursday through
Saturday for $49.50 a person. For reservations, call (970)
925-1455.

 &HT;    
 By JAMES BROOKE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Coloradans sometimes feel they need a visa to visit Aspen. But,
behind the intimidating buzz of celebrities and high prices, Aspen
is a magical town where the beauty of the Elk Mountains combines
with an ever more stimulating cultural life.
 &HT;    Long known for winter sports, Aspen now reports its highest
hotel occupancies in August. Highlighting its increasingly cerebral
image, a survey by the Aspen Chamber Resort Association of last
summer's visitors found that half came for cultural events and only
one-fifth for outdoor recreation.
 &HT;    The survey also found that the average household income of
visitors was $131,000. But with almost two hotel beds (9,200) for
each of its 5,600 residents, it is possible to manage a stay on a
moderate budget.
 &HT;    A key to enjoying Aspen, an eminently walkable town, is to leave
your car behind. Parking is rare and expensive. Visitors who arrive
by air can take a van to town _ free from Aspen's airport, or $81
from Denver's airport, four hours away. Visitors arriving by car
can park free at the Aspen airport and take the 15-minute bus ride
into town.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The largest cultural draw of the summer is the Aspen Music
Festival, a miniature Tanglewood that draws as many as 1,700 people
to concerts under a blue-and-white tent set up across from Harris
Concert Hall, with seating inside and, free, on the lawn.
 &HT;    The festival began June 18 with the Starling Chamber Orchestra
performing Britten and Puccini, and will finish Aug. 16 with a
Prokofiev performance by the Aspen Festival Orchestra conducted by
James DePriest. Tickets are $8 to $50. Information: (970) 925-3254.
Tickets: (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    Saturday afternoons until Aug. 15 there is a free festival
concert atop Aspen Mountain. Gondola tickets, $18, are required.
 &HT;    In July and early August, the students of the festival's school
also perform at the Wheeler Opera House, a beautifully restored
1889 building. This season's offerings include Mark-Anthony
Turnage's ``Greek'' (July 23 and 25) and Carlisle Floyd's
``Susannah'' (Aug. 4, 5, 7 and 8). Tickets, $17 (for ``Greek''),
$24 and $48; (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    The opera house has also inherited events from Dance Aspen,
which went bankrupt last winter. A series of engagements July 22
through Aug. 15 features the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Les Ballets
Jazz de Montreal, the Parsons Dance Company and Ballet West.
Tickets are $15 to $48 from (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    Aspen Theater in the Park will offer a full summer season in its
white tent in Rio Grande Park. The season, June 28 to Aug. 29,
rotates ``Forever Plaid'' by Stuart Ross, Neil Simon's ``Jake's
Women,'' ``The Nerd'' by Larry Shue and a children's show, ``The
Magician's Nephew.'' Tickets, $25 and $30 ($7 for ``Magician'') are
sold through the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    This week, Snowmass, Aspen's modern sister city, holds Janus
Jazz Aspen at Snowmass, a distinguished small festival, in its town
park, with tent and lawn seating for 5,500. Appearing Thursday to
Sunday is a lineup including Wynton Marsalis, the Headhunters with
Herbie Hancock, B.B. King, and Earth, Wind and Fire. Tickets: $20
to $100 from the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    The Aspen Institute, the nonprofit educational organization,
offers free lectures at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays in July and August at
Paepcke Auditorium on its campus. Speakers include the playwright
Wendy Wasserstein, July 28, and Murray Gell-Man, Nobel Prize winner
in physics, Aug. 18; (970) 925-7010.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In Aspen, the mountains are accessible to all _ on an easygoing
gondola ride to the 11,212-foot-high summit of Aspen Mountain, a
moderately challenging bicycle ride down a secluded path, or a
crashing raft ride down the Roaring Fork River.
 &HT;    On busy summer weekends, the Silver Queen Gondola carries 2,000
people a day to the summit. It runs daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. At the
top, there are free, 45-minute guided nature walks daily, on the
hour from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., until Sept. 7.
 &HT;    The Sundeck restaurant is open for lunch every day, and for
dinner on Monday (Mexican) and Wednesday (barbecue), when the
gondola runs till 7:30. Gondola prices range from free for children
6 and under to $18 for adults on weekends. Dinner and gondola
combination is $8 to $25. For information, call (800) 525-6200.
 &HT;    Bicycle paths abound in Aspen. My family and I rented bikes at
Aspen Velo, one of at least nine bicycle renters in town. We rode
down a riverfront path to Woody Creek Tavern, about six and a half
miles one way. A four-hour rental is $22, helmet included; (888)
925-1495.
 &HT;    Hiking is another popular activity. A favorite route is the
two-mile Maroon Lake Scenic Trail, which is accessible by bus from
the Rubey Park transportation center in town. Information: Aspen
Chamber of Commerce, (970) 925-1940.
 &HT;    Rafting on the area's rivers is a fast-growing recreation sport.
Among the rafting companies in the area are Inland Drifters, (970)
963-7438, which charges $45 a person a half day or $75 for a full
day, and runs class 1 through class 4 rapids (6 is the most
difficult), and Blazing Adventures, (800) 282-7238, which charges
$65 to $78 for class 1 through 5.
 &HT;    Children enjoy exploring Ashcroft, a semirestored ghost town on
Castle Creek Road, 30 minutes from downtown. The Aspen Historical
Society gives free tours at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. every day but
Monday.
 &HT;    On rainy days, tours of Aspen's two silver mines, Smuggler and
Compromise, offer instructive insights into the city's origins (but
children must be 5 or older).
 &HT;    At Smuggler, visitors walk a quarter-mile into a mountain that,

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From the days of Al Capone through the glittery era of Frank
Sinatra, Bob Hope and Dinah Shore, we mature travelers have been
bedazzled by stories of Palm Springs, Calif. But who can afford
that kind of playground except movie stars?
 &HT;    Today, little has changed in classy Palm Springs and its
neighboring communities in the Coachella Valley, which is about 120
miles east of Hollywood in the desert _ little, that is, except the
cost of having a good time.
 &HT;    Play golf for $20 a round on uncrowded courses? Stay at a resort
for $49 a night? Eat at outstanding restaurants and get pampered in
the spas? Find discounts at almost every attraction without waiting
in line?
 &HT;    Yes, it's true.
 &HT;    Indeed, mature travelers who shop around, do their homework and
pick the proper season can experience the joys of Palm Springs for
about $100 a day per person. That season is summer. The downside:
the heat.
 &HT;    No longer does Palm Springs shut down between June and
September, as it used to when resident celebrities fled to cooler
climes. One marketing executive at a local resort explained it this
way: It is less expensive for restaurants, hotels and other travel
vendors to stay open during the summer than to have to lay off
staff as the heat approaches and hire new, green help in the fall.
 &HT;    The result: During the summer, there are restaurants with more
waiters than customers, rooms with good rates and golf tee-times
almost anytime you want.
 &HT;    Many of Palm Springs' bargains, in fact, stay in place through
mid-December.
 BEATING THE HEAT  
 &HT;    We visited Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley for a few days
late last June, when daytime temperatures were already over 100. We
played lots of golf, swam almost every afternoon, enjoyed some fine
naps under misters in the shade, took evening walks and did our
sightseeing _ mostly to air-conditioned places _ in the early
afternoon.
 &HT;    Our formula for enjoying the Palm Springs heat is to plan ahead
and move slowly.
 &HT;    Our early morning tee times meant we were able to enjoy the
benefit of a comforting breeze and, as a bonus, we learned that the
desert is prettiest at the beginning of the day.
 &HT;    If it got too hot for us to finish 18 holes _ at only $15 to $30
a round _ we simply quit the course and cooled down in the
clubhouse.
 &HT;    We started at 7:30 one morning at Del Webb's Sun City Palm
Desert (760-772-2200 for tee times). A few golfers were on the
course ahead of us, but there was never a wait to play. At that
course, visitors pay $80 a round in winter but only about $30 in
summer.
 &HT;    The next day, with a 6:30 a.m. tee-off, we played the
championship course at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas resort
(760-862-4551). It costs $109 a round in winter, $48 in summer. We
finished 18 holes before noon, beating the heat again.
 &HT;    Several great courses have summer ``twilight'' rates: $20 for 18
holes after 10:30 a.m. at Rancho Las Palmas before the heat or
darkness get to you.
 &HT;    Darkness doesn't blanket Palm Springs until about 7 p.m., which
means golf fanatics can play late into the evening. However, our
original plan to play nine holes in the early morning and another
nine just before dark didn't work. Frankly, it's too hot in the
early evening _ coolness comes to the desert at night.
 &HT;    On getaway day we started to play at about 8 a.m. at Tommy
Jacobs' Bel Air Greens (760-322-6062), an easy nine-hole course
that is almost entirely shaded.
 &HT;    Last June, it cost $15 a round. If we had waited a month,
between July and September, Bel Air would have charged $14 a round
_ and handed out two-for-one passes.
 LODGING DEALS  
 &HT;    This year, summer specials at Palm Spring's hotels may not be as
spectacular as last year due to increased occupancies. (Seems more
people are realizing the benefits of vacationing in the desert!)
But mature travelers can still find spectacle savings if they shop
wisely.
 &HT;    Last June, our $69 room at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas in
Rancho Mirage (800-909-6019) _ one of the leading resorts _ cost
$179 or more last winter.
 &HT;    One of the best lodging deals we found was a $49-a-night
weeknight summer special at the Palm Springs Spa Hotel &AMP; Casino,
operated by the Cahuilla tribe and located right in downtown Palm
Springs. That price included a room for two, a spa session, dinner
two-fers and $10 in casino chips. January through mid-June, those
rooms cost up to $159 without the extras.
 &HT;    Public transit around the valley is practically useless to
tourists, and most summer visitors rent autos or bring their own.
 &HT;    We spent early afternoons touring in cool places: the
air-conditioned Palm Springs Desert Museum; the well-shaded,
outdoor Living Desert Wildlife Park; and the new Palm Springs Air
Museum. All give senior discounts of up to 50 percent.
 TAKE A TOUR  
 &HT;    Celebrity Tours' (760-770-2700) 2 1/2-hour trips show you where
the stars live and include a pickup in an air-conditioned
motorcoach at your hotel. Mature travelers get $2 off the regular
$17 tour price.
 &HT;    The easiest way to beat the heat is to ride the Palm Springs
Aerial Tramway (760-325-1449) to the top of the 12,000-foot Mount
San Jacinto. Bring a jacket _ it's 30 degrees cooler high above the
desert floor. Mature travelers get $3 off $17 tram tickets.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs Desert Resorts Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau
operates centers in Rancho Mirage and at the Palm Springs Regional
Airport. For more information, call (800) 417-3529, or write 69-930

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From the days of Al Capone through the glittery era of Frank
Sinatra, Bob Hope and Dinah Shore, we mature travelers have been
bedazzled by stories of Palm Springs, Calif. But who can afford
that kind of playground except movie stars?
 &HT;    Today, little has changed in classy Palm Springs and its
neighboring communities in the Coachella Valley, which is about 120
miles east of Hollywood in the desert _ little, that is, except the
cost of having a good time.
 &HT;    Play golf for $20 a round on uncrowded courses? Stay at a resort
for $49 a night? Eat at outstanding restaurants and get pampered in
the spas? Find discounts at almost every attraction without waiting
in line?
 &HT;    Yes, it's true.
 &HT;    Indeed, mature travelers who shop around, do their homework and
pick the proper season can experience the joys of Palm Springs for
about $100 a day per person. That season is summer. The downside:
the heat.
 &HT;    No longer does Palm Springs shut down between June and
September, as it used to when resident celebrities fled to cooler
climes. One marketing executive at a local resort explained it this
way: It is less expensive for restaurants, hotels and other travel
vendors to stay open during the summer than to have to lay off
staff as the heat approaches and hire new, green help in the fall.
 &HT;    The result: During the summer, there are restaurants with more
waiters than customers, rooms with good rates and golf tee-times
almost anytime you want.
 &HT;    Many of Palm Springs' bargains, in fact, stay in place through
mid-December.
 BEATING THE HEAT  
 &HT;    We visited Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley for a few days
late last June, when daytime temperatures were already over 100. We
played lots of golf, swam almost every afternoon, enjoyed some fine
naps under misters in the shade, took evening walks and did our
sightseeing _ mostly to air-conditioned places _ in the early
afternoon.
 &HT;    Our formula for enjoying the Palm Springs heat is to plan ahead
and move slowly.
 &HT;    Our early morning tee times meant we were able to enjoy the
benefit of a comforting breeze and, as a bonus, we learned that the
desert is prettiest at the beginning of the day.
 &HT;    If it got too hot for us to finish 18 holes _ at only $15 to $30
a round _ we simply quit the course and cooled down in the
clubhouse.
 &HT;    We started at 7:30 one morning at Del Webb's Sun City Palm
Desert (760-772-2200 for tee times). A few golfers were on the
course ahead of us, but there was never a wait to play. At that
course, visitors pay $80 a round in winter but only about $30 in
summer.
 &HT;    The next day, with a 6:30 a.m. tee-off, we played the
championship course at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas resort
(760-862-4551). It costs $109 a round in winter, $48 in summer. We
finished 18 holes before noon, beating the heat again.
 &HT;    Several great courses have summer ``twilight'' rates: $20 for 18
holes after 10:30 a.m. at Rancho Las Palmas before the heat or
darkness get to you.
 &HT;    Darkness doesn't blanket Palm Springs until about 7 p.m., which
means golf fanatics can play late into the evening. However, our
original plan to play nine holes in the early morning and another
nine just before dark didn't work. Frankly, it's too hot in the
early evening _ coolness comes to the desert at night.
 &HT;    On getaway day we started to play at about 8 a.m. at Tommy

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For passionate skiers, the season doesn't end when the mountain
bikes come out in Colorado and Utah. Summer is the time to get on a
plane and head south to Chile and Argentina.
 &HT;    North America may be enjoying hot weather, but south of the
border you'll find snow falling in the rugged Andes.
 &HT;    ``Last year was a great year for snow down there,'' explains
Gary Nicoll, manager of Ski Vacation Planners. ``We're hoping for
the same this year.''
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise challenging runs,
glorious mountain scenery and a laid-back Latin lifestyle. The
resorts usually open in mid-June and close around the first week of
October.
 &HT;    There are daily direct flights from Miami to Santiago and Buenos
Aires. Remember that this is a good time to use frequent-flier
miles for both tickets and upgrades.
 &HT;    The flights may be long _ about eight hours from Miami to
Santiago _ but the good news is that jetlag, the bane of many
European ski vacations, is minimal for North Americans heading
south.
 &HT;    In Chile, the major resorts to consider are Portillo, Valle
Nevado, Termas de Chillan.
 &HT;    Portillo, about 92 miles from Santiago, has spectacular
surroundings, including the 23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the
highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    There is plenty of beginner and intermediate terrain here, as
well as enough expert terrain, including chutes, to keep advanced
skiers busy for a week.
 &HT;    Just 37 miles from Santiago is Valle Nevado, a vast resort with
over 40 miles of groomed runs, with all skiing above the treeline.
 &HT;    Skiers can also access two adjacent areas, La Parva and El
Colorado.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village not unlike that at the Canadian
resort of Whistler. The skiing is varied, with plenty of
intermediate and expert terrain.
 &HT;    Termas de Chillan, located about 300 miles south of Santiago,
has emerged as one of the most popular ski resorts in the country.
 &HT;    A hot springs resort that dates back to the 17th century, it has
a vast amounts of terrain, including one run that it is 6.8 miles
long.
 &HT;    In July of 1997, the Gran Hotel Termas de Chillan opened, the
first five-star deluxe hotel at the resort.
 &HT;    Las Lenas, San Carlos de Bariloche and Chapelco are the primary
areas in Argentina.
 &HT;    Las Lenas has some of the most challenging terrain on Earth,
with over 40 miles of trails. It is the choice for expert skiers
and for powder-hounds looking for some of that fabled Andes snow.
 &HT;    San Carlos de Bariloche is the only town in South America with a
traditional ski culture. Picturesquely located on the shores of
Lake Nahuel Huapi, it long ago earned the moniker ``Little
Switzerland.''
 &HT;    The ski mountain, Cerro Catedral, is about 12 miles from town.
There is so much terrain here that both intermediates and advanced
skiers have plenty of opportunity to explore.
 &HT;    Chapelco is located 12 miles outside of the lakeside resort town
of San Martin de Los Andes. It offers tree-skiing and steep chutes
for experts only. The resort is accessed via an air connection from
Bariloche.
 &HT;    High season in Chile and Argentina, which runs from mid-July to
mid-August, is based on South American school holidays and should
be avoided. Both prices and crowds can be nearly double what they
are in low-season.
 &HT;    Mid-August is generally regarded as the best time for North
Americans to go while ``spring'' skiing arrives in early September,
with a season's worth of snowfall and lodging discounts everywhere.
 &HT;    Anyone shopping around for a South American ski vacation should
look to a specialist, such as Ski Vacation Planners (545 Cedar
Lane, Teaneck, N.J. 07666; 800-822-6754) or Adventures on Skis (815
North Road, Westfield, Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655).
 &HT;    Both companies have established reputations in planning such
trips and can easily arrange add-ons in Santiago or Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of packages. Prices are per person and are
based on double occupancy in mid- to late-August.
 &HT;    Adventures on Skis offers a package to Las Lenas that includes
round-trip airfare between Miami, Buenos Aires and Malargue,
round-trip airport transfers, seven nights' lodging at the Hotel
Escorpio, daily lift tickets, as well as daily breakfast and dinner
for $2,575.
 &HT;    In Chile, they have Termas de Chillan in late August that
includes round-trip airfare from Miami to Santiago and round-trip
airfare from Santiago to Concepcion. Skiers also receive transfers,
seven nights' accommodation at the Grand Hotel Termas de Chillan, a
weekly lift ticket, breakfast and dinner daily. The price starts at
$2,170.
 &HT;    Ski Vacation Planners has a deal to Portillo that starts at
$1,315 for seven nights' accommodation at the Hotel Portillo, four
meals daily, eight full-day lift tickets for $1,315, land only.
Round-trip airfare from Miami to Santiago is $954. Transfers are
extra.
 &HT;    In Argentina, they can offer Bariloche for $1,497, land-only, at
the Club Hotel Catedral, at the base of the mountain. The price
includes seven nights' accommodation, daily breakfast and dinner.
Lift tickets and transfers are extra. Airfare from Miami to Buenos
Aires to Bariloche is $1,321.

 &HT;    Between flames, Citrus plant auction a success
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When a federal judge orders a bankruptcy
sale, it takes more than last week's brush fires to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart auctioneer Karlin Daniel, 47, belted out his rap _
``Sixty-five hundred there! Do I hear 7,000?'' _ for four hours
recently at a Brevard County citrus packing plant, despite heat,
smoke and ash from brush fires burning out of control several miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   A federal bankruptcy judge in Orlando had ordered the sale of
the items owned by the Mims Citrus Growers Association, Daniel
said. The growers' cooperative filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on
Feb. 6 and closed in late March after the federal court declared
its finances unsalvageable.
</P>
<P>
   The auction had even greater attendance than Daniel usually gets
for such auctions because Brevard County sheriff's deputies were
coincidentally directing traffic toward the auction from a detour
due to the fire. Just east of the packing plant, the deputies had
blocked U.S. 1 at State Road 46 to give firefighters further north
room to battle the brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 people who attended the auction were not in an affected
area and were not in any danger, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, however, deputies evacuated about 200 bidders
inspecting auction items at the packing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op's assets _ including a 14-acre citrus grove close to
but spared by the fires, an 11,500-square-foot packing plant and 58
citrus trailers _ raked in nearly $1 million for creditors, Daniel
said. Successful bidders picked up their prizes in Mims on Friday
and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' Daniel said. ``In retrospect.''

 &HT;    Animals routed by fire still scared, confused
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ These animals don't have to talk. Their terror
and confusion are all too plain, in the eyes peering out of small
cages, the burned and bandaged feet of a puppy, the way horses
quietly place their heads against owners' chests, as if asking to
be held.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't over for the pets, livestock and wild animals routed by
fire. Some are still out in the smoking woods, cut off from their
homes, hiding in culverts, drainage ditches, under cars or in
garbage cans, disoriented and traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos still had the upper hand at times around the animal
control shelter at the Flagler County fairgrounds, as groups and
volunteers tried to reconnect scores of animals and owners
separated by fire and evacuation. Besides the dogs, cats, birds and
rabbits on hand, loads of horses, pigs, goats and other animals had
been farmed out to shelters in Jacksonville, Gainesville and
Palatka and were due back by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the problem changed from finding shelter space to
caring for abandoned, lost and injured animals.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers told horrifying stories of how people
fleeing the fires left dogs chained to trees and fences, in yard
kennels or in houses with no food and water. And the miracles of
their survival.
</P>
<P>
   At one address in Palm Coast, officer Rick Kinard found the
house and two vehicles burned to the ground. In a sandy spot in the
back yard, a terrified Rottweiler and bulldog were huddled
together; in a cage attached to the only part of the wooden fence
that didn't burn was a little Pekingese.
</P>
<P>
   At another house in Palm Coast, officers found an elderly, weak
and bedraggled miniature poodle and a young Dalmatian, both without
food or water. By day's end, Kinard had found the owner and filed
cruelty charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   There were worse accounts, such as the sheriff's deputy who used
his nightstick to try to bash open the chains holding three dogs,
was attacked and had to leave them as the flames moved in. But the
most gripping story was one of danger, heroism and mother's love.
</P>
<P>
   A matronly female hound and her 3-month-old pup had run from
who-knows-where through smoldering ground that burned the pup's
tender paws. She stopped, dug a deep hole in the dirt for the puppy
to lie in and stood guard over him.
</P>
<P>
   She stood her ground against the well-meaning people who first
tried to help them. But Kinard and his wife, Darlene, also an
animal control officer, gradually won her trust. Tired, hurt and
trusting, she lay down and let them carry her and the pup to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The pup, with his singed feet covered by bright orange
``socks,'' has become a media star and shelter celebrity. Volunteer
Paul Borruso is pretty sure an owner will show up to claim the two,
but if it doesn't happen by Friday, he's volunteered to be a
``foster'' owner. Borruso and his wife, Connie, recently moved to
nearby Ormond Beach from Boca Raton, where he was with IBM.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles south on U.S.1 at Eagle Rock Ranch, Pam Cochran
waited for all her boarding horses to come home from various places
and recalled the night of panicked evacuation. She and her husband
and two daughters had gotten eight horses to the shelter, including
two thoroughbreds picked up along the highway, only to find they
were gone and nobody could tell her where they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called The Mad Lady,'' by the shelter staff, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The horses had been sent to Palatka to stay at the fairgrounds
there, then to Jacksonville. The confusion left Cochran and other
owners realizing they need a disaster plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle fared reasonably well in Flagler County, where most are
kept in vast, cleared pastures that served as firebreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They's a lot of fences burned,'' said cattleman Leslie Tucker,
``but everything else is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers' herds may be mixed up, but that's all right, Tucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around here pretty much knows their own cows.''

 &HT;    BOOKREVIEW: Folklore from the largest State
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Texana books collectors must love the University
of North Texas Press and the people who operate it. They're always
coming out with books that remind us of our diverse and rich
heritage in this big state.
</P>
<P>
   For example: ``Boardin' in the Big Thicket'' by Wanda A Landrey.
Some call this a history book with recipes and some call it a
recipe book with a lot
</P>
<P>
   of history in it. Either way you label it, this is a book worth
having, and the UNT Press has recently released a paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Leon Hale, the Houston Chronicle columnist and
I-don't-know-what-all, wrote about it when it came out the first
time in hardback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanda Landrey causes me to remember a special day, long ago,
when I ate sweet potato pie at the Bragg Hotel in the Big Thicket.
This book makes me
</P>
<P>
   hungry, not just for the boarding house dishes Wanda describes,
but also for a time in Texas culture that is gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer in the Bloomsbury Review had this to say, among other
things: ``Pioneers in southeast Texas found a little Eden in the
Big Thicket...The
</P>
<P>
   woods were filled with delicacies like nuts and wild fruit...The
commerce that crisscrossed the region created a network of boarding
houses, with a
</P>
<P>
   unique cooking style that took advantage of the bounty of the
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with the acquisition of a batch of Encino Press
books, all Texas Folklore Society publications still in print are
now available from
</P>
<P>
   UNT Press. A few of those include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Puss &AMP; Others, Old Days in the Piney Woods'' by Emma
Wilson Emery. Published in 1969. Emma Wilson Emery spent her
childhood in the Big Thicket
</P>
<P>
   piney woods with many interesting relatives. She later lived in
Nacogdoches and worked as typesetter for the Daily Plaindealer. She
graduated from
</P>
<P>
   nursing school in 1911 at Shreveport and became poet laureate of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Going On?'' (In Modern Texas Folklore), edited by F.E.
Abernethy. Publication of the Texas Folklore Society XL, published
in 1976. This
</P>
<P>
   collection of essays from the 1970s describes the customs,
traditions, songs, and stories by which future anthropologists will
analyze the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The rodeos and chain letters and bumper stickers, Neiman Marcus
and fat stock shows, gospel conventions and underground newspapers,
CB radios and
</P>
<P>
   university ghosts, backwoods beer busts and the folklore of
marijuana, Jack Ruby and the Kennedy assassination. This book also
looks at zydeco, Western
</P>
<P>
   Swing, gospel music, Texas country music, and the rise of
redneck rock. ``Texas Folk Medicine'' by John Q. Anderson.
Published in 1970. The list of
</P>
<P>
   ``cures'' from acne to whooping cough will bring to mind your
grandparents' methods for removing warts, stopping hiccups, or
relieving the aches of
</P>
<P>
   rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these folk medical practices are older than scientific
medicine. Some reflect a belief in magic. Seldom written down, this
oral lore has been
</P>
<P>
   passed down from generation to generation from the time of the
first settlements in this country. Science has shown that many have
no therapeutic
</P>
<P>
   value, but some do and the power of suggestion was enough for
others. John Q. Anderson taught folklore at Texas A&AMP;M and the
University of
</P>
<P>
   Houston. He is a past president of the Texas Folklore Society.
</P>
<P>
   If your friendly local bookstore isn't stocked with one of the
above and you'd like to have it, you may order any of them from:
University of North
</P>
<P>
   Texas Press, P.O. Box 311336, Denton, Texas 76203-1336.

 &HT;    Ready Food Review
 &HT;    By Jim and Barbara Maggard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Precooked Montgomery Inn Ribs, $10.99 for 1-pound slab. Sauce
included. Cooking instructions: Grill or broil for 4 minutes, turn
and cook an additional 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   E CONVENIENCE: The ribs are sizzling after just 7 minutes under
the broiler; it's certainly a quick meal.
</P>
<P>
   E QUALITY: Yep, the meat is literally falling off the bone of
these baby back ribs. However, the meat has the pronounced
``leftover'' taste associated with oven-reheated meat. The
sweet-as-ketchup sauce helps disguise it.
</P>
<P>
   E VALUE: Just a couple more dollars buys side dishes and service
at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   E OVERALL RATING ON A 10-POINT SCALE: 5
</P>
<P>
   E WOULD YOU BUY AGAIN: No. I like ribs with some chew and sauce
with some heat.
</P>
<P>
   E COMMENTS: Fans of Montgomery Inn ribs, and there are many,
might want to fix these at home rather than drive to Cincinnati.
But they don't have to do that either; Montgomery Inn ribs are
available for carry-out at the Englewood Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Heller Food Editor
</P>
<P>
   E CONVENIENCE: Thunderstorms made our decision to broil the ribs
instead of grilling them. Cooking time listed was right on the
money.
</P>
<P>
   E QUALITY: While the sauce easily earns a 10 rating and was a
sufficient amount, the tasters commented on the musty ``aged-meat
taste'' and questioned the lack of a sell-by date on the package.
</P>
<P>
   E VALUE: A bit pricey at $10.99 for the actual amount of edible
meat in the package.
</P>
<P>
   E OVERALL RATING ON A 10-POINT SCALE: 7.
</P>
<P>
   E WOULD YOU BUY AGAIN: Not the ribs, but we have bought and used
the sauce before.
</P>
<P>
   E COMMENTS: Not a sensible buy for a family, but a lone diner
might choose this entree on a rainy Saturday night over a trip to a
restaurant or another ``carryout'' meal.

 &HT;    Federal funds frozen at school for mentally ill
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ First, a mentally retarded woman drowned at Abilene
State School. Next, retarded residents at Richmond State School got
sick after drinking bottles of pear-scented body spray and
mouthwash. Then, Austin State School failed to report sexual
activity among residents to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, all three institutions have had their
federal money frozen because of serious health and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   The three sanctions may signal growing trouble with Texas'
ability to keep free from harm the 5,300 mentally retarded people
living in state institutions. Safety inspectors routinely cite the
institutions for insufficient staffing and poorly trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, federal money has been frozen nine times at
various retardation institutions because the residents' health and
safety were jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   With money from the Medicaid program being halted every three
weeks on average, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental
Retardation soon could surpass the record number of 11 freezes
placed on Medicaid money in 1997 at retardation institutions.
Between 1993 and 1996, Medicaid money was halted a total of 10
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid money, which at large institutions can amount to
$69,000 a day, provides as much as 85 percent of the budget at each
of the 11 state retardation institutions. The money will be
restored when state Department of Human Services inspectors decide
the problems have been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Brunette, director of state mental retardation facilities,
said he's concerned about the incidents but that perspective is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at our facilities, the vast majority of them, go
through every day, all day long, well-cared for, well-supervised,''
he said. ``It's these exceptional things that occur that are going
to require our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   More Medicaid sanctions have occurred over the past two years,
Brunette said, because federal Health Care Financing Administration
officials have imposed stricter Medicaid standards on retardation
institutions, much as the federal government has tried to get tough
on nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the agency is having a hard time hiring and
retaining enough qualified workers. As the Texas economy soars,
workers are turning away from caring for disabled people toward
jobs in fast-food and other businesses that pay more than the
state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An average state retardation worker, who provides direct care
such as bathing and feeding, earns about $7 an hour. Last year,
four of every 10 direct-care workers quit, compared with three of
every 10 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor contributing to the problems at state schools is
the growing concentration of residents with severe behavior and
medical problems as more moderately retarded people move to group
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The June 18 drowning of Anita Gaye Kelley, 54, at Abilene State
School occurred after the institution failed to closely supervise
the woman. She was left alone to climb into a bathtub full of
water, inspection records show.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found that a replacement worker had not been told of
Kelley's need for close supervision at bath time. Several workers
complained that too few workers are available at the institution,
forcing workers who may not know the residents to float from dorm
to dorm to cover vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   At Richmond State School, regulators found similar complaints
from employees. ``We need more staff,'' one worker told state
inspectors. ``We have tried to tell the supervisors that we can't
do our jobs without more staff, but no one listens. Then, if the
clients leave the dorm unsupervised, we get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, a retarded woman with a history of ingesting
inedible liquids was left unattended at Richmond State School. She
drank a bottle of pear-scented body spray and required
hospitalization in the institution's infirmary, inspection records
show. Just the day before, a retarded man in a different dorm drank
a bottle of mouthwash and had to be treated in a local emergency
room, records also show.
</P>
<P>
   At Austin State School, the institution was notified recently
that its Medicaid money is frozen because it failed to tell state
regulators about several incidents of fondling among male
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Jim Armstrong said his staff did not realize such
incidents must be reported to authorities. ``Hereafter, though, we
will report it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of Medicaid sanctions comes after the state
cut $13.2 million from the retardation institutions' budgets last
fall because their populations are declining as more residents move
to community-based homes. The cuts resulted in layoffs at some
institutions, including Austin State School.

 &HT;    COLUMN: At least they didn't play the Bee Gees
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The disk jockey came up to me right after
the Class of 1978 reunion party started and said he was glad I was
there, since he hated being the oldest person in the room. He
walked off before I could hasten to explain that although I was too
old to be a member of that class, I was certainly too young to be
in his graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he played K.C. and the Sunshine Band's ``That's the Way I
Like It.'' The late 1970s might have had something to recommend it
(though I can't remember what it would be at the moment), but it
sure wasn't musical taste. In less than 10 years the songs at the
top of the charts went from the
</P>
<P>
   Beatles and Jefferson Airplane to the Bee Gees and the Village
People. Yeech.
</P>
<P>
   This is my running buddy's graduating class of Nacogdoches High
School. I've never been to a reunion party of a class to which I
didn't belong. I've
</P>
<P>
   only been to one of my own, and that was 15 years ago. I thought
Longview High would have a 25-year reunion this summer, but
apparently nobody had the energy to organize it. Or I wasn't
invited, which would be a distinct possibility given my rather
spotty record back then.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange going to someone else's class reunion -- lots of
inside jokes, old stories and such that you don't get. I did a lot
of standing around, smiling and shuffling while strangers peered in
vain for a yearbook picture encased in plastic and pinned to my
shirt. Aaah, a spouse, they would finally realize, and introduce
themselves. I was sorely tempted to borrow a name tag of a
non-attendee and wear it. That'll mess 'em up, as they look at the
20-year-old photo of someone who looks vaguely like you, meaning
the same gender and race, and try to connect that memory with the
person standing in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't all strangers. A goodly number of the Class of 1978
still live here, running small businesses, teaching, working at a
bank, etc. I
</P>
<P>
   know several of them. A surprising number of the class,
including the contractor, was involved in building our house.
</P>
<P>
   My running buddy has a circle of girlfriends who still keep in
touch, most of whom still live here or come back often to visit.
They've stuck together
</P>
<P>
   through kids, divorces, death and other assorted disasters.
These women in the past 20 years have gone on countless road trips
together, crashed on
</P>
<P>
   each other's couches when marriages went south, and still call
each other, usually late at night, to laugh and gossip into the wee
hours. When they all
</P>
<P>
   got back together at the reunion, cutting up and reminiscing,
they reminded me of ``Thelma and Louise'' -- except there were more
of them. You could
</P>
<P>
   picture them all piled up in a convertible, hurtling down the
road somewhere, radio going full blast, looking for an ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   The few members of her gang that I hadn't met examined me, the
new husband, closely. I felt as if I was a piece of livestock with
an uncertain
</P>
<P>
   pedigree -- not all that far off the mark. I passed examination,
apparently: teeth OK, hasn't lost all his hair, a bit short
perhaps, but relatively

<P>
   My running buddy took a great deal of ribbing from classmates
she hasn't seen in years about no longer dressing exclusively in
cowboy boots and hat.
</P>
<P>
   Her penchant for rodeos and dressing like Annie Oakley passed
long before I met her, thank the Lord. Other classmates had ditched
their Afros or
</P>
<P>
   bouffaints, or acquired some extra baggage around the middle. A

<P>
   After the reunion party, about two dozen or so folks showed up
at our house, since it was close by. A classmate who plays music
professionally

<P>
   brought out his saxophone. My step-son lugged his electric
guitar and amp outside, and and jammed with the sax player for a
good while, followed by

were sleeping soundly.

   It was a pleasant ending, the ceiling fans stirring the finally

Everyone finally

   left by 3:30 in the morning, which meant I wasn't worth killing
the next day.

 &HT;    Medicaid withstands Florida's Viagra onslaught
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Poor men are not going as wild over
Viagra as state officials had feared.
</P>
<P>
   So the state Medicaid's $12 million-a-year projection for the
impotency drug is shrinking to $3 million to $5 million a year.
That sounds like a lot of money, but it is just a blip in Florida's
$7 billion yearly Medicaid budget.
</P>
<P>
   For $5 million, about 10 percent of the state's 176,000 men on
Medicaid age 19 or older _ or about 17,000 men _ would get three
pills a month. Recipients can get up to four pills a month.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer-paid coverage has resulted in a phone fury, said
Jerry Wells, state pharmacy program manager.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, people call to say impotency is a serious problem
and men need Viagra to help them feel better. On the other side,
callers are angry their taxes are being wasted.
</P>
<P>
   One day, two calls from the same senator's office were made to
Wells. One aide spoke against paying for the pills. Another wanted
to make sure a man who uses a wheelchair would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The state Medicaid program must cover the drug unless the
federal government decides the drug is being abused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear with such popular drugs is that Medicaid patients will
trade their prescriptions for other drugs, services or cash on the
street, Wells said. There are no signs of that in Florida, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 44 days the drug was available, the state spent
about $2,700 a day, setting a $1 million yearly pace. So far,
13,819 pills have been distributed through 3,688 claims that cost a
total of $118,586.
</P>
<P>
   The state pays about $7.49 a pill but a $4.23 processing fee on
each prescription increases the price to about $8.58 a tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Wells expects the pace to still increase as doctors feel more
comfortable doling out Viagra and patients realize Medicaid covers
it.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast last year, the state paid 612 claims totaling
$260,000 for two different impotency drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, which helps impotent men achieve and maintain erections,
is much more popular because a pill is simpler and less painful
than treatments that involve placing suppositories or having an
injection in the penis.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug is not for everyone. Experts warn that Viagra,
tested on a few thousand men, could cause unknown side effects in
the hundreds of thousands of men now taking it. So far, health
officials haven't heard of any major problems in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center's emergency room,
cardiologist Dennis Hanney has seen two men who have been near
death because they took Viagra and had been on a long-acting
nitroglycerin prescription.

   ONE GOOD WEB SITE
</P>
<P>
   I f you're already in a burger rut at the grill, check out the
ideas on the Web at the University of California at Berkeley's
``101 Ways to Make Burgers'' site. The possibilities range from
Louisiana-style Spicy Blackened Burgers to Fajita Burgers. Point
your browser to soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/burgers/indexall.html.
</P>
<P>
   ONE GOOD IDEA
</P>
<P>
   I f the idea of keeping cool in the kitchen appeals to you, a
new book may expand the possibilities. Joie Warner's No-Cook Pasta
Sauces (Chronicle, $17.95) goes beyond everyone's staple of
uncooked tomato sauce and comes up with 75 recipes. Some rely on
leftover chicken and seafood from a night out or prepared foods
such as eggplant caponata from a jar, but most are prepared from
scratch. Example: a no-cook meat sauce made with diced prosciutto
and Black Forest ham.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry tomatoes hint at what's ahead
</P>
<P>
   Though a few truly home-grown tomatoes are available at farmers
markets, most of us are waiting for the sun-warmed backyard variety
that are still weeks away. Stem tomatoes at the supermarket remain
the best choice at the store . Now they are available as cherry
tomatoes, and one variety labeled Towingo is as pretty as a piece
of art. Look for a good selection at Meijer stores.

   MEDICAID-VIAGRA _ Poor men are not going as wild over Viagra as
state officials had feared. So the state Medicaid's $12
million-a-year projection for the impotency drug is shrinking to $3
million to $5 million a year. That sounds like a lot of money, but
it is just a blip in Florida's $7 billion yearly Medicaid budget.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that the Federal Reserve sets interest rates,
which in turn affects unemployment. By what authority does ``the
Fed'' exist? Who makes its policies?
</P>
<P>
   A. More than unemployment is involved. The Federal Reserve
encourages the nation's economic growth and controls inflation by
influencing interest rates, as you say, and thus the availability
of money and loans. It also performs many financial services for
the federal government and provides numerous services in its role
as central bank of the United States, to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is an independent government agency. Its policies are
directed by two main committees, the Board of Governors and the
Federal Open Market Committee. The board has seven members,
appointed to 14-year terms by the President, subject to the consent
of the U.S. Senate. The committee, which makes the main decisions
on Fed monetary policies, consists of the Fed governors; the
president of the New York City Federal Reserve Bank; and the
presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks (there are 12
nationwide).
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is formic acid? I recently read that an interstate
highway ramp was closed for five hours recently when that type acid
spilled from a truck. I've never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's the dictionary definition: ``a colorless, irritating,
fuming, water-soluble liquid . . . CH 2 O 2 (or HCOOH) . . . used
in dyeing and tanning and in medicine.'' Our definition:
``something that stings and irritates like you wouldn't believe.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know where the word ``formic'' comes from, you'll
understand why firefighters donned masks, gloves and heavy garb,
and closed the ramp for five hours, when the stuff spilled from
that truck at Old National Highway and I-75 in Clayton County.
Think of how a teeny, tiny ant can sting you if it chooses. Ants
belong to the family Formicidae. If the formic acid produced by an
ant can, in almost microscopic amounts, create a painful experience
in humans, what could the synthetic version in concentrated amounts
do?
</P>
<P>
   Q. The governor of Georgia and Sony Music are involved in a
program to give parents of newborn babies in Georgia a CD or tape
of various classical music selections. It is believed that an
infant hearing such music will have a positive intellectual
response. How can people who aren't parents of newborns in Georgia
obtain the CDs or tapes?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music!'' can
be ordered by calling Sony Music Special Products, 1-800-356-1052.
The cost is $9.98 for a CD, $5.98 for a cassette tape, plus sales
tax and $3.95 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Old and new gospel hymns speak of Beulah land. The word
Beulah is not in the Bible and I can't find a reference anywhere to
Beulah land. Can you explain what it means?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before we answer, let's start the song going in everyone's
mind by repeating the refrain from C. Austin Miles' ``Dwelling in
Beulah Land'' (and don't forget to clap your hands):
</P>
<P>
   I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,/
</P>
<P>
   I'm drinking at the fountain that shall never run dry;/
</P>
<P>
   O yes! I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,/
</P>
<P>
   For I'm dwelling in Beulah Land.
</P>
<P>
   Beulah's origin is in the Bible (the book of the Prophet Isaiah
62:4), where it refers to ``your land Beulah,'' meaning the new
Jerusalem _ a place, neither heaven nor Earth, that enjoys God's
loving benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate source for contemporary usage may be ``The
Pilgrim's Progress,'' by John Bunyan, the religious allegory first
published in 1678. In it, Christian, the hero, arrives at last in
the land or country of Beulah on the border of the Celestial City
(heaven). Bunyan describes this land as a garden of perfect harmony
between nature and man, who, finally understanding God's plan,
rests from the arduous journey before confronting the final
challenge: crossing the river of death to eternal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please explain the concept of the dew point. What is it? How
is it related to relative humidity, temperature and dew?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dew point is the temperature at which moisture in the air
begins to condense. The dew point is either lower than the air
temperature, or the same as the air temperature when the relative
humidity is 100 percent. The difference between air and dew point
temperatures, popularly called the ``spread,'' is especially useful
to people in aviation, because it helps anticipate fog. However, it
has little bearing on precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Dew forms when a thin film of air, in contact with the surface,
is cooled to below the dew point _ the point at which it cannot
hold all its water vapor. If the air temperature and dew point are
below freezing, frost may form on the surface, or ice crystals may
form in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``crackers'' in referring to
poor white Southerners?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are various explanations of how ``cracker'' acquired
the meaning of ``a low-down Southern white man,'' in the words of
H.L. Mencken, who added that such people ``were especially numerous
in Georgia.'' According to the Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins, the one that seems soundest traces to the verb ``crack,''
as in the expression ``he's not what he's cracked up to be,''
meaning that the person doesn't live up to his own boastful opinion
of himself. The Dictionary of American Regional English defines the
word, in this sense, as ``a backwoodsman, rustic, countrified
person,'' and also traces it to cracker or corn-cracker, the
probable original form of the word, meaning a ``braggart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible origin is from the cracking of a whip, since
North Florida and South Georgia at one time were the site of large
ranches, but this wouldn't have any negative connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back in the spring, I read that film director James Cameron
would release a longer version of ``Titanic.'' When will this come
out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't start popping corn quite yet. While Cameron has said he
``eventually'' will put together a special edition of the movie,
which could include as much as 20 minutes of scenes edited from the
first version, he has yet to start working on it. In an interview
in June, he said it would be released ``anywhere from one to five
years from now,'' although he added that he would like to start
putting it together ``while it is still fresh in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the relative burn of calories by walking and
running?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of variables involved, such as the person's
weight, the length of stride, grade of terrain, degree of vigor
expended while walking or running, even heat and humidity, so these
numbers, provided by the American Council on Exercise and the book
``The New Fit or Fat,'' are only guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   An ``average'' person (for statistical reckoning, let's assume
it's a 160-pound man) waliing will burn 8.7 calories a minute, or
261 calories for half an hour. That same man jogging will burn
about 12.4 calories a minute, or 372 calories during 30 minutes. If
that same man picks up the pace and runs, his caloric burn will be
15.1 calories a minute, or 453 calories for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers would be skewed a bit if a person measures the
caloric burn by distance _ a mile, for example _ instead of the
amount of time. ACE says our average man will walk a mile in about
15 minutes; burning 8.7 calories a minute, his total burn will be
130.5 calories. That same person will run a mile in about 7 1/2
minutes, ACE says; at 15.1 calories a minute burned while running,
that totals 113.25.
</P>
<P>
   Jogging, by the way, is just ``slow running,'' said ACE's Rachel
Narsh. She said the average jogger would burn 372 calories in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said air carriers have been given permission to
resume charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Does
that mean the embargo for tourists has been lifted?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Nothing has changed in connection with the sanctions
against general tourist travel to Cuba, said Hamilton Dix of the
Treasury Department. Long-standing U.S. regulations applying to the
spending of U.S. currency on travel to Cuba are intended to limit
the flow of hard currency into that country. Only those U.S.
citizens who meet certain restrictions _ such as U.S. government
travelers on official business, including representatives of
international organizations of which the United States is a member;
journalists; and family visitors traveling once a year due to
extreme humanitarian need _ are permitted to fly on the direct
charters. And the eligibility of those people will be verified by
the Treasury Department at least 48 to 72 hours in advance of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The restricted direct flights to Cuba, which were begun in 1977,
were suspended in 1996 by President Clinton as part of a series of
measures to punish the Cuban government for shooting down two
planes over international waters. Three U.S. citizens were killed.
</P>
<P>
   American tourists determined to visit Cuba, by the way, can fly
there via another country, such as Mexico, the Bahamas or Canada.
But Beth Weaver of the Treasury Department says if Americans go to
Cuba without a specific license, and spend money there, ``which
they certainly would do,'' they would be breaking the law. They
could be investigated when they come back into the United States,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thomas Harris wrote ``Silence of the Lambs'' 10 years ago.
The subsequent movie garnered several Oscars. Fans have eagerly
awaited his sequel, but a decade has passed and we're still
waiting. What has happened to Harris?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harris is said to have been working on the sequel for more
than five years, but no one _ not Anne Sibbald, his literary agent;
not his publisher; not even his family _ has yet to see a word.
``It will arrive when it arrives,'' Sibbald told a British
newspaper last December.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, creator of psychiatrist and psychopath Dr. Hannibal
Lecter, is not exactly prolific. His first book, ``Black Sunday,''
a non-Lecter thriller, was published in 1973. ``Red Dragon,'' the
tense thriller that introduced Lecter, became an instant bestseller
when published in 1981. Fans had to wait another seven years before
Lecter reappeared in ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' which was made
into the hugely popular 1991 film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, the divorced Harris, who has a daughter, was
living in seclusion with Pace Barnes, a former publishing house
editor, and they were dividing their time between Miami and Long
Island's Sag Harbor.

   (UNDATED: Silence of the Lambs . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of HR 3008, the Notch Fairness Act, that
was introduced in Congress the latter part of last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Notch babies'' is a term some retirees use to refer to
themselves because, they believe, they are receiving lower benefits
than other Social Security recipients with comparable earnings born
earlier. According to an analysis by the American Association of
Retired Persons, the problem is that these ``notch babies'' are
comparing themselves to those born from 1912 through 1916 who are
receiving higher benefits than intended. According to AARP, the
benefits that ``notch babies'' receive are actuarially correct.
</P>
<P>
   The ``notch baby'' situation is a long-simmering issue. Since
1981, members of Congress have introduced 118 pieces of notch
reform legislation. None of these initiatives, however, has been
passed into law. The latest bill, HR 3008, sponsored by Rep. Mark
Neumann (R-Wis.), would give the ``notch babies'' the option of
receiving lump-sum payments totaling $5,000, or increased monthly
benefits, through the year 2002. It was referred to the House
Committee on Ways and Means and to the Committee on the Budget Nov.
7, 1997, but has yet to be acted on. Staff of the Ways and Means
subcommittee on Social Security is reviewing the bill's provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the expression ``caught red-handed'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: In ancient times, ``to be taken with red hand'' was to be
caught in the act, like a murderer, with his (or her) hands red
with the victim's blood. The use of ``red hand'' in this sense goes
back to 15th-century Scotland and Scottish law. Sir Walter Scott's
``Ivanhoe'' has an early use of ``taken red-handed'' for someone
apprehended in the act of committing a crime. Not long afterward,
the expression became more common as ``caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a big fan of Rosie O'Donnell. How can I get tickets to
her show in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be lucky, and persistent. And you must plan
well in advance. Even then, there are no guarantees. You can send a
postcard (or letter with stamped, self-addressed return envelope)
to be entered into a lottery for tickets for the 1998-99 season.
You'll be notified by postcard if your name has been chosen. The
address: NBC Studios, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 30 Rockefeller
Plaza, Suite 800E, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take a chance at getting standby space for tapings
Monday throughThursday each week. Standby tickets are available on
that same day only at 8 a.m. outside the 49th Street entrance to 30
Rockefeller Plaza. Standby holders must return no earlier than one
hour prior to a taping on the 50th Street side of the NBC lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication: Even if you get a regular or standby
ticket, you're still not guaranteed admittance. And taping
schedules are subject to change, sometimes without notice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the houseboat in Miami where Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide? Was any connection ever determined
between Cunanan and a German businessman, I think it was, who owned
the houseboat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The houseboat, named the New Year, was condemned by Miami
Beach officials in January after it had settled on the shallow
bottom of Indian Creek and its German owner, identified as Torsten
Reineck, missed a deadline to refloat and repair it. It then was
demolished. Cunanan, the suspected serial killer of fashion
designer Gianni Versace and four other men, committed suicide on
the houseboat in July 1997 before police could capture him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were unable to prove any previous link between
Cunanan and Reineck. That was among several questions the
investigation was not able to answer, such as how Cunanan ended up
on the houseboat, and what he did between Versace's slaying and his
own suicide. As Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto said when
the probe was closed officially on Dec. 31, 1997, the answers to
many questions ``went down with the ship, so to speak, when Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find the Powerball winning numbers on the
Internet? I travel frequently, and it would be handy when I buy a
ticket in a Powerball state. The only site I could find has not
been updated in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try a website for a lottery in one of the participating
states, such as Wisconsin. Here's the address: www.wilottery.com/
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the Mississippi River get its name, since it starts
in Minnesota and ends in Louisiana and borders many states?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Why Do They Call It Topeka'' explains that the
Mississippi, the longest river in North America, derives its name
from the Algonquin words mescha (meaning ``great'') and cebe
(water). The state was named after the river.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 paperback, subtitled ``How Places Got Their Names,'' is
a wealth of information about how places (towns, states, rivers,
mountains) got their name. It's by John W. Pursell. If it isn't in
stock, bookstores should be able to order it. It's a Citadel Press
book, published by Carol Publishing Group ($9.95; ISBN
0-8065-1588-0).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The release of the new ``X-Files'' movie, and the popularity
of Gillian Anderson in the role of Agent Scully, has me wondering:
When did the FBI start permitting women to serve as agents? And
what thoughts did J. Edgar Hoover have on this subject?
</P>
<P>
   A: The FBI's first female agents were Joanne E. Pierce of
Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Susan Lynn Roley of Long Beach, Calif.,
who joined on July 17, 1972. FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead
said the agency can't respond about Hoover's beliefs on female
agents because ``that would be speculation as to what someone else
thought, and we're not going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the CIA gift shop have a mail order catalog?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Furthermore, the gift shop doesn't sell to the public. A
spokesman said the gift shop, operated by the CIA's Employees
Activity Association, is private and not government-run. It sells
such items as golf balls, baseball hats and beer mugs with the CIA
logo, but only to CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a retail outlet not affiliated with the CIA
that does sell many such items to the public. Ship's Hatch Inc.,
has outlets in Arlington and Fairfax, Va. ``Tourists love the CIA
stuff,'' said Mary Beth Cox of the Arlington location. Numerous
items with the CIA logo are available, including coffee mugs,
T-shirts, hats, patches, cigarette lighters and shot glasses, she
said. Specialty items such as Navy hats (from any Navy ship, past
or present, Cox said) also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Items can be obtained in person (or by mail order) from Ship's
Hatch, 1677 Crystal Square Arcade, Arlington, VA 22202
(703-413-6289); or by telephone order from the Fairfax location
(703-691-1670). Information also is available on the stores'
website: www.shipshatch.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the name Atlanta derived from Atlas, the god in Greek
mythology? Or is it from the Atlantic Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you want to take an indirect route, it's from Atlas. But
the more direct source is Atlantic, from a railroad that took part
of its name from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The place that was to become Atlanta was incorporated under the
name Marthasville on Dec. 23, 1842. The post office also recognized
it by that name. In 1845, J. Edgar Thompson, chief engineer of the
Georgia Railroad, was asked by his boss to suggest a new name for
the depot, the southern terminus of the Western &AMP; Atlantic
Railroad. The book ``Georgia Place Names'' said Thompson came up
with Atlanta as a feminine version of Atlantic. Although the town
still was called Marthasville, freight coming in was marked
``Atlanta,'' and it wasn't long before the new name stuck. Atlanta
was incorporated as a city Dec. 29, 1845.
</P>
<P>
   The names Atlantic and Atlas are directly related. The ancient
Romans named the Atlantic Ocean after the Atlas Mountains of North
Africa, which marked the western limit of what was then the known
world. The Atlas Mountains were named for Atlas, son of the Titan
Iapetus and the sea nymph Clymene, in Greek mythology.

temperatures, popularly called the ``spread,'' is especially useful
to people in aviation, because it helps anticipate fog. However, it
has little bearing on precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Dew forms when a thin film of air, in contact with the surface,
is cooled to below the dew point _ the point at which it cannot
hold all its water vapor. If the air temperature and dew point are
below freezing, frost may form on the surface, or ice crystals may
form in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``crackers'' in referring to
poor white Southerners?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are various explanations of how ``cracker'' acquired
the meaning of ``a low-down Southern white man,'' in the words of
H.L. Mencken, who added that such people ``were especially numerous
in Georgia.'' According to the Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins, the one that seems soundest traces to the verb ``crack,''
as in the expression ``he's not what he's cracked up to be,''
meaning that the person doesn't live up to his own boastful opinion
of himself. The Dictionary of American Regional English defines the
word, in this sense, as ``a backwoodsman, rustic, countrified
person,'' and also traces it to cracker or corn-cracker, the
probable original form of the word, meaning a ``braggart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible origin is from the cracking of a whip, since
North Florida and South Georgia at one time were the site of large
ranches, but this wouldn't have any negative connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back in the spring, I read that film director James Cameron
would release a longer version of ``Titanic.'' When will this come
out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't start popping corn quite yet. While Cameron has said he
``eventually'' will put together a special edition of the movie,
which could include as much as 20 minutes of scenes edited from the
first version, he has yet to start working on it. In an interview
in June, he said it would be released ``anywhere from one to five
years from now,'' although he added that he would like to start
putting it together ``while it is still fresh in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the relative burn of calories by walking and
running?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of variables involved, such as the person's
weight, the length of stride, grade of terrain, degree of vigor
expended while walking or running, even heat and humidity, so these
numbers, provided by the American Council on Exercise and the book
``The New Fit or Fat,'' are only guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   An ``average'' person (for statistical reckoning, let's assume
it's a 160-pound man) waliing will burn 8.7 calories a minute, or
261 calories for half an hour. That same man jogging will burn
about 12.4 calories a minute, or 372 calories during 30 minutes. If
that same man picks up the pace and runs, his caloric burn will be
15.1 calories a minute, or 453 calories for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers would be skewed a bit if a person measures the
caloric burn by distance _ a mile, for example _ instead of the
amount of time. ACE says our average man will walk a mile in about
15 minutes; burning 8.7 calories a minute, his total burn will be
130.5 calories. That same person will run a mile in about 7 1/2
minutes, ACE says; at 15.1 calories a minute burned while running,
that totals 113.25.
</P>
<P>
   Jogging, by the way, is just ``slow running,'' said ACE's Rachel
Narsh. She said the average jogger would burn 372 calories in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said air carriers have been given permission to
resume charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Does
that mean the embargo for tourists has been lifted?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Nothing has changed in connection with the sanctions
against general tourist travel to Cuba, said Hamilton Dix of the
Treasury Department. Long-standing U.S. regulations applying to the
spending of U.S. currency on travel to Cuba are intended to limit
the flow of hard currency into that country. Only those U.S.
citizens who meet certain restrictions _ such as U.S. government
travelers on official business, including representatives of
international organizations of which the United States is a member;
journalists; and family visitors traveling once a year due to
extreme humanitarian need _ are permitted to fly on the direct
charters. And the eligibility of those people will be verified by
the Treasury Department at least 48 to 72 hours in advance of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The restricted direct flights to Cuba, which were begun in 1977,
were suspended in 1996 by President Clinton as part of a series of
measures to punish the Cuban government for shooting down two
planes over international waters. Three U.S. citizens were killed.
</P>
<P>
   American tourists determined to visit Cuba, by the way, can fly
there via another country, such as Mexico, the Bahamas or Canada.
But Beth Weaver of the Treasury Department says if Americans go to
Cuba without a specific license, and spend money there, ``which
they certainly would do,'' they would be breaking the law. They
could be investigated when they come back into the United States,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thomas Harris wrote ``Silence of the Lambs'' 10 years ago.
The subsequent movie garnered several Oscars. Fans have eagerly
awaited his sequel, but a decade has passed and we're still
waiting. What has happened to Harris?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harris is said to have been working on the sequel for more
than five years, but no one _ not Anne Sibbald, his literary agent;
not his publisher; not even his family _ has yet to see a word.
``It will arrive when it arrives,'' Sibbald told a British
newspaper last December.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, creator of psychiatrist and psychopath Dr. Hannibal
Lecter, is not exactly prolific. His first book, ``Black Sunday,''
a non-Lecter thriller, was published in 1973. ``Red Dragon,'' the
tense thriller that introduced Lecter, became an instant bestseller
when published in 1981. Fans had to wait another seven years before
Lecter reappeared in ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' which was made
into the hugely popular 1991 film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, the divorced Harris, who has a daughter, was
living in seclusion with Pace Barnes, a former publishing house
editor, and they were dividing their time between Miami and Long
Island's Sag Harbor.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED: Silence of the Lambs . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of HR 3008, the Notch Fairness Act, that
was introduced in Congress the latter part of last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Notch babies'' is a term some retirees use to refer to
themselves because, they believe, they are receiving lower benefits
than other Social Security recipients with comparable earnings born
earlier. According to an analysis by the American Association of
Retired Persons, the problem is that these ``notch babies'' are
comparing themselves to those born from 1912 through 1916 who are
receiving higher benefits than intended. According to AARP, the
benefits that ``notch babies'' receive are actuarially correct.
</P>
<P>
   The ``notch baby'' situation is a long-simmering issue. Since
1981, members of Congress have introduced 118 pieces of notch
reform legislation. None of these initiatives, however, has been
passed into law. The latest bill, HR 3008, sponsored by Rep. Mark
Neumann (R-Wis.), would give the ``notch babies'' the option of
receiving lump-sum payments totaling $5,000, or increased monthly
benefits, through the year 2002. It was referred to the House
Committee on Ways and Means and to the Committee on the Budget Nov.
7, 1997, but has yet to be acted on. Staff of the Ways and Means
subcommittee on Social Security is reviewing the bill's provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the expression ``caught red-handed'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: In ancient times, ``to be taken with red hand'' was to be
caught in the act, like a murderer, with his (or her) hands red
with the victim's blood. The use of ``red hand'' in this sense goes
back to 15th-century Scotland and Scottish law. Sir Walter Scott's
``Ivanhoe'' has an early use of ``taken red-handed'' for someone
apprehended in the act of committing a crime. Not long afterward,
the expression became more common as ``caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a big fan of Rosie O'Donnell. How can I get tickets to
her show in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be lucky, and persistent. And you must plan
well in advance. Even then, there are no guarantees. You can send a
postcard (or letter with stamped, self-addressed return envelope)
to be entered into a lottery for tickets for the 1998-99 season.
You'll be notified by postcard if your name has been chosen. The
address: NBC Studios, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 30 Rockefeller
Plaza, Suite 800E, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take a chance at getting standby space for tapings
Monday throughThursday each week. Standby tickets are available on
that same day only at 8 a.m. outside the 49th Street entrance to 30
Rockefeller Plaza. Standby holders must return no earlier than one
hour prior to a taping on the 50th Street side of the NBC lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication: Even if you get a regular or standby
ticket, you're still not guaranteed admittance. And taping
schedules are subject to change, sometimes without notice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the houseboat in Miami where Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide? Was any connection ever determined
between Cunanan and a German businessman, I think it was, who owned
the houseboat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The houseboat, named the New Year, was condemned by Miami
Beach officials in January after it had settled on the shallow
bottom of Indian Creek and its German owner, identified as Torsten
Reineck, missed a deadline to refloat and repair it. It then was
demolished. Cunanan, the suspected serial killer of fashion
designer Gianni Versace and four other men, committed suicide on
the houseboat in July 1997 before police could capture him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were unable to prove any previous link between
Cunanan and Reineck. That was among several questions the
investigation was not able to answer, such as how Cunanan ended up
on the houseboat, and what he did between Versace's slaying and his
own suicide. As Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto said when
the probe was closed officially on Dec. 31, 1997, the answers to
many questions ``went down with the ship, so to speak, when Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find the Powerball winning numbers on the
Internet? I travel frequently, and it would be handy when I buy a
ticket in a Powerball state. The only site I could find has not
been updated in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try a website for a lottery in one of the participating
states, such as Wisconsin. Here's the address: www.wilottery.com/
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the Mississippi River get its name, since it starts
in Minnesota and ends in Louisiana and borders many states?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Why Do They Call It Topeka'' explains that the
Mississippi, the longest river in North America, derives its name
from the Algonquin words mescha (meaning ``great'') and cebe
(water). The state was named after the river.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 paperback, subtitled ``How Places Got Their Names,'' is
a wealth of information about how places (towns, states, rivers,
mountains) got their name. It's by John W. Pursell. If it isn't in
stock, bookstores should be able to order it. It's a Citadel Press
book, published by Carol Publishing Group ($9.95; ISBN
0-8065-1588-0).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The release of the new ``X-Files'' movie, and the popularity
of Gillian Anderson in the role of Agent Scully, has me wondering:
When did the FBI start permitting women to serve as agents? And
what thoughts did J. Edgar Hoover have on this subject?
</P>
<P>
   A: The FBI's first female agents were Joanne E. Pierce of
Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Susan Lynn Roley of Long Beach, Calif.,
who joined on July 17, 1972. FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead
said the agency can't respond about Hoover's beliefs on female
agents because ``that would be speculation as to what someone else
thought, and we're not going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the CIA gift shop have a mail order catalog?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Furthermore, the gift shop doesn't sell to the public. A
spokesman said the gift shop, operated by the CIA's Employees
Activity Association, is private and not government-run. It sells
such items as golf balls, baseball hats and beer mugs with the CIA
logo, but only to CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a retail outlet not affiliated with the CIA
that does sell many such items to the public. Ship's Hatch Inc.,
has outlets in Arlington and Fairfax, Va. ``Tourists love the CIA
stuff,'' said Mary Beth Cox of the Arlington location. Numerous
items with the CIA logo are available, including coffee mugs,
T-shirts, hats, patches, cigarette lighters and shot glasses, she
said. Specialty items such as Navy hats (from any Navy ship, past
or present, Cox said) also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Items can be obtained in person (or by mail order) from Ship's
Hatch, 1677 Crystal Square Arcade, Arlington, VA 22202
(703-413-6289); or by telephone order from the Fairfax location
(703-691-1670). Information also is available on the stores'
website: www.shipshatch.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the name Atlanta derived from Atlas, the god in Greek
mythology? Or is it from the Atlantic Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you want to take an indirect route, it's from Atlas. But
the more direct source is Atlantic, from a railroad that took part
of its name from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The place that was to become Atlanta was incorporated under the
name Marthasville on Dec. 23, 1842. The post office also recognized
it by that name. In 1845, J. Edgar Thompson, chief engineer of the
Georgia Railroad, was asked by his boss to suggest a new name for
the depot, the southern terminus of the Western &AMP; Atlantic
Railroad. The book ``Georgia Place Names'' said Thompson came up
with Atlanta as a feminine version of Atlantic. Although the town
still was called Marthasville, freight coming in was marked
``Atlanta,'' and it wasn't long before the new name stuck. Atlanta
was incorporated as a city Dec. 29, 1845.
</P>
<P>
   The names Atlantic and Atlas are directly related. The ancient
Romans named the Atlantic Ocean after the Atlas Mountains of North
Africa, which marked the western limit of what was then the known
world. The Atlas Mountains were named for Atlas, son of the Titan
Iapetus and the sea nymph Clymene, in Greek mythology.

</P>
<P>
   1. ANTONIO BANDERAS TAKES A STAB AT 'ZORRO' Spanish actor
Antonio Banderas talks about the new movie ``The Mask of Zorro,''
the enduring appeal of the swordsman, why his own children may not
like the movie and how he coped with the scandal of his romance
with Melanie Griffith, for whom he left his wife. By Ian Spelling.
1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
SOMETHING ABOUT MATT DILLON Matt Dillon has spent a decade making
movies, and gone from flavour-of-the-month teen idol to respected
Hollywood leading man. His latest film, ``There's Something About
Mary,'' is the zany, slapstick face he says he's always wanted to
make. Dillon talks about the new movie, what it was like to co-star
with his longtime girlfriend Cameron Diaz, how he reacted to
criticism of his recent, super-steamy erotic thriller ``Wild
Things,'' and why he thinks there isn't enough sex in today's
movies. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
BEN AFFLECK'S NEXT FRONTIER At precisely the moment when Hollywood
wants to label him ``hunk'' or ``genius,'' actor Ben Affleck sees
the danger of being mythicized into something unreal. So he's
playing the Hollywood kind of Russian roulette young talent has
always played, dancing with the system, but also dancing away from
it. In this interview Affleck talks about the summer's big action
movie, ``Armageddon.'' By Jay Carr. The Boston Globe. 2,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________4.
WILD ABOUT HARRY Family comes first for Harry Connick Jr., the
father of two young girls and husband of former Victoria's Secrets
model Jill Goodacre. He tries to guard his privacy at home but it's
hard with two successful careers : he's an in-demand musician whose
love of traditional jazz and funk has struck a chord with millions,
and an in-demand actor whose career took off in the blockbuster
sci-fi film ``Independence Day.'' He now has a starring role in
``Hope Floats,'' a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock. By Steve
Morse. The Boston Globe. 1,100 words.
_______________________________________________________________5.
THE SECRETS OF LOREENA MCKENNITT Loreena McKennitt's star has been
gently rising in the new-age and world-music fields for more than a
decade. She has had gold albums in America and sells well in other
parts of the world. The Canadian singer-songwriter-harpist is
comfortable with both ancient tribal instruments and computers. In
this interview she calls her soothing style ``eclectic Celtic,'' --
it has a Celtic basis and a wide range of world-music influences
including Middle Eastern and Russian, that sounds as if it sprang
from the mystical Dark Ages. By Jim Sullivan. The Boston Globe.
1,600 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
ERNIE HUDSON AT A CROSSROADS Ernie Hudson starred in the two
``Ghostbusters'' hits, and has a score of other films to his
credit. Now in his 40's, Hudson admits that his dreams of being a
big-screen leading man may be over. The actor, frustrated but
determined, talks frankly about mistakes he has made, the downside
of money in Hollywood, and his new dream : surviving on his own
terms. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
ROSEBUD REDUX : ORSON WELLES IS HOT AGAIN Towards the end of his
life, Orson Welles - a proud, defiant artist and arguably the
greatest director America ever produced - was reduced to appearing
in wine commercials to earn a living. Meanwhile, his cherished
projects were left unseen. ``When I die,'' Welles said, ``they'll
be picking over my creative bones.'' Nearly 13 years after his
death, Welles is now at the centre of a major revival. Critics
lament that his quintessential works are being made by other
directors. By Patrick Z. McGavin. From The Hollywood Reporter.
2,300 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
FRANCES MCDORMAND TAKES A SHINE TO MADELINE Frances McDormand won
an Oscar for her ``Fargo'' role as a pregnant sheriff who gets
tangled up in a violent kidnapping case. She's been a regular in
the weird films of the Coen brothers, and is even married to Joel
Coen. So it's a change for her to be bright and bubbly in
``Madeline,'' based on the beloved classic children's book and
filmed in Paris. By Jean Oppenheimer. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
EXPLORING SPACEY The man who has made a career out of playing
psychos is really just a nice, normal, cultured guy. Kevin Spacey
broke out of the crazed mould in a British production of ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' and on the movie front, he stars in ``The
Negotiator.'' Interview by Merle Ginsberg. W magazine. 1,500 words
+ 2 photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 10.
EDWARD BURNS INTERVIEW Actor Edward Burns wowed the Sundance Film
Festival for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which was
shot for a tiny $25,000 but grossed more than $10 million.
Hollywood is already buzzing about his starring role in Steven
Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' (Spielberg cast him without an
audition.) By Julie L. Belcove. W magazine. 1,500 words + photos.

   VINYL-CHLORIDE (Lake Charles, La.) _ Thousands of previously

ranks in the late 1950s to contain evidence of the toxic effects of
vinyl chloride, which is used to make one of the world's most
common plastics. The documents present a deadly scenario: That the
companies subjected at least two generations of workers to

   ``Doctor's note: Engrossed as I am by my intensive research into
the specific molecular composition of the perfect margarita, I
thought I'd step back and let the readers write this week's column.
Don't worry. I'll be right here in italics if you need me. Now,
what happened to all the Triple Sec?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for good uses for old CD-ROMs, but this
one is stretching it a bit:''
</P>
<P>
   A friend and CEO of a corporation who has been a Microsoft
developer for many years ``(And that's supposed to make him
credible?)'' takes his CDs and places them in the microwave for
three seconds. The resulting corona flash was amazing, and the
result is the most wonderful crinkle pattern. He then hangs them on
the wall as art. ``(No accounting for taste, I guess.)'' It's
awesome to enter a room filled with Microsoft CDs burned at the
stake. _ Tron
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have made this next one up even on a good day:''
</P>
<P>
   The lapidary world is finding that CDs make GREAT polishing
discs for faceting gems. I'm not kidding! They are coated ever so
slightly with a bit of carnauba wax and then ``charged'' with
diamond dust, and they work great. So, if one were to really want
to recycle the darn things, they could bundle 'em up and donate
them to their local rock and mineral club. _ Suzette
</P>
<P>
   ``And the winner is ...''
</P>
<P>
   Two words: ``PULL! BLAM!'' _ Frank
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to one woman's letter about her husband's snooping
into what she was doing on a chat channel, I recently asked if
anybody knew of a specific way it could be done. These responses
should make everybody a little more paranoid:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubby'' might be using a key-logger _ a hacker's tool used for
recording keystrokes (usually used for the purposes of obtaining
passwords). Most likely he is using the IRC client's own
logger,.MDBR/.MDNM/ though. Whichever way, the guy's a jerk. ``(No
argument about that.)'' _ Michael Spencer
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple script that can be used in mIRC, one of the
popular chat programs out there, and I'm sure that with very little
change it would work with Pirch and many other chats. No, I'm not
anal and don't have such a line in my remotes. ``(Sure.)'' I am
just responding to your request. ``(I'd include the script here,
but it would scare the nongeeks. Besides, I don't want any more
snooping than there already is.)'' For more on chat scripting, you
can come to Dalnet, channel \ mIRC4Dummies. _ Ron
</P>
<P>
   There are many utilities that will track your every move on the
computer. One of my clients thought his salesman was spending too
much time at Pyro Pete's Porn Page ``(not that there's anything
wrong with that)'' instead of working on his sales reports, so he
had me install a client that he bought that tracks every keystroke.
But why would you want to? The lady who wrote you left out one
important piece of information. Why does the husband feel it's his
duty to check up on her? Maybe she's caused him no end of grief. I
would suggest that he divorce her, but she'd probably get the
computer. Good women are a dime a dozen, but a good computer, now
that's something worth hanging onto. _ Tom
</P>
<P>
   ``Owww. Remember, as you sit down to write your angry letters, I
was busy with the blender and didn't know what was going on or who
was saying what. Hmmm, too much lime, not enough tequila.''

SCARLETT AND FRIENDS GO ONLINE  
 BY TOMMY CUMMINGS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankly, my dear, the ``Gone With the Wind'' online exhibit is
darn good.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an address
(www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/HRHRC/DOS/GWTW/GWTW.html) that's as
long as the movie is epic, the online exhibit is an entertaining
visit while the 1939 film is in its remastered re-release.
</P>
<P>
   The ``GWTW'' online exhibit was launched in October by the Harry
Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at
Austin, using resources from the David O. Selznick Archive.
Selznick produced the movie.
</P>
<P>
   By tapping into Selznick's archive, site creator Steve Wilson
was able to post video of screen tests, transcriptions of memos and
letters, and dozens of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is divided into three sections: The Search for
Scarlett, Costumes and Makeup, and The Book Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlett section uses multimedia to detail how Selznick and
his staff cast Scarlett. Included are photographs of many of the
top contenders and videos from the screen tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Costumes and Makeup section includes video of the famous
Curtain Dress, the outfit Scarlett made from the green velvet
curtains of her Tara plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The Book Purchase section displays memos, telegrams, teletypes
and letters that tell the story of how Selznick and Katherine
Brown, his New York story editor, acquired the film rights to
Margaret Mitchell's novel.
</P>
<P>
   Selznick's archives are also available online. Materials gleaned
from documents in more than 5,000 boxes from the center chronicle
Selznick's career from 1916 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Future sections have been considered, but no plans have been
made, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot to do in the future,'' he said. _ Tommy

THE MOUSE PADS IN ON LITTLE ROUND FEET

   MOUSE-PAD HUNT
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Web sites for collectibles, the one that makes the
most sense is Adriaan van der Hek's First Virtual Mouse Pad Museum
(www.expa.hvu.nl/ajvdhek).
</P>
<P>
   Hey, they're more practical to hoard than keyboards, monitors or
motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Utrecht, the Netherlands, van der Hek created the
site after scarfing up 45 free mouse pads at a trade show. On a
friend's suggestion, he first used them as wallpaper, but he found
them more practical as collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people from all over the world send me mouse pads or
make virtual donations'' via a scanned image, said van der Hek, who
has received more than 400 pads from France, Japan, Germany, Spain,
the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Hek's site includes a gallery of his collection,
documentation of the first patented mouse pad and a look at what he
calls the best mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   SOUPED UP
</P>
<P>
   If copycat cook Todd Wilbur were to order at Al Yeganeh's Soup
Kitchen International in Manhattan, he'd likely get the dreaded
``NO SOUP FOR YOU!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, author of several books that duplicate brand-name
recipes, has apparently cracked the soup recipes made by Yeganeh,
the New York restaurateur who was immortalized on ``Seinfeld'' as
the ``Soup Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wilbur's Top Secret Recipes site (www.topsecretrecipes.com),
he has posted recipes for Yeganeh's crab bisque, cream of sweet
potato and indian mulligatawny.
</P>
<P>
   HIT THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Count Encyclopaedia Britannica as a partner in this summer's
movie bonanza. The encyclopedia's site, Britannica Online
(www.eb.com), has developed a virtual march through the D-Day
invasion of 1944 to accompany Steven Spielberg's upcoming film,
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy site includes articles, essays, interactive maps,
audio and video clips and transcripts of first-person accounts.

LINUX'S WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few weeks in the company of Linux, I'm convinced that
Microsoft Corp. CEO Bill Gates deserves his billions.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Linux. It's the free operating system software
developed in part by the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge,
Mass. Linux has between 5 million and 7 million users worldwide,
depending on who you ask, and it's beginning to offer a head-on
challenge to Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back I vowed to try running Linux on my home
machine, instead of Windows 95. I'm no Microsoft-basher; I'm just
sick of the company's arrogance and eager for a high-quality
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Since then I've received dozens of e-mails from around the
world. A few suggested that I skip Linux and switch to an Apple
Macintosh instead. But these were far outnumbered by messages from
faithful Linux users, as well as fence-sitters wondering whether
they should take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not surprised by the response. Even most faithful Mac users
know that their favorite computer has reached a commercial dead
end. But today's Mac is a technology dead end as well--along with
Microsoft's DOS and Windows 95, and even the shiny new Windows 98.
None of these operating systems is designed to take full advantage
of today's hot processor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is well aware of this. All of its future releases for
home and business will be built around the more sophisticated
Windows NT. This software is Microsoft's effort to emulate the
sophisticated Unix operating system that runs most of the computers
on the Internet. Meanwhile, Apple's next-generation operating
system, Mac OS X, is set to roll out next year. OS X will be based
upon a Unix work-alike called Mach.
</P>
<P>
   Notice a trend here? The Unix way of doing things holds a lot of
appeal, because Unix and its various clones like Linux tend to be
more crash-resistant, even when you're running several programs at
once. That's because Linux will assign each program its own chunk
of memory to play in, with other programs ordered to keep out.
Windows 95 tries to do the same, but it frequently fails, leading
to those amusing ``general protection fault'' crashes. Windows NT
goes a long way toward fixing this problem, for as much as $800 a
pop. But Linux is free.
</P>
<P>
   So why go with Windows? Well, maybe you'd like to get some work
done.
</P>
<P>
   I get paid to fiddle with computers, and so I had a ball writing
script files and sending desperate e-mails to Linux gurus. Linux
harkens back to the Heroic Age of computing, when you actually had
to know something about your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Any of you weenies can insert a floppy disk on a PC or Mac. With
Linux, I have to shove in the disk, and then type a magical
incantion in computerese, too complicated to repeat here. You PC
and Mac users don't have to understand what's really happening when
you're swapping disks or installing a new piece of software. You
point, you click, you get busy.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what 95 percent of all computer users want to do. My
Linux adventure has heightened my respect for the hardworking
coders at Apple and, yes, even Microsoft. Bill Gates has earned his
money by giving us colorful, convenient software that shields us
from the brute realities of computing. Until Linux also gets a
simple and attractive user interface like Windows NT, it'll only be
popular with tightwads and arrested-development types like me. In
addition, Linux needs high-quality software from reputable
companies if it's to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there's movement on both fronts. Netscape
Communications Corp. has a solid version of its Web browser running
on Linux, and Corel Computer Corp. also offers its excellent
WordPerfect program. Indeed, Corel says they're bringing out an
entire office suite for Linux--word processor, spreadsheet, the
works. Meanwhile, a band of German software designers have created
KDE, a user interface that comes mighty close to civilizing Linux.
While it still needs a lot of work, my KDE-Linux setup qualifies
for the junior varsity in the ease-of-use league.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft just announced that the next version of Windows NT
will be delayed again. It probably won't see daylight till next
year. I'd call that a window of opportunity for Linux.

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO FIX PROBLEM WITH PROCOMM FOR DOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: You may have missed when you swung at the problem in your
June 26 Help Line answer concerning the user with the Procomm for
DOS problem. Procomm Plus for DOS will not run on a Pentium
200-megahertz or faster machine. Datastorm has a fix for the
problem at support.qdeck.com/files/fd2up0001.exe.html. This takes
you to a description page of the fix and a link to download the fix
itself. The page says to use the fix only for 200-megahertz Pentium
systems, but in its user group Quarterdeck says it works on
anything 200 megahertz and faster. Another fix is a utility called
MoSlo which will slow your computer to under 200 megahertz so
Procomm works without the patch. You can set it so when you run
Procomm, your system slows, then speeds back up when you exit. The
utility can also slow your system for older, speed-dependent games.
You can get a free copy at www.hpaa.com or spend $20 for the deluxe
version.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the information. However, I'll stick with my
suggestion that he move to a Windows-based version of Procomm. It
has more features, is easier and doesn't require crippling the
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read and saved your June 5 Help Line regarding the
naming of a Web site. I have created a brochure in Publisher 98 and
am in the process of converting it to HTML.
</P>
<P>
   Now my confusion. The company at which I work has an America
Online address and we have five mail boxes. When we build our Web
site and must give it a name, we had hopes of naming the site with
our company's name _ ourcompany.com. Your column suggests that the
only option open to us, namewise, is members.aol.com/ourcompany.
This name is cumbersome, to say the least, and not easily
remembered. If we use this service, is this the only option open to
us for a naming of the site? That leads to a second question
regarding the name: How do others (companies located worldwide)
access our Web site? In other words, what do they type in to read
about the services we offer? If they were to type in the
``search/find'' area some words, for example, ``technology
licensing chemical engineering,'' would we be one of the
suggestions listed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The America Online feature I described was its free Web
hosting service, available to all subscribers. However, if you are
a business and are willing to pay for more, you can get your own
Internet domain name and have it hosted by AOL. Do a keyword
PRIMEHOST to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   As far as others finding your Web site, you can start the
marketing process by adding it to search engines, such as Yahoo!,
Lycos, AltaVista and Hotbot. Each has a page that lets you enter
information about your site, though when it is posted varies. In
some cases, it may not get posted at all _ for example, Yahoo! can
be very selective about what is included in its indices.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the search engines themselves have automated
software robots that scour the Web in search of pages to add to
their databases. Of course, your page must be linked to another
page to be found.
</P>
<P>
   There are several sites on the Web that will take a Web site
listing submission and automate its transmission to multiple search
engines, usually for a fee. You can also download software that
will do it from your computer, such as at www.submissions.com. Some
Web site developers will also do this for you as part of their fee.
</P>
<P>
   You can place certain words on your home page that will cause it
to be pulled in a Web search. If you think potential customers will
use the words ``technology licensing chemical engineering,'' then
add them to the page. You can also add keywords that appear only in
your main page's source code to attract searches.

USB DEVICES ARE COOL, THAT IS, IF YOU CAN FIND ONE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you bought a personal computer in the past 12-18 months,
chances are that machine has at least one Universal Serial Bus
port, which is a new and, in theory, better way of connecting
devices to the system.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, as is always the case with new technology, is:
``Why should I care?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the IBM PC, users have gotten along just fine
with two basic ways of hooking things up _ the serial and parallel
ports. The problem with both of these port standards is that they
are dumb and slow.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Serial Bus, or USB, is supposed to fix that. It's
very fast, able to transmit data at speeds up to 12 megabits per
second. And it's relatively smart _ you can plug in a USB device
while a computer is on and it will be recognized instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98, released June 25, has built-in support for USB. And
the OSR2 version of Windows 95 can support USB with a software
add-on that's either on many new PCs or is available as a download
from Microsoft's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So if USB has been around for almost a year and a half, and
Windows has been able to support it for almost that long, why isn't
the Universal Serial Bus ... well, universal?
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues here.
</P>
<P>
   First, USB support in Windows 95 was a bit rough around the
edges. While it works, it's not as smooth as it should be. Windows
98 fixes that problem, because USB support is not an add-on; it's
built into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the companies that make devices that would plug into a
USB port are playing a chicken-or-egg game. They don't want to
start pumping out USB devices until they see more public
acceptance. But public acceptance won't come until consumers see
plenty of USB devices that fill their needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Intel Corp. in its early promotion of USB used to
cite Iomega's Zip drive as the perfect device to benefit from the
port's abilities. There's just one problem: Iomega executives say
they have no plans to introduce a USB version of the Zip until
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with some new USB devices on a computer, and I
have to admit that the technology is pretty cool. Yes, you can plug
a USB component into your computer while the machine is running
and, yes, Windows will install the drivers for it automagically.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you have the drivers installed for a device doesn't
mean it will work. A driver is a small software program that acts
as go-between for the computer and the device. You usually need a
more sophisticated software package to coax the device into
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some USB peripherals are simple enough that you can indeed
plug-and-go.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's new Natural Keyboard Elite _ a more compact version
of its popular ergonomic keyboard _ comes with both a PS/2 and USB
plug. When you use the latter, Windows finds the drivers, installs
them and you're ready to type.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a USB version of its Intellimouse, which has
a wheel _ situated between the left and right buttons _ that is
designed for scrolling through documents. Plug it in, and you can
immediately begin mousing. However, the wheel won't work until you
install a control panel that activates it and other additional
features.
</P>
<P>
   USB is being highly touted for use with scanners and digital
cameras. One of the features of Windows 98 is a built-in
image-receiving and -editing program called Imaging for Windows,
which was developed by Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Storm Technologies' new PageScan USB. Plug it in, and
you can immediately begin using it with the built-in software. But
Imaging for Windows is rudimentary _ if you want to do more, you'll
have to install the suite of software that comes with the Page- &QL; 
Scan.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the USB aspect works fine, but the supporting software
still gives you fits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera Pack for USB requires
a full suite of software to operate, even though Windows also loads
quite a few drivers when the camera is first plugged in. The camera
uses this software to grab still images and record video with
sound. Without the package, the hardware is useless.
</P>
<P>
   Although I had no problems with the USB aspect, my entire system
froze during the first reboot after installing all that software.
Only after downloading an update to the software did it work
flawlessly. So much for plug-and-play.

WEB CAMERAS SHOW WHAT'S GOING ON, NO MATTER HOW ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Heather Cocks   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Andrea Oakes likes to look at people when she
chats with them.
</P>
<P>
   So when she uses her computer to talk to Isaac Kishk over the
Internet, Oakes simultaneously visits his Web site, KazCam, to see
Kishk live and in person in his Austin home.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes can see Kishk through the watchful lens of his Web camera,
a palm-sized device that looks _ and works _ like an oversized
electronic eyeball. The camera is connected to Kishk's computer and
trained constantly on his bedroom, not unlike a real-life version
of the Jim Carrey hit movie ``The Truman Show.'' Every time a user
accesses the KazCam page, the camera snaps a photo and displays it
on the Web within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With KazCam, I know exactly who I'm talking to,'' Oakes said.
``It's hard to tell who is lying about who they are these days.
When you throw a computer into the mix, you're likely to be talking
to a 15-year-old kid instead of the 30-year-old businessman he told
you he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakes isn't the only one peeking at Kishk through his camera's
lens. This year alone, KazCam has logged more than 86,000 hits, or
requests for photos, and his Web site averages 473 hits per day _
be they from casual observers hoping he'll just wave or dedicated
voyeurs hoping he'll do a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really feels intrusive,'' said Kishk, 21, a former UT
student who works for Austin-based Illuminati Online, an Internet
service provider. ``I used to be in broadcasting back in high
school, so I see it as just another curious eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of curious eyes opening up around the globe is
growing rapidly _ and so is the use of Web cameras.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of growth of Web cameras can be found at the Web
site of EarthCam, where users can peruse a directory of national
and international sites like the KazCam, including several in
Austin. To travel farther, EarthCam's visitors are a click away
from photos of Times Square or action on Wimbledon's Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site has increased dramatically over the past two years,''
said Brian Cury, president of Hackensack, N.J.-based EarthCam,
which is chiefly a television production company. ``When we first
started the site, we added maybe one to three cameras a week. Now,
it's 10-20 cameras a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are self-proclaimed exhibitionists like Kishk, who don't
mind giving the world a window into their lives; others are
attracted to the technology and the range of possibilities it
brings. Mark Bryant, an economist with MCI Communications Corp.,
has a Web camera that snaps photos of him in his Austin home
office, something he said piqued his interest because of potential
practical uses for live Web photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents could use it to monitor their kids, or kids too sick
to go to school could still see what's happening in the
classroom,'' Bryant said. ``There are educational and practical
applications. Plus, you can see the world anytime, from the streets
of San Francisco to the canals in Holland.''
</P>
<P>
   And from there, to the Austin skyline. The local Fox Network
affiliate, KTBC-TV, puts a live picture of downtown Austin on its
Web page. The photo is updated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras and the software needed to run them start at $99 or
so at CompUSA. Both Bryant and Kishk opted to use high-speed ISDN
phone lines to connect to the Internet and upload the photos to
their Web pages, but ISDN lines aren't essential. Cury's company
has studied the Web camera market since August 1996, when EarthCam
created its online directory. As more Web camera pages crop up,
Cury predicts Web cameras' popularity will parallel that of the
video camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal Web cams are a big area for growth,'' he said. ``Just
think of how many millions of people now have video cameras,
compared to when they just started taking off. Right now, only
several thousand Web cameras are hooked up, but there's similar
potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Kishk _ like his audience _ is just having fun
with KazCam. Web users in the United Kingdom, Brazil and even Malta
_ along with a U.S. audience that includes government employees and
college students _ watch Kishk sit at his desk, leave his room or
even sleep with his teddy bear under a leopard-skin blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numerous requests to bare more of himself on-camera
_ including an invitation to play strip dreidel _ Kishk said he
doesn't bow to the pressure and tries to be careful about what the
camera captures.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't rule out playing a joke or two on his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wired it to my kitchen once,'' he said. ``I laid out a bagel
with cream cheese to rot. But I got grossed out after a couple days
and threw it out.''

 Packard Bell NEC Names Groupe Bull Exec as CEO  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC moved quickly Saturday to name Alain Couder
president and CEO following the abrupt resignation of its founder.
</P>
<P>
   Couder, a top executive of Groupe Bull, a major stakeholder in
Packard Bell NEC, replaces Beny Alagem, 45, who decided to leave
the PC maker Tuesday because of ``fundamental differences'' with
its shareholders, Groupe Bull and NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Couder said Alagem had not resigned under pressure from the
company's board of directors, but he wouldn't say more. Analysts
speculated that Alagem was ousted because he was unable to stem
losses, and one analyst said that health problems prompted Alagem
to leave. Alagem would not elaborate on his prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Couder, 52, is chief operating officer at Groupe Bull, a French
hardware and software-maker that owns 13 percent of
Sacramento-based Packard Bell NEC. NEC Corp. of Japan owns 49
percent of Packard Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The executive change comes as the company, known for its
low-cost personal computers, is trying to shore up its slipping
market share against rivals Dell, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the privately held company cut 400 jobs nationwide to
pare costs. Although company officials did not disclose figures,
they said Packard Bell has been losing money for ``a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the market share of Packard Bell, the world's
fifth-largest PC-maker, has fallen to 4.8 percent from 7.6 percent
in 1995, according to Dataquest, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells Packard Bell consumer PCs at retail stores and
NEC business PCs primarily through distributors and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   There was some confusion about when the new CEO will start work.
Couder, a French citizen who now lives in Paris, said he will
assume the role of president and chief executive of Packard Bell
NEC as soon as his visa is issued.
</P>
<P>
   But board members, who also appointed Couder to chair the
executive committee of the board, said in a statement they expect
Couder to start work by October 1, at the latest. The board did not
say who would run the company in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   ``One goal is to be profitable,'' Couder told reporters and
analysts during a conference call. Speaking in a heavy French
accent, he declined to be specific about his plans or when he
expected to get the company into the black.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants Packard Bell to be able to provide consulting
services along with its PC sales _ as its competitors do. He would
not discuss how he plans to build the services business, other than
to say he plans no acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Couder also was unable to say when an initial public offering _
planned for later this year _ would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Couder's operational experience at Groupe Bull,
which sells to business customers, could help Packard Bell as it
shifts its emphasis to the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   But they worried about his ability to build a vision for the
company. For example, other PC companies, such as Apple Computer
and Dell, benefit from a top executive who is seen as a visionary
and who can inspire workers. Couder, though, is a relative unknown
to U.S. analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the spark, the excitement for Packard Bell NEC going
forward?'' asked Bill Schaub, a PC analyst at Dataquest in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Alagem and his co-founders remain shareholders of Packard Bell
and currently own 25 percent. He will have no management role in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell was founded in 1986, when Alagem and two partners
bought rights to the name from Teledyne Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Alagem was given a chance by NEC and Groupe Bull to stay on as
chairman but declined. ``I decided I'd be happier in my own
venture,'' Alagem said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not named a new chairman.

 An Epiphany Brings Former Top KMPG Exec to Silicon Valley  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chauffeur used to drive Roger Siboni from his New Jersey home
each morning to his mid-Manhattan office, where he worked as chief
operating officer of the prestigious KPMG accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays Siboni is driving himself around Silicon Valley. Chalk
it up to the fact that at age 43, Siboni reached an Epiphany _
that's the name of the Palo Alto software firm he joins this month
as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trading salary and the trappings of power for equity,''
Siboni said.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphany sells a $250,000 software package that can extract
customer information from any database and pour it into a Web
browser. The idea is to let marketing people spot occasional
customers and turn them into big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Using software to pump up sales is a top priority for
corporations like Charles Schwab Corp., which has been using
Epiphany since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing on the market that I'm aware of that is as
powerful and as easy to use, and is also Web-accessible,'' said
Mary Kelley, vice president for database marketing at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for making Epiphany powerful and simple goes to
co-founders Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, and lead programmers Greg
Walsh and John McCaskey.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Siboni to sell this startup to the Fortune 500 by
drawing on personal relationships built up during two decades as a
high-profile KPMG consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Siboni is no stranger to the Valley. He started KPMG's high-tech
consulting practice in 1975, advising ancient firms such as
WordStar.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while COO at KPMG, Siboni took sides in the ``browser
wars'' when he handed a huge contract to Microsoft despite a
personal sales pitch from Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch in Palo Alto, Siboni said he's run into Barksdale
since then, and their cordial exchange convinced him that the
Netscape CEO hasn't held a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barksdale's such a big man, he probably doesn't mind
that Epiphany just hired Karen Richardson as its vice president of
sales, luring her away from a similar post at Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's only business in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Conspicuous absence: &LR;  House Speaker Newt Gingrich led a
delegation of congressional Republicans on a meet-and-greet tour of
Silicon Valleythis week, but local Representative Tom Campbell,
R.-Campbell, was not a member of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the hometowner was snubbed because he was on the
losing side of last summer's attempted Republican coup against the
Speaker? Whatever the cause, Campbell finds himself temporarily
frozen out of the GOP's effort to make sure Vice President Al Gore
doesn't walk away with Silicon Valley votes _ or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pay more attention here, and ask in return for more
attention to be paid to us,'' said Representative Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., who accompanied Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, who has spearheaded encryption legislation favored by
high-tech firms, was tapped by Gingrich to head a new Technology
Leadership Group that will bring Republicans in Congress together
with industry leaders like Cisco Vice President Judy Estrin,
Merrill Lynch investment banker Scott Ryles and Kleiner, Perkins
venture capitalist Floyd Kvamme.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; AOL's slippery slope? &LR;  Last week America Online shut down the
Web site of a member who had parodied several passages from the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The shut down was publicized by the Freedom Forum, a Virginia
foundation dedicated to newspaper and First Amendment issues. The
Forum said the site drew strong objections from Muslim academics in
Egypt and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley-based AOL watcher Dave Cassel said members at large
hardly noticed the flap. But Cassel questioned AOL's censorship
policy in light of the fact that a Texas Ku Klux Klan chapter has a
long-standing AOL page that advises visitors to prepare ``for the
coming disorder that will test the very survival of the White race
... (against the) jack booted Zionist Occupational Government.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said her firm received more than
1,000 complaints about the Koran site, and closed it after decided
it ``defamed a religious group.''
</P>
<P>
   She said AOL had received some complaints last year about the
KKK site last year, and AOL requested some changes to the page at
that time. But this year AOL has not heard any objections from
members and therefore has not taken any action against the page.
</P>
<P>
   The page is maintained by the Klan group that marched in Jasper,
Texas, last week, the town where a black man was killed by being
dragged behind a truck allegedly driven by several white men.
</P>
<P>

Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by phone
(650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 Lucent Plans Bell Labs Unit In Silicon Valley  
 By Jonathan Marshall   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Laboratories, the research arm of Lucent Technologies, is
opening a new branch in Silicon Valley, in part to foster Lucent's
local venture investments.
</P>
<P>
   The labs will house as many as 130 people at a new facility to
be completed next year in Stanford Research Park and will focus on
data networking, semiconductors, communications software, wireless
communications and optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   It also will supply expertise to Lucent Venture Partners, a $100
million fund the company announced in February to back startups
that complement Lucent's own development efforts. Many major
technology companies, including Microsoft and Intel, have similar
venture arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Labs will help identify and evaluate promising new
technologies,'' said Lucent spokesman Gary Bonham. ``The point
isn't simply to gain an equity position, but to have a hands-on
involvement to move the technology along. We'll give the startups
access to our business units and distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Venture Partners already has funded at least four new
companies, said John Hanley, its managing partner. He declined to
name the companies or report the level of investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley said the fund is working closely with half a dozen
other venture funds, including Accel Partners in Palo Alto and
Mayfield Fund and U.S. Venture Partners in Menlo Park, to identify
investment candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Fong, a general partner at Mayfield Fund, said Lucent
might use its venture fund to promote commercial development of
technology dreamed up at Bell Labs. And it could further attract
promising startups in the networking industry because Lucent is
widely viewed as a counterweight to networking goliath Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also said yesterday that Lucent Technologies Foundation
will contribute $2.6 million to endow a professorship and two
graduate fellowships at Stanford University to promote research and
teaching on communications networking.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has made several major acquisitions in the Bay Area
independent of its venture unit. Last year, it bought Octel
Communications, a Milpitas firm that makes unified messaging
software for corporate networks, for $1.8 billion. It also
purchased Livingston Enterprises in Pleasanton, a networking
company, for $650 million in stock. In February, it announced plans
to buy a wireless technology division of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bell Labs group will be led by Bill Coughran, head of
Lucent's Internet software research team, and Ron Schmidt, who left
the board of Bay Networks in April. Bay announced last month that
it was being acquired by Northern Telecom, a Lucent competitor in
the telecommunications equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new Bell Labs group will be housed with Lucent
Venture Partners on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, before both move
to the Stanford Research Park next year.

 Tech's High Flier Soars Again  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Clark already has founded two billion-dollar high-tech
companies, and if his latest startup takes off, he could make
Silicon Valley history.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent morning, he hardly looks like an executive at
the pinnacle of the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   His voice raspy from a nagging allergy and his gangly body
dulled by a late night of libations, Clark _ who co-founded
Netscape Communications Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc. and who
currently is shepherding another Internet company with big-time
potential _ is late for an interview and uncharacteristically
reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, let's get some coffee,'' he says, forcing out each
word. ``I need to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a latte at a Menlo Park cafe, he's as animated as some
of the splashy graphics that SGI brought to high-powered
workstations. Opinions and pronouncements rattle out like chat room
conversations on the Internet, the global communications network
which Netscape technology helped popularize.
</P>
<P>
   In a far-ranging, three-hour interview, the tall Texan expounds
on the Internet phenomenon, takes digs at former SGI chief
executive Ed McCracken (``an egomaniac who never looked me straight
in the eyes''), recounts his childhood in Plainview, Texas (``I
grew up in black and white''), discusses academia and politics, and
describes the art of the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impatience is a virtue,'' Clark said, explaining his
businessphilosophy. ``Entrepreneurship is about not being satisfied
with the way things are done and changing it. And (potential
entrepreneurs) better be interested in making money. If you're just
interested in passion, then go to your playpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 54, quit high school at 16 to join the Navy after a
series of hijinks _ including an unsuccessful attempt to smuggle
whiskey on a band trip _ got him suspended &UR; .  &LR; After hauling wheat
in Kansas and generally kicking around, he started college at 20
and eventually earned a doctorate in computer science from the
University of Utah in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job teaching computer science at theUniversity of
Santa Cruz but found it a disappointment. ``I thought it would be
an idealistic place to teach and walk in the redwoods,'' he said.
``Instead, there was a noses-in-the-clouds attitude that drove me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a more down-to-earth school, he went to teach at
Stanford University, met some computer science students and formed
SGI in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began one of the more remarkable hot streaks in the
high-tech business. In 1984, Clark brought in McCracken as CEO and
the Mountain View company went on to reshape computer-generated
graphics. Its workstations were used to create the special effects
in such movies as ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite SGI's early roaring success, Clark's strained, 10-year
relationship with the stoic McCracken resulted in some awkward
moments. Clark recalls one SGI executive meeting:
</P>
<P>
   ``My adolescent daughter couldn't pronounce his name, so she
used to call him Ed `McCrackle' or Ed `McMuffin,' Clark says. ``I
mentioned this, but Ed didn't find it amusing. He said, `It's not
funny to make fun of one's last name.' Meanwhile, everyone around
the table is trying to suppress their laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken says he doesn't remember the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is a really special, brilliant guy whom I respect a lot,''
said McCracken, who now is chairman of Prasad Project, a South
Fallsburg, N.Y., organization that provides health-care services to
low-income U.S. neighborhoods and developing countries. ``He's an
extrovert, and I'm a lot quieter. But differences are what make
great companies. SGI grew from nothing to a Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strengths of a good company like SGI is that you
have brilliant people who are on the edge,'' McCracken says in a
measured tone. ``That makes the pot more turbulent, and from
turbulence comes brilliance and good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken got most of the credit for SGI's success and took most
of the blame for its recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered by his clash with McCracken, Clark quit as SGI's
chairman in 1994 and sold all his stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, the self-described ``serial entrepreneur''
hooked up with browser whiz-kid Marc Andreessen to start Netscape,
which opened up the Web to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right startup at the right time,'' Clark said.
``The Internet was just taking off, and we blew out the doors with
our timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 18 months of its founding, Netscape went public amid much
hoopla and Clark's stock options were worth more than $1 billion.
He currently owns 16 million shares of Netscape stock, worth more
than $570 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's genius is looking at the intersection where the
technology is going and where the market will be in several
years,'' Andreessen said. ``On two occasions,he has gone from a
standing start to creating billion-dollar businesses. What's
interesting is how many more companies he has in him.''
</P>
<P>
   While remaining chairman of Netscape, Clark also is the
financial and intellectual force behind Healtheon Corp., which some
observers including Andreessen think could become Clark's third
multibillion-dollar startup.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company, rumored to be going public in the fall,
makes software that lets consumers manage their health benefits
online. The two-year-old company already has enlisted a long list
of health care providers, hospitals and pharmacies to adopt the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online health care (management) will emerge as one of the
low-hanging fruit industries on the Internet, along with selling
books and PCs,'' said analyst Mary Meeker, of Morgan Stanley in New
York. ``This is a market with huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has invested $16 million of his own moneyin Healtheon,
which is backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the same Menlo
Park venture-capital company that helped launch Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the only one to start two or more major companies
nationally,'' Clark said. ``Wayne Huizenga did it (with Waste
Management Systems and Blockbuster Entertainment). I can't think of
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's Midas touch has paid off handsomely. He estimates his
personal worth at $500 million to $750 million, give or take a few
million depending on the fortunes of Netscape stock.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also is penning a book, ``Netscape Time,'' which recounts
the launch of the Internet company, and is spending more time with
his family. He has two daughters, ages 33 and 28. He and wife,
Nancy Rudder, a journalist, divide their time between Palm Beach,
Fla., and Atherton, where Clark rents a house from his
grandchildren, ages 2 and 1, who own it.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Healtheon becomes viable, Clark's formidable
energies are shifting to yet another firm: Seascape Communications,
which he houses in a few hundred square feet on top of a Jenny
Craig Weight Loss Center in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The small software outfit is developing technology for his
latest ``passion'' _ a 156-foot sailboat, dubbed Hyperion, that
could redefine high-tech transportation. When completed in October,
the software program will control the boat's basic functions from a
bank of a dozen onboard computers.
</P>
<P>
   The luxurious boat is chock-full of amenities such as state
rooms, espresso machines, wine storage areas, library and
movie-viewing lounge. Clark said the price tag was in the ``low
eight figures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love creating companies,'' Clark said as he was noodling
with a software program he created for the boat. ``I come up with
an idea and then I let someone else run them.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he is running late for a helicopter lesson.
``Gotta go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, you get the impression that Clark, an ardent flier,
will be a world-class helicopter pilot in no time.

 Tall Texan's Big Words  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Clark has as many opinions about
the high-tech industry as he has startup ideas. A sampling of his
views:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On former Silicon Graphics Inc. CEO Ed McCracken: &LR;  ``He's a
Napoleon, a classic example of a massive egomaniac. Ed assumed he
was the reason for the company's success, but I fully blame the
current state of SGI on him.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Microsoft CEO Bill Gates: &LR;  ``A whole library can be written
about Bill Gates' business practices, but it can be distilled in
one sentence: He's a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   (A Microsoft spokeswoman responded: ``It is too bad that the
leader of a fine company would take business issues and make them
so personal.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Netscape Communications CEO Jim Barksdale: &LR;  ``Jim is like a
Confederate general. There's not too much idle talk, but the man is
a natural leader.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On At Home CEO and former SGI executive Tom Jermoluk: &LR; 
``Outgoing, gregarious, smart. He was the reason behind a lot of
SGI's success, not Ed McCracken.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On building a successful startup.  &LR; ``You can't be too
religious or wedded to your ideas. You have to adapt to keep
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On the Web-browser war. &LR;  ``If Microsoft beats Netscape, the
Internet will be dominated and governed by Microsoft. There will be
no stopping them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On mixing politics and high tech: &LR;  ``A waste of time. I don't
have the patience. It's hard to make things happen. I remember
testifying before the Senate in the late 1980s and being asked by
(then Senator Al Gore) and others about what we could do to start
an information superhighway. I told them it already exists. They
just needed to pave it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On the Internet. &LR;  ``It has become the standard form of
communication for every (computer) network in the world. The Net is
a massive revolution that has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Microsoft's Windows operating system. &LR;  ``I don't use
Windows, so I got that much going for me.''

IMPOTENCE PILL THE LATEST DRUG PEDDLED ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CARL T. HALL   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Viagra and the Internet appear to be ushering in
a new brand of high-tech drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in California and Colorado said Wednesday that they
are beginning investigations of an online pharmacy operation,
Performance Drugs Inc., which has been supplying Viagra and other
medicines through the Web without traditional prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations were prompted in part by inquiries from a
Chronicle reporter, who had ordered 10 tablets of Viagra, the
wildly popular new anti-impotence pill, and 10 doses of
``Stimula,'' a purported ``female erectile cream,'' through the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs is just one of a growing crop of Web-based
pill mills exploiting the phenomenal demand for Pfizer Inc.'s
impotence remedy. A record 2.5 million Viagra prescriptions have
been filled since the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has issued statements decrying loose prescribing of
Viagra _ a potentially dangerous medicine linked to 174 reports of
side effects and 31 deaths, although it's not clear whether the
drug itself or underlying health problems were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   However, the New York-based pharmaceutical giant conceded that
it has done nothing to stop questionable sales through the
Internet. Nor has the company been systematically monitoring the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said Internet sales appear to be legal in
many states, ``so there's not much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators said anyone, including the manufacturer, could
prompt an investigation simply by filing a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The pills received by The Chronicle appear to be genuine _
blue-colored, oblong tablets stamped with Pfizer's logo. The
newspaper is having the pills tested for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   To get them, the reporter was only required to fill out a short
``medical history'' online through an easy-to-find, well-promoted
Web site. Besides agreeing to a $99.50 charge on a credit card, he
also agreed to pay a $50 ``physician review charge'' for first-time
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The form did not ask whether the reporter was suffering from
impotence _ the only condition for which the Food and Drug
Administration has approved Viagra. He did not even have to reveal
his age or gender. No doctor or pharmacist contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   Since The Chronicle submitted its order, the online form has
been revised, and customers must now provide more detailed
information.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Performance Drugs were answered by Mike Takano, who
identified himself as president of Alliance Marketing in Seattle,
which he said has a partnership with Performance Drugs to handle
the phone calls and other business generated by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug company was founded by a Colorado physician,
Dr. Benjamin Taylor Johnson. Johnson, 31, is a 1994 graduate of
Creighton University in Nebraska who practices at a clinic in
Denver called the Center for Body Enhancement. Records of the
Colorado medical board indicate that Johnson has a valid license to
practice in that state and has no record of disciplinary action
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's name appeared on the drug packaging received by The
Chronicle as the prescribing doctor. He did not return repeated
telephone calls this week.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and regulators said it is bad practice, and possibly
illegal, for a doctor to order prescription drugs for patients he
has never met or examined. Nor does Johnson have a license to
prescribe medicine to someone in San Francisco, according to a
record check by the Medical Board of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely not legal unless there's a good-faith
examination by a doctor licensed to practice medicine in
California,'' said Doug Laue, deputy director of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, program administrator of the Colorado Board of
Medical Examiners, said, ``The board may have problems with what he
is doing and certainly we will be investigating that.'' Regulators
said the willy-nilly sale of Viagra and other prescription drugs
over the Web is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this on our radar screen,'' said Carmen Catizone,
executive director of the National Association of Boards of
Pharmacy, which is developing a ``seal of approval'' for Web sites
that follow what are considered sound guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against the law to dispense a prescription drug to
someone without a legitimate prescription,'' he said, adding that
filling prescriptions based only on Web questionnaires, without any
semblance of a patient-physician relationship, clearly will not
pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site in Wisconsin jumped on the Viagra bandwagon soon
after the drug was approved but promptly closed under pressure from
state medical authorities. Another site with a sponsor based in
Arizona also has apparently come and gone. In California, however,
officials said they had not looked into the matter until questioned
this week by The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   State telemedicine statutes and other provisions traditionally
allow physicians to conduct business over the phone or by fax, as
long as they exercise sound judgment and act in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors consider it good judgment to fill a telephone
prescription requested by someone they have not physically examined
before.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing Viagra prescriptions to total strangers, even if they
fill out detailed forms on the Internet, ``is not a good idea,''
said Dr. Tom Lue, a nationally known urologist on the faculty of
the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although Viagra is by far the main attraction, Web sites also
are advertising baldness treatments, female ``sexual enhancement''
creams and other drugs that usually cannot be purchased legally
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs, one of the more visible Viagra-peddlers on
the Internet, has made no secret of the business. The company even
issued a press release in May advertising ``worldwide access'' to
Viagra, even though the drug has been approved only in a few
countries outside the United States so far.
</P>
<P>
   Takano said the service is extremely popular with customers all
over the country. He declined to offer details other than saying
that the Web service has received no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   As for the legalities, Takano said the Web service employs
plenty of lawyers to make sure no laws are broken. Still, he added,
``this kind of falls into the frontier; it's in uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no real statutes for or against it,'' he said. ``We
meet with doctors. We pay doctors quite a bit of money to review
prescriptions. The doctors can reject every order if they want.
We're relying on the physician's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's Viagra-Stimula order was shipped by U.S. mail
from Pencol-Medisave Pharmacy, which listed a Denver address.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered a telephone request for an interview at the
pharmacy identified himself as Marshall Tobin. He initially refused
to answer any questions, and he ended the conversation shortly
after a reporter declined to grant him anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not in any jeopardy,'' Tobin said, claiming that he
did not know all the details about the Web supply operation when
The Chronicle reporter's order was filled.
</P>
<P>
   But he then added that he has since stopped filling such orders.
``It was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra still appears to be safe and effective when used as
intended, according to the FDA. The most serious known side effects
have been listed on the drug label since it was approved.
</P>
<P>
   One known risk is the strain that sexual activity could have on
newly potent men in poor health. The drug can trigger potentially
fatal drops in blood pressure in heart patients taking nitrate
drugs _ an increasingly common problem in emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's also potentially dangerous to combine Viagra with the
inhaled recreational nitrates known as ``poppers.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the demand for the drug, doctors say, is in
recreational use by men who are not impotent but seek to enhance
their sexual prowess, even though the drug evidently does nothing
for men who have no problems achieving erections. The pill also is
being tested by the manufacturer as a sexual aid for women.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities said the Viagra traffic on the Internet opens
the possibility that the drug will fall into the hands of children
or people refused prescriptions by their doctors, presumably for
fear of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about this,'' said Dr. James Winn,
executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards,
a Texas-based organization that advises state physician-licensing
agencies across the country. ``This is bad medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn's organization issued a memorandum last week warning state
medical boards about the Performance Drugs Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is ``technically not illegal,'' the memo stated,
but ``does raise flags about the quality of medicine being
practiced by physicians who have agreed to write prescriptions for
the individuals placing orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous gossip about what the medication might do for
normally functioning men _ or perhaps even women _ has prompted
phenomenal demand for the pills, even at $9 or more a pop.
</P>
<P>
   In some Bay Area neighborhoods, the pills can be had on the
street with little more difficulty than copping a bag of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said one San Francisco police investigator,
confirming that Viagra is being passed around in some bars for $20
or $30 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities noted that it's merely a misdemeanor to
possess prescription medications without a prescription. A felony
could be charged if large quantities are involved, but successful
prosecution would require showing intent to sell the drug _ and
that's not easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Food and Drug Administration step in. The agency has
no authority over how pharmacies and physicians use an approved
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Nightingale, associate FDA commissioner for health
affairs, said some Web sites may be treading on dangerous legal
ground, however, citing at least two past instances of a provider
being shut down by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has joined in a global effort through the World Health
Organization to reach effective cross-border agreements to monitor
pharmaceutical marketing in the online era.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several countries hope to reach agreements for a
cooperative program that would force pill mills out of business
wherever they might arise.
</P>
<P>
   The world health group has even adopted a resolution against
unlicensed cross-border sales of prescription drugs, although the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington
trade group, said WHO lacks authority to deal effectively with the
problem.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Wall Street is hot for Rambus' chip technology  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pay no attention to the soaring stock price of Rambus Inc.,
which has shot up 54 percent in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Tate, the president and chief executive of Mountain
View-based Rambus, shrugs off the rise as Wall Street's odd
response to ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to ignore the stock price when it goes up or down,''
said Tate, 43. ``When our stock price goes up, I am quick to remind
everybody here, `This is great, but don't think this means we got
smarter today. We're the same people we were before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rambus is an anomaly in many ways. In a chip industry that's
hitting a rocky spell, Rambus is on a roll. Rambus doesn't even
make anything; it licenses its technology to chipmakers, and
encourages computer makers to use chips made with Rambus
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a stock market that rewards companies for short-term
earnings, Rambus keeps its eye on the horizon. Yet unlike other
companies whose stocks levitate on promises of future profits _
firms like Yahoo and Amazon.com spring to mind _ Rambus operates in
the black, and has ever since its initial public offering last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should become one of the most profitable semiconductor
companies ever,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco. ``Its stock will probably hit
$150 in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambus was founded in 1990 by P.Michael Farmwald, a former chief
scientist at chipmaker MIPS Technologies, and Mark Horowitz, an
engineering professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   They recognized a bottleneck that was slowing down the
processing power of computers and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Intel made microprocessors run faster and faster,
but computers and game consoles couldn't take full advantage of
that speed because memory chips had not advanced at the same rate.
The system could only move as fast as the weakest link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Farmwald and Horowitz, who remain on Rambus's board of
directors, came up with a way to speed up the memory chips, and
they persuaded venture capitalists to invest $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was a start, but if Rambus was going to build these faster
memory chips, it would need a fabrication facility, and that would
cost a whopping $1billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contract with another foundry to build the chips,
Rambus chose what Tate calls a software model: It would license its
intellectual property to chipmakers, and collect a royalty every
time they sold a chip with Rambus technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small royalty on billions of dollars can mean big dollars to
a small business like us,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Even with the market for dynamic random access
memory chips _ known as DRAM _ in a prolonged slump because of an
oversupply, it's still a huge market. Tate said it has grown from
$10 billion in 1990 to $26 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most dire projections of the memory market going
forward are $15 billion,'' said Dataquest analyst Nathan Brookwood.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus has already signed deals with all of the major makers of
DRAM in the world, most of which are based in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has positioned their technology to become the next
standard for main memory used in PCs,'' said analyst Edelstone.
``Within the next five years, I expect that Rambus technology will
dominate the DRAM market.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, only 1 percent of DRAM chips manufactured use
Rambus technology, Tate said. Even in a shrinking market, if Rambus
doubles its market share to 2 percent, it rakes in a tidy sum.
``Small companies can grow through down cycles and up cycles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces no direct competition, although Tate notes
that the DRAM makers are trying to come up with their own standard.
</P>
<P>
   If memory vendors find their own way of making chips run faster
without infringing any of Rambus' 40 patents, the company could
face a tough fight, Dataquest's Brookwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Tate, a Canadian, came to Rambus after its founding. He had
already left his job as vice president in charge of chipmaker AMD's
microprocessor and logic group. ``I had left to run my own startup,
but this idea seemed even crazier,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, Tate said he never listened to his
mother very much, but he does recall her advice: ``Do what's fun.
If you aren't having fun, you aren't going to be good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's tried to instill that atmosphere at Rambus. The company
takes workers and their families to a baseball game every year.
Employees work hard, Tate said, but turnover is low, and ``there's
no perks for the hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   He runs an egalitarian operation, in which he works in a
cubicle, and doesn't even have a secretary _ or a better computer
than anyone else. He hopes to avert the bureaucratic underpinnings
of big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus went public in May 1997, again following what Tate
called &QL; 
``counter-intuitive'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective in going public was not to raise cash,'' he
said. ``We already had $30 million in the bank and a positive cash
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tate said, the company sought to reward employees who
had received much of their pay in stock options and were wondering,
``Is this paper ever going to be worth anything?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, being in the market raised Rambus's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The stock peaked in August at $86.50, but gradually fell to a
52-week low of $35.50 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't I buy that one when it was $35?'' analyst Brookwood
asked, somewhat rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   The stock began its latest ascent on June 22, when Rambus
announced that Santa Clara-based Intel, the world's largest
chipmaker, was testing Direct Rambus DRAMs made by Toshiba and LG
Semicon. In addition, personal computer makers Compaq and Dell
confirmed their intention to ship PCs using Direct Rambus next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody saw something, I assume, in the press release,'' Tate
said. ``It was just another milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock stampeded up, from $38.81 Friday, to $46.50 Monday, to
$57.25 Tuesday. It has stayed at roughly that level, or slightly
higher, in heavy trading since then.
</P>
<P>
   But Tate's eye is not on the ticker, and the analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to keep your eye on the longer term,'' said Morgan
Stanley's Edelstone. ``The revenues and earnings the company is
generating today will pale in comparison to what you can expect in
2003 and 2004.''

ZAPATA IN DEALS TO BUY 21 INTERNET PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been two months since Avram Glazer announced in
advertisements in national newspapers that he wanted to buy World
Wide Web sites. On Monday, Glazer and his Zapata Corp. will
disclose the results of his search: letters of intent to buy 21
properties and aggregate them under one site, www.Zap.com.
</P>
<P>
   The sites range from the search engine, Starting Point, to a
chat network, Chat Planet, to a variety of electronic commerce
offerings, including Bibliofind, Mass Music and Virtual Technology,
which sells computer equipment. Terms are not being disclosed, but
Glazer described them as ``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second step of Glazer's plan to make Zapata ``No. 1
or No. 2 on the Internet.'' The first step, taken in April, was
acquiring the online magazines Word and Charged.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquisitions were part of an announced new strategy for
the company, which was founded as an oil business in 1953 by a
young George Bush and more recently had concentrated on processing
protein extracted from fish and other sea life.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Glazer also made a play to purchase the Web search
service Excite, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer contends that the user traffic generated by the combined
sites he is acquiring would make Zap, ``among the top 10 largest
Internet sites in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Media Metrix, a Web measurement company, said Glazer's
numbers were not realistic. An analysis of the traffic of 15 of the
sites found that of all Web users, 2.1 percent, or just over
900,000 people, visited the sites in May.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Glazer said that once he grouped all the sites
together under the Zap.com domain, the audience for each site would
grow ``exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared his strategy to the so-called portals that companies
like Excite, Yahoo and Infoseek operate _ doorway services through
which users pass on their way to other Web sites.

the other portals don't have. It's a cross between a portal and
America Online.''

DVD LEADS RACE FOR MOVIE DISCS, FOR NOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The companies backing DVD, the CD-size digital disc
that contains a feature-length movie, are boasting a lot these
days, telling anyone who will listen that their product is selling
faster than either compact-disc players or VCRs did at the
corresponding points after they were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   By late June, a little more than a year after the introduction
of DVDs, manufacturers had sold nearly 600,000 DVD players. By
comparison, in March 1985, 16 months after the compact disc was
introduced, only 320,000 players had been sold. For VCRs in
September 1979, the number was 515,000.
</P>
<P>
   As pleased as equipment makers and Hollywood studio executives
are, some acknowledge that in some ways the achievement is hollow
because DVD is in a race for its survival, sprinting to gain a
significant foothold in American homes ahead of two headstrong
rivals. The odds of success are uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   One of the competitors is Divx, an upstart hybrid DVD format
that went on sale last month in two test markets, Richmond, Va.,
and San Francisco. A full-scale national introduction is scheduled
for September.
</P>
<P>
   But the other more important adversary is digital cable
television, which is expected to make picture-perfect, digital,
pay-per-view movies a ubiquitous feature in American homes within a
few years, said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video,
the largest distributor of DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a horse race, not just against Divx, but
against AT&AMP;T and TCI, against Comcast cable _ and the whole
migration to digital pay per view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc.,
the United States' second-largest cable company, for $31.8 billion.
One goal of the merged company is to bring pay-per-view movies on
demand to millions of homes. Comcast Corp. and other cable
companies have similar plans, as do some broadcasters, after
digital broadcasting begins in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberfarb fears that movies on demand will short-circuit the
sale of movies on discs. Why buy a DVD when you can dial up the
same movie on your television set whenever you want? The medium
will fail, he says, unless DVD is already an entrenched part of
family life, as VCRs are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have three years,'' he said. ``Three years from now
we need to be in 10 million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order, given that the industry has sold only
578,604 DVD players in the last 15 months, according to the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association. Initial industry
projections were that 800,000 DVD players would sell in the first
year.
</P>
<P>
   DVD originally stood for digital videodisc. But that name was
abandoned when the designers realized that the discs could be used
for computer files and audio recordings, too, offering seven times
the storage capacity of CD-ROMs and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the format is simply known as DVD. Though DVDs offer
high-resolution pictures and digital surround-sound, the format
faces its own daunting challenge: most Americans still know nothing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Video Software Dealers Association,
which backs the format, found that 62 percent of those surveyed in
May had never heard of DVD. The study did find some improvement; in
a similar survey a year ago, the number was 81 percent. In the
latest survey, Yankelovich Partners interviewed 1,938 people, all
of whom were at least 18 and owned a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally I think it shows that we are seeing an uptick in
consumer awareness,'' said Jeffrey Eves, association president.
</P>
<P>
   But Eves, Lieberfarb and many others worry that Divx (pronounced
DIV-ix) may stand in the way of further progress.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, a technology backed by the Circuit City chain of
electronics stores and a Los Angeles law firm, originally stood for
digital video express. But like DVD, the acronym has become the
name.
</P>
<P>
   Divx discs are DVDs with coding that allows them to be played
only once and only in special players. Zenith Corp. is making the
first player, which accommodates both Divx discs and regular DVDs
and sells for $499 _ a little more than the lowest-priced DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Each Divx disc costs $4.49, compared with about $25 for a DVD.
But if a viewer plays the Divx disc after an initial two-day
viewing period, the owner will be charged about $3. The accounting
is done by the Divx central computer, which is connected to the
Divx player by a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   When Circuit City announced the Divx concept last fall, it was
greeted with howls of vitriol from DVD supporters who complained
that the new format would confuse consumers and threaten the
success of DVD. Lieberfarb was among the most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints were so loud that some in the industry predicted
that Divx would never get off the ground _ especially because
Warner Bros. and a few other studios, including Columbia Tri-Star,
have refused to issue movies in the Divx format, fearing it would
undermine the success of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 7, Divx discs and players went on sale in 45 Circuit
City and Good Guys stores in Richmond and San Francisco. Circuit
City also began advertising Divx on television and in newspapers in
both places.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Home Video countered with a program to encourage video
stores in those two cities and three others to rent DVDs and DVD
players. The Yankelovich survey showed that most people wanted to
be able to rent DVDs just as they do videotapes. But video dealers
have been slow to stock the discs because few people own DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Divx and Warner sales programs are so new that neither
company is ready to release results, though Richard Sharp, chief
executive of Circuit City Stores Inc., dismissively said: ``We've
been in some of their stores, and they are offering only about 40
titles'' for rent.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp is able to do little better. As of Wednesday, only 45
movies were available in the Divx format. Sharp predicts the total
will be 400 by the end of the year. By comparison, 1,400 movies
were available on DVD on July 1; 180 of those were issued in June
alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Divx players go on sale nationally this fall, Circuit City
plans to begin a $100 million advertising campaign. Warner,
meanwhile, says it will offer its DVD rental program nationally in
the fall as well, though Lieberfarb said Warner and allied
companies would spend considerably less than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Divx, like DVD, must gain a foothold before
pay-per-view services proliferate. Sharp agrees but says he has
five years before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp predicts that Divx will succeed because the concept offers
several advantages that his research indicates consumers
appreciate. Chief among them is that for about the cost of renting
a videotape, a Divx buyer can take a disc home and keep it,
eliminating return trips to the video store and late fees.
</P>
<P>
   But those two attributes have turned out to be liabilities as
well. The nation's video-rental dealers hate Divx. ``It undermines
the entire business'' by reducing traffic in the stores, Eves said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no video store has agreed to sell Divx discs. They
can be bought only at at Circuit City and Good Guys stores and the
Divx site on the Internet at www.divx.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a kind of chicken-and-egg problem,'' Sharp said.
``In time, I think the power of the Divx format will overpower
this.''

SOFTWARE PIRACY AND A RETRACTED RELEASE 
 BUYING CARS ONLINE WITH `REASONABLE OFFERS' 
A WINDOWLESS LINE OF COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SOFTWARE PIRACY AND A RETRACTED RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   The Software Publishers Association got a little ahead of itself
last week in promoting its efforts to crack down on software
piracy. Last Monday, it sent out a two-page press release
indicating that it had reached an out-of-court settlement for
$150,000 with a New Jersey medical supply company. The release
stated that the company, Edison-based International Technidyne
Corp., agreed that it had used unlicensed or pirated software from
23 of the association's companies.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one catch: The company had agreed to settle, but
not to have the settlement disclosed. Hours after the release went
out, company lawyers called the Software Publishers Association and
demanded a retraction. The trade group acquiesced, distributing a
new release, which read in its entirety:
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today the Software Publishers Association (SPA) issued
a press release entitled `Software Piracy Costs NJ Firm $150,000.'
SPA retracts the release. Neither SPA nor the company concerned
will now comment publicly. SPA apologizes for any inconvenience
this may have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   David Phelps, a spokesman for the Software Publishers, explained
afterward that the organization had been eager to get its latest
victory to the press. ``As a good PR department, we wanted to get
the news out,'' Phelps said, but ``we didn't look closely enough''
at the settlement agreement. ``We've got to take our licks on this
one,'' he said, adding that the trade group will be more cautious
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The association has good reason to highlight its victories. For
one, it needs to justify its existence to some 1,200 members,
including most of the major software makers in the United States.
Less cynically, it hopes to drive home the message that it will
pursue and audit companies that don't pay for the software they
use.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Feldman, president of International Technidyne, had little
to say on the matter. ``We feel bound by the confidentiality
agreement,'' Feldman said. ``We're surprised to have to comment on
this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   BUYING CARS ONLINE WITH `REASONABLE OFFERS'
</P>
<P>
   Will car dealers be more willing than airlines to leap at
dollars dangled under their noses?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question facing Priceline, an Internet service that
is meant to let consumers buy things by making ``reasonable
offers'' that sellers can choose whether to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's first service, for air tickets, met a chilly
response from airlines, which do not want to undercut their high
last-minute fares for business travelers by letting customers
propose their own discounted offers. Only a few domestic airlines
have agreed to participate, and so Priceline can fill only about a
quarter of customer offers, which must be within 15 percent of the
lowest published fare.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Priceline plans to introduce a car-buying service
with fewer restrictions than its airline service, and it may have a
better chance of acceptance among the many highly competitive car
dealers. In essence, consumers log on to Priceline.com and specify
the cars they are looking for along with the options and colors
they would accept, and the price they will pay. These offers are
sent by fax to every car dealer within the region specified by the
buyer. The first dealer to call and accept the bid sells the car.
Dealers can also submit a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   In existing online car buying services, like Autoweb, Carpoint
and Autobytel, customers enter the car they want. Then, typically,
one dealer calls them back to name a price and try to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about our service is that you never talk to a
car salesman,'' said Jay Walker, Priceline's chairman. ``You show
up with your check and you drive the car home.''
</P>
<P>
   A WINDOWLESS LINE OF COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   As a market test, Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology
recently tried to order a personal computer from a dozen companies
without Microsoft's Windows as the operating system. No luck,
reported David Chun, the Nader summer intern who made the calls to
Dell Computer, Gateway, IBM and others _ not even when he asked for
a PC with no operating system at all.
</P>
<P>
   He should have called VA Research in Mountain View, Calif. The
upstart computer maker specializes in machines that run Linux, a
freeware version of the Unix operating system. Linux (pronounced
(LINN-uks) originated in 1991, written by a young Finnish
programmer, Linus Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   VA Research began in 1993 as a part-time venture for Larry
Augustin, then working on his doctorate in electrical engineering
at Stanford University. He could not afford a costly Sun
Microsystems work station, so he decided to build his own
high-powered machine, using Linux and off-the-shelf hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Linux has become a more mainstream operating system,
and VA Research is beginning to take off, but Augustin, 35,
declines to disclose revenues for the private company. VA
Research's machines start at $1,500, but the line extends to server
models that can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Its customers
include Southwestern Bell, a unit of SBC Communications Inc., which
uses the Linux machines in its call-processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   Linux users worldwide now number about 6 million, tiny compared
with the more than 300 million for Windows. Still, as Augustin sees
it: ``Microsoft is always going to get its share. But Linux does
have a future as a genuine alternative to Windows.''

THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET: ONE PIECE OR MANY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. by
AT&AMP;T was almost as full of unlikely promises as the cable giant's
notoriously unfulfilled plans to merge with the Bell Atlantic Corp.
in 1993, the reaction of the news media has matured. The former
frenzy has given way to the kind of skepticism that only five years
of Internet-driven market chaos could have inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not much has been said about how the deal will affect
one of the most vibrant new industries that now finds itself
directly in AT&AMP;T's path: the largely local, independent Internet
service providers, or ISP's.
</P>
<P>
   The service provider industry includes more than 4,000
companies, according to Boardwatch Magazine, each of which serves
as a gateway to the global Internet and all of which, in concert,
transfer trillions of bits of data around the world every day.
</P>
<P>
   Service providers range from tiny companies serving a couple of
hundred customers to the gargantuan Worldcom Inc., which owns three
of the largest such services _ Uunet, ANS and the network services
of Compuserve _ and also controls the biggest portion of the
``Internet backbone,'' the high-speed, high-capacity fiber optic
cables, routers and national access points to which smaller service
providers are connected.
</P>
<P>
   The service provider industry is already being consolidated.
Even before the AT&AMP;T deal, it had been expected to shrink to as few
as 100 companies over the next three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever other impact consolidation might have, as more control
of Internet access moves into the hands of fewer and larger
companies, there is a growing fear among industry watchers that the
larger, more powerful access providers may end up tearing the
Internet to pieces in a competitive frenzy of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Small access providers lease connections from larger ones and
from backbone owners. Because no single company or group owns or
controls the Internet, these competing access providers move data
over the global network by a cooperative arrangement called
peering, whereby they agree to send one another's data through
their own networks without charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird business, where companies compete and cooperate
at the same time,'' said Bill McCarthy, managing editor of
Boardwatch, which follows the Internet access industry and
publishes a directory of access providers twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is not among the analysts who think that AT&AMP;T's new
push into the consumer Internet market via At Home, the high-speed
cable modem business owned in part by TCI, will mortally wound
smaller access providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them don't want to deal with consumers anyhow,'' he
said, and those who do will be compelled to provide a higher level
of customer hand-holding than big companies are willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy is more wary of another possible outcome of a
further consolidation of Internet access into a few large
companies: that for the sake of competition, big access providers
will stop cooperating with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear is that if one company decides not to peer with
other networks, then you no longer have an Internet,'' McCarthy
said. ``You have separate networks, connected to one company's
infrastructure but not to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's point of view, though not necessarily his degree of
concern, is shared by one of the founding fathers of the Internet,
Robert Kahn, who helped develop the set of protocols, or computer
communication rules, that gave birth to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until the commercial Internet was born, Kahn said, there was
always a way to ``bootstrap'' everyone to the same level of
service. Everyone can send and receive e-mail, for example, and get
files and Web pages using standard Internet protocols.
</P>
<P>
   But when a big access provider starts to provide enhanced,
proprietary services _ ``like Internet video, for an extreme
example,'' he said _ it creates a fragmentation that until now was
unheard of on today's largely homogenous Internet and World Wide
Web. In fact, it would return us to the kind of America Online,
Compuserve and Prodigy models that existed before the Internet
became the great digital melting pot _ islands of on-line services
that were incapable of interaction with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be a stupid thing to do by our measure,'' McCarthy
acknowledged. ``Breaking up the Internet would defeat the
purpose.'' But he added, `` `Stupid' doesn't mean it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn is relatively circumspect about such a trend. ``There's so
much in flux today that what you think is today's problem might
look like ancient history,'' he said. ``These are serious issues,
but you have to keep them in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But for McCarthy, solving today's problem _ especially regarding
access providers and peering _ is crucial for tomorrow's Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm AT&AMP;T and you've got a little $20,000 network, why
should I allow you to use my network for free, rather than be my
customer?'' he said. ``But by allowing me to choose which role you
play, I can literally choose my competitors and create a role for
myself as a dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   This rather remarkable ability could become a cause for alarm
if, as McCarthy asserts, all access providers, big and small, are
moving in the same strategic direction as Worldcom and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all trying to provide the complete digital pipe so you
can get all your services _ local telephone, long distance, Web
services, video, and any other data services you might need _ all
at once,'' he said. ``With that in mind, the industry had better
set down some rules about this, or the government will do it for
them.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some dare call it electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A major consumer products company logged 264,000 telephone calls
to its customer service center in a recent month and handled
225,000 in what it considered satisfactory fashion _ a ``close''
rate of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And during the same period, the center's service representative
received about 20,000 customer e-mail messages via the Internet.
Just 2,000 _ a measly 10 percent _ received attentive replies, and
some not for several weeks. (This data was shared on the condition
that the company not be identified.)
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to the Web as black hole.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce? One-to-one communication? The promise of these
buzzwords is belied by simple reality: Many companies, even those
with a seemingly sophisticated presence on the World Wide Web,
continue to treat customer e-mail as second-class communication.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence and some limited market research confirm that
unless a company is a Web-based business to start with, like the
online bookseller Amazon.com, the organization is likely to lack
the tools and policies to handle the inflow of messages from its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies go on the Web they tend to immediately get
overwhelmed by messages,'' said Donna Hoffman, an associate
professor at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt
University. ``But some still don't see handling this e-mail as one
of the most important customer service jobs. They haven't created
the proper policies or allocated the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the director of an influential research program that
studies the marketing implications of commercializing the Web,
finds it disturbing that her own frequent messages to commercial
sites almost never result in a response. Web users may lose trust
in the medium if their experience is similar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey earlier this year by First Data Investor
Services Group, which supplies transaction services to mutual fund
companies, 82 percent of the mutual fund Web sites it tracks
advertise themselves as offering customer service via e-mail. Yet
when First Data tried to measure how long it took each site to
respond to e-mail, it found that about 30 percent of customer
messages never got any response.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's unscientific spot check of the consumer-contact
e-mail addresses on the Web sites of two dozen well-known,
consumer-focused corporations did not fare much better: Only seven
of the sites responded in less than 24 hours, and five of the
companies never replied.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies that did reply _ though it took a couple of
days _ was Nike, a company known for its marketing prowess. Even
though it is not a big online retailer, Nike sees sufficient value
in the more than 2,000 e-mail messages its site receives daily that
the company has devised extensive procedures for handling the
volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some forward-looking companies there is a realization that
you don't get to hear from customers often _ that you should
treasure it and find a way to deal with every e-mail,'' said Martha
Rogers, a partner at Peppers &AMP; Rogers Group in Stamford, Conn., a
consulting firm that focuses on ``one to one'' marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by Forrester Research was based on interviews
with 37 companies that Forrester selected as especially intent on
customer e-mail. Even among those companies, which average 500
incoming e-mails a day, dealing with the deluge can be confusing,
with responsibility split among departments. And most of the
companies sampled still manually route messages _ despite being
aware of automation tools that would speed the process.
</P>
<P>
   One such technology for automating customer e-mail is Echomail
from General Interactive Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. Echomail uses
natural-language and ``discourse analysis'' software to parse
messages in an attempt to classify them as, say, a complaint, a
sales lead or an investor inquiry. In some cases automated
responses may be sent, but most messages are typically routed to
customer-service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Echomail users include Nike, IBM, AT&AMP;T, Lycos, J.C. Penney and
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before someone puts in our system,'' said V.A. Shiva,
president and chief executive of General Interactive, ``we ask
them, `Do you value e-mail? Do you have policies and processes for
handling this inflow? Whose responsibility is this mail, marketing
or customer service or someone else? What happens to a message, for
instance, if it hasn't been read in five days?'''
</P>
<P>
   Shiva added that the slow adoption of systems to handle incoming
e-mail had ``a lot to do with technology but also with process and
elevation of consciousness _ even politics going on within
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is probably a consideration, too, since such systems often
sell for $200,000 or more, according to Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   Shiva and other industry executives say that companies could
often create smarter customer-contact pages on their Web sites that
would greatly simplify e-mail management. An increasing number of
corporate sites ask _ or even require _ customers to complete a Web
form rather than send a free-form message. Even though some might
find the templates intimidating or off-putting, the consumers who
do proceed will be providing information that makes it easier for
the company to route and respond to the message.
</P>
<P>
   At the leading edge of managing customer e-mail are companies
that have trained their phone agents to handle e-mail, too,
treating it as simply another type of customer communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A science has built up around handling 800-number calls after
all these years, but on the Web we are only recently seeing those
disciplines applied to handling customer e-mail,'' said Don
Morrison, executive vice president of Chordiant Software Inc. in
Palo Alto, Calif., a provider of customer-interaction technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morrison points out that some messages, like those
involving order confirmations or complex instructions, are better
handled by e-mail than phone calls.

<P>
   In fact, the discount stockbroker Charles Schwab is actively
trying to increase the percentage of customer queries handled by
e-mail rather than by phone, said Paul Raskin, director of Schwab's
electronic brokerage services unit. E-mail now accounts for
one-third of customer inquiries to the unit, up from one-tenth two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of a consumer-focused company that has
increasingly moved its business online, Schwab was quick to
recognize the value of customer messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actively promote e-mail as a customer-service channel,''
and electronic brokerage services receives up to 15,000 electronic
messages a week, Raskin said. About a quarter of the 300 service
agents that Raskin has working at any one time are devoted to
handling e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, like most companies that deal with consumer e-mail, is
reluctant to send out automated responses.
</P>
<P>
   With automated responses the human aspect is lost, Hoffman said,
``and that goes against the whole idea of trying to create the
appearance of a personal relationship'' online.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that do use boilerplate replies tend to reserve
them for only the most common questions _ as Nike, does, for
example, with queries about the location of the nearest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   One significant exception is Lycos, the Web-searching service.
With only two customer-service representatives, Lycos uses
Echomail's automated response capability to handle the majority of
its incoming messages _ most of which have to do with the listings
and navigation on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' experience with Echomail's parsing capabilities has been
positive, with 80 percent or more of the responses being
appropriate replies to the queries, said Adam Gross, a senior
customer-service representative for the company. Among the 20
percent of inapplicable responses was one to a reporter's spot
check. A question asking how to use Lycos to count the number of
sites on the Web that are linked to a specific home page was
answered with, ``We appreciate your desire to place a link to
Lycos,'' and instructions on how to link a home page to the
service.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of automated responses can be a sensitive issue.
Although the system is able to reply automatically within five
minutes, Gross has set it to respond at a more human pace _ within
12 hours. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the response comes right away, the customer may discount it
as just a machine talking,'' Gross said. ``Even if the answer is
full and correct, they'll view it with disdain.''

RURAL AREA'S CYBER REVOLUTION CREATES A BOOM WITHOUT URBAN STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANASTASIA HENDRIX   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUALALA, Calif. _ At their remote seaside cafe on the rugged
Mendocino coast, owners Pat Kelly and Bonnie Simons take turns
pouring coffee, scooping ice cream and _ during the lulls _ solving
the year 2000 computer problem for a $2 million software
development company 115 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the two San Francisco software executives packed
their attache cases and quit the city life, but not their corporate
careers. Now instead of commuting through crowds to the 14th floor
of a high-rise office building, they simply slip behind a blue
curtain that separates the front of the cafe from the office in
back.
</P>
<P>
   There, from a laptop in the tiny town of Gualala, they make a
comfortable living writing technical manuals and programs for the
Forecross Corp., all while realizing their dream of living on
California's beautiful northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can even watch the whales go by while we work,'' Simons
said, sipping fresh coffee from a mug.
</P>
<P>
   Simons and Kelly are among those who have swapped their suits
for sweat shirts, their mega-mainframe systems for portable word
processors and headed to this 80-mile stretch of craggy coastline
to work by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Locals have dubbed the area reaching from Jenner to Mendocino
``Silicon Coast,'' and boast that there are more computer users per
capita here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Though no scientific data exist, a recent survey by the Coast PC
Users Group found that about 3,600 computers are in use in the
region, an area with about 6,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Another report compiled by the Mendocino Unified School District
showed that more than half the students in grades four through 12
use the Internet at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're just a bunch of country bumpkins out here,
but this is one of the most extraordinarily technical groups of
people anywhere,'' said Marshall Sayegh, 48, a former construction
supervisor who now creates business Web sites and technology links
from his home in Gualala.
</P>
<P>
   It won't take long, he hopes, for the virtual world to rebuild
the real economy along the Northern California coast, which has
declined with the faltering fishing and timber industries and made
residents heavily reliant on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It all became possible just four years ago, after the Mendocino
Unified School District decided to go into business as the area's
only local-access Internet service provider by making its
cyber-connection publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Students had been able to use the Internet at school after NASA
paid for a dedicated phone line installed directly to the Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, which allowed them to reach the
World Wide Web without getting tangled in expensive long-distance
phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   The grant expired, but interest in Internet access was
flourishing. And though it was enormously expensive and risky,
``everyone saw the power and the potential in it,'' said Mitch
Sprague, an English teacher who spearheaded Mendocino High School's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Mendocino Community Network (mcn.org) has 2,500
subscribers and is the heart of the cyber revolution under way
along the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked in a small room tacked on to a class at the high school
_ its walls still unpainted and the wooden beams exposed _
expensive computer components fill three floor-to-ceiling columns.
</P>
<P>
   From behind the glass-paneled doors that protect them, green
lights blink as modems from Cuffy Cove to Schooner Gulch and miles
all around log on to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stacks of equipment are miles of bundled, intertwined
wires and telephone cords running along the walls, under the desks
and on the floor. The hum of the monitors and the buzz of fans used
to keep the equipment cool drone in the background as staffers on
headsets answer calls and questions from the network of people who
have come to depend on mcn.org as their lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have students who live in houses without electricity
that are now connected to the Internet,'' teacher Deena Zarlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   They boot up with the help of wind or solar-powered systems,
12-volt batteries or propane generators to access anything and
everything just like their urban peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a tremendous amount of access to experiences,
people and resources that just wasn't possible before,'' said
Zarlin, who lives three miles off a dirt road half a mile from her
nearest neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, sometimes I'm even e-mailing while video
conferencing,'' she said. ``Now that's country living!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are hundreds of examples of how the Internet has changed
life in this picturesque, isolated terrain, said Jim Heid, who
hosts ``Point and Click Radio,'' a weekly computer talk show
simultaneously broadcast on the local public radio and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There's the construction worker in Fort Bragg who linked up,
found his true love in cyberspace and is now happily married; the
woman who used the Internet to trace long lost relatives and
arrange a reunion in Europe and the grandmother who gushed with
excitement when talking about sending and receiving e-mail to her
brood scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a camera pointed outside my window that snaps a live
picture every five minutes (and posts it on my Web site), and a lot
of people tell me they check my weather cam before coming to the
coast so they can determine whether or not they need to wear a
sweater,'' Heid said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is business that is really booming, and not just for the
newcomers who bring their computer savvy to Silicon Coast. Internet
commerce has transformed some longtime locals, like Mickie Zekley,
into such successes that they've become hometown heroes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 25 years Zekley eked out a modest living in his
small shop in Mendocino that sells rare and exotic musical
instruments. Offerings at Lark in the Morning include flutes made
of turkey leg bones ($170) and 17th-century monkey grinder organs
from Germany than cost as much as $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Zekley began writing the computer program to
put his catalog on the Internet. Though the chore was difficult, it
has transformed his store into a million-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been phenomenal,'' he said. ``We used to send out
maybe 30 to 50 catalogs a week, now we mail out at least 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And his client list has grown from 2,000 names to more than
180,000, he said.

POWERBOOKS GIVE MACINTOSH CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest gathering of Apple Macintosh fans on the East Coast
begins Wednesday in New York, and they have several reasons to be
optimistic after more than a year of darkness and turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Led by co-founder Steve Jobs, Apple appears to have stabilized
its management team, cut costs, made some money, halted a
precipitous decline in market share, outlined (at last) a clear
path for its Mac operating system, and streamlined and
reinvigorated its product lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The company is not out of the woods yet, of course. Apple's
decision last year to kill the Macintosh clone market may have
boosted Apple's financial prospects, but it was of no benefit to
consumers and it contributed to the overall decline in market share
for the Macintosh operating system. (Even the Palm Pilot operating
system and Windows 3.1 outsold the Mac OS last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the most recent customer-loyalty survey by the research
group ZD Market Intelligence, which measures the percentage of
computer owners who say they would buy the same brand again,
determined that Apple had lost its perennial perch in first place.
Apple slid to third, behind Gateway and the surprisingly strong
Hewlett-Packard. Apple's decline was most pronounced in the
home-computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, having the third-highest level of customer satisfaction
among more than 200 computer companies is an admirable achievement.
Apple executives say the company has a plan to win back the
affection, and dollars, of the home and small-business market.
Perhaps their strategy will be revealed this week at the Macworld
conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best reasons for optimism among the Macintosh
faithful is the new Macintosh Powerbook G3, which comes in a
variety of configurations and prices ranging from $2,300 to more
than $6,000. Along with the Jetsons-style iMac that is to go on
sale next month, the Powerbook G3 is tangible evidence that Apple
has regained its flair as a leader in innovative computer design.
</P>
<P>
   Big and beautiful, the Powerbook G3 is perhaps the first
portable computer that warrants being called sensual. With its
not-so-subtle curves and a mixture of textures, including one that
feels vaguely like rubber and evokes flesh, the Macintosh Powerbook
G3 is the most distinctive notebook on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But visual and tactile appeal are not the Powerbook G3's only
strengths. It also has brains. In the case of the top models in the
new Powerbook G3 line there is enough processing power to persuade
some Macintosh users to consider it as a replacement for their
desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple boasts that its Power PC G3 RISC-based notebooks will
outperform any Intel Pentium II-based notebooks, and many Pentium
desktop computers as well. Reviewers confirm that in most cases the
Powerbooks clobber the competition.
</P>
<P>
   We tested an upper-middle-of-the-line model, which was built
around a 250-MHz Power PC chip, a 13.3-inch active matrix XGA color
display, 32 megabytes of SDRAM memory, 4MB of special graphics
memory, a 4-gigabyte hard disk drive, removable CD-ROM and diskette
drives, a 56K internal modem, and a lithium-ion battery. It was
built in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   All of the new Powerbooks are substantially larger than the
earlier Powerbooks they replaced _ at least an inch deeper and
wider. (The new Powerbook G3 is not to be confused with Apple's old
Powerbook G3, which was smaller, less powerful and less
distinctively styled. Why Apple chose to recycle the name is one of
the company's many mysteries.) The weight, between 7.5 and 8 pounds
when fully tricked out, remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   The size and weight disqualify the Powerbook G3 as a good choice
for road warriors who plan to lug the computer around all day and
work while sitting in coach. (Is there such a thing as shoulder
tunnel syndrome?)
</P>
<P>
   It just will not fit on a standard airline fold-down tray. So
put a pillow on your lap and make it a true laptop, upgrade
yourself to first class _ if you can afford the $6,000 version, it
deserves to be shown off up front anyway _ or put the computer away
and relax.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Powerbook's formidable size means it is
more acceptable as a desktop-computer replacement. The keyboard is
quite nice, with good key touch and spacing. And then there is the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the dismal, 12.1-inch, passive-matrix screen of the
cheapest, 233-MHz Powerbook, unless your budget has no flexibility.
The larger screens of the Powerbook line, including the 13.3-inch
model we tested and the practically cinematic 14.1-inch model, are
very impressive and worth the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a larger viewing area, they come with added
video memory and a graphics accelerator, and a superior resolution
of 1,024 by 768 pixels (XGA). Powerbooks with the larger screens
also have higher-resolution S-video output, which allows
computer-generated graphics to be sent to S-video-equipped TV sets,
VCRs and camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The Powerbooks are most impressive at the high end of the line,
including the 250-MHz and 292-MHz models. Both of these have faster
internal data pathways (an 83-MHz system bus, in geek parlance) and
a further booster rocket called a 1MB backside cache, features that
are lacking on the slower Powerbook.
</P>
<P>
   But as strong as the new Powerbook G3 models are, they are
unlikely on their own merits to entice longtime Windows users to
convert to the superior Macintosh operating system. Apple could
score more points, and increase the chances of winning back
customers who have defected to the Microsoft monopoly, by including
Windows emulation software as standard equipment on its Powerbooks.
</P>
<P>
   So Apple now has a strong lineup on the top decks of its product
line, with its G3-based desktop and Powerbook machines. Now it
faces the tough challenge of winning back customers at the low end,
where it lacks compelling products. On Wednesday, Apple will begin
the campaign to promote the G3-based iMac, which the company calls
the most revolutionary Macintosh since, well, the Macintosh itself.

WebMentors turn tables, tutor own teachers 
By Mark Fisher  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Throughout the summer, University of Dayton
professors are inviting a select group of University of Dayton
students into their offices for lengthy, one-on-one instructional
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely and you'll hear the usual professorial lecturing
about the importance of thorough understanding of the subject
matter coupled with quiet reassurances that there are no dumb
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But wait . . . these personal tutorials have a twist. The
students are the teachers, the teachers the students.
</P>
<P>
   UD wants to make sure all of its professors develop enough
computer know-how to be able to build and maintain their own World
Wide Web pages as the school prepares to wire up its students,
faculty and staff into what it calls a ``Learning Village.'' And
who better to teach its teachers than Web-savvy UD students who
have grown up with computers?
</P>
<P>
   Thus the ``WebMentors'' program was born. Seven students adept
in the intricacies of the Internet and Web have trained 50 UD
faculty and staff since last fall. The university pays the
WebMentor students for their efforts but does not charge UD
employees for the training.
</P>
<P>
   WebMentor Bill Rombach, a 21-year-old accounting and finance
student, said he was a little worried about whether faculty members
would be reluctant to take instruction from a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way it has turned out, a lot of the faculty are
completely eager to learn,'' Rombach said. ``It's refreshing to see
professors excited about learning from students.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no hand-holding, Rombach said. ``We put our hand on
their shoulders, but we let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rombach's pupils, Father John McGrath, S.M., assistant
professor of religious studies at UD, recognizes the benefits of
the new technology. During a recent session between the two, the
conversation focused on icons, HTML directories, Netscape software
and double-clicks-versus-single-clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more way to reach students and help them
learn,'' McGrath said after his training session. ``There is an
element of creativity to it that makes it exciting and leaves a lot
to students' own initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The role-reversal aspect of the WebMentors program carries its
own benefits for faculty members, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us,'' he said. ``We get a better understanding
of how students feel.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and his colleagues who receive training agree to three
conditions: they must be willing to learn, keep their Web sites
fresh and updated and share their Web knowledge with colleagues.
McGrath, who has worked with a computer in his classes for eight
years, says he's eager to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I had this when I prepared my doctoral thesis. . . ``
he said.

TechnoBuddy: Cyber-friends aside, don't forget virtue of real
friends 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sweet and single Teresa is really a burly truck driver
named David from Montana, married, with tattoos and kids. And the
wealthy neurosurgeon you met last night is a lonely schoolteacher
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Let's chat about chat and the people you meet there.
</P>
<P>
   Chat is a feature you'll find in several forms on the Internet.
Most Internet veterans who like to chat online use IRC -- Internet
Relay Chat -- to have typed conversations with strangers. There are
also chat programs that run directly on Web pages and need no
special software. But the idea behind all the various ways of
chatting is to be able to have a conversation using the Internet
instead of the telephone or two rocking chairs on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   I started using chat almost as soon as it became available on
the Internet. And I met some nice people there, folks who became
real-world friends. I'm glad I met them and that sort of thing is
still possible. But the Net was a smaller and friendlier place back
then. I hate to sound elitist, but -- as the Internet has grown
--there's been a dumbing down. It's no different than the way
broadcast television progressed. In the Golden Age of television,
the screen was filled with classic variety shows, intelligent
comedy and original plays. There has been an inevitable lowering of
taste to fit the lowest common denominator both on television and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of frightening stories about really scary people
-- criminals of various types -- who use the Internet to meet their
victims. That threat of physical harm is an important reason to be
careful on chat and with e-mail acquaintances. But, that's not the
topic for today. Instead, let's talk about some real concerns I
have about chat that have more to do with the threat it can pose to
your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying chat is evil, or the people
you meet there are somehow lesser humans than the folks you'd find
hanging around the community swimming pool or sitting at the tables
of your favorite coffeehouse or bar. But I am saying that -- unlike
the people you meet in the real world -- there are fewer ways to be
able to use your common sense and intelligence to judge how worthy
David or Teresa is to be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to my example of the people you'd meet at the
community swimming pool. Let's say you pull up a chair in the shade
and strike up a conversation with the people sitting nearby. Right
away, you're able to tell how old they are, what sex they are, and
just get a general impression of how they act. Almost certainly, if
you talk longer than five minutes, you'll learn their names and
perhaps where they work.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about how chat works on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, unlike on ``Cheers,'' nobody knows your name. You
use a nickname. And since there are no controls over what nickname
you choose, David can become Teresa if he decides that would be
fun. All of a sudden things are very much like they'd be if
everyone you meet at the swimming pool is wearing a disguise and a
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Humans being human, this anonymous world tempts a lot of people
to indulge in some fantasy. Not all of it is bad or even harmful. A
bald middle-aged guy like me can become a 22-year-old soccer player
with curly blond hair. An unemployed person can briefly become the
chief technical officer for a large corporation. Who's to know?
And, if you don't take the folks you meet in the chat areas
seriously, what does it matter anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's just my point and the thing that I most dislike about
chat. At best, most of what you do there really doesn't matter. You
may spend hours a week chatting with Ben72 or MaryBeth98, get to
know them and even get to care about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But try calling up ole Ben72 some morning when your car won't
start and ask him for a ride. With rare and wonderful exceptions,
the people you meet there are cyber-friends. They'll hold your hand
electronically or listen to your troubles with a keen ear. But,
when the real world intrudes, often as not they aren't around and
don't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm suggesting that most people who spend hours a week making
cyber-friends would have happier and better lives if they put the
same amount of time and effort into making real-world friends.
Friends in the real world can be inconvenient and aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   These friends don't come with on/off switches. And that, to me,
is their virtue.

Cyberscene: There's always someone to talk to 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you'd like to have a little chat?
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people use the Internet as a way to make friends and
have typed conversations with them using one of the many chat
services there. You'll find plenty of do's and don'ts about
chatting with strangers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But, other than to say that it's just common sense not to tell
anonymous strangers your name, telephone number, address or any
personal information, this article isn't about the right and wrong
of chat. Instead, it'll guide you to places where you can get the
software you need, sites that offer instruction on how to use chat,
and even offer a brief course in chat etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at one of the best Web sites for basic chat
information. It's not a commercial site and that makes the complete
information and terrific links all the more impressive. The start
page is called Internet Relay Chat and can be found at
http://hoga.wwa.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)edge/irc.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a beginner, you'll find the Newbie section especially
helpful. In simple language, you'll be able to cover topics such
as: How to get Hooked up, Servers and How to Connect, Join Channels
and Communicate with Others.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've learned what to do and why you might like to do it,
you'll need the computer programs that let you reach some of the
Internet Relay Chat areas. That's another nice feature of this
page: It also has links to downloads for the chat programs. You'll
be able to download the programs free and the page offers software
for almost any computer platform you can name (and some you
probably have never heard of) including Unix, Windows, DOS,
Macintosh, OS/2, VMS, Amiga and X-Windows.
</P>
<P>
   There are several choices for most platforms. My favorite
software programs for Windows and Macintosh chatting are both
available from this site. I'd select a program called mIRC for
Windows and IRCle 2.1 for Macintosh computers. But, since these
programs are free, you may want to download a couple and find
something that suits your own tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're connected and online with other chatters you'll
notice that a lot of abbreviations and special terms are used. If
you want to sound like you've been around for a while, you may want
to drop in on a page called Chatter's Jargon Dictionary at
http://www.tiac.net/users/scg/jargpge.htm. You'll soon learn that
if someone is ROFL they're ``rolling on the floor laughing'' or if
they tell you something IMHO, it's ``in my humble opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   So far we've talked about the type of chat that is known as IRC.
But there is a new breed of chat on the Net that goes beyond
typing. It's called virtual worlds. In most of these Web-based chat
services, you'll be able to see a cartoonish representation of the
person you visit with.
</P>
<P>
   There are way too many virtual chat services to list them all.
If you want to explore that type of chat, there's an excellent
collection of links from the Yahoo search engine at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Internet(underscore)Games/Virt
 ual (underscore)Worlds/3D(underscore)Worlds/.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who are only casually interested in chat and do not
want the trouble of downloading chat programs may want to check out
some of the Web-based chat services. In most cases, you need
nothing more than your Web browser to chat there. Again, there are
literally dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web chat services. So you
should start with another group of Yahoo sites at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Computers(underscore)and(underscore)Internet/In
 ter net/World(underscore)Wide(underscore)Web/Chat/.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Check it out. We'll chat more later.

TechnoBuddy: Cyber-friends aside, don't forget virtue of real
friends 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sweet and single Teresa is really a burly truck driver
named David from Montana, married, with tattoos and kids. And the
wealthy neurosurgeon you met last night is a lonely schoolteacher
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Let's chat about chat and the people you meet there.
</P>
<P>
   Chat is a feature you'll find in several forms on the Internet.
Most Internet veterans who like to chat online use IRC -- Internet
Relay Chat -- to have typed conversations with strangers. There are
also chat programs that run directly on Web pages and need no
special software. But the idea behind all the various ways of
chatting is to be able to have a conversation using the Internet
instead of the telephone or two rocking chairs on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   I started using chat almost as soon as it became available on
the Internet. And I met some nice people there, folks who became
real-world friends. I'm glad I met them and that sort of thing is
still possible. But the Net was a smaller and friendlier place back
then. I hate to sound elitist, but -- as the Internet has grown
--there's been a dumbing down. It's no different than the way
broadcast television progressed. In the Golden Age of television,
the screen was filled with classic variety shows, intelligent
comedy and original plays. There has been an inevitable lowering of
taste to fit the lowest common denominator both on television and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of frightening stories about really scary people
-- criminals of various types -- who use the Internet to meet their
victims. That threat of physical harm is an important reason to be
careful on chat and with e-mail acquaintances. But, that's not the
topic for today. Instead, let's talk about some real concerns I
have about chat that have more to do with the threat it can pose to
your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying chat is evil, or the people
you meet there are somehow lesser humans than the folks you'd find
hanging around the community swimming pool or sitting at the tables
of your favorite coffeehouse or bar. But I am saying that -- unlike
the people you meet in the real world -- there are fewer ways to be
able to use your common sense and intelligence to judge how worthy
David or Teresa is to be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to my example of the people you'd meet at the
community swimming pool. Let's say you pull up a chair in the shade
and strike up a conversation with the people sitting nearby. Right
away, you're able to tell how old they are, what sex they are, and
just get a general impression of how they act. Almost certainly, if
you talk longer than five minutes, you'll learn their names and
perhaps where they work.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about how chat works on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, unlike on ``Cheers,'' nobody knows your name. You
use a nickname. And since there are no controls over what nickname
you choose, David can become Teresa if he decides that would be
fun. All of a sudden things are very much like they'd be if
everyone you meet at the swimming pool is wearing a disguise and a
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Humans being human, this anonymous world tempts a lot of people
to indulge in some fantasy. Not all of it is bad or even harmful. A
bald middle-aged guy like me can become a 22-year-old soccer player
with curly blond hair. An unemployed person can briefly become the
chief technical officer for a large corporation. Who's to know?
And, if you don't take the folks you meet in the chat areas
seriously, what does it matter anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's just my point and the thing that I most dislike about
chat. At best, most of what you do there really doesn't matter. You
may spend hours a week chatting with Ben72 or MaryBeth98, get to
know them and even get to care about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But try calling up ole Ben72 some morning when your car won't
start and ask him for a ride. With rare and wonderful exceptions,
the people you meet there are cyber-friends. They'll hold your hand
electronically or listen to your troubles with a keen ear. But,
when the real world intrudes, often as not they aren't around and
don't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm suggesting that most people who spend hours a week making
cyber-friends would have happier and better lives if they put the
same amount of time and effort into making real-world friends.
Friends in the real world can be inconvenient and aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   These friends don't come with on/off switches. And that, to me,
is their virtue.

 An Epiphany Brings Former Top KMPG Exec to Silicon Valley  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chauffeur used to drive Roger Siboni from his New Jersey home
each morning to his mid-Manhattan office, where he worked as chief
operating officer of the prestigious KPMG accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays Siboni is driving himself around Silicon Valley. Chalk
it up to the fact that at age 43, Siboni reached an Epiphany _
that's the name of the Palo Alto software firm he joins this month
as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trading salary and the trappings of power for equity,''
Siboni said.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphany sells a $250,000 software package that can extract
customer information from any database and pour it into a Web
browser. The idea is to let marketing people spot occasional
customers and turn them into big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Using software to pump up sales is a top priority for
corporations like Charles Schwab Corp., which has been using
Epiphany since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing on the market that I'm aware of that is as
powerful and as easy to use, and is also Web-accessible,'' said
Mary Kelley, vice president for database marketing at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for making Epiphany powerful and simple goes to
co-founders Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, and lead programmers Greg
Walsh and John McCaskey.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Siboni to sell this startup to the Fortune 500 by
drawing on personal relationships built up during two decades as a
high-profile KPMG consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Siboni is no stranger to the Valley. He started KPMG's high-tech
consulting practice in 1975, advising ancient firms such as
WordStar.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while COO at KPMG, Siboni took sides in the ``browser
wars'' when he handed a huge contract to Microsoft despite a
personal sales pitch from Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch in Palo Alto, Siboni said he's run into Barksdale
since then, and their cordial exchange convinced him that the
Netscape CEO hasn't held a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barksdale's such a big man, he probably doesn't mind
that Epiphany just hired Karen Richardson as its vice president of
sales, luring her away from a similar post at Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's only business in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Conspicuous absence: &LR;  House Speaker Newt Gingrich led a
delegation of congressional Republicans on a meet-and-greet tour of
Silicon Valleythis week, but local Representative Tom Campbell,
R.-Campbell, was not a member of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the hometowner was snubbed because he was on the
losing side of last summer's attempted Republican coup against the
Speaker? Whatever the cause, Campbell finds himself temporarily
frozen out of the GOP's effort to make sure Vice President Al Gore
doesn't walk away with Silicon Valley votes _ or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pay more attention here, and ask in return for more
attention to be paid to us,'' said Representative Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., who accompanied Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, who has spearheaded encryption legislation favored by
high-tech firms, was tapped by Gingrich to head a new Technology
Leadership Group that will bring Republicans in Congress together
with industry leaders like Cisco Vice President Judy Estrin,
Merrill Lynch investment banker Scott Ryles and Kleiner, Perkins
venture capitalist Floyd Kvamme.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; AOL's slippery slope? &LR;  Last week America Online shut down the
Web site of a member who had parodied several passages from the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The shut down was publicized by the Freedom Forum, a Virginia
foundation dedicated to newspaper and First Amendment issues. The
Forum said the site drew strong objections from Muslim academics in
Egypt and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley-based AOL watcher Dave Cassel said members at large
hardly noticed the flap. But Cassel questioned AOL's censorship
policy in light of the fact that a Texas Ku Klux Klan chapter has a
long-standing AOL page that advises visitors to prepare ``for the
coming disorder that will test the very survival of the White race
... (against the) jack booted Zionist Occupational Government.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said her firm received more than
1,000 complaints about the Koran site, and closed it after decided
it ``defamed a religious group.''
</P>
<P>
   She said AOL had received some complaints last year about the
KKK site last year, and AOL requested some changes to the page at
that time. But this year AOL has not heard any objections from
members and therefore has not taken any action against the page.
</P>
<P>
   The page is maintained by the Klan group that marched in Jasper,
Texas, last week, the town where a black man was killed by being
dragged behind a truck allegedly driven by several white men.
</P>

MODERN FEATURES TURN BATHING INTO AN EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You don't just hop in the bathtub anymore to take
a quick bath. With today's new line of whirlpool and deep soaking
tubs, it's referred to as a ``bathing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that experience can fall short in many of today's
postwar houses, which haven't been remodeled and still feature the
original shallow, 14-inch-deep tub. These tubs are so shallow that
the water barely covers an adult's legs, let alone providing much
room for stretching for those over 5-feet-2-inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no real thought to comfort and the lumbar support
back then,'' said Martha Kerr, a designer with Neil Kelly
Designers/Remodelers in Portland, Ore. ``Today, there's a trend
toward deep tubs, where the water comes up to your chest, and
there's an angled end to comfortably support your back.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, whirlpool and tub manufacturers are making deeper
soaking tubs that fit in many of the tight enclosures of older
postwar bathrooms. These tubs also come in a variety of affordable
prices, depending on how many options you desire.
</P>
<P>
   A standard 14- to 17-inch deep, cast-iron tub that's 32 inches
wide by 5 feet long holds 20 gallons of water and sells for
approximately $310 to $400. Compare that to a cast acrylic
whirlpool that is 21 inches deep, takes 40 gallons of water and
costs approximately $720, said Tim Rose, a sales associate with
Central Plumbing Bath &AMP; Kitchens in Scotia, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool manufacturers have realized the majority of us can't
fit one of those megasized tubs into our small, narrow baths and
are therefore making models that can replace older tubs in cramped
quarters of up to 60 inches in length.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have the room, such as converting an extra
bedroom into a bath, whirlpools come as large as 7 feet by 5 feet
and 24 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing a more compact construction of whirlpools,
because getting in and out of them where they were sunken into a
large tile surround has become a safety issue,'' said Kerr, who
also teaches bathroom programs for the National Kitchen &AMP; Bath
Association in Hackettstown, N.J. ``You're now seeing fewer steps
or decks surrounding the whirlpool. Albeit, they looked grander
with the big surround and steps leading to them, but they weren't
very practical.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of whirlpool shapes to choose from, including
rectangles, ovals, novelty and corner shapes.
</P>
<P>
   You can even attach shower doors to some whirlpool models. Some
whirlpools, called body spas, include a shower with massage jets
that recirculate 80 gallons of water per minute, according to Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Within a whirlpool, you can choose various decorative features.
The water and air mixture jet systems come in brass, chrome or the
same color finish as your tub. There are standard power jets,
hydro-jets that feature individual flow control and pulsating
massage jets. Jets even come with an air volume control, allowing
the right mixture of air and water to create a gentle to vigorous
pulse. Don't worry about getting an electric shock, as a pneumatic,
nonelectric control switch allows you to turn the jets on and off
while in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Many models feature molded-in head or armrests, or both. With
some models, you even have the option of a molded seat. You can
even get mood lighting with a dimmer control and five
interchangeable colored lenses to see the bottom of the bath.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's new tubs are made of cast high-gloss acrylic,
which is resistant to stains and scratches. Acrylic also holds the
temperature longer than cast iron, according to Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are numerous colors to choose from, Kerr said
that off-whites, such as bone or almond, collectively sell as well
as white, still the most popular color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When restoring a house, some people replace a modern tub with a
resurfaced claw-and-ball-foot tub, some in whirlpool-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increased interest in maintaining the
architectural integrity of a home,'' Kerr said. ``Therefore, bath
fixtures with a more traditional look are desirable. You can even
get a claw-and-ball-foot tub with whirlpool jets. To hide the motor
and pipes, the tub has a double wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Refinishing an existing claw-and-ball tub or other cast-iron
tubs should only be done if it is to be used in the guest bedroom,
where it will only be used occasionally,'' Kerr added. ``That way
it could hold up for the next 25 years. But I don't recommend it
for a tub that you'll be using every day. A refinished tub isn't
resurfaced under the same conditions as the original surface. If
you use it every day, it will only last about one and a half to
five years at the most before it begins to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other style baths have made their niche, or are doing so now.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soaking tubs have been around for about 15 years. These
are large, deep tubs with a drain in the middle of the floor, that
you can stand in or sit on built-in areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soaking tub is just that and used in the traditional
way,'' Kerr said. ``You take a shower before getting into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear from designers around the country that a soaking tub is
preferred more than the whirlpool,'' Kerr said. ``People want the
oversize tub, but not necessarily the noise of the jets. Even
though the jets have an on/off button, just about every
manufacturer now makes a deep soaking tub, which costs less than a
whirlpool.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the soft look of a bath, Kerr said the newest
looking tub to surface at a recent national bath show was a wooden
tub sealed with a poly glaze to protect it from temperature
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years we have seen several wooden tubs come on the
market,'' she said. ``It's a most intriguing material, but the
amount of care is beyond the norm. When you drain the water from
the tub, you may end up with staining, depending on the chemical
composition of your water. Therefore you have to thoroughly dry the
tub each time you use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chemical water wear line can also occur, if you tend to soak
in the tub for an hour or more each time ... sort of a ring-wear
stain line around the tub.''
</P>
<P>
   Bath specialists warn against using abrasives of any kind, such
as scrub sponges to cleansers, on any tub, even cast iron, as they
will eventually cause the surface to break down and become abrasive
itself.

FRIDA KAHLO INTRODUCES HER HUSBAND, DIEGO RIVERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ During her lifetime and for a good 25 years after her
death in 1954, Frida Kahlo seemed to owe much of her renown as a
painter to the fact that she was married to Diego Rivera, the
colossus of Mexican muralism. Not that Rivera did not himself
proclaim her a great artist in her own right. It is just that for
decades the shadow of Rivera's painting, personality and politics
served to dim most other Mexican lights.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1980s, the Socialist Realism of Rivera's vast
historical and revolutionary murals had begun to look outdated.
Coincidentally, Kahlo was being rediscovered as an artist whose
unflinching portrayal of her own physical and emotional pain spoke
not only to a new generation of feminists but also to an era more
concerned with feeling than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least outside Mexico, Diego has become Frida's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   One motivation for ``Diego Rivera _ Frida Kahlo,'' an intriguing
show that runs through Sept. 30 at the Musee Maillol in Paris, is
therefore to introduce Rivera to a European public that is barely
aware of him. (The exhibition was seen earlier this year at the
Fondation Glanadda in Martigny, Switzerland.) Another is to bring
the artists together, almost for the first time, so that their work
can be compared and their turbulent lives revisited.
</P>
<P>
   With 80 paintings and drawings by Rivera and some 50 paintings
by Kahlo, it is not a complete double retrospective because it
lacks many of Kahlo's best-known self-portraits as well as some of
Rivera's most haunting oils. And Rivera's greatest legacy, his
murals at the National Palace and other public buildings in Mexico,
cannot travel. But the show nonetheless conveys a clear message:
Kahlo looked to Rivera as her maestro, but she followed him more as
a man than as a painter.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Rivera, 20 years her senior, always encouraged
her to go her own way. In an essay in the catalog, Raquel Tibol, a
well-known Mexican art critic, recalled what Kahlo told her in
1953: ``Evoking the episode of Diego observing her early work, she
remembered his comments. `Your will must lead to your personal
style of expression.' And she added, `Then I began to paint things
which pleased him. I followed his painting for only a short
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cover of the catalog and the poster for the show
underline how, emotionally, Kahlo never escaped Rivera. They
reproduce ``Diego and I'' (1949), a self-portrait of Kahlo in which
she painted Rivera's portrait on her forehead, with a third eye on
his own forehead. And it is only one of many paintings in which
Rivera appeared. In contrast, while Rivera included Kahlo in
several murals, he did only one portrait of her, a 1930 lithograph
of her sitting naked on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera seemingly had no need for a muse. Although he is best
remembered for his portrayals of heroic Mexican peasants and
workers combating conquistadors, Roman Catholic priests and
plutocrats through the ages, he in fact spent the entire 1910-1917
Mexican Revolution outside Mexico, honing his skills as a
post-Impressionist and as a Cubist in Paris between 1909 and 1921.
The Musee Maillol throws light on this little-known Rivera by
including 20 paintings from this period.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Mexico, though, he quickly rediscovered his
roots. ``My style was born, as children are born, in an instant,
except that this birth came after a painful 35-year pregnancy,'' he
later wrote. Certainly, by the time the tall, overweight Rivera
married the petite, dark-eyed 22-year-old Kahlo in 1929, he had
both his own style and a strong political agenda and, along with
David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco, he was defining
post-revolutionary Mexican art.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Rivera's art looked outward, Kahlo's looked inward,
reliving the terrible traffic accident that shattered her body in
her late teens, recording the pain of her 30 operations, her
abortions, miscarriage and inability to bear children, painting her
sorrow at Rivera's frequent betrayals (even though she too had many
lovers, the exiled Trotsky among them, it is said). Emotionally,
though, Rivera needed Kahlo: after they divorced in late 1939, he
persuaded her to return, and they remarried 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Where their artistic paths crossed was in Mexico itself.
Convinced by now of the virtues of Mexico's Indian past, Rivera
encouraged Kahlo to wear the traditional embroidered dresses and
hair ribbons of the Tehuanas, the matriarchal Indian tribe of the
Tehuantepec isthmus. She was in turn inspired by the colors and
forms of Mexican folk art and the tiny religious metal plaques
known as ex-votos, albeit replacing religious images with symbolic
objects.
</P>
<P>
   If this was often the form of her work, however, the content was
largely autobiographical. ``If I paint myself, it is because it is
the subject I know the best,'' she once explained. The first
self-portrait in this show has her standing on the United
States-Mexican border in 1932, dressed in a pink dress, holding a
Mexican flag and surrounded by symbols contrasting ancient rural
Mexico with industrial urban America. But soon the self-portraits
become ever more intimate, ever more fixated with her broken body,
as in ``The Henry Ford Hospital'' (1932), where she lies naked in a
pool of blood on a hospital bed, attached by veins to an embryo and
other symbols. In ``My Wet Nurse and I'' (1937), a baby's body with
Kahlo's head is breast-fed by a dark-faced Indian woman
representing Mexico's roots. Perhaps most despairing is ``Without
Hope'' (1945), where she is again bedridden, with a macabre
fountain of animals, fish and a skull spewing from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When Andre Breton visited Mexico in 1937, he promptly claimed
her for Surrealism, but she would have nothing of it. ``They
thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't,'' she said. ``I never
painted dreams. I painted my own reality.'' In another essay in the
catalog, Christina Burrus, the show's curator, records a still more
mischievous observation by Kahlo. ``The problem with Mr. Breton is
that he takes himself too seriously,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rivera understood that her Mexican art would have
universal appeal. In 1953, one year before Kahlo's death, four
years before his own, when he was well enshrined as Mexico's
greatest living painter, he gave an interview to Ms. Tibol, which
she quotes in the catalog. ``Frida Kahlo is the greatest Mexican
painter,'' he said. ``Her work is destined to be multiplied by
reproductions and will speak, thanks to books, to the whole world.
It is one of the most formidable artistic documents and most
intense testimonies on human truth of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover,'' he went on, as if anticipating that Kahlo would
one day become a feminist icon, ``it is the first time in the
history of art that a woman has expressed with absolutely
disincarnate and, we could say, quietly ferocious frankness these
general and specific facts which affect women exclusively.''

REGULATORS NEGLECT SIDE-EFFECTS OF ANTI-MALARIAL DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By B. MEREDITH BURKE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ A recent San Francisco Examiner column on
the perils of the anti-malarial drug Lariam is the first ever aimed
at a general audience.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you would need to subscribe to special-interest
publications where underwater divers, photographers and outdoor
sports enthusiasts have contributed ``traveler's advisories'' about
this toxic drug.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have tried to alert the Food and Drug
Administration find our reports uniformly discounted. I sent
then-FDA Commissioner David Kessler an account of what happened to
me years ago in Uganda after I took a precautionary dose of Lariam.
(I then fantasized jumping from my eighth-floor room in Kampala to
experience the sensation of flying. I had strange sensations in my
legs. And so forth.)
</P>
<P>
   I received a characteristic FDA reply. It questioned my
observations, chided me for being unwilling to suffer a few
``minor'' side-effects and lectured me, a health economist, on the
cost-benefit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   I sent the same account five years ago to The Lancet, the
British medical journal, trying to alert health and medical
professionals to Lariam's relatively high incidence of serious,
long-lasting side-effects. Since then, manufacturer Hoffmann-La
Roche has expanded the Lariam product warning sheet in the United
Kingdom. And the British government no longer recommends Lariam to
the general traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FDA still pronounces Lariam ``safe.'' The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention still designates Lariam as its
preferred anti-malarial drug.
</P>
<P>
   The sluggish reaction by the FDA and CDC to the cascade of
Lariam critiques reflects weakness in its adverse drug reaction
reporting system.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors or users are required first to identify as a drug
reaction problems that may have been omitted from the product
warning sheet. Next, they must obtain and file the ``Medwatch''
form.
</P>
<P>
   According to University of Pennsylvania biostatistics chairman
Brian Strom, more than two-thirds of the doctors in his audiences
fail to file Medwatch forms. More than 225 people this past year
have contacted Lariam Action-U.S.A., an informal clearinghouse I
manage for people who have used Lariam or have questions about it.
But few had filed Medwatch reports of disabling side-effects they
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Some users, completing our questionnaire, reply that our
information sheet alerted them for the first time to link Lariam to
their neuro-psychiatric symptoms, panic and anxiety attacks, skin
rashes, insomnia, circulatory and respiratory upsets and so forth.
Others had deprecated their own experience, saying, ``I thought it
was just me'' or, ``I took only one pill, so why should I bother
the FDA?''
</P>
<P>
   This known underreporting bias explains Dr. Philip Lee's caution
when addressing a Stanford University audience: ``We do not have
adequate authority for post-marketing surveillance of new drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, now with the FDA, is founder of the University of
California at San Francisco's Institute for Health Policy Studies.
He was assistant secretary for health in both the Clinton and
Johnson administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kennedy, FDA commissioner (1977-79) and Stanford
president emeritus, concurred. He has since told me that he doesn't
know anyone ``intimately familiar with the FDA's adverse drug
reaction reporting system'' who believes it is performing
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of the FDA's
Center for Drug Evaluation, stated he believed ``very good about
our system'' of drug reaction tracking.
</P>
<P>
   This reassurance was directed at those who questioned the FDA
capability to monitor thalidomide, a notorious teratogen associated
with fetal limb reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: An FDA lacking funds to conduct its own outreach
studies first maintains full trust in its drug reaction system.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it attacks the credibility of those users who
conscientiously self-report side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   The agency consistently ignores the Medwatch reports and letters
from me and other sufferers, not to mention assessments in two
British medical journal reports that Lariam is ``toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it has not called for experts with no financial ties to
Roche to evaluate these overseas studies. Where Lariam is
concerned, the FDA's motto seems to be: ``Don't tell; we won't
ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we trust this is the only drug the agency treats so
cavalierly?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;

Medical School, and is director of Lariam Action-U.S.A.)

DREAMS OF DOING IT WITH THE FIRST DUDE

   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Finally, it happened. A woman confessed she
didn't have sex with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Former Time magazine White House reporter Nina Burleigh wrote in
a Mirabella magazine essay that she would have gladly had sex with
Clinton after she supposedly caught him admiring her legs during a
game of hearts on Air Force One. She wrote that she didn't feel
harassed. Instead, she swooned for the First Dude.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, he didn't have sex with her. I don't know if
this is a first for Clinton, but it is a new low in the already
sinking field of journalism: A no-kiss-and-tell article.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the worst of it: Burleigh wrote that she would have
been happy to have oral sex with Clinton ``just to thank him for
keeping abortion legal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is truly weird stuff. Please tell us, oh no-kiss-and-tell
reporter, what in heck does oral sex have to do with abortion?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to become a little sympathetic toward the
president after all the dirt that's been dumped on him. If things
keep on like this, his presidential library will have buck-a-peep
windows.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to have complete sympathy for presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry. This is the kind of day he had with the
Washington press corps on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a grilling on Clinton's threats to get tough
with health care providers who don't provide, and went on to
questions about the Indonesian army shooting protesters. Then came
this:
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Mike, is there any plan to send a representative to
the ceremony of the burial of Czar Nicholas II's remains?''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: ``I'd have to check with our embassy in Moscow to see
if there are. I'm not aware of any.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``How about Roy Rogers?''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: ``Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we do know Roy's song, but not in Russian. McCurry has to
put up with this kind of stuff day in and day out.
</P>

   In a state test, graduates of bilingual programs in San
Francisco and San Jose out-scored native English speakers in most
grades and subject areas. Sean Walsh, the spokesman for Gov. Pete
Wilson, said it was remarkable, adding: ``The governor has never
been flatly against programs that help kids transition into
English.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing kids might learn in a bilingual program, unless
they're taking Bureaucratese as a Second Language, is that
``transition'' isn't a verb.

   In Berkeley, Mayor Shirley Dean is trying to downgrade the crime
of public nudity to the level of a traffic ticket, to make it
easier to prosecute all the naked people running around there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are performance artists,'' said one of them, X-plicit
Player Marty Kent. ``We don't feel what we are doing is a trivial
matter on the level of a parking ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, performance artists, like mimes, deserve capital
punishment. But it wouldn't be right. By the way, where do you put
the traffic ticket on a nude guy? It might not be a trivial matter
at all.

STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE THAT TIME OF MONTH

<P>
   SAN PEDRO, Calif. _ I am in the throes of a major bad mood and
my husband is not home and my kids are at summer classes.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone-induced for sure, this blasted bad mood. But still, I
know, someone is going to receive the sharp edge of my temporarily
contorted psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Hark, who goes there! Why, none other than the handyman who is
here to install the blinds and block the sun that dares enter my
living room.
</P>
<P>
   I am standing cross-armed with a twisted mouth and a frown that
pulls my face tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not straight,'' I can hear my voice barking.
</P>
<P>
   He is not fazed by this shrew of a woman who wears the oldest
sweatshirt she could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``I haven't put them up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   I stomp out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   I throw some water on my face, look piercingly into my
reflection, and order that angry-for-no-reason face of mine to stop
this descent into bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   I am back in the living room, and all the blinds are firmly hung
already. The handyman glances at me and picks up his tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not straight,'' I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He pokes the blinds lightly, pulls them up, moves them down.
``There,'' he says to me, ``all straight now.''
</P>
<P>
   I am feeling lousy. This monster within me won't leave me. And I
know that if the man in front of me was the man I married who is
now safe in his office, he would have thrown his arms up in the air
and with a pained look on his face headed to the nearest bakery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weather is driving me crazy,'' I tell this guy who, by
the way, is named Guy. But I know that La Nina has nothing to do
with this time-of-month storm that rages through my body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' I tell Guy, ``if the blinds are not straight, my
husband will blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he is a nice guy, but crooked blinds drive him crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' Guy edges toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' my voice has reached its highest pitch. ``I am very
reasonable when it comes to straight lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what,'' says Guy, who seems no stranger to strange
suburban ladies. ``Let your husband take a look at the blinds and
have him call me.''
</P>
<P>
   I muster the last remnants of my sanity. I bid Guy adieu. I even
remember to sign the check.
</P>
<P>
   There, all is well, I am sure the weather will change for the
better. And, thanks to Guy, I have managed to seek some relief by
rattling someone else's sanity.
</P>
<P>
   How do I know? The poor guy left all his tools in my living
room. I doubt he will be back soon.

BC IRISH PROGRAM INCLUDES COUNTRY'S DYNAMIC PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The Jesuits founded Boston College in large part to
educate the children of Irish immigrants who fled the famine of 150
years ago, and so it is no surprise that BC has one of the oldest
and best Irish Studies programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But while many American universities have programs dedicated to
the more traditional disciplines of Irish history and literature,
BC is carving out its own niche by marrying the study of
traditional Ireland with modern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and students have long been fascinated by Ireland's
history and the writings of Swift, Synge, Joyce, Yeats, Beckett,
and a legion of others. But modern Ireland is being defined by its
business acumen as much as its continued ability to produce prose
as compelling as Roddy Doyle's and poetry as timeless as Seamus
Heaney's.
</P>
<P>
   As Ireland has become Europe's most dynamic economy in the
1990s, the skills of Irish business magnates Michael Smurfit and
Tony O'Reilly are as worthy of study as the writing of Edna O'Brien
and John Banville.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, meanwhile,
signals that politics is a growth industry on the island. Political
leaders, both established and emerging, want to impart and absorb
lessons on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If revisionism is all the vogue in Irish history, the Irish
Institute at Boston College is leading the way to revising what it
is to use Ireland as a subject of study in higher education, and to
equip tomorrow's leaders on the island in both the private and
public sector. It is also a way for a university founded on the
backs of Irish immigrants to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   Sean M. Rowland, the Institute's director, explains the change
this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC has always been strong in Irish studies, especially history
and literature,'' he said. ``What we've done is take it campus
wide. Our political science department is working with political
parties here. Our education department is working with the Irish
government's Department of Education. Our business studies have all
sorts of links with the corporate sector here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been an interest in Ireland in higher
education. But a sentimental interest is one thing. A
business-rooted interest is entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said academia tends to consider itself above politics,
but the Institute has deliberately cultivated strong and high-level
political support from the American, Irish, and British governments
because it sees such support as crucial to its efforts. It gets
funding from those governments, including a $1 million grant from
the US government it has received each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goals are to promote peace and economic
development through education and job creation,'' Rowland said. To
do so, he says, political support at the highest levels is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute is politically connected. The Irish prime
minister, Bertie Ahern, presided over its official opening last
December at Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an academic side to the political links. For
example, Mary O'Rourke, the Irish Cabinet minister in charge of
trade and enterprise, has been lecturing MBA students at BC for the
last decade. O'Rourke, who has held more senior positions in
government than any other Irish woman, is an expert on European
Union affairs, and is a veteran of many a domestic political
battle.
</P>
<P>
   At a Dublin Castle dinner to wrap up a higher education
conference sponsored by the Institute last month, the head table
included the BC president, the Rev. William P. Leahy; Irish
President Mary McAleese; US Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith; and
Irish Education Minister Micheal Martin.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese, an academic who left her job as law professor and vice
chancellor at Queen's University in Belfast to become the first
native of Northern Ireland to serve as Ireland's head of state,
said the partnerships created by BC with Irish businesses and
government agencies are ``yielding very tangible results in the
numbers of young people equipped with the leadership skills to
carry this island forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic and cultural renaissance is no accident or
coincidence,'' said McAleese.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the evolving relationship with Ireland ``goes to the
very roots of Boston College. We'd like to think we're at the
cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the Institute has been given the room to expand
``because of the commitment of Father Leahy and Frank Campanella,''
BC's executive vice president. Campanella's interest in all things
Irish might not be obvious from his last name, but three of his
grandparents were born in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who splits his time between Boston and his native
Ireland, said corporate support is essential for the Institute's
ability to mount a trans-Atlantic presence. IBM, for example, whose
worldwide education manager is BC grad Sean Rush, helped underwrite
last month's three-day conference in Dublin. The Ireland Funds, the
International Fund for Ireland, and the Irish American Partnership
also lend financial support.
</P>
<P>
   In its previous incarnation as the Center for Irish Management,
the Institute began humbly in 1988 offering a program that brought
20 entrepreneurs from Northern Ireland for three-month internships
in Boston. This year, the Institute administered 21 programs. More
than 250 people from Ireland, north and south, plus hundreds of BC
students, will take part in education, political leadership, and
business management programs put on by the Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As the Irish economy booms, meanwhile, the traffic is no longer
one-way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, our biggest worry was how do we get enough visas
for the Irish kids to get into America,'' said Rowland. ``Now we
have all these American kids who want to get in here. It just shows
how much things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs is one aimed at marketing tourism in both
parts of Ireland, which reflects one of Ireland's traditional
economic strengths, and one on corporate child care that highlights
an emerging need in an economy where only recently have large
numbers of both parents or single mothers worked. The child-care
program is aimed not only at those in the private sector who want
to develop child-care businesses but those in the Irish government
who will regulate this emerging industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the Institute is developing closer links with
British institutions. Taking a page from the Good Friday agreement
that created new political machinery to reflect new relationships
between the islands of Ireland and Britain, and within those two
islands, Rowland wants to ``bring young political leaders from
Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales to BC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to develop some programming to bring Ireland,
Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom together,'' said Rowland.
``The old, anti-British stuff isn't helpful to anyone anymore. BC
is very much at the fore of forging ahead, of building new
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland believes the ``new'' Irish studies complement the
traditional Irish studies program. He said the Institute draws on
those traditional strengths. Among lecturers at last month's
conference were historian Kevin O'Neill, co-director of BC's Irish
Studies program, and Robert K. O'Neill, director of the John J.
Burns Library at BC, an internationally recognized expert on rare
books and special collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a Kevin O'Neill and a Bob O'Neill opens doors in the
world of higher education,'' said Rowland. ``They are known at
every university in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the Institute, Thomas O'Connor, BC's
professor emeritus of Irish history, is developing a research
project that will identify the migration trends of the Irish
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   BC obviously sees the old and the new working together. Last
month, it moved the Institute and the traditional Irish Studies
programs into the same mansion house on Hammond Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' says Rowland, ``we're all under the same roof.''

FUGITIVE A SYMBOL OF MEXICAN CRIME RUNNING RAMPANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Where is Daniel Arizmendi Lopez?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, police officers and army troops
have scoured Mexico City and its surrounding states in hopes of
nabbing the elusive reputed kidnapper who has become this country's
most notorious criminal. But Arizmendi, 39, known as
(itals)cortaorejas,(unitals) or ``ear cutter'', for the way he
allegedly mutilates his hostages to get families to pay ransom,
remains at large, and a living, if unseen, symbol of Mexico's crime
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the massive search for the drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes a year ago _ which ended when he died during botched
plastic surgery in Mexico City _ have Mexicans seen such a
concentrated hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The search has become a national saga. Headlines about the hunt
for him and his accomplices have rivaled coverage devoted to the
World Cup soccer tournament and to the continuing struggle between
the government and guerrillas in the southern states of Chiapas and
Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many kidnappings are attributable to the
Arizmendi ring. Estimates from officials range from 18 to 200 over
the past eight years. In an interview Arizmendi granted last month
to a Mexico City newspaper, he admitted to 20. Observers believe he
has netted more than $40 million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, authorities raided a half-dozen of Arizmendi's
homes in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, about 40 miles south in the
state of Morelos, in hopes of catching him. Although police and
army troops arrested Arizmendi's wife, son, daughter, and
daughter-in-law and seized $5 million, they missed their target,
who reportedly slipped away in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Arizmendi's younger brother, Aurelio, allegedly a
major figure in the kidnapping ring, was arrested in a southern
Mexico City neighborhood following a car chase and a daylight
sidewalk shootout. Officials said they had been tailing Aurelio for
five days.
</P>
<P>
   From his hospital bed where he was taken after being shot during
the capture, the younger Arizmendi gave candid and grisly accounts
of how the kidnappings were carried out and of how victims were
beaten and their ears cut off with scissors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daniel was the chief, Daniel cut the ears,'' Aurelio said in
television and newspaper interviews. ``We never had regrets. We
never thought about that. It was all about work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings have become widespread in Mexico and in other Latin
American countries over the last few years. In Mexico City, for
example, where many abductions are cases in which taxi drivers take
passengers hostage at gunpoint and rob them, police report nearly
2,000 cases in three years, though many say the actual number is
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizmendi ring has hit mostly Mexican and Spanish
business-people. Aurelio said in the interview that there have been
eight ear cuttings and that two people have died.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings are often seen as a relatively low-risk and
high-profit crime, especially during bad economic times. And weak
criminal justice systems encourage police and prosecutors to become
accomplices, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of abductions and assaults in Mexico, once considered
among the safest of Latin American countries, has spawned a rapidly
growing industry in private security and kidnapping insurance. Many
executives, for example, have resorted to riding in bulletproof
cars with tinted windows and surrounding themselves with
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the perception of impunity, that criminals can
commit these crimes and get away with them,'' said Arturo
Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at
Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To halt the tide of abductions, the Mexican attorney general
formed an antikidnapping unit late last year. The force includes
about three-dozen police officers who receive higher pay and three
months of special training.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Arizmendi, a former chauffeur and state
police officer in Morelos who reportedly turned to crime as a
small-time car thief in the 1980s, began his kidnapping spree in
Mexico City's working-class neighborhoods. Eventually, the ring
began working almost exclusively in the financial districts and
affluent areas.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi kept several rank-and-file as well as top police
officials on his payroll, investigators say. These officers either
helped carry out kidnappings, authorities say, or have given
Arizmendi tips to avoid capture.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arizmendi brothers have denied receiving protection from
law enforcement officers. But several top officials _ including the
former chief of the antikidnapping police unit in Morelos, a
federal agent, and a prosecutor _ have been arrested and charged
with helping the ring. Morelos Governor Jorge Carrillo has also
resigned because of the scandal, although he has denied any
involvement with Arizmendi.
</P>
<P>
   Police agencies and media outlets say they receive calls daily
from witnesses claiming they've spotted Arizmendi. Late last year,
Mexico's attorney general offered a $625,000 reward for his
capture.
</P>
<P>
   On one television broadcast last week, an anonymous caller said
Arizmendi and his associates were eating in a restaurant in the
posh neighborhood of Polanco on the city's north side. Armed
officers and TV cameras rushed to the scene but found he wasn't
there.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi himself added to the drama last month when he
reportedly called the Mexico City newspaper Reforma and gave an
extensive interview. When asked what his message was to the police
who are searching for him, Arizmendi responded: ``Well, nothing,
except that I wish them luck, and hopefully, the day they find me,
they catch me and kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Arizmendi admitted to being addicted to
money and alcohol, adding, ``I believe I'm going to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if police capture Arizmendi, many experts and residents in
this city of 20 milllion people agree that it would be a symbolic
but small victory in the struggle against rampant crime. Already
this year, there have been a record 100 bank robberies in Mexico
City. And although record keeping is erratic, one government
estimate reportedly shows that homicides here were up 50 percent
from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until the economic situation here improves will things
change,'' said Alfonso Pasapera Mora, a professor of criminal law
at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. ``I believe
people prefer to take these criminal risks so long as they find
themselves in desperate economic situations.''

BIG-TICKET TRANSPORTATION ITEMS REQUIRE BIGGER BACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cities must build. But should government pay for big projects,
or should they be left to the private sector, which, after all,
stands to benefit?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is reasonably clear, concluded some professionals and
academics who recently focused on the question: Government should
build the transportation links _ the highways, the tunnels, the
railroads _ because they pay off big-time. But the stadiums and
convention centers have more uncertain economic returns and should
be looked at skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are caveats and exceptions. Obviously, there are the
roads and transit lines to nowhere, plotted only to create a few
temporary jobs and (sometimes named) to support a politician's ego.
Forget those.
</P>
<P>
   And there are cities, according to Heywood T. Sanders, professor
of urban administration at Trinity University in San Antonio, that
are established ``destination'' cities and for which big public
investments can make sense. You know which ones they are. There's a
good chance you've been to them: Las Vegas, Orlando, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Boston? No easy answer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a somewhat peculiar place,'' said Sanders. ``It's a
good visitor destination, but it's got some problems.'' The
downside includes location, far from the growing population centers
of the American West and Southwest; weather (enough said); access,
which refers particularly to the fact that Logan Airport is close
but one frequently can't get there; and hotel costs, among the
gougiest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders spoke last month at a seminar &UR;  &LR; in Boston called
``Evaluating Infrastructure Projects: Concrete Lessons for Policy
Making.'' The session was organized by the Pioneer Institute, a
market-inclined think tank that occasionally pays academics and
consultants to assess potential projects like Boston's new
convention center. Or those under way, like the controversially
priced, $10.8 billion Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking of the panelists, such as Alan Altshuler, director
of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard
University, was that transportation links have generally returned
more than they cost in economic benefits. Altshuler was secretary
of transportation under Governor Frank Sargent in the 1970s, when
Sargent, a Republican, was perhaps the first prominent politician
in the country to say no to another big urban stretch of highway
like those that had crushed myriad neighborhoods nationwide. It was
the so-called Inner Belt that would have pushed Interstate 95
through Boston and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Zuk, director of the Big Dig, formally known as the
Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project, of course defended the
effort and, in general, ``the grand idea'' of transportation
megaprojects.
</P>
<P>
   Highway projects that used to cost a mere million dollars a mile
and were obviously good investments have turned into those like the
Big Dig, which at eight miles and almost $11 billion is _ well, you
figure it out. It takes a while to get a payback on an investment
like that, no matter how many commuters and delivery trucks it
speeds through Boston at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spends a small portion of its gross national
project on infrastructure, Zuk said, adding ``That is a very
important deficiency.'' He named the Suez and Panama canals,
Brooklyn Bridge, and interstate railroad and highway systems as
transportation links, often controversial, that now are economic
pillars.
</P>
<P>
   Take even the $4 billion Denver airport, which Taubman Center
assistant director David Luberoff noted was so far from population
centers ``you're more or less in Kansas.'' Said Zuk, ``Denver may
be an airport built in a place where nobody is today ... but in 20
years it won't be,'' and he suggested building every new airport
``just far enough away that people will accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadiums and convention centers, though, are another matter,
said Sanders, who was pessimistic a year ago about the return on
spending hundreds of millions of public dollars in Boston and said
he is even more so now. He recently compared what he says were the
convention industry's own projections for the last few years to
reality. To put it in academic jargon, the curves don't occupy the
same space on the chart. And the trends are in opposite directions
_ predictions optimistic, actual number of conventions declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are inevitably oversold,'' says Sanders, author of
``Convention Center Follies,'' an article in the Summer 1998 issue
of the journal Public Interest. And bad public dollars get thrown
after good ones. The attitude is: ``If it doesn't work, build some
more hotels next door.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and other cities
trying to prosper, says Sanders, ``The answer lies in the grand
idea. The grand big-fix idea is alive and well and charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sanders blames not only politicians but also business
people for wasting increasingly scarce public funds. He cites ``the
astonishing political strength and persistence of large-scale
business interests in big cities,'' the same groups that
shortsightedly pushed for interstate highways through urban
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, powerful Boston and state business interests
led by the Artery Business Committee crushed a sputtering effort to
remove tolls from the Massachusetts Turnpike and harbor tunnels, in
a court victory that ensures a big source of Big Dig funding.
</P>
<P>
   The leanings of academics aside, there is an emerging public
attitude in the wake of the counterculture '60s and the perhaps
excessive '80s that business is as business does, and big-project
plans should be judged on a case-by-case basis, not based on who is
for and who against.
</P>
<P>
   And in politically alive locales like Boston, projects are going
to be critically considered whoever is behind them, to avoid
perpetual regrets like the elimination of the city's West End
neighborhood, a victim of urban renewal. The Massachusetts Port
Authority's combined stadium and convention center idea for South
Boston was dashed in part because Boston _ unlike some less
desirable cities _ doesn't need to pay wealthy team owners to come
to town.
</P>
<P>
   According to Luberoff, the question of whether the federal
government should engage in huge building projects with public
money was debated from the nation's beginnings but never officially
answered. So the debate devolved to the states, with the same
inconclusive result, and then to the cities. Only with the Great
Depression did public works come alive.
</P>
<P>
   History repeated in the 1950s, with federally funded
urban-renewal programs. And the business community was supportive,
Sanders contends, because spending public money meant that land
values stood to increase.
</P>
<P>
   No project ever represented that principle better than the Big
Dig. Not only will scores of businesses downtown, formerly faced
with an elevated eyesore of a highway, eventually abut inviting
open space. But a new city neighborhood has been opened up on the
South Boston waterfront, largely because of the Ted Williams Tunnel
connection to the airport, and eventual direct access to the
turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to really reap the benefits'' of the Big Dig and
the convention center? asked Luberoff. Both are being paid for with
your taxes. A healthy economy will benefit all, as the nation is
fortunate enough to experience now. But being situated next to
these gleaming new projects is the equivalent of being personally
handed another big check.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Boston, the Turnpike Authority and the state want to
start talking about a means by which those who benefit will pay
more of a share of the considerable cost of maintenance and upkeep.
So that the taxpayers who paid in the first place won't just keep
on paying.

`EXES' MARKS THE SPOT OF ROCK 'N' ROLL DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE EXES 
By Pagan Kennedy 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23, 203 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever wanted to play in a rock band? Go on tour in a
beat-up van and sleep on the cold floor of someone's
ex-girlfriend's apartment? Practice night after night for months in
order to perform for 13 people? And all so that sometimes on some
nights you will connect so fully with the right combination of
melody and volume that you and your bandmates move like one
creature and mesmerize everyone listening?
</P>
<P>
   Author Pagan Kennedy's second novel, ``The Exes,'' is for anyone
who has ever dreamed of dominating rock 'n' roll clubland _ and for
everyone who has ever spent a night there. This good-humored and
often sly book creates a fictional band and lets it loose in the
real and gritty world of the Boston scene. Told in four parts, by
the four band members, it gives us a loosely related tale of how a
rock group forms, makes some kind of name for itself, and then
teeters on the brink of disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   The band of the title, the Exes, comes into being when
singer/guitarist and sometime art student Lilly conceives of a
group in which everyone once went out with another band member. Her
idea appeals to Hank, her ex-boyfriend, largely because he realizes
that his attraction to Lilly's wildness, her desperation to become
famous, is more of a ``musical crush'' than a personal one. When
they win over Shaz, a bisexual bassist who proves the most
musically adept of the group, and her unstable ex, Walt, a former
graduate student still raw from a psychiatric hospitalization, the
band _ and the setup _ are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Before long the Exes encounter a modicum of success, but it
takes a while longer for its members to get used to not losing.
Lilly, who grew up poor and socially outcast, learns that what
makes her different _ her ``stink,'' as she calls it _ is also her
creative germ. Shaz keeps trying to reconcile her family-oriented
Islamic upbringing with her sexuality. Walt is just trying to hold
himself together, and Hank, seemingly the most normal Ex, secretly
suspects that his calm suburban upbringing has left him without a
soul. In some way, all four have been outsiders, and at first their
new popularity shocks them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilly grew used to these guys with their never-to-be-shot
movies and their never-to-be-organized benefit concerts. They
wanted to lay claim to you, if only in some imaginary way. For they
had seen something magical glinting out of you when you were up
there on stage, and they wanted credit for having such good
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is sometimes obvious (to anyone who has ever
been in a band) and also very funny. Egos interfere with
songwriting as they once did with dating. Secret alliances form,
and stale resentments heat up. Cold romances rekindle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all these complications are human ones, rather than
musical. And that's what helps this sharp little novel transcend
its setting. The band setup is not only a hip device, replete with
enough name-dropping to appeal to scenesters, it's also a lovely
pressure cooker of emotions. Throw four people into one basement
practice room night after night and see what develops. Add late
hours, liquor, and an occasional motel room, and watch the
combination ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a few only mildly disguised characters and places in
``The Exes'' is a point of interest, but ultimately irrelevant.
Kennedy knows her stuff _ she published her own basically
autobiographical fanzine, called Pagan's Head, for years, turning
the experience into the book ``'Zine: How I Spent Six Years of My
Life in the Underground and Finally Found Myself ... I Think.'' And
yes, local rockers will get a kick out of recognizing the local
music fanzine The Noise (or The Source, as Kennedy calls it) and
wondering if the Satanistas are really the Satanics. But what makes
this book so enjoyable is its author's eye for detail, from the
sweet smell of Cambridge's Necco Factory to the rush of playing
music: ``Suddenly when all the factors are right you suddenly click
in. You're there. You aren't playing the music anymore _ it's going
through you, like electricity. ... You could kill a person by
hitting him with just enough sound at just the right frequency. ...
And sometimes you want that. You want to find the one perfect note
that will shatter everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy roots her people in a real place and time, and works the
humor and in-jokes inherent to these. But she also portrays the
loneliness and aimlessness that come to young adults starting life
in the city. Hip as they are, her people connect and disconnect
like any others, and ``The Exes'' has their beat.

AS ASIAN ECONOMIES TUMBLE, SO DO INVESTORS' PORTFOLIOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Asia's biggest economies text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Collapsing currencies and sinking economies cascaded from
Indonesia to South Korea, robbing US mutual fund investors in Asia
of as much as one-fourth to one-half of the value of their
investments in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second disaster in nine months for investors in Asian
mutual funds. US funds invested in Asia were already pummeled by a
collapse in Asian economies _ and stock markets _ that started a
year ago when Thailand's currency, the baht, plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Only Japan's stock market seemed to float above the pandemonium
_ the Nikkei stock index dipped only slightly in the second
quarter. But the resilient Nikkei masked a severe downturn in the
island country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for Southeast Asia to fully recover, the Japanese must yank
the world's second-biggest economy out of a deflationary spiral fed
by a weak yen, a sinking banking system, and shaky consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The region's entire economy is intricately bound to Japan's
fortunes. Japan buys one-fourth of China's exports. Japanese banks
lend to businesses all over Asia. Malaysian plants owned by
Matsushita, the Japanese electronics giant, produce 5 percent of
Malaysia's income. Global fallout could be severe if the Japanese
yen plunges further and China is forced to devalue its currency,
the yuan. If the yen declines, Chinese exporters would be less able
to compete in world markets with lower-cost Japanese goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan only last month was declared officially in recession,
and policy makers have barely begun to deal with a crisis in its
banking system that could drive its _ and possibly the world's _
economy down further.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist for Salomon Smith
Barney in New York and a specialist in emerging markets, said he
fears that Asia's economic slump may be the worst globally since
the Great Depression of the 1930s. ``I see very few signs of a
turnaround on the horizon,'' Gendreau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two or three years are going to be awful years for
the economies of the Asian region _ there's no doubt about that,''
said Mark Madden, who travels to Asia as manager of a $200 million
emerging markets fund for Pioneer Funds in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Madden predicted investor confidence would grow as
governments tackle banking crises and corporate bankruptcies. When
that begins, investors will ``begin to anticipate an improvement
and a bottoming of things.'' Madden is most optimistic about South
Korea, Thailand, Singapore and, perhaps, Indonesia. China and Hong
Kong ``are much further away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could not bear a repeat of the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, rioting over rising prices for rice and fuel
forced President Suharto to resign in May. South Korea's finance
minister was arrested and charged with the ``crime'' of bringing
the country to the verge of collapse and its financial system to
insolvency. Recipients of aid from the International Monetary Fund
_ Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea _ are suffering from tight
credit. Malaysia's resilient economy is strained. And the condition
of China's banks is in question.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil was disastrous for US investors. After gaining
between 2 percent and 5 percent in the first quarter, all four
major types of Asian funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. in New York declined in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   China funds had the biggest loss among all categories of equity
funds, falling 28.34 percent. Funds invested in the Pacific Rim _
excluding Japan _ dropped 26.93 percent. Funds with diverse Asia
stocks declined 15.95 percent _ their losses were softened by
holdings in Japan. Japan-invested funds declined just 1.18 percent
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst-performing funds were single-country funds
invested in Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore. The WEBS Malaysia
fund managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors in San Francisco lost
46.01 percent in the second quarter and 73.96 percent over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in Asia funds in the fourth quarter of 1997 was
slightly worse: China funds were down 29.41 percent, according to
Lipper: Pacific Rim funds, excluding Japan, were down 28.26
percent; regional funds, down 23.44. Only Japan funds fared much
worse last fall, declining 16.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn has been a big lesson for American investors.
Though some dipped their toes in Japan as early as the 1950s, they
did not become adventurous in emerging markets until the 1990s. US
investors now have $10 billion in nearly 200 such funds.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some who see &UR;  &LR; bright spots amid Asia's gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farrell, head of Asian investments for Guinness Flight
Investment Management Ltd. in London, &UR;  &LR; predicted ``more normal''
economic conditions in Hong Kong, the home of Asia's third-largest
stock market (after Japan and Taiwan). Most important for Hong Kong
and China are continued growth in the United States and Europe,
which fueled recent export growth in the two Asian markets. In
South Korea, he is encouraged by efforts to start the ``painful''
restructuring of the &UR;  &LR; chaebol trading groups, such as electronics
giant Samsung. Malaysian plantations that produce palm oil are
doing well, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he hesitated to predict when a regionwide recovery would
lift the most troubled economies _ Indonesia, Thailand, and South
Korea. Said Farrell, in a moment of frankness: ``Who knows?''

WHEN THE LANDSCAPE WAS THE STAR OF THE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONUMENT VALLEY, Utah -- In 1924, Harry Goulding and his wife,
Leona, opened a trading post here and lived simply with their
Navajo neighbors amid the stark remoteness of this beautiful
valley. But in the Depression of the 1930s, ochre rock and
vermilion dust fed no one, so amid deepening poverty, Goulding
sought help in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He heard that United Artists was scouting locations for a new
Western. Goulding camped at the studio until he could show a
portfolio of black-and-white photographs by Josef Muench to the
director, John Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Born Sean Aloysius Feeney to immigrants from Galway in Cape
Elizabeth, Maine, Ford had never seen such sights, not even on the
screen of the Dreamland Theater in Portland. In Hollywood, where he
changed his name to John Ford, he eventually directed 136 movies,
34 of them westerns, the most memorable of which he filmed in
Monument Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the cameras rolled for ``Stagecoach'' 60 years ago, making
a star of the actor who played the Ringo Kid, a Midwesterner who
also changed his name, from Marion Morrison to John Wayne.
``Stagecoach'' was a box-office hit for Ford, Wayne, and Monument
Valley. Producer Walter Wanger hired Navajo riders to play Apache
warriors and a few weeks' work on ``Stagecoach'' earned tribesmen a
total of $48,000, a hefty payroll in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can say that the real star of my westerns has
always been the land,'' Ford once said. The modern director who
follows that philosophy is Robert Redford. In ``A River Runs
Through it'' and ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Redford's Montana is the
star.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford-Wayne collaboration flowered as vividly as the
cliffrose and purple sage in Monument Valley. In Paris, ``The
Searchers'' is studied nearly every day at the Sorbonne; Left Bank
bookshops sell solemn tomes on the existential odyssey of Ethan
Edwards, the ornery cowboy played by Wayne in the 1956 film.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a cavalry trilogy portrayed Wayne posed against higher
command. In ``Rio Grande'' and ``Fort Apache'' the Duke battles and
curses the Army's bureaucracy. ``She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,'' his
first cavalry epic in Technicolor, also stressed Ford's elegaic
longing for frontier values. Next to Goulding's Lodge stands a
movie-set stone cabin, a shrine for Duke fans, which housed Wayne's
character, Captain Nathan Brittles, a cavalry officer on the verge
of retirement who faces one last patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Among visitors here is one whose faulty recall evokes ``A
Child's Christmas in Wales'' by Dylan Thomas, who could ``never
remember whether it snowed for six days and nights when I was 12 or
for 12 days and nights when I was 6.'' In a vanishing American
demographic, many a moviegoer can not remember whether he saw ``She
Wore A Yellow Ribbon'' 10 times when he was 8 or eight times when
he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne once said that ``For the big screen, for the real outdoor
dramas, you have to do it where God put the West.'' The 30,000
acres of majestic buttes and mesas have attracted other movies,
from ``Easy Rider'' to ``Thelma and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile above sea level, the austere land where Arizona and Utah
converge with Colorado and New Mexico attracts tourists who gaze at
the pictographs, painted images, and petroglyphs, carvings, left in
the caves of nearby Mystery Valley by the Anasazi, called ``the
ancient ones'' by the Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur and professional photographers arrive daily, drawn by
the architectural splendor of the brooding monoliths. Don Imus and
Fred Imus, raised in Arizona, followed Muench's trail and published
in 1997 the results of their Nikon-and-Hasselblad forays in ``Two
Guys, Four Corners.'' A stunning sunrise portrait of the valley is
captioned: ``The Southwestern equivalent of the New York City
skyline minus anything with Donald Trump's name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid its towering cathedrals, formed by millions of years of
dust and wind, the place where God put the West has no room for
Mammon.

`ADULT' SHOPS, BARS BRACE FOR NYC CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any day now, city inspectors are going to march into
Billy's Topless, a Manhattan bar where women have been dancing
bare-breasted for a quarter-century, and order its current crew of
young ladies to slip into something a little more decent.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are going to be marching all over town that day,
enforcing a zoning law that bans ``adult establishments'' within
500 feet of a school, church, residence, or another adult
establishment. It is a restriction that spells doom for all but a
couple of dozen of New York City's 155 strip joints, porn shops,
peep shows, and XXX video salons.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation was passed by the City Council more than three
years ago, but legal challenges invoking the First Amendment's
guarantee of free expression have kept it holed up in the courts
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, a federal appeals court, like all the state
courts before it, ruled the measure constitutional. Soon the
appeals court will issue a technical document, called a mandate.
Then, city officials say, enforcement will be quick and decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Anthony, the 78-year-old owner of Billy's Topless, stood
behind his bar the other day, taking a long drag on another
cigarette and shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about this,'' he said of the new law, ``is
that Mayor Giuliani made a deal with Disney that they'd clean up
42nd Street. I have no objections to that. I applauded that _ 42nd
Street was a whole bunch of sleaze. But don't say the whole city
has to do the same. You'll put a lot of people out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony has been running Billy's, on the corner of 24th Street
and Sixth Avenue, a rather undeveloped section of Chelsea, for 22
years. (The original Billy died in 1979, shortly after selling him
the place.) For 10 years before then, he was an agent who provided
the dancers to Billy's and several places like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I got into this profession was I used to make
costumes,'' he said. ``One day, a girl comes in and says, `Can you
make me a two-piece go-go outfit?' This was more than 30 years ago,
so I say, `What's that?' Turns out she worked as a go-go dancer for
an agent, he started coming up to my shop, I got interested in what
he was doing, and that's how it started.''
</P>
<P>
   He slapped his right hand on the bar, exposing a tattoo on his
knuckles _ a devil with a halo over its head. ``I got that 52 years
ago in Panama, on my way back from World War II,'' he said. ``I
call it `The Good Devil.' It's me.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up. ``I mean, what's wrong with this business?'' he
asked, spreading his arms to encompass the place. ``This is a
neighborhood bar. People come in here, have a drink, enjoy
themselves. We don't have any hookers, we don't have any drugs,
nobody's hustling anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   When the law takes hold, Anthony will not have to shut down. He
could relocate to some site in a city-specified ``manufacturing
area,'' ``but that would put me way over on 12th Avenue,'' he said
dismissively. ``Who's going to go over there?''
</P>
<P>
   Or he could have the dancers put on a few more square inches of
clothing. The law is anatomically explicit on what areas of the
body have to be covered for a place like Billy's to stay in
business. Basically, ``Billy's girls,'' as a sign in the bar calls
them, would have to put on something akin to bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's what I'll do,'' Anthony said with a shrug. ``I'll
comply. I don't plan on retiring, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The law provides similar escape hatches for the XXX video
arcades. If they adjust their stock so that pornography takes up
less than 40 percent of the floor space, then they can stay where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer who is representing a
consortium of adult establishments in the court battles over the
zoning law, said last week that most of his clients will probably
make the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   One Fahringer client, the owner of Manhattan Video, a triple-X
palace in midtown, just down the street from a Lord &AMP; Taylor
department store, put it like this: ``Hey, they want me to sell
violence and horror instead of sex? OK. I'll sell violence and
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, 1996, authorities shut down all 38 of the porn
stores that dominated 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth
Avenue. Since then, the Street and the whole Times Square district
have undergone a transformation few had thought possible _ from a
din of drugs, crime, and prostitution to an urban theme park of
comparative wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup was accomplished through the bluntest of
instruments. A state agency condemned the whole block as a
``disaster area,'' took title to the properties, and evicted the
tenants and owners, reimbursing them with a modest estimate of
``fair market value.''
</P>
<P>
   This tactic would have been too costly to apply to the whole
city. So, like several other cities, New York moved to control the
rest of the porn industry through zoning laws. The Supreme Court
had ruled that regulating porn shops is not unconstitutional as
long as it can be demonstrated that their current locations affect
crime, commerce, or safety. City lawyers, business organizations,
and neighborhood action groups set out to make the case.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the inspectors make their move, the controversy will
not be over. Fahringer is still hoping the federal appeals court
will consider his petititon for another rehearing on the issue. If
that fails, he will take the case to the US Supreme Court. ``We've
already prepared our papers for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues could spin out for years or decades. For example,
if an inspector finds that a video shop carries more than 40
percent pornography, the owner could challenge the finding, arguing
that some portion of the tapes are not pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute doesn't delineate clearly,'' Fahringer said,
adding with a chuckle, ``We'll have a lot of fun in compliance.''

HIGH DRAMA TO LOW FARCE, MOB CASE EVOLVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the astounding allegations of Stephen Flemmi first
made headlines last summer, a skeptical public weighed the word of
the veteran gangster against that of the FBI, which Flemmi accused
of unethical, even criminal, conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The gangster lost _ at first.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom held that Flemmi's most startling claims _
that he and his criminal sidekick, James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger, had
paid off an FBI supervisor and were tipped off to investigations
during their years as the bureau's marquee informants _ simply
couldn't be true.
</P>
<P>
   A terse, two-sentence statement issued by the head of the Boston
office of the FBI last June reminded the public that those claims
were made by ``an individual who is a co-defendant in a pending
federal racketeering case.'' That seemed to speak for many within
and outside of the law-enforcement community.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after months of federal court hearings sparked in large
part by Flemmi's allegations, most of what initially seemed
unimaginable has been supported by a first-hand source: former FBI
supervisor John M. Morris, who ran the bureau's Boston organized
crime squad in the late 1970s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark L. Wolf has suspended the hearings until August
without hearing from Flemmi or the mobster's longtime bureau
contact, former special agent John Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is expected to testify. But Connolly _ who unlike Morris
has not been given immunity from prosecution _ invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination when called as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Still, in interviews and through his lawyer, Connolly has
denied key points of Morris's testimony, including his alleged
involvement in funneling money to Morris and telling Bulger and
Flemmi about investigations or indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Connolly has acknowledged that Bulger and Flemmi were given
permission to continue their gambling and loan-sharking operations
while working as FBI informants.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Flemmi or Connolly, the hearings have had moments
of high drama and low farce:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Morris admitting that he told Connolly an informant had
implicated Bulger and Flemmi in a murder, fully expecting the
information would get back to them. The informant wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Morris's wife ordering him to throw out a silver ice bucket, a
gift from Flemmi. Morris and two other agents planting a fake bomb
under the car of a reluctant witness. &UR;  &LR; FBI agents welcoming Bulger
and Flemmi as dinner guests _ and Flemmi's elderly parents
reciprocating. And Bulger's brother, Billy, then the state Senate
president, wandering next door to the Flemmis just as one party was
breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stunning testimony came from Morris, who retired
from the bureau in 1995 and who now lives in Tennessee. During
eight days on the witness stand in April, Morris admitted that he
had alerted Flemmi and Bulger to an investigation targeting
bookmakers in 1988 and had asked a federal prosecutor to keep them
out of a 1979 indictment for fixing horse races.
</P>
<P>
   Morris had taken $5,000 from Bulger during one of the cozy
``get-togethers'' Flemmi described in an affidavit, plus $2,000
that Flemmi hadn't mentioned _ $1,000 Morris asked for to pay for a
rendezvous with his girlfriend in Georgia and another $1,000 hidden
in a case of wine.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris denied that he alerted Bulger and Flemmi to the 1995
extortion and racketeering indictment that landed Flemmi in jail
and sent Bulger on the run. And the former agent said he never told
the pair they were free to commit any crime as long as they didn't
kill anyone, as Flemmi claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than three months of hearings suggest the FBI wasn't
eager to lock up its prized snitches.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nearly 200 documents, many of them from Bulger's and Flemmi's
previously secret FBI files, and the testimony of FBI agents and
supervisors suggest a hands-off policy, or at least a willingness
to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the alleged shakedown of a South Boston
real estate agent by Bulger and two associates in the late '80s,
complete with threats at gunpoint and chilling references to body
bags.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The alleged victim agreed to secretly record meetings and to
testify against Bulger and the others, but later backed away after
the FBI says the threats stopped. There is nothing in the FBI files
on the case, even though the realtor was interviewed at least
twice, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   And three or four years before a 1990 indictment charging 51
people with running four major South Boston cocaine rings, the FBI
had been told that Bulger was extorting money from drug dealers. A
year before the raids, an FBI agent submitted a report on one drug
dealer paying ``tribute'' to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   But when the indictments were returned, the only mention of
Bulger was a quote in the indictment from a defendant. Unless
Bulger got his cut, the defendant said, ``You didn't deal drugs, or
you ended up dead.'' Attorneys for Flemmi and his three
codefendants in the 1995 case, including reputed New England Mafia
boss Francis P. Salemme, argue that the FBI ignored Bulger's and
Flemmi's crimes because they had been promised immunity in exchange
for information they provided on their criminal rivals _ especially
those in the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, equating the FBI's inaction with a formal pledge of
immunity remains a tough case to make, legal experts say. There is
no document to prove such a pledge, and a string of FBI agents and
supervisors have denied they ever gave Bulger and Flemmi permission
to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a stretch,'' said Rosanna Cavallaro, an associate
professor at Suffolk University Law School. ``I don't think the
fact that they turned a blind eye is the equivalent of a promise of
immunity. That's a leap for a judge to make.''
</P>
<P>
   To do so, she said, would create ``a pretty troubling
standard,'' in effect transforming ``a good-buddy relationship into
a kind of de facto immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one former federal prosecutor, ``Even if the FBI looked the
other way for 10, 20, or how many years doesn't mean they can't go
after him in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorney Robert Sheketoff, who has represented
organized crime figures and whose law partner, Kimberly Homan, has
assisted in Flemmi's defense, sees it differently. ``I think what
matters is if there was an agreement, implicit or explicit,'' he
said. ``People ... can share the same mental state without any
piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheketoff says the hearings have provided a valuable public
service in exposing ``the seamy side of law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the general public and the legal community
understand that there's a lot of dishonesty in this business,'' he
said, ``and it's not just the criminals.''

COMMUNITY GROUPS POISED TO QUESTION MERGER OF NATIONSBANK,
BANKAMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most bank mergers are dry, routine affairs. But
a political firefight could erupt in California over the proposed
$60 billion acquisition of San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp. by
NationsBank Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups fear the merger will lead to poorer banking
service and less money invested in California's low-income and
minority neighborhoods, charges denied by both banks, which claim
strong records of community lending.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will heat up Thursday and Friday during a public
meeting in San Francisco of the Federal Reserve Bank. At least 200
people who support or oppose the bank deal are scheduled to appear,
said Fed spokeswoman Carol Eckert.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have jumped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress _ including California Democrats
Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters, both members of the House Banking
Committee _ sent a letter Tuesday to NationsBank Chairman Hugh
McColl, expressing concern about the impact of the merger on
banking services to low-income and minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Association of Bay Area Governments held
a hearing last month to study the economic impact of the merger.
And the Los Angeles City Council recently passed a resolution
calling for public hearings on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers can't stop the planned merger, but they can pressure
federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve Board and the
Treasury and Justice departments, to look more closely at the
acquisition. They could also rally public opinion against a
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can up the ante and put a lot of pressure on NationsBank if
we're not satisfied with their response,'' said Kate Emanual,
legislative director for Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif. ``I
would hope they would want to do the right thing, and not just blow
off congressional concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent wave of bank deals has drawn congressional attention,
but politicians appear to have little influence on the process.
Last year, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and other powerful lawmakers
objected strongly to the $16 billion sale of Philadelphia's
CoreStates Financial Corp. to First Union Corp., another Charlotte
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed approved the merger anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether political pressure might delay or sway the outcome
of a merger application, Fred Bagwell, a Fed vice president in
Richmond, Va., said: ``The comments of local political leaders will
be taken into consideration, along with all other comments.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger between NationsBank and BankAmerica, announced in
April, would create the nation's second-largest bank with $570
billion in assets and 29 million customers. The new bank would keep
the name of the venerable San Francisco bank, but its corporate
headquarters would be in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives hope that regulators will approve the merger by
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires banks to make
loans in all neighborhoods in which they have branches. If a bank
has a poor community lending record to minority and low-income
areas, regulators can kill a merger proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the NationsBank-BankAmerica merger proposal, bank
executives announced a $350 billion, 10-year commitment nationwide
in community development loans and other investments. The plan
includes $180 billion for small businesses, $115 billion for
affordable housing, $25 billion for economic development and $30
billion for consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, BankAmerica has had a good reputation for
banking in low-income and minority areas. Community groups and
politicians fear that NationsBank may neglect or abandon its
community investments in California.
</P>
<P>
   But NationsBank executives defend their record of community
lending.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has made more than $25 billion in community investment
loans over the past five years, including $5.2 billion in mortgage
loans to minority and low-income borrowers, according to
NationsBank spokesman Scott Scredon.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also has built 14,000 affordable homes for $300 million
and invested another $340 million in 10,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who do business with us know our record is very
strong,'' said Catherine Bessant, president of NationsBank's
community investment group. ``We're the unknowns in California, but
we believe over time we'll build the kind of credibility that we've
enjoyed in other markets.''

MILITARY DOUBLE STANDARD CHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sergeant Major Gene McKinney, once the Army's top
enlisted man, was court-martialed last year for sexual misconduct.
Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, the Air Force's first female B-52 pilot,
was discharged in 1997 for having an affair with a subordinate's
husband. But in the swirl of allegations of sexual offenses by one
of its generals, the Army allowed Major General David R.E. Hale to
resign in February with full honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old boys protecting the old boys, that's what it
smacks of,'' said Susan Barnes, a Denver lawyer who represented
Sergeant Major Brenda Hoster, one of six women who brought charges
of sexual harassment against McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   A day after disclosure of a scathing report from the Pentagon's
Inspector General finding evidence that Hale behaved improperly or
committed adultery with the wives of four officers under his
command and lied about it, the question for the Pentagon Tuesday
was whether it applies a double standard for punishment based on
rank, race, or gender.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokeman Kenneth Bacon denied the brass played
favorites or gave special treatment to Hale, who was the Army's
deputy inspector general when he retired. Hale has denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double standards are always very tricky, and it's easy to use
the term,'' Bacon said Tuesday. ``When the facts are known here,
people will see that it's not a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   On orders from Defense Secretary William Cohen, the department's
general counsel is reviewing whether Hale's retirement request was
handled in a ``fair and adequate'' way, Bacon said. He emphasized,
however, that the review will not focus on the role of the Army
chief of staff, General Dennis Reimer, in allowing Hale to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Pentagon, that decision was viewed by some as at
least a mistake and at worst as one more sign that the
male-dominated military still ignores criticism of its often clumsy
handling of sexual misconduct cases and its well-documented culture
of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For General Reimer to have let Hale go out the door with his
stars intact looks very suspicious,'' said Elaine Donnelly,
president of the Center for Military Readiness, a Pentagon watchdog
group. ``I disagree that he should not be the focus of an
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, thinks so, too. She
has summoned Reimer for a meeting to get details of why he allowed
Hale to retire while allegations of misconduct were outstanding and
a Pentagon investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ``Today'' show in May, Reimer denied as
``absolutely untrue'' accusations that he made ``special promises''
to Hale, and he defended his decision as one ``based upon the facts
available to me at that particular point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reports the Pentagon was probing, Reimer acknowledged,
was that Hale was being ``stalked'' by Donnamaria Carpino, a
military wife who had filed a criminal complaint against Hale in
January. Carpino charged that Hale had blackmailed her into having
sex by threatening to bring adultery charges against her husband,
an Army colonel under Hale's command at the NATO base in Izmir,
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   According to the inspector general's report, which the Pentagon
released Tuesday after it was circulated on Capitol Hill and
leaked, Hale had a consensual, sexual relationship with Carpino
from March to June 1997, while Hale was married and was the
commanding officer of Carpino's husband. The report said the affair
violated good order and discipline and the military's code of
justice, which prohibits adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the report said, Hale lied about why he had approved
Pentagon-paid travel for Carpino to the United States. The two met
in Boston while Carpino was supposed to be visiting an ailing
mother in Connecticut. Hale, 53, also allegedly lied to
investigators that he was single when he met Carpino. In fact, his
divorce did not become final until the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has become the basis for a criminal
investigation by the Army, asserts that Hale romanced and had
``inappropriate relationships'' with wives of subordinate officers
during postings in Hawaii and Turkey. ``Witnesses told us that
(Hale's) actions created a command climate that was `ugly,'
`uncomfortable' and ... `a Peyton Place,''' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesmen insist Hale could be returned to active duty to
face formal charges and even a court-martial. It's an issue with
the Army because McKinney, who is black, had vigorously argued that
high-level officials similarly charged but part of the military
network had been allowed to retire without penalty, while he was
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney retired with full benefits after being acquitted of 18
counts of misconduct. He was convicted of one count of obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the civilian world, the military has strict prohibitions
against adultery because it can undermine order and discipline.
Flinn's case drew protests because the female flier seemed unfairly
singled out for punishment. In fact, her fraternization with the
spouse of a subordinate, and her lying about it, made her a prime
candidate for a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force General Joseph Ralston, on the other hand, was not
punished _ though he lost his bid to be chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff _ when it was revealed that he had a lengthy affair
in the 1980s with a civilian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the lawyer who represented one of the women who brought
charges against McKinney, said that too often the Pentagon hides
behind a charge of adultery when the more serious issue is military
leaders who abuse power.

BETTORS ON THE NET MAKE A SPORT OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, the very idea _ gambling on famous people dying _ seems
sick. The players themselves admit it. Macabre, morbid, all that.
And yet, death comes to us all. So why not get a bet down on who'll
go 10 toes up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't wish for anybody to die,'' says Jake
Maruby, who runs ``Dying for Dollars,'' a popular ``death pool'' on
the Internet. ``But nothing we do is going to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grim Reaper harvests on his own schedule, but who says you
can't indulge in a bit of spectral speculation? If you were one of
the shrewd bettors who figured that Chris Farley or Princess Di
might be on the 1997 list, or Roy Rogers on the 1998 list, you hit
the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   If you had Wendy O. Williams or Tammy Wynette or Sonny Bono this
year, you chalked up big points. Frank Sinatra? Dr. Spock? Who
didn't have them? And everybody always has the Pope. He's what they
call a ``perennial.''
</P>
<P>
   Death pools have been around since at least the 19th century.
``It's a game, a very amusing game that they play in every
drawing-room in Paris whenever an `Immortal' passes on,'' Georges
Duroy says to Madame Walter in Guy de Maupassant's novel ``Bel
Ami.'' ``The game of Death and the Forty Old Men.''
</P>
<P>
   The game of Death has gone cyber now, and it includes anyone who
might ever have rated a page in People or 30 seconds on ``ET.'' At
least a dozen death pools with names like Celebrity Death Pool, A
Date With Charon Dead Pool, Derby Dead Pool, and Dead! are now on
the Internet, abetted by master lists like the Dead People Server
and You're Outta Here! that keep track of who's still living and
who has joined the choir invisible. (James Mason is dead; Jackie
Mason is alive.)
</P>
<P>
   While pools differ on format, most involve submitting a list of
up to 50 people ``marked for death'' in the upcoming calendar year.
The more prescient the pick (like rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996), the
more points.
</P>
<P>
   Some pools come with modest cash payoffs; others merely provide
bragging rights and 15 minutes of cyberfame. ``Of course we're not
rooting for these people to die,'' Ron Frey says on his site, The
Death Pool. ``We just want the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Morbid or not, death pools are undeniably intriguing. ``People
will tell me `That's sick,''' says Ray Markey, a New Jersey
computer net-worker who runs the Philadelphia Dead Pool. ``Then
they say, `Well, can I see the list?' Then they say, `You know who
you don't have?' Then they say, `How do I get in?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghoulpooling'' is, as Maruby concedes, a guilty pleasure.
Still, betting against the living is as American as the
Constitution. Why else did the Founding Fathers dream up the idea
of a vice president, who is frequently described as being ``a
heartbeat away'' from the Oval Office? Why else would we have life
insurance?
</P>
<P>
   ``People take out policies against death and dismemberment,''
says Melody Rutherford, a San Francisco computer worker who's been
involved with the Celebrity Death Pool since the early '70s.
``You're betting that you're going to die before you pay up. And
the company is betting that you won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's not as if the players are bumping people off to
move themselves up in the standings. That was the plot of ``The
Dead Pool,'' the 1988 Dirty Harry movie in which death pool
celebrities were mysteriously turning up dead. ``We frown on
that,'' says Rutherford. ``You wouldn't get any points if you
killed somebody. You'd be disqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Death pools may be macabre, but they do have rules. Decedents
must be notable (or notorious) enough to have their passing
mentioned on television or in a major newsmagazine. They must be
certifiably dead (not just presumed) and must have been human. No
cartoon characters or animals.
</P>
<P>
   There are also rules that govern betting on (okay, against) the
living. Nobody on death row. Nobody whose government has put a
price on his head (though author Salman Rushdie is fair game, since
he's on a religious hit list). And nobody who's just received a
artificial major organ. ``No ba-boon hearts,'' says Maruby.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, anyone from Madonna to the Queen Mum is fair
game. Actuarial strategies abound. Most ghoulpoolers choose ``the
old, the feeble, the overweight, the addicted.'' Others ``chase
ambulances,'' picking celebrities who've had strokes (Gene Kelly),
developed cancer (Frank Zappa) or contracted AIDS (Randy Shilts).
</P>
<P>
   Others do ``lifestyle analyses'' and select healthy people with
unhealthy tendencies (``the young and the restless''), like rock
stars who snort coke and drive Porsches at 120 mph. Still others
pick totalitarian dictators with bloody hands (the ``live by the
sword, die by the sword'' theory) or violent types due for ``karmic
payback.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Vincent Price to play the most extreme (and
endless) game of all. Organizers say most ghoulpoolers are between
20 and 40 and that as many women play as men. ``They're the people
next door,'' says Maruby, who has more than 80 players in his Dying
for Dollars pool, which costs $25 (``just pennies a day'') to
enter. ``They just have a different slant on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghoulpoolers pore through newspapers and magazines and watch
``ET'' for hints that someone famous might be heading for a ``dirt
nap.'' Street rioting in a Third World country whose ruler has been
propped up by the CIA since the '70s. A punk rocker who's off to
Hazelden for his third detox. An actress who's back on chemo. An
ex-ballplayer who's too frail to make it to his Hall of Fame
enshrinement.
</P>
<P>
   They check the Noted Nonagenarians and Centenarians Web site for
anyone on borrowed time. They consult the Dead People Server to
make sure it was James Earl Ray and not James Earl Jones who
crossed the Styx. And they're scrupulous about keeping up with the
obits. ``First thing every day, they log on to the CNN Web page and
search for the word `dead,''' says Ray Markey, who has 153 members
in his Philadelphia Dead Pool and 250 more who want in for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Non-poolers usually recoil in disgust at the idea of marking
people for death. ``They pause and they say, `That's really sick
and morbid,''' says Maruby, who lives outside of New York City and
works for a publishing company. ``Then they stop and say: `What
about Milton Berle?'''
</P>
<P>
   Berle _ Great-Great-Granduncle Miltie by now _ is 89, after all.
Most ghoulpoolers have chips on his number. They're also betting
against Muhammad Ali, Fidel Castro, Kirk Douglas, Robert Downey
Jr., Rev. Billy Graham, Katharine Hepburn, Bob Hope, Saddam
Hussein, Richard Pryor, Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor, Strom
Thurmond, and Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on ``perennials'' like Hope and Reagan, though, is like
betting on favorites at the race track. It's brainless and,
usually, fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hawking, the author-physicist with Lou Gehrig disease,
has already lived more than three times longer than medical tables
say he should have. ``Keith Richards,'' Maruby says. ``People have
been losing money on him for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teasers'' who keep eluding their demise (remember the endless
``FRANCO TAKES TURN FOR WORSE'' headlines?) drive ghoulpoolers
crazy. So connoisseurs would rather score big with an exotic bet on
someone like Pol Pot, whom most folks had forgotten was still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne Gacy, Les Aspin, Herve Villechaize, and Lee Atwater
all carried heavy points when they booked passage with Charon. This
year's long shots include James Brown, Bob Dylan, Hugh Hefner,
Jerry Lewis, and Frank Perdue.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, betting humans as though they're Preakness entrants can
require some soul-searching. ``Am I ready to put aside that
puritanical side of me that says this is disrespectful of the
living, not to mention exploitive of the dead?'' Ron Frey muses on
The Death Pool.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``harvesting stiffs'' may be macabre, but graveyard
humor goes back at least as far as Lazarus. Shakespeare has dying
Mercutio cracking wise (``Ask for me tomorrow and you will find me
a grave man.'') and Hamlet holding poor Yorick's skull as though it
were a cantaloupe. So what's wrong with a decedents derby?
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Oh my God, that's terrible,''' says Melody
Rutherford. ``Then they say: `Bob Hope.'''

CATHOLIC SCHOOLS SUPPORTER MAKES CASE FOR EDUCATION WITH VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catholic educators and their supporters were elated last month
when the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that government-funded
vouchers for private religious schools were constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Catholic educators see a small crack in the door
between public and private schools that has been firmly shut for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Groome, a theologian and one of the country's foremost
authorities on Catholic education, also sees cause for optimism.
But Groome, a professor at Boston College, argues that the country
is poorer for failing to understand why Catholic education is so
appealing to Catholics and non-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, as a system of education, there probably is no
more successful system in the history of humankind,'' said Groome,
author of a recently released book, ``Educating for Life: A
Spiritual Vision for Every Teacher and Parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Groome noted that there is plenty of empirical evidence showing
that Catholic schools outperform public schools, particularly when
it comes to educating children in some of the country's most
impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his latest book to make the case that what ails public
schools is a lack of precisely what Catholic education emphasizes _
the education of the whole student, including nurturing the soul
and shaping character.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has been in the business of education for
nearly 2,000 years and so, Groome believes, has a place in any
serious discussion of how to educate the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced there isn't a value or virtue or core curriculum
taught in a Catholic school that couldn't be taught in a public
school,'' said Groome, whose writings have had a significant
influence on Catholic school curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Groome said, any mention of values in the same breath
as public education too often leads immediately to the belief that
advocates are trying to push religion into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic education, when true to its historical roots, isn't
about proselytizing or forcing dogma on students, Groome said.
``The Catholic tradition stands roundly and soundly in favor of
critical reasoning and getting people to think and to think for
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Catholic education's success, Groome believes, is
its embrace of the ``humanizing'' function of education, an idea
that can be traced to ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest Greek philosopher, Plato, described teaching as
`turning the soul' of learners, and he meant touching and shaping
their innermost `being' _ their identity and agency,'' Groome
writes in his book. ``For Plato, we become and act most humanly as
our souls are turned toward the true, the good, and the beautiful,
and education is a crucial catalyst in this `turning.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is what good teachers have been been able to do: Go beyond
just filling students' brains with facts, to reach to their core,
to touch their heads and hearts. Catholic education has succeeded,
Groome argues, by focusing on seven R's: reading `riting,
`rithmetic, reverence, respect, rhetoric and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Groome also makes a clear distinction between religious and
spiritual values. While religious values may concern a specific
faith tradition, the spiritual values are broader. ``Spirituality
is that which appeals to the depths of the human soul'' and that
need not be bound by any traditional faith systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses arguments that spiritiual values in education are
incompatible with the separation of church and state. ``When you
look at the Constitution, at the Declaration of Independence, they
presume great spiritual values,'' Groome said. ``The founding
fathers presumed that the educational system would be grounded in
great spiritual values.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the philosophy that permeates public education today,
Groome asserts, promotes a, ``narrow kind of individualism,
consumerism, a deep materialism, and very often a dangerous kind of
selfishness and parochialism.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is a more holistic educational philosophy, one
grounded in spiritual values. ``There is still false liberalism
that paralyzes us into believing we cannot impose values on our
children,'' Groome said. ``And that's just baloney. It's
irresponsible and it's disastrous.''

   _Jeff Smith, who has achieved national fame as the ``Frugal
Gourmet'' and who is an ordained Methodist minister, has reached a
settlement with several men who accused Smith of sexually
assaulting them as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   By settling, Smith avoided a civil trial scheduled to begin next
week in Tacoma, Wash. Smith had vowed to fight the allegations,
charging that his accusers were ``bloodsuckers'' and ``crooks''
bent on ruining his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, George Heitman, said he was unhappy with
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dissatified with the terms of confidentiality of the
agreement,'' he told reporters. ``In fact, I'm kind of dissatified
with the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting as a university chaplain and then a restaurateur in
Tacoma more than 30 years ago, Smith went on to become a national
TV personality and a best-selling author. His ``Frugal Gourmet''
cooking show at one time reached more than 7 million households
through syndication on local public television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasts of his last series of shows were suspended last year
following the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Six men accused Smith of sexually molesting them when they
worked for him at his Tacoma restaurant, the Chaplain's Pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has not been charged with any crimes. It is not clear yet
what the impact of the allegations and the settlement will be on
Smith's television career.

WHERE JOURNALISM IS A LIFE-AND-DEATH MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England -- Like Alka-Setzer after a leaden meal, a
change of scenery can bring blessed relief from even the japeries
of jaded journalists.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of navel-gazing and breast-beating over the
career wrecks of assorted miscreants in US journalism, it was
refreshing to sit in on a panel discussion about journalism that
matters.
</P>
<P>
   There are still life-and-death decisions made by editors and
reporters in many parts of the world, as the toll of slaughtered
journalists attests each year. Less fatal, but no less threatening,
are the subtler pressures meant to remind the truth-teller that
one's job, promotion or longterm economic prospects can be dashed
by an overly-aggressive presentation of unpalatable facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis has produced a series of challenges
to the journalists of those countries ranging from Indonesia to the
Philippines that were nearly capsized by the Japanese tailspin.
Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, and the other smaller players have
been rocked.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Reuters Foundation reunion of journalism fellows from
the past 15 years at Oxford University, the tensions of
contemporary journalism were described by editors who get death
threats, intimidating hints from superiors, and heavy-handed
treatment by their governments.
</P>
<P>
   The trivial pursuits of American journalism's infatuation with
the ongoing sitcom cast of Bill-Monica-Linda-Kenneth-Paula-Hillary
were hardly raised. You can't very well horn your way into a
discussion of death threats, career loss and being blamed for a run
on the bank your publisher owns, by raising the weighty issues of
Zippergate.
</P>
<P>
   In too many other countries, they don't shoot the piano player,
they shoot, stab or toss acid in the face of the journalist for
pointing out connections that malefactors of power would prefer
left in the shadows. And I came away from a recent morning's earful
about Asia with the sinking feeling that Asia's economic turmoil is
deeper and more perilous for us than I'd realized.
</P>
<P>
   If what I heard is correct, and it rang with truth for me, then
the extent of rot in the economic timbers of Asia is greater than
we comprehend. In country after country, bureaucrats and bankers
conspire _ sometimes in the belief they are defending national
interests _ to cover up the extent of the weaknesses in their
currencies, banking structures and statistics of real wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Asian journalists are constantly pressured to help the
government save face, by accepting unchallenged some patently
inflated government numbers, or by refusing to print or highlight
rumors of impending bank collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's anemic government offers the worst example of a
bureaucracy that cannot summon the will and nerve to confront its
banking collapse head-on. The successive pronouncements in Tokyo of
this bid to prop up the yen, or that tax cut, or of still another
public works program, do not convince the hard-eyed speculators who
lay in wait to ambush the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's weak political system cannot yet come to grips with the
banks' refusal to come clean about the extent of their
nonperforming loans. And as Aaron Zitner spelled out in Sunday's
Globe, bank-owned stocks have fallen by half over 10 years, as
property values plummeted 70 percent. Rare is the banker who wants
to admit his assets are halved, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China was a nine on a scale of 10
for a number of reasons, including atmospherics, domestic political
fallout in both countries, and a chance to change the topic from
you-know what. But the extensive and deftly executed state visit by
Clinton and his thousand-or-so camp followers reset
Chinese-American relations on a much more solid _ and much more
necessary _ footing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's swoon has effectively taken the world's second-largest
economy off the board, at least until the lame Japanese political
system can face the harsh realities. That puts the great Chinese
giant much higher in the economic scheme of things, because 1.2
billion people will drink a lot of Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have stuffed $87 billion in foreign mutual funds to
take advantage of the run-ups that have occurred over the last
decade. But political turmoil (Indonesia, South Korea), oil price
drops, hostile weather for some crops, and the vagaries of the
economic cycle have hammered many Asian investments. Funds
concentrating on Europe went up 28 percent in the last two qarters,
while Chinese funds were down 26 percent, and Latin America's
dropped 18.
</P>
<P>
   The average Pacific-Japanese fund was off 24 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because their government is cowering in advance of upcoming
local elections, there is not much confidence that the carping of
the US and other powers will hound the Japanese into plugging the
leaks in their banks. So you'd have to guess it will get at least a
little worse before it gets a little better.

MILITARY DOUBLE STANDARD CHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sergeant Major Gene McKinney, once the Army's top
enlisted man, was court-martialed last year for sexual misconduct.
Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, the Air Force's first female B-52 pilot,
was discharged in 1997 for having an affair with a subordinate's
husband. But in the swirl of allegations of sexual offenses by one
of its generals, the Army allowed Major General David R.E. Hale to
resign in February with full honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old boys protecting the old boys, that's what it
smacks of,'' said Susan Barnes, a Denver lawyer who represented
Sergeant Major Brenda Hoster, one of six women who brought charges
of sexual harassment against McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   A day after disclosure of a scathing report from the Pentagon's
Inspector General finding evidence that Hale behaved improperly or
committed adultery with the wives of four officers under his
command and lied about it, the question for the Pentagon Tuesday
was whether it applies a double standard for punishment based on
rank, race, or gender.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokeman Kenneth Bacon denied the brass played
favorites or gave special treatment to Hale, who was the Army's
deputy inspector general when he retired. Hale has denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double standards are always very tricky, and it's easy to use
the term,'' Bacon said Tuesday. ``When the facts are known here,
people will see that it's not a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   On orders from Defense Secretary William Cohen, the department's
general counsel is reviewing whether Hale's retirement request was
handled in a ``fair and adequate'' way, Bacon said. He emphasized,
however, that the review will not focus on the role of the Army
chief of staff, General Dennis Reimer, in allowing Hale to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Pentagon, that decision was viewed by some as at
least a mistake and at worst as one more sign that the
male-dominated military still ignores criticism of its often clumsy
handling of sexual misconduct cases and its well-documented culture
of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For General Reimer to have let Hale go out the door with his
stars intact looks very suspicious,'' said Elaine Donnelly,
president of the Center for Military Readiness, a Pentagon watchdog
group. ``I disagree that he should not be the focus of an
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, thinks so, too. She
has summoned Reimer for a meeting to get details of why he allowed
Hale to retire while allegations of misconduct were outstanding and
a Pentagon investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ``Today'' show in May, Reimer denied as
``absolutely untrue'' accusations that he made ``special promises''
to Hale, and he defended his decision as one ``based upon the facts
available to me at that particular point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reports the Pentagon was probing, Reimer acknowledged,
was that Hale was being ``stalked'' by Donnamaria Carpino, a
military wife who had filed a criminal complaint against Hale in
January. Carpino charged that Hale had blackmailed her into having
sex by threatening to bring adultery charges against her husband,
an Army colonel under Hale's command at the NATO base in Izmir,
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   According to the inspector general's report, which the Pentagon
released Tuesday after it was circulated on Capitol Hill and
leaked, Hale had a consensual, sexual relationship with Carpino
from March to June 1997, while Hale was married and was the
commanding officer of Carpino's husband. The report said the affair
violated good order and discipline and the military's code of
justice, which prohibits adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the report said, Hale lied about why he had approved
Pentagon-paid travel for Carpino to the United States. The two met
in Boston while Carpino was supposed to be visiting an ailing
mother in Connecticut. Hale, 53, also allegedly lied to
investigators that he was single when he met Carpino. In fact, his
divorce did not become final until the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has become the basis for a criminal
investigation by the Army, asserts that Hale romanced and had
``inappropriate relationships'' with wives of subordinate officers
during postings in Hawaii and Turkey. ``Witnesses told us that
(Hale's) actions created a command climate that was `ugly,'
`uncomfortable' and ... `a Peyton Place,''' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesmen insist Hale could be returned to active duty to
face formal charges and even a court-martial. It's an issue with
the Army because McKinney, who is black, had vigorously argued that
high-level officials similarly charged but part of the military
network had been allowed to retire without penalty, while he was
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney retired with full benefits after being acquitted of 18
counts of misconduct. He was convicted of one count of obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the civilian world, the military has strict prohibitions
against adultery because it can undermine order and discipline.
Flinn's case drew protests because the female flier seemed unfairly
singled out for punishment. In fact, her fraternization with the
spouse of a subordinate, and her lying about it, made her a prime
candidate for a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force General Joseph Ralston, on the other hand, was not
punished _ though he lost his bid to be chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff _ when it was revealed that he had a lengthy affair
in the 1980s with a civilian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the lawyer who represented one of the women who brought
charges against McKinney, said that too often the Pentagon hides
behind a charge of adultery when the more serious issue is military
leaders who abuse power.

BC IRISH PROGRAM INCLUDES COUNTRY'S DYNAMIC PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The Jesuits founded Boston College in large part to
educate the children of Irish immigrants who fled the famine of 150
years ago, and so it is no surprise that BC has one of the oldest
and best Irish Studies programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But while many American universities have programs dedicated to
the more traditional disciplines of Irish history and literature,
BC is carving out its own niche by marrying the study of
traditional Ireland with modern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and students have long been fascinated by Ireland's
history and the writings of Swift, Synge, Joyce, Yeats, Beckett,
and a legion of others. But modern Ireland is being defined by its
business acumen as much as its continued ability to produce prose
as compelling as Roddy Doyle's and poetry as timeless as Seamus
Heaney's.
</P>
<P>
   As Ireland has become Europe's most dynamic economy in the
1990s, the skills of Irish business magnates Michael Smurfit and
Tony O'Reilly are as worthy of study as the writing of Edna O'Brien
and John Banville.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, meanwhile,
signals that politics is a growth industry on the island. Political
leaders, both established and emerging, want to impart and absorb
lessons on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If revisionism is all the vogue in Irish history, the Irish
Institute at Boston College is leading the way to revising what it
is to use Ireland as a subject of study in higher education, and to
equip tomorrow's leaders on the island in both the private and
public sector. It is also a way for a university founded on the
backs of Irish immigrants to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   Sean M. Rowland, the Institute's director, explains the change
this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC has always been strong in Irish studies, especially history
and literature,'' he said. ``What we've done is take it campus
wide. Our political science department is working with political
parties here. Our education department is working with the Irish
government's Department of Education. Our business studies have all
sorts of links with the corporate sector here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been an interest in Ireland in higher
education. But a sentimental interest is one thing. A
business-rooted interest is entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said academia tends to consider itself above politics,
but the Institute has deliberately cultivated strong and high-level
political support from the American, Irish, and British governments
because it sees such support as crucial to its efforts. It gets
funding from those governments, including a $1 million grant from
the US government it has received each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goals are to promote peace and economic
development through education and job creation,'' Rowland said. To
do so, he says, political support at the highest levels is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute is politically connected. The Irish prime
minister, Bertie Ahern, presided over its official opening last
December at Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an academic side to the political links. For
example, Mary O'Rourke, the Irish Cabinet minister in charge of
trade and enterprise, has been lecturing MBA students at BC for the
last decade. O'Rourke, who has held more senior positions in
government than any other Irish woman, is an expert on European
Union affairs, and is a veteran of many a domestic political
battle.
</P>
<P>
   At a Dublin Castle dinner to wrap up a higher education
conference sponsored by the Institute last month, the head table
included the BC president, the Rev. William P. Leahy; Irish
President Mary McAleese; US Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith; and
Irish Education Minister Micheal Martin.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese, an academic who left her job as law professor and vice
chancellor at Queen's University in Belfast to become the first
native of Northern Ireland to serve as Ireland's head of state,
said the partnerships created by BC with Irish businesses and
government agencies are ``yielding very tangible results in the
numbers of young people equipped with the leadership skills to
carry this island forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic and cultural renaissance is no accident or
coincidence,'' said McAleese.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the evolving relationship with Ireland ``goes to the
very roots of Boston College. We'd like to think we're at the
cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the Institute has been given the room to expand
``because of the commitment of Father Leahy and Frank Campanella,''
BC's executive vice president. Campanella's interest in all things
Irish might not be obvious from his last name, but three of his
grandparents were born in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who splits his time between Boston and his native
Ireland, said corporate support is essential for the Institute's
ability to mount a trans-Atlantic presence. IBM, for example, whose
worldwide education manager is BC grad Sean Rush, helped underwrite
last month's three-day conference in Dublin. The Ireland Funds, the
International Fund for Ireland, and the Irish American Partnership
also lend financial support.
</P>
<P>
   In its previous incarnation as the Center for Irish Management,
the Institute began humbly in 1988 offering a program that brought
20 entrepreneurs from Northern Ireland for three-month internships
in Boston. This year, the Institute administered 21 programs. More
than 250 people from Ireland, north and south, plus hundreds of BC
students, will take part in education, political leadership, and
business management programs put on by the Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As the Irish economy booms, meanwhile, the traffic is no longer
one-way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, our biggest worry was how do we get enough visas
for the Irish kids to get into America,'' said Rowland. ``Now we
have all these American kids who want to get in here. It just shows
how much things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs is one aimed at marketing tourism in both
parts of Ireland, which reflects one of Ireland's traditional
economic strengths, and one on corporate child care that highlights
an emerging need in an economy where only recently have large
numbers of both parents or single mothers worked. The child-care
program is aimed not only at those in the private sector who want
to develop child-care businesses but those in the Irish government
who will regulate this emerging industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the Institute is developing closer links with
British institutions. Taking a page from the Good Friday agreement
that created new political machinery to reflect new relationships
between the islands of Ireland and Britain, and within those two
islands, Rowland wants to ``bring young political leaders from
Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales to BC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to develop some programming to bring Ireland,
Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom together,'' said Rowland.
``The old, anti-British stuff isn't helpful to anyone anymore. BC
is very much at the fore of forging ahead, of building new
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland believes the ``new'' Irish studies complement the
traditional Irish studies program. He said the Institute draws on
those traditional strengths. Among lecturers at last month's
conference were historian Kevin O'Neill, co-director of BC's Irish
Studies program, and Robert K. O'Neill, director of the John J.
Burns Library at BC, an internationally recognized expert on rare
books and special collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a Kevin O'Neill and a Bob O'Neill opens doors in the
world of higher education,'' said Rowland. ``They are known at
every university in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the Institute, Thomas O'Connor, BC's
professor emeritus of Irish history, is developing a research
project that will identify the migration trends of the Irish
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   BC obviously sees the old and the new working together. Last
month, it moved the Institute and the traditional Irish Studies
programs into the same mansion house on Hammond Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' says Rowland, ``we're all under the same roof.''

HAUNTED BY UNSPEAKABLE NIGHTMARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ZABELLE 
By Nancy Kricorian 
Atlantic Monthly Press, 237 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after being forced to flee her homestead in
eastern Turkey with her eight brothers and sisters, my grandmother
would spend every morning sitting at the breakfast table of my
parents' home in Watertown, Mass. with her Armenian newspaper
spread out in front of her and discuss with me the news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the reporter in me would divert the conversation to her
childhood and to those terrifying times of the massacres of
Armenians _ what had life been like before the Turkish crackdown
began, how had she and her family survived when more than a million
like them died, why had they wound up in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   While she would occasionally give me glimpses of the tortuous
path that had led her and her family to safety, inevitably she
would stop, often waving me away by taking off her reading glasses
and burying her face in her hands. I did not need to know about
those things, she would tell me. What happened, happened in the old
country. We are in America now.
</P>
<P>
   Although fictionalized, ``Zabelle,'' the first novel by the poet
Nancy Kricorian, is a story that my grandmother and hundreds,
perhaps thousands, like her who were driven from their homes in the
early 1900s could have told but never did. Their painful silence,
now finally broken, is made understandable.
</P>
<P>
   A child at the outbreak of World War I, Zabelle Chahasbanian is
forced to join the death march with her mother, grandparents, and
two brothers for hundreds of miles out of Turkey to Ras Al-Ain in
the Syrian desert. Her father was taken from their home at the
outbreak of the violence in April 1915 and was never heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   The starvation, deprivation, and Turkish attacks during the trek
are too much for her mother, grandparents, and baby brother, and
with her brother she is left an orphan, with only her her best
friend, Arsinee, to console her.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage is arranged with an older man in America, and she
emigrates to the Armenian enclave in Watertown, where she begins a
quiet but emotionally restive life. Her enmity toward her
mother-in-law, the emptiness she feels toward her husband, her
displeasure at how her children turn out are the important issues
of her life. What is not part of it is experiencing the fullness of
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a world away from the remote village where she
was born, she remains captive to its old-world traditions _ caring
for her family, cleaning her house, tending to her garden, and
generally suspicious of anyone who is not Armenian. The one time
she ventures into the melting pot of Boston _ a trip to see a movie
with Arsinee _ turns into a disaster after she is accosted by a man
in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kricorian leaves unexplained why the assimilation,
which brought richness to succeeding generations of Armenians, did
not work for Zabelle. It is an important question, because there
were so many others like Zabelle, including my grandmother, who,
despite being educated as a teacher in her village in eastern
Turkey, likewise confined her world to her family, home, and church
once she came to America.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, of course, would search for answers in the way
Zabelle dealt with the terror that had overwhelmed her in the world
that she had fled _ in silence.
</P>
<P>
   There was no coming to terms with the anger and sadness that she

VAUGHAN REDISCOVERS JOY IN THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jimmie Vaughan last put out a solo record, he was hurting.
His brother, the blues giant Stevie Ray, had died in a helicopter
accident in 1990, causing Vaughan to retreat from the business.
After a few years, he finally poked his head out to release
``Strange Pleasure,'' an album that paid tribute to Stevie Ray and
was suffused with spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dealing with a lot of things on that album. There was a
lot of emotion,'' says Vaughan. ``But for the new record, it's like
I'm back on the other side of the street. It's bluesier, dirtier,
more raw.''
</P>
<P>
   The new disc, ``Out There,'' is a return to Vaughan basics: the
stinging yet svelte guitar tone, the warmth of a Hammond B3 organ,
and a reliance on blues shuffles that hook you whether you want to
be hooked or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my last record was spiritual, I'm back to being a wino,''
Vaughan says, with a self-deprecating laugh. ``But, you know, it's
so hard to describe music. Thank God, I can play it.''
</P>
<P>
   He plays it adeptly on ``Out There,'' with the dean-of-the-blues
chops that date back to his days with the Fabulous Thunderbirds. He
also wrote the songs _ except for ``Like a King,'' by Nile Rodgers,
and ``Motorhead Baby,'' by one of his idols, Johnny ``Guitar''
Watson. For any bluesman to write most of his songs, however, is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot better,'' Vaughan, 47, says of his emotional
state. ``I did the tribute record and I thought that was important
for acceptance and closure. Then I said, `OK, I've done this, and
I've got to start a new phase.' I'm really doing my own thing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughan, that means mixing his blues guitar with the more
streamlined sound of a hired vocal group and with the naturalistic
``wood and tubes'' sound of a Hammond B3. He is a purist _ and long
may he feel that way, because it works for him.
</P>
<P>
   He also sings with surprising assurance, since he didn't start
singing lead vocals until he was 40. His debut as a lead singer
came on the album he made with Stevie Ray, ``Family Style,'' which
was released shortly after the helicopter accident.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan, the older of the two, has made great strides as a
vocalist. He was shaky on his last solo disc, but, like Eric
Clapton, he has honed himself into a fine singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better. It's just from doing it more,'' he says.
``I have a long way to go, but at least when I do sing, it actually
sounds good to me now. I go into my head and say, `What would you
like to hear?' And then the song comes pretty fast, but I can't do
it on command. It has to twirl around in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to sing in a natural way. Some people can sing
amazingly, but I'm more of a feel singer. Hopefully, that's enough
for me to express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vaughan shows a malleable voice, using it as an
instrument, rather than an afterthought, in a new love song
``Astral Projection Blues.'' He also shines vocally on the smooth,
Claptonesque soul of ``Lost in You,'' which he co-wrote with New
Orleans legend Dr. John. It has a groove that won't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people just like blues,'' says Vaughan. ``When
they hear it, they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   They like it when it's done this well. Vaughan has crafted a
stylistic, signature sound, while nodding to his other idols such
as B.B. King and Buddy Guy, both of whom joined him on the epic ``A
Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan'' live album in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still listen to those guys,'' Vaughan says of King and Guy.
``What can I tell you? I'm still learning.''

TO BAY STATE VOTERS, IT'S NOT A TAXING ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GEETA ANAND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ If there's one message percolating up from
voters around the state, it is this: They don't think they live in
Taxachusetts any more.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Acting Governor Paul Cellucci and the Legislature debate
tax-cut proposals on Beacon Hill, with Cellucci pouncing on news of
the state's $1 billion surplus to demand an even larger cut this
year, the people of Massachusetts seem far from convinced that the
state should return extra revenues to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, voters say their top priorities are elsewhere _ on
education, mostly, but also on jobs, crime, and health care. They
aren't looking for budget cuts, they're looking for government to
use its extra cash to tackle some longstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd like to see the tax rate cut a percent. Sure. But I
can't get too excited about that,'' said Ed Kasok, leaning against
his new red sports utility vehicle as he watched his daughter's
softball practice in Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government could do is help with health insurance,''
said the toy store owner. ``These are things you think about as you
get older _ my town taxes are going to go up, and my health
insurance is going to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   If then-governor William F. Weld lost to US Senator John Kerry
in 1996 because he sounded the wrong mantra of crime, welfare, and
taxes, voters suggest that candidates who make tax cuts the crux of
their campaign messages this year may be following suit.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, polls often show that voters favor tax cuts. And
every candidate running for governor this year has a plan to roll
back the state income tax over time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in conversations with dozens of people in shopping malls and
on street corners around Massachusetts, only one person even raised
the issue of taxes when asked to discuss the state's most pressing
problems. When specifically questioned about a tax cut, many said
they had higher priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Even pollsters are detecting such a sentiment this year. Lou
DiNatale, who oversees the regular University of Massachusetts
poll, says he has run four polls on the budget surplus and found
that a consistent 50 percent favor spending the money on things
like social programs or capital projects, rather than giving it
back to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this lack of public enthusiasm for lower taxes
that has led the state's leading tax-cut group, Citizens for
Limited Taxation &AMP; Government, to consider closing its doors. For
the first time in two decades the group couldn't gather enough
signatures this year to put a tax-cut question on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't seem to care,'' said Barbara Anderson, the
executive director. ``If they don't care, how can we ask our
membership to organize?''
</P>
<P>
   Where people do talk taxes, it is local property taxes they
mention and fret about. Many people wanted Beacon Hill to spend
more to help pay for local schools, roads, and other services _
which, in turn, could ease the burden on property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rebuild roads, we need to improve our schools. All
of these are important, and all of them are draining town
budgets,'' said Tom McCrumm, as he delivered maple syrup from his
farm in the tiny western Massachusetts town of Ashfield to a diner
in nearby Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Of Taxes, McCrumm, who has voted Republican in recent years,
offered: ``Oh, I just bite the bullet and pay 'em and hope I get
something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Batts of Marshfield, shopping at the Natick Mall with
her grandchildren, said she didn't feel like she was paying too
much in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think they're too bad,'' she said. ``The most
important issue is education and those teachers failing the test.
Do you know it was on the Jay Leno show?''
</P>
<P>
   What voters are most concerned about appeared to depend,
generally, on what corner of the state they call home.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs around Boston, where crime has fallen to record
lows and an electric economy has pushed employment to record highs,
almost everyone who was approached demanded that the state focus
more attention on education.
</P>
<P>
   In pockets of western and central Massachusetts, where the
economy has yet to recover from the loss of manufacturing jobs,
residents sought economic incentives to draw industry. In interview
after interview, they complained that Beacon Hill ignores them and
their region's very serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get us some industry. Get us some jobs,'' said Joanne Maloney,
who works the cash register at a liquor store in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   In middle-sized cities, such as Worcester and Springfield,
resident after resident complained that crime remains a stubborn,
demoralizing problem, and ought to be government's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real serious drug problem,'' said Bishop Timothy
Baymon of the Praise and Glory Ministries in Springfield, which
recently opened a drug rehabilitation program there. ``I really
believe this election should be about economics in our communities.
We should be talking about economic literacy and crime in western
Massachusetts. Is anyone listening?''

UNRELEASED VAN MORRISON EMERGES FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late 1974, Van Morrison played the Anaheim Convention Center
in California, one of many shows that year before he retreated for
two years from performing and recording. Besides songs from the
then-recent ``Veedon Fleece'' album, Morrison did a strange number
called ``Twilight Zone.'' He sang in a falsetto voice and finished
the song memorably _ lying on his back on top of a grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, I never heard the song again, but remembered it
well: ``It's not the Twilight Zone/It's just a party
phone/Honeycomb, honeycomb, honeycomb.'' Then, a couple of years
ago, a friend from England tucked into my hand an old bootleg
audience-made tape from another 1974 Morrison show.
</P>
<P>
   There it was.
</P>
<P>
   That enigmatic, rather haunting love song is one of 30
previously unreleased Van Morrison works, mostly his own
compositions, on a new double-CD set, ``The Philosopher's Stone.''
For anyone, it's good listening, but for many who appreciate the
poet from Northern Ireland as one of the most necessary and gifted
of the pop musicians who came of age in the 1960s, this set is more
than just that.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing these 30 songs recorded from 1971 through 1988 _ remixed
and with quality sound _ is a little like going to a place where
you suspect, but aren't quite sure, you've been before.
</P>
<P>
   Five are alternate versions of _ and in each case improvements
upon _ earlier recordings: ``Wonderful Remark,'' heard first in the
Martin Scorsese movie ``King of Comedy'' and less commercially
treated here; ``Joyous Sound'' from 1977, this a fuller, happier
version; ``Flamingoes Fly''; a more energetic ``Bright Side of the
Road''; and a reggae, ``Real Real Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The real surprises, however, are two dozen blues, ballads, and
love songs that would have been hailed when they were originally
recorded but, in most cases, just didn't physically fit on the
albums Morrison released annually. Most of them have circulated
among obsessive Morrison fans for years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Polydor Ltd. even put out a tentative 30-song CD
set, but it was pulled back, and the content of the two discs
tweaked to make it even richer.
</P>
<P>
   Three somewhat monotonous inclusions were eliminated, and three
superior pieces from the enormous Morrison vault were substituted.
One of them is ``The Street Only Knew Your Name,'' a moving 1975
recording that already had the reflective songwriter looking back
nostalgically: ``That was long before fortune and fame/No such
thing as a star when you've played that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the favorites of Van collectors are ``Not Supposed to
Break Down,'' an introspective song with lyrics typical of the
searching '60s period; ``Laughing in the Wind,'' with Morrison
joined by Jackie DeShannon; ``Madame Joy,'' an upbeat cousin to the
dark masterpiece ``Madame George,'' from the 1968 album ``Astral
Weeks''; ``Contemplation Rose,'' an urban diary you'd swear could
have been written for ``West Side Story''; and the rocking ``Naked
in the Jungle,'' covered by Morrison's San Francisco-based
singer-daughter, Shana, when she visited Boston last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison never hid his contempt for the commercial end of the
record industry, and ``Drumshanbo Hustle'' is an explicit
expression from 1973, early in his career: ``You were puking up
your guts/When you read the standard contract you just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The musicians Morrison gathers always have been creative
choices, and these _ from sessions ranging from Sausalito, Calif.,
to Hilversum, the Netherlands _ include the late jazz drummer
Connie Kay, from ``Astral Weeks,'' and the always remarkable
pianist Jeff Labes. Morrison himself plays a weepy saxophone on ``I
Have Finally Come to Realize,'' as well as some guitar and
harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the reworked songs are more assured, less
commercial, somewhat stripped-down _ more in keeping with the
artist's folk or jazz roots. Morrison, like Dylan, has a knack for
turning his songs inside out, reshaping them. Morrison actually
improves his.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mr. Thomas,'' a tribute to poet Dylan Thomas by Robin
Williamson, is on a level with the many literary paeans Morrison
has written and sung over the years. ``Crazy Jane on God,'' a W.B.
Yeats poem set to music by William Mathieu and sensuously
harmonized by the voices of Ireland's Moving Hearts, could be the
most interesting song of all he's left on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   It was pulled at the last minute from the ``A Sense of Wonder''
album in the 1980s because of objections from the Yeats estate _
and would have helped save that album from mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the assortment that makes up these two CDs, fans clearly
have even more to anticipate. The original studio tapes with
extended versions of the songs on ``Astral Weeks'' are rumored to
survive in a basement somewhere, perhaps even in Boston, where
Morrison lived in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The set released this month, after all, is subtitled: ``The
Unreleased Tapes _ Volume One.''

SCAIFE SCHISMS; FEAR OF `CREAMING';   RESILIENT YELLOWSTONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled her right-wing conspiracy
theory earlier this year, Richard Mellon Scaife was an obscure
Western Pennsylvania newspaper publisher. But in the reflected
glare of ``Monicagate,'' Scaife _ whose foundations have earmarked
hundreds of millions to conservative causes _ has emerged as the
camera--shy sugardaddy of the New Right.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get a handle on Scaife, a semirecluse who eschews
interviews, is a frustrating task at best. (He is best known in
media circles for an obscenity-laced tirade he unleashed at a
reporter for the Columbia Journalism Review.) The latest writer to
take a crack _ and trying a unique tack _ is Joe Conason, in the
July issue of Boston magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fish Out of Water,'' Conason _ the political editor at the
New York Observer _ portrays Scaife as philosophically out of sync
with his fellow Nantucket summer-home dwellers. One of Scaife's
neighbors is Teresa Heinz, who is married to Senator John Kerry and
the widow of Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz. Both Heinzes were too
liberal for Scaife and his Pittsburgh Tribune-Review paper. Another
Nantucket denizen is Heinz's successor, former Pennsylvania Senator
Harris Wofford, whose Republican opponent was the recipient of
serious Scaife largesse. Then there's Clinton's private snoop,
Terry Lenzner, who lives a few miles from Scaife and for all we
know, may have a fat dossier on the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Conason's approach is clever and readable. But he can't surmount
the same old dilemma. The real Richard Mellon Scaife remains as
elusive as sasquatch. ``Nobody knows him,'' one longtime Nantucket
resident tells Conason. ``I don't think I've ever met him,''
confesses Wofford. ``Scaife is here?'' says a laughing Lenzner. ``I
didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next profile of Scaife, I nominate the ``X-Files'' duo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the search for solutions to the education crisis, charter
schools have emerged as the panacea of the moment. Writing in the
July/August issue of the liberal American Prospect, Richard
Rothstein, an adjunct professor of public policy at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, is clearly out to puncture some charter
school myths. ``What we hear about charter schools today is little
more than anecdotal puffery and phony statistics,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   The author makes persuasive arguments that it's too early to
accurately measure charter school performance and raises worthy
suspicions about ``creaming,'' the fear that charters will
ultimately attract the cream of the crop and leave the needier
students to the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Where Rothstein's analysis veers from academic to polemic is his
conclusion that charter schools won't ``seriously harm the cause of
public education,'' largely because ``there will be too few
charters to have much of an impact.'' That seems to verge on open
rooting for the failure of this intriguing experiment.

   Ever since a buffalo showed up next door to my Yellowstone Lake
cabin a few summers ago, I've been hooked on the Disneyland of
national parks. Now, the August issue of Audubon magazine offers
some reassuring news. A decade after raging wildfires burned for
six months, affected almost 800,000 acres in the 2.2 million acre
park, and ``redistribute(d) biological wealth'' (nice turn of
phrase), the winners outnumber the losers. Owls, bluebirds, and
woodpeckers have thrived. Wildflowers have exploded and the food
chain has been strengthened by increases in insects and algae. The
one big victim has been the park's moose population, which lost a
major food source when the fire burned forests.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the verdict a decade later, the park's chief
scientist says that ecologically, Yellowstone survived the fires
``as if they were a summer thundershower passing through.`` Now
that's resilience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news is considerably more ominous in the July issue of
Outside magazine, which examines the impact of this year's Amazon
rainforest fires on the ``world's largest Stone Age tribe,'' the
Yanomami Indians of Brazil. (Remember them from Anthropology 101
class?) While blaming the fires, which destroyed 5,400 square miles
of forest, on ``rampant tree-clearing and homesteading,'' the
article paints a grim portrait of ``a bewildered people in
transition.'' Their home scarred by the fires, the Yanomami
encountered by writer Tad Friend were starving, stunned, and in
social retreat. (The saddest image is of them lugging around empty
two-liter Coke bottles, apparently in the belief that they held
some commercial value.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Yanomami viewed the smoke from the fires as a sign of the
apocalypse,'' Friend writes. It's hard to argue with them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Fire is also a theme, actually more of a metaphor, in David
Grann's New Republic story on Jasper, Texas. That's the town where
Black Panthers and Muslims faced off against the KKK in the days
following the brutal race murder of James Byrd Jr., whose body was
dragged three miles by a pickup truck. (Locals say that raging
fires, clearly some kind of omen, began breaking out right about
the time when Byrd was killed.)
</P>
<P>
   Grann's story is another parable of a media age in which
journalists and outsiders descend on a place in the news and
distort its natural rhythms. As racial tensions mounted, Jasper
residents actually fled their town, hoping to escape the flames of
hate being fanned by strangers in need of a cause and a story.

   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... enough products.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This ``demand'' problem is often stated another way. Japan has
an ``export-led'' economy that relies more on foreign customers
than on Japanese consumers to make their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what needs to be done: shift Japan from a producer
economy to one based on domestic demand,'' said Chalmers Johnson,
president of the California-based Japan Policy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high prices and high profits of so many Japanese
companies, not enough of the wealth is passed to workers, some
economists say. Katz estimates that companies, instead of raising
wages or paying interest and dividends to investors, retain cash
beyond their business needs equal to 3 percent to 4 percent of
Japan's annual gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money has gone to poor investments, such as excess
factory space and overpriced real estate. Flush with cash, Japanese
companies paid high prices for such US properties as New York's
Rockefeller Center in 1989 and Pebble Beach in California in 1990.
The Rockefeller Center owner wound up in bankruptcy, while the
Pebble Beach owner sold out at a reportedly steep loss.
</P>
<P>
   With businesses failing to pass much of their wealth to workers
and investors, Japanese consumers do not have enough money to buy a
large share of Japanese goods. And the rest of the world can buy
only so much from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has acknowledged this problem for years.
In 1985, then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone charged a high-level
panel with developing a plan to change the country from an export
economy to a consumer economy.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Maekawa Commission for its leader, a former Bank of
Japan governor, the panel proposed cutting back the export-heavy
industries and spurring consumer demand by giving the Japanese more
tax breaks, more vacations, and shorter work weeks. But even the
commission acknowledged, one year after its report, that the
government had not acted on those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Japan has even exacerbated its demand problem.
The government raised the sales tax last year, a move that crimped
consumer spending even more. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bank debacle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one other major problem in Japan: the banks. And nobody
knows how bad that problem is.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks, unlike their American counterparts, can buy
stock and count it as part of their assets. Now, the stock market
has dropped by half since its 1989 high, cutting the value of bank
assets. At the same time, property values have fallen by 70
percent, hurting banks that hold loans backed by inflated real
estate values.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the government of Japan claimed that the banking
system had about $200 billion in nonperforming loans,'' said
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, at a recent Senate
hearing. ``Earlier this year, the government increased that
estimate to $600 billion. Private estimates of bad loans range from
$770 billion to as high as $1 trillion, or about one-fifth of total
bank assets. And this does not count the billions more that are off
the books.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the size, Japan's problem is far larger than the $150
billion in direct costs that the United States spent to clean up
the savings and loan crisis, and they come in an economy just over
half the size of the United States economy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Necessary measures
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still the world's second-largest economy, with a huge
industrial base, a skilled work force, and many other resources.
Many Western analysts say the nation can revive itself, though the
process will likely raise unemployment and stifle growth for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures often suggested:
</P>
<P>
   _End protectionist trade rules so that Japanese industries face
competition and become more efficient;
</P>
<P>
   _Dismantle the cartels, which have been officially abandoned for
a decade but continue in practice, so that poorly run companies
cannot be propped up;
</P>
<P>
   _Cut taxes so that consumers have more money to buy goods, which
might stimulate the economy;
</P>
<P>
   _Change accounting standards, so that the extent of the bad bank
and corporate debts are known;
</P>
<P>
   _End the system by which companies own large chunks of their
business partners, so that the stock market becomes an efficient
vehicle for allocating capital to the best firms rather than a way
to cement business ties; and
</P>
<P>
   _Write off the bad bank debts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised to take some of these steps. Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto last week announced a new plan to close
insolvent banks and turn credit-worthy clients over to
government-run ``bridge banks'' that will continue to provide them
capital. The government also proposed a $115 billion tax cut to
spur consumer demand, and has spent $600 billion on public works
over five years to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are reserving judgment until after next month's
parliamentary election. If Japanese leaders do not follow through
on a comprehensive plan by then, currency and stock traders could
batter Japanese markets even harder than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pivotal moment for Asia and the global economy,''
warned Lawrence Summers, the number two US Treasury official, at a
Senate hearing last month. ``The weakness in Japan is now having a
clear impact on the other troubled economies in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are goods reasons for Japan to hesitate: Cleaning
up the economy would force businesses to close and cause huge
layoffs, which are unheard of in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This contract was Japan's social safety net, the system that
stood between order and panic. Now, some economists say, Japan must
create a new safety net, some kind of equivalent to US
unemployment, Medicaid, and bank-deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have these social safety net devices, it is
impossible to do the reforms they need to do. Which is why they
don't do it,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese leaders may not yet be ready to impose pain on their
country, said Johnson of the Japan Policy Research Institute. ``The
Japanese do not yet feel that the old system has to be abandoned,''
he said. ``They say, `We are like people sitting comfortably in a
hot bath. We know the water is cooling off, but we don't yet feel
the need to get out.'''

 &HT;    RADIO TALKS WITH STUDENTS SCRUBBED FROM GLENN SHUTTLE FLIGHT
 &HT;    280&AMP;add
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A popular education program has been scratched from
the October space shuttle flight of Sen. John Glenn because the
astronauts are booked solid with a vast array of science
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   One school in Japan and five in the United States _ including
John Glenn High School in the senator's home town of New Concord,
Ohio _ were scheduled to connect via amateur radio with the shuttle
Discovery for 10-minute conversations between students and
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   NASA schedulers decided last week that the process of setting up
and then stowing the radio equipment makes the classroom program
too time-consuming for a mission that already has more than 80
experiments aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time-liners have come to the conclusion that it doesn't
all fit,'' said Doug Ward, head of public information at Johnson
Space Center in Houston. ``That's not one we like to give up, but
it also has a lower priority than the science.''
</P>
<P>
   Now NASA's education division is looking for a replacement
project that will fit the schedule of the nine-day, science-laden
flight that also has great education potential because of its high
public profile with Glenn aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the oldest person in space (he'll be 77 by
launch day), Glenn is returning to space for the first time since
his pioneering flight as the first American to orbit the earth in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Robertson, who heads the education and information
services division of the Johnson Center, said she's been given a
short window in the astronauts' schedule to fill with an education
project and she said Glenn will be at the center of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 30 minutes open for some kind of education event,''
she said. ``And right now, we don't know what that's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) began in 1983
aboard the ninth shuttle mission and spent its first few years as a
secondary project that astronauts did only in their leisure time.
Although it now is a scheduled shuttle program like any other, it's
not uncommon for a SAREX project to be scotched when a shuttle
schedule gets too full.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we call it an experiment,'' said Rosalie White,
manager of educational activities for the American Radio Relay
League. ``Schools know that when they apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The Radio League, a non-profit organization of amateur radio
operators, has a contract with NASA to manage the SAREX program by
selecting the schools that participate from hundreds that apply.
The league also arranges for radio equipment to be set up in
schools that are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're looking at applications from schools that
applied in 1996, just to give you an idea of how backed up we
are,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   In the program, students learn about radio waves and space
travel in anticipation of the radio contact. As the shuttle passes
overhead, students ask questions and take answers from the
astronauts. White said schools typically practice the event to get
the most out of their 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Space shuttles are equipped with air-to-ground radios, but the
SAREX program involves adding a separate radio that transmits on a
public frequency. Robertson said it's likely that the official
shuttle radio will be used in the replacement project, which means
it will be transmitted through NASA television.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the SAREX program had gotten the ax apparently hadn't
reached Glenn, who on Tuesday touted it as one of the
``intangible'' benefits of the space program. During debate on the
Senate floor over an amendment to kill the International Space
Station, Glenn's defense of the station included mention of the
radio talks he'd be giving to students while aboard the Discovery
in October.
</P>
<P>
   A staff member for the Ohio Democrat said the senator wouldn't
comment on the loss of SAREX from his mission because he doesn't
want to overstep his role as a regular member of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named to shuttle crew in January, Glenn has taken
pains to point out how ``research-rich'' the flight would be, and
two weeks ago his flight commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Curt Brown,
said in Houston that the flight was so rich in experiments that
NASA schedulers were considering cutting some projects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a multitude of experiments, the crew also will
use the heavy mechanical arm in the shuttle's cargo bay to deploy
and then retrieve a sun-measuring device called the Spartan. Glenn
himself will be the subject of two experiments in which scientists
are searching for links between the human body's reaction to
extended periods of weightlessness and old age, which cause similar
debilitating effects.

MARY-CHAPIN CARPENTER HAS COME OUT TO PLAY, NOT TO PROMOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Touring, for some musicians, is a necessary evil. It's a way to
promote a new album or ``prod-uct,'' a way to keep their record
label happy. So it's refreshing to see artists hit the road when
they're not hyping something. The Grateful Dead often toured
without a new album. And Billy Joel once even played Boston Garden
for the sheer fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, it's Mary-Chapin Carpenter's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to tour,'' she says. ``I didn't have a new
rec-ord out. I just wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, the folk-country star by way of Brown University,
actually took a chance by touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate fact that because it's so expensive to
tour, you tend to do it only if you have something new to
promote,'' says Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she want to alienate the concert promoters who have
supported her. ``The last thing I want to do is blow a promoter's
wad or do bad business. You don't want to be stupid about it,'' she
says. ``But hopefully, the tour we set up is done smart enough so
that no one is gonna lose their shirt and we can still just go out
there and play. And it's been really gratifying, because I haven't
really gotten any airplay to support this tour, but we're still
seeing people come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour's success is also due to Carpenter's personality. She's
an effervescent, charismatic performer who not only has a deep
cache of hits (``Passionate Kisses,'' ``Down at the Twist and
Shout,'' and ``Shut Up and Kiss Me''), but can pull out many
crowd-pleasing cover songs, from Van Morrison's ``Real Real Gone''
to Johnny Cash's ``I Still Miss Someone.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the cover song of choice is John Gorka's ``Flying
Horse,'' which opens her show. ``It's a wonderful song about how
the Texaco horse _ you know, the red horse with wings _ decides to
just blow off her job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Carpenter, 40, is a revered songwriter, she loves doing
other people's songs so much that, like Shawn Colvin and Dwight
Yoakam in recent years, she'd consider releasing an album of
covers. ``I'd love to do that someday,'' she says. ``It would be a
challenge because I'd want to put all my favorite songs on the
album, but it would be excruciating to whittle them down.''
</P>
<P>
   After Carpenter played Harborlights last year, she talked about
taking a long vacation. But she hit the trail again last winter for
a tour of Bosnia sponsored by the United Service Organizations, at
the request of US Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whirlwind,'' she recalls. ``And it came up very
quickly. It was, like, do you want to go to Bosnia? Do you want to
play for the troops on Christmas Eve? And it was: Yeah, I do. I
just thought it would be a meaningful experience. And I find it
hard to describe how meaningful it was. Just to be there with
people who are doing a really important thing _ and to see all the
(Bosnian) orphans that I met. I had never really experienced
anything that like that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went by myself and slung my guitar over my shoulder,''
she says. ``I did three gigs in one day, from Italy to Macedonia to
Bosnia. Your head is spinning and you are emotional. But I found it
to be a real gift.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Carpenter also performed an ``Evening at the Pops''
concert at Boston's Symphony Hall, invited by conductor Keith
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the best time,'' she says of the Pops. ``Maestro
Lockhart and everybody were so great and really made you feel at
home. They just said, `Do whatever you want to do and it's going to
be fine.' The only time I had ever played with an orchestra before
was a couple of years ago at the Fourth of July `Down at the Mall'
concert in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear your songs scored for an orchestra, it's like
being in your own movie. It's very cool,'' she adds. ``And it was
really fun to be in Symphony Hall, which is one of the great
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   As for future recordings, Carpenter doesn't have a studio album
in the works, though she's doing a couple of new songs in her show.
She will likely release a hits-oriented disc this fall, including a
couple of new tracks and a couple of covers. One would be ``Party
Doll,'' a Mick Jagger tune from his ``Primitive Cool'' album.
``I've loved that song for years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And don't ask her what she thinks of the current Nashville
scene, because she's too busy doing her own thing. ``I don't really
know what's going on,'' she says of Nashville. ``That's not an
abdication, but I'm just out here having fun right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And part of that fun is having Boston-based guitarist Duke
Levine in her band. ``He's a truly amazing player,'' she says. ``He
has a gift for the interiors of songs. And he's very modest. He
turns beet red when you tell him how great he is.''

REBORN STRAWBERRIES GETTING BACK IN THE GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out of bankruptcy and under new ownership, the Strawberries
record store chain looks to make a comeback worthy of Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries ``could do nearly $100 million in sales this
year,'' said chief executive Robert J. Higgins of Trans World
Entertainment Corp., which bought 90 Strawberries stores last fall
for $21 million _ nearly half of what the chain reportedly sold for
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   With too many stores and too few hit records, the mid-1990s were
a nightmare for many record chains including Strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   But after a burst of intense consolidation, the mood today is
more upbeat. Soundtracks from movies such as ``Titanic'' and ``City
of Angels'' are luring consumers back into stores. And hits from
Garth Brooks and Dave Matthews along with CD singles could help
boost music retail sales by 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   With many of its stores now remodeled, Strawberries hopes to
cash in on this rebound as part of Trans World's music empire,
which includes such other chains as Coconuts Music &AMP; Movies, Record
Town, and Saturday Matinee.
</P>
<P>
   The Strawberries stores, Higgins said, fit well with his
distribution network, and there was an opportunity for savings by
closing Strawberries' home office in Milford, Mass. and moving many
operations to Trans World's headquarters in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For Strawberries, a change of ownership is simply another
chapter in a colorful three-decade history.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by the late Morris Levy, who managed the Birdland jazz
club in New York before going on to produce such rock-and-roll hits
as ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?,'' Strawberries was once a dominant
record chain in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   If it was the 1970s, and a local disco lover wanted a copy of
``Saturday Night Fever,'' Strawberries was the place to go.
</P>
<P>
   And in the '80s when many Beatles fans were replacing worn-out
vinyl albums with cassettes or CDs, Strawberries was where many
local music lovers went to buy new copies of old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Strawberries operated 160 stores. In 1989, the
chain claimed sales of $75 million. It was about that time that
out-of-state retailers began invading the Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, chains such as Tower Records, HMV, and
Circuit City moved in and, suddenly, everyone from the local Star
Market to the local Kmart was also selling music.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a chain such as Circuit City would use music as a
loss leader, further squeezing traditional record store chains.
</P>
<P>
   If all this new competition wasn't enough, the music of the
mid-1990s was a disaster. Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, REM, and Pearl Jam
all released CDs that disappointed retailers.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, this shortage of hits occurred just as
many baby boomers had finished replacing their vinyl record
collections with CDs, something that had driven music sales for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``1996 was one of the worst years the music business ever had,''
Higgins recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the double whammy of stiff competition and bad music,
Strawberries had issues of its own to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, founder Levy was convicted of racketeering. A
short time later, the new owner of Strawberries, Jose Menendez, and
his wife were found shot to death. Their sons, Lyle and Erik, were
later convicted of the California murders.
</P>
<P>
   Following this turmoil, Strawberries was bought by its
management team through a leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, though, the entire music business was struggling,
including the industry's biggest player, Musicland Stores Corp.,
the $1.8 billion Minnesota-based company that operates the Sam
Goody chain.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Strawberries filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was rapid consolidation in the $12.2 billion music
industry. Analysts estimate that in about a two-year period, more
than 1,000 record stores closed.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to store closings, Trans World was especially
aggressive. Instead of operating a large number of small stores,
the company believed it would have greater success with a smaller
number of large stores. At the end of fiscal 1994, it operated 684
stores; at the end of 1997, it operated 539 stores.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some of its rivals, Trans World has managed to become
mean and lean without loading on a lot of debt.
</P>
<P>
   All this consolidation has improved the industry's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overcapacity has been absorbed,'' said analyst Thomas
Tashjian at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, which recently
helped Trans World underwrite a secondary stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Something else has improved the industry's health and its profit
margins: Record companies have had success in persuading giant
retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to stop selling CDs below
cost and using them as loss leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In such an ideal climate, Trans World has been thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business keeps coming in over plan,'' said Tashjian, who
projects Trans World's earnings per share for this fiscal year at
$1.50, up from 99 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World uses two retail formats: one for freestanding stores
such as Strawberries, and another for stores in malls. Part of
Trans World's turnaround strategy has been to negotiate leases that
allow it to be the only record store in a particular mall. Trans
World is also experimenting with a much larger store concept called
``For Your Entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the shortage of hits in the mid-'90s, Trans World has
taken steps to be less dependent on the vagaries of new releases.
To that end, it has signed licensing agreements that allow it to
package its own exclusive CD boxed sets, such as anthologies by
Yanni, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike other music retailers, Trans World does the majority of
its business outside the top 50 category,'' wrote Beth A. Richard,
an analyst for Everen Securities Inc., which also helped underwrite
Trans World's recent stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   All these moves have yielded results. Last year, Trans World
reported sales of $571 million, up from $482 million the previous
year. Profits grew from $7.1 million to $20.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World's share price has also exploded. Less than a year
ago, shares traded at 20. Now, even after a two-for-one stock
split, shares are trading above 40. On Nasdaq Tuesday, Trans World
shares were up 3/4 to close at 43 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains are also enjoying better days. In early 1997,
shares of Musicland traded at under a dollar; now they're near 13.
</P>
<P>
   But challenges lie ahead for the industry and for Strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Some day fans could buy more music on the Internet, and national
chains Target and Best Buy are set to soon open their first stores
in Greater Boston, the latest outsiders to challenge Strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   But after almost 40 years in the business, Higgins doesn't seem
worried. He remembers when the Kingston Trio was popular and when
disco was king. As he scouts other possible acquisitions, he sees
good times ahead for the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do over $700 million in sales this year,'' he said.

<P>
   I live in New York City, the capital of English-speaking
culture. But I can go entire days without ever speaking English.
Today was one of those days. This morning, I didn't have exact
change for the bus ride so I went into a Korean deli and asked the
Ecuadorian behind the register for it.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus, coming down Seventh Avenue, I tried reading a few
pages of ``Three Trapped Tigers,'' by the Cuban writer Guillermo
Cabrera Infante. But I was distracted by the stories of a Dominican
mother, who, on a nearby seat, was telling her young son about his
grandmother's house in Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   I closed my book and decided to notice New York's Latin face.
Behind me, two teen-age girlfriends chatted half in English, half
in Spanish. One of them carried a keychain with the Colombian flag
hooked to the pocket of her backpack; the other was wearing a
necklace of yellow, blue and red plastic beads that ended in the
three-color flag of five Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled how at the Sunday rumba in Central Park, the bata
drums might as easily have been played by a Puerto Rican or a
Dominican as a Cuban. New York, I thought, has shown me so much of
my own culture. It is here, not in my native Colombia, after all,
where I have tried to dance a tango and a ``danzon.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has always been a city of immigrants. A 1998 report by
the Census Bureau shows that one out of five New Yorkers is
foreign-born. If at the turn of the century, they arrived from
Europe, today they are arriving from the Caribbean and from Central
and South America. Most of them come from the Dominican Republic.
They are followed, in the order of greatest numbers, by
Ecuadorians, Colombians, Peruvians, Hondurans, Salvadoreans,
Mexicans, Guatemalans and Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   New York is living the dream of Latin American unity that Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, held most dear _ the belief that a
single people has been divided only by the turmoil of historical
events. And now, curiously, there never has been the opportunity
for Latin Americans to know each other as there is today in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the bus at 14th Street, a wide, store-lined, two-way
path that reminds me of Panama's Avenida Calidonia or the
commercial thoroughfare of any Latin American downtown area. It is
a reflection of the Latino community which, according to the
Department of City Planning, will soon be the largest minority in
New York City _ surpassing even the African-American community,
which currently constitutes about 24 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth Street mirrors the needs, the growth and the
idiosyncrasy of the Latino community. Here a Latino finds whatever
he or she might need or yearn for _ from work offers, to law firms
offering green cards, to two Spanish-language bookstores where one
can find the novels that won this year's Alfaguara Prize, Spain's
new prestigious international literary award, as well as the
magazines covering the latest news of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores sell guayaberas, CDs in Spanish, brand names at a
discount. On the sidewalk you are offered cellular phones, games of
Three-Card Monty, compliments, pushes, dirty looks, smiles _ all
Latino-style, in Spanish, and in the accents of many countries.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, I went to a restaurant where they offer the entire
Latin American region in their menu _ from chicken soup,
``empanadas chilenas,'' black and red beans to slivers of yellow
plantain, mango juice and flan.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a ``batido de mamey,'' a milkshake made of a pink
tropical fruit, and asked the Mexican at the counter what was the
difference between a Cuban Sandwich, or a sanduche cubano, and a
Midnight Sandwich, or a media noche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is in the bread,'' the young man from Puebla,
in central Mexico, told me. And I was sure he had never tasted a
Cuban sandwich before coming to New York. ``The Midnight is made
with `pan de huevo,' which is bread made with eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered it because that bread, sweet and yellowy, reminds me
of afternoons in Barranquilla, Colombia, where I was born. The
baker would pass by my house on his bicycle selling pan de huevo,
also made into rolls filled with a guava paste sprinkled with sugar
on top. I have not lived in Barranquilla for 20 years, but it only
takes a sip of the shake _ its smell, its taste _ or the sounds of
the chords of a Colombian vallenato song, to feel as if I am
sitting in the rocking chair on my grandmother's patio.
</P>
<P>
   My experience is not unique. It must be the same for that
Dominican woman who was talking to her son on the Seventh Avenue
bus, or for the hundreds of people who walk or work on 14th Street
every day. It is a surprise even to hear English here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I turned around when I heard a masculine voice say,
in the tone that North Americans use when they go on vacation to
Latin America and their tourist package includes a native dance and
a cocktail of tropical fruit, ``This surely is colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that this is the new face of New York. That
this wonderful convergence of cultures is more than a colorful
novelty. That this is his new country.

   WASHINGTON _ There was a time, only 10 years ago, when Americans
wondered if they would soon lose their claim to living in the
world's largest economy. Japan was growing rich on auto and
electronics exports, and Japanese companies were buying such
trophies as Rockefeller Center, the Pebble Beach golf course, and
CBS Records. As Americans watched the Soviet Union crumble, many
saw a new threat in the economic power of ``Japan Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, in a turnabout few predicted, the business tactics
that made Japan so fearsome have led to its undoing, causing one of
the sharpest economic reversals in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial cartels, clubby lending practices, rules that barred
US firms from reaching Japanese customers _ all this helped build
Japan into one of the world's top makers of autos, computer chips,
and consumer electronics. But as it turns out, the same practices
created a set of bloated, inefficient industries in Japan that are
now largely responsible for rising unemployment, plummeting stock
prices, and a banking crisis that could turn Japan's current
recession into something far worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable setback for the nation that inspired Michael
Crichton's 1992 novel ``Rising Sun'' and Pat Chaote's political
study ``Agents of Influence,'' which portrayed Japanese businessmen
as secretly buying their way into American politics and society to
steal US jobs and wealth. Today, Japan is again being cast as an
economic threat. But in a twist worthy of any thriller, Americans
are now frightened of Japan's economic weakness, which might allow
the Asian financial crisis to spread to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me is how angry, how unalloyed the anger is in
the US toward Japan right now,'' said Richard J. Samuels, who heads
the Japan program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
``There's this unified front of frustration with the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it proves to be a short-term problem or the start of a
major collapse, Japan's downturn holds lessons for the United
States, economists say. They say it shows the need for flexibility
and ``creative destruction'' in an economy, values that Japan has
rejected as a threat to its long tradition of social stability.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some economists say, Japan's story shows that
to survive this kind of economic turbulence, a country must spread
the wealth to workers, or at least extend them a safety net. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The supply problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan is facing two problems at once: a supply problem and a
demand problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side _ the part of the economy that produces goods
and services _ Japan is suffering from an industrial policy suited
for a fast-growing economy, not the mature nation that it has
become. ``It was a marvelous system for catching up to the West,''
said Richard Katz, senior editor of The Oriental Economist Report
and author of a new book, ``Japan: The System That Soured.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second World War, Japan turned itself from a farming
nation into a manufacturing powerhouse by channeling its money into
factories. Its government allowed banks to lend freely to
manufacturers and fostered industrial cartels in which members
assisted one another instead of competing. At the same time, it
protected those cartels with trade rules that kept foreign
competitors out of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Toyota and Honda autos had become world standards,
and Sony electronics flooded Western markets. By the mid-1980s,
Japanese computer chip makers outsold US rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a good economic model,'' said Gary Hufbauer, research
director at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ``But all
this shows that no model lasts forever, or that every model has its
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's case, a key weakness was that the economic system
protected not only world-class exporters but inefficient
industries, including steel, aviation, glass, and cement.
</P>
<P>
   These industries charged inflated prices to their domestic
consumers, and their cartels punished any company that tried to
undercut those prices. For example, Katz writes in the September
issue of The American Prospect magazine, the construction industry
promised not to buy cement from any firm that sold it at prices
below those set by the cement cartel. When one construction firm
bought low-cost Korean cement, Katz writes, the cartel persuaded
Japanese longshoremen not to unload it.
</P>
<P>
   Practices like these allowed Japanese producers to charge their
domestic customers prices 60 percent higher than world prices for
steel, 70 percent more for cement, and 64 percent more for
petrochemicals, Katz writes in the Prospect. They allowed the food
processing industry to survive with one-third the productivity of
US companies.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to Japan's protectionist trade rules, these
industries never faced the foreign competitors who might have
forced them to cut prices or become more efficient, Katz said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota, Honda, Sony _ they are not the problem,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington. ``The problem is with the 80 percent of companies that
are not global or flexible, that are inefficient and dragging down
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems became worse in recent years as South Korea,
Thailand, and other ``Asian Tiger'' economies developed their own
manufacturing sectors. Faced with new competition and the high
costs that cartels imposed within Japan, some of the best Japanese
companies began shifting production overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``VCRs and refrigerators _ Japan makes more of those outside
Japan than inside Japan,'' Katz said. ``Glass, steel, cement _
that's what's left at home.'' The trend is so significant that the
Japanese have a word for it: ``kudoka,'' or the ``hollowing out''
of the economy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The demand problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of its manufacturers are in trouble, Japan has also
developed a problem that seems unimaginable in the United States:
Its citizens do not buy enough products.

SOME STILL HAVE FAITH IN RUSSIAN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A once-popular Soviet song about prerevolutionary Russia
describes a servant's response to the mistress of the mansion when
she calls home one night. The stable has caught fire. In fact, the
entire estate has burned. The aristocrat's husband has died. And
the peasants have revolted.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, the servant reassures her _ &UR;  &LR; everything else
is fine.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the song could just as easily be about Russia's
stock market, in shambles after two years of heady gains.
</P>
<P>
   Among those reciting a litany of disasters but still insisting
things will turn out all right are the managers of the Lexington
Troika Dialog Russia fund, the worst-performing equity mutual fund
in the quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million fund, which invests solely in Russian stocks, is
not for the faint of heart: It lost 55 percent of its value in the
second quarter and 60 percent in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several very real and severe problems going on in
Russia right now,'' said Richard Hiser, one of the fund's managers,
from Saddle Brook, N.J., headquarters of Lexington Management, the
fund's adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's stock market _ only last year the world's
best-performing emerging market for the second year in a row _ has
collapsed in the wake of &UR;  &LR; the Asian economic turmoil that has
infected Russian debt markets, where Korean banks were players. The
reformist government is broke. Tax evasion is rampant. Hard
currency and gold reserves are dwindling. The communist-dominated
parliament is dragging its feet on tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   But everything else is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of progress has been made,'' Hiser said, citing ersatz
blue-chip enterprises, newly privatized, that are becoming more
responsive to shareholder concerns and Kremlin anticrisis measures
aimed at reviving the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, huge uncertainty remains for Lexington Troika Dialog
Russia, which last year was among the world's highest-returning
mutual funds but has since seen steep redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is now begging the International Monetary Fund for a
supplement to its $10 billion bailout. There are signs that Russia
may be forced to devalue the national currency, the ruble _ a move
that would spark inflation and social and political unrest as well
as slash equity values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors as a whole have not found Russia to their liking
yet,'' conceded Gavin N. Rankin, Lexington Troika Dialog Russia's
lead manager, from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The open-end fund, one of a handful invested solely in Russia,
treated investors to a 67.4 percent return in 1997. Most of the
gains came last summer, when economists mistakenly predicted Russia
would undergo its first growth in productivity since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's stock market, barely four years old, soared 97.7
percent in 1997 after rising 141.8 percent in 1996, both in dollar
terms. Since then, the outlook for this wild emerging market, now
in decline for nine straight months, has soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next six months are make or break,'' said John Paul Smith,
a Russia equity strategist at Morgan Stanley International in
London. ``It all depends on whether or not they devalue.'' He said
Russia's stock market could take at least two years to recover from
a currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   About one-quarter of Lexington Troika Dialog Russia's holdings
are in Russia's oil and gas sectors, which have been hit hard by
low world energy prices. Shares in utilities and telecommunications
firms account for the fund's next biggest &UR;  &LR; holdings, at 19 percent
each. With a total of 40 stocks, the fund also hold shares in
breweries, retailers, and autoworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuations have become extremely attractive, but there's a
great deal of short-term volatility,'' Hiser said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has 22 percent of its holdings in cash _ a sign that
its managers do not view stocks as the best place for investors'
money.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has some potentially world-class companies, with oil
giant LUKoil, &UR;  &LR; gas behemoth Gazprom, and national utility Unified
Energy Systems among investors' favorites. The country is endowed
with huge untapped energy and metals reserves, and, in some cases,
major Russian companies have lucrative alliances with Western
partners.
</P>
<P>
   But eight years after Russia jettisoned its planned economy,
privatized enterprises have done little to remake themselves.
Productivity has fallen and companies are mired in a vicious cycle
of nonpayments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; John F. Cogan, president of Pioneer Group Inc., a Boston-based
asset management firm with Russia operations, recently described
Russia as ``a country with 14,000 failed IPOs,'' or initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But high-risk spills as well as high returns are the hallmarks
of most emerging market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rankin: ``Russia is used to taking its knocks.''

AFTER HUGE GAINS, BLUE CHIPS DISAPPOINT INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking safety in the stock market's high but choppy waters,
most investors set their moorings last quarter in the biggest
mutual funds with the largest blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
   But they found little solace in their chosen haven.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds invested in US stocks lost an average 0.3 percent
in the three months ended &UR;  &LR; June 30, slipping into the red after
giant gains of 12 percent in the first quarter. Among general
equity funds, only those with the biggest household-name stocks
made any significant money _ and those gains were far below those
of earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of 1998, an investor could not lose
money in most US equity funds, as the market crested to new highs.
In the second quarter he could barely make any, as Wall Street,
more conscious of earnings warnings amid worries about Asia,
joltily slowed down. It was the third time in the past six quarters
that the average stock fund lost money, and a strong sign that the
double-digit gains of previous quarters simply cannot be sustained
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few exceptions. Mutual funds that invest solely in
technology stocks staged a rally at the end of June to gain 3.3
percent in the second quarter, becoming the best performing of the
so-called sector funds, which invest in a particular industry,
according to Lipper Analytical Services, the New York fund tracking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   But in a major shift from the recent past, when US stocks
dominated headlines, the best action was not even stateside.
European stock funds, buoyed by Europe's economic and financial
transformation, rose 6.3 percent, more than any other kind of fund.
Nine out of the 25 top-returning funds were invested in Europe,
with Belgian and German stocks doing especially well. Funds
invested in international small companies also gained, rising 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Funds invested in Asia and natural resources continued to
perform abysmally, with gold funds down 16 percent, China funds
losing 28.3 percent, and those invested in Asia but not in Japan
dropping 26.9 percent. Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, a Russia
fund that was once a highflier, was the worst performer of the last
quarter, losing 55 percent on Moscow's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the second-quarter slowdown, US stock funds are still up
a very strong 11.8 percent so far this year. That is a typical
year's total gains, and some analysts think the US market may yet
pull off an unprecedented fourth straight year of returns over 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Individual and institutional investors in mutual funds have done
much to fuel Wall Street's huge rise this decade. The investing
revolution that began in earnest in the mid-1980s has transformed
the way Americans plan for their futures, with funds replacing
savings accounts and insurance policies as the favored investment
vehicle. At just $135 billion in 1980 and $1 trillion in 1990, the
total assets in mutual funds of all types has mushroomed to more
than $5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But many investors appear to have unrealistic expectations of
what they will earn.
</P>
<P>
   And the newly intensified focus on size may have reshaped the US
bull market into a beast that is trying to run on one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market got narrower,'' said James M. Weiss, deputy chief
investment officer at State Street Research &AMP; Management Co.
``There was a focusing of the market onto very large companies. The
theme was `very few, very large.'''
</P>
<P>
   With their market dominance and traditionally stronger earnings
growth, large companies are historically more insulated from
economic downturns. Eager to own the outsize ``Steady Eddy'' stocks
that can better weather the effects of Asian or interest rate
turmoil, investors retreated to funds tracking the big-name
well-established companies, such as General Electric and Coca-Cola,
that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 &UR;  &LR; stock index.
</P>
<P>
   While the S&AMP;P 500 gained only 3.3 percent last quarter, after
13.5 percent in the first quarter, it is still in record territory.
But the percentage of S&AMP;P 500 companies that outperformed the index
dropped to 36 _ one of the lowest rates in 10 years, and a sign
that only a small number of the biggest companies are generating
Wall Street's returns.
</P>
<P>
   Swelled by new investments, funds that track the S&AMP;P 500 gained
3.2 percent in the just-ended quarter, and were the period's best
performing general equity funds. Such funds slightly underperformed
the index when their managers could not invest a flood of new cash
fast enough, thus missing some of the S&AMP;P's upturns late last
month. Index funds are able to attract more new money than funds
that actively pick stocks because they charge lower fees for
passively tracking a benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given the focus on size, growth funds invested
in large companies with the potential to increase earnings also
nudged up, gaining 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 19 of the nation's 25 largest mutual funds _ all of
which invest mostly in large companies _ rose last quarter, with
American Century 20th Ultra fund &UR;  &LR; leading the pack with gains of
6.1 percent. And it was a good quarter for Boston's Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest fund company, whose Magellan, the
country's biggest fund, rose 3.4 percent. Fidelity's Contrafund
returned 4.5 percent, while its Blue Chip Growth increased 4.2
percent. Bringing up the rear of the largest funds was Vanguard
Windsor, which lost 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, investors' predilection for large-company stocks locked
funds invested in smaller companies out of the action. After gains
earlier this year, most small-cap and mid-cap funds lost money.
</P>
<P>
   But the US market still hands some good stockpicker gains, even
if they are invested against the fashion. The best-performing fund
last quarter was the IAI Value fund, which gained 24.8 percent; the
tiny fund, closed to new investors in May, seeks out undervalued
stocks in smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers see danger behind the mutual fund
industry's intensified gravitation toward a narrow group of
large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a phenomenon you begin to see at the beginning of
every economic slowdown,'' said Michael Stolper, publisher of the
Mutual Fund Monthly newsletter in San Diego, describing the flight
to quality and safety and away from the small and midsize companies
that are more open to downswings in fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these blue chips are selling at price-earnings
multiples that defy history,'' said Lawrence Wachtel, a market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Valuations are at record highs.
But you could have made this argument for the past year and a half
and you would have been locked out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In another portent that Wall Street may be preparing to head
south, bond funds _ until recently the staid, fail-safe cousin to
more glamorous, high-flying stock funds _ did well last quarter,
rising 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the domestic stock market may return
to the more moderate 12 percent annual gains returns that are the
historical norm. Many companies have revised downward their
forecasts for quarterly earnings growth. But they are still 2
percentage points above the 4 percent range that many economists
think is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowly focused markets, for whatever reasons, tend to
eventually have to broaden out and take a correction at some
point,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Japan. Severe troubles with the Asian country's
battered economy risk spilling over to China, causing currency
devaluations and further regional weakness _ a process that would
jolt US companies that sell into Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, US fund investors &UR;  &LR; will stay put through a
downturn. Much of the new money has gone into long-term retirement
plans, such as 401(k)s, and investors are not likely to trash their
retirement savings by panicking and yanking out cash in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists and analysts think the recently ended
quarter provided a preview of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going ahead, you're going to have a mixed market,'' said John
W. Ballen, chief equity officer at Massachusetts Financial
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock picking and selecting (vs. tracking indexes) is going to
be more important,'' he said. ``I would think that in the more
normal return environment that we're heading into, those S&AMP;P gains
will reverse.''

ESTATE TAXES NOW PINCH MORE THAN JUST THE RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Once thought to be a problem only for the rich,
estate taxes are now challenging middle Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Work for a few decades, pay off a mortgage, buy some life
insurance and invest your savings, and boom, you could have a more
sizable estate than you had ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It's startling for clients to realize that ``maybe estate taxes
do reach down to people other than the Kennedys,'' said financial
planner Jeffrey Sullivan, who works on estate plans for clients of
the Albany law firm Burke &AMP; Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   Having a decent job, a retirement plan that performed well in
the stock market and a paid-off house puts many people in line for
estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're definitely in the middle of middle-income America,''
agreed Stewart Welch III, author of the forthcoming ``J.K. Lasser's
Estate Planning for Baby Boomers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People of my generation are accumulating a fair amount of
wealth in their own right, as well as the amount of wealth they
will inherit from their parents,'' Welch, 47, said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why consumers are seeing so many seminars from financial
consultants and lawyers on ways to protect the value of estates,
and why politicians at both state and federal levels have created
more protection from estate taxes for middle-income consumers and
their heirs, Welch said. Estate taxes generally have to be filed
and paid within six to nine months after a person's death, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the federal government that imposes a tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, current state law exempts from taxes estates of up
to $115,000, plus up to $250,000 value in a principal home.
(Separate credits apply to businesses.) But changes that will give
new relief on estate taxes go into effect later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first step will come in October when estates of up to
$300,000 will be exempt from New York estate tax, and taxes will be
cut even further after Feb. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new changes will eliminate state taxes for about 85 percent
of estates that would have been taxed previously, and cut taxes for
many of the rest, according to the state Department of Taxation and
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   New York estate taxes range from 2 percent to 21 percent,
depending on the size of the estate.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, federal estate taxes range from 18 percent to 55
percent and can create the major financial burden on an estate,
Sullivan said. Heirs often have to sell an asset to satisfy the
taxes, and it's common for estates to be taxed at 35 percent to 40
percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law now exempts $625,000 from estate tax, and the amount
exempted gradually increases to $1 million in the year 2006. But
some people are seeing their net worth grow at such a fast pace
that they may have a tax burden even under the new rules, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, careful planning is more important than ever, and
consumers should consider options such as giving some assets to
their heirs while they are still alive or creating trusts, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Every case is individual and complex, yet planning can be
worthwhile for people whose estates might be taxed by 35 percent to
40 percent, and who realize ``for every dollar I can protect, I'm
saving my heirs 35 to 40 cents. That's a staggering amount,'' he
said.

   FLAG _ WASHINGTON _ As a constitutional amendment to allow
Congress to outlaw flag descretation nears a showdown in the
Senate, witnesses ranging from former Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda
to former Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider to a disabled Green
Beret veteran testified Tuesday on the emotional issue at a hearing

already overwhelmingly approved by the House and 49 state

BUSINESSES PRESSURE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ON AGE-BIAS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson must choose between
protecting middle-aged workers and helping California's corporate
interests in a bill that would significantly strengthen
anti-discrimination laws for workers older than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups are pressuring Wilson to veto the bill, which
would prevent companies from firing older workers just to profit
from hiring younger, lower-paid employees. The measure also would
put age in the same protected class as race, religion, ancestry and
gender within the state's Labor Code.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Sen. Quentin Kopp, an Independent, the bill is
supported by every lobbying group for senior citizens. Members of
those powerful political forces, including the California Congress
of Seniors and the American Association of Retired Persons, have
sent scores of letters to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most significant anti-discrimination bills to
reach Wilson, who turns 65 next month. He has until Monday to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp's measure comes as the nation's work force is growing
older, and the number of age-discrimination lawsuits is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a court weakened California's 35-year-old age
discrimination when it ruled that companies had a free-market right
to fire employees if they were paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   Age discrimination laws generally apply to workers over 40.
Lawyers who specialize in age discrimination say they are noticing
a younger class of workers being fired and replaced with even
younger and less-expensive employees, despite the seemingly robust
economy and an ample supply of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, half of the working population in California is
expected to be over 40. The number of age discrimination complaints
filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing
rose from 2,705 in 1992 to 3,297 last year. About 15,000 claims
were filed in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see an increase in business,'' said Mark
Rudy, a San Francisco lawyer who specializes in age discrimination
cases. ``Maybe this is a prelude to some kind of recessionary
cycle, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean more people are successfully suing their
former bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate interests in California received a boost last summer
when a state Court of Appeal said they could choose workers ``even
though this may result in choosing younger employees.'' The ruling
allowed juries to be instructed that ``if the choice is based on
salary, there is no age discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted many attorneys to recommend against suing
companies for age discrimination. Instead, workers are advised to
take whatever bailout package or severance pay is offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That instruction to a jury is a killer,'' said Kopp, who
recently advised a group of airline employees against suing for age
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it put a stranglehold on a lot of the age claims that
had been brought and were pending,'' Rudy said. ``It gives
employers broad discretion in relying on cost in deciding who to
let go and who to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   A divided state Supreme Court let the jury instructions and
ruling stand. That's when Kopp and two other lawmakers proposed
three bills to rewrite the law. Kopp's bill, which was approved by
the Legislature mostly with Democratic support, is the first to
reach Wilson, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The California Manufacturers Association and the California
Chamber of Commerce contend that just because someone with a high
salary is fired doesn't mean the firing occurred because of age.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kopp's bill, a business owner would have to prove they
fired an employee out of a ``business necessity,'' not just to make
a profit. In addition, a worker would no longer have to prove
intentional discrimination, only that a framework allowed
discrimination to exist at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it removes the ability of employers to make basic
decisions as to the cost of running their businesses,'' said Fred
L. Main, a lobbyist for the Chamber of Commerce.

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Michael Allen Patton's young adult years
were characterized by violent sexual perversity, but those who knew
him say he had lived a straight-arrow life since his parole three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was here every day. He was a very steady, consistent
worker,'' said his boss, Craig Miller, president of Kresky Signs
Inc. of Petaluma, where Patton worked as a large-format silk-screen
printer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently depressed by being identified in a notice distributed
to his neighbors as a high-risk sexual predator, Patton hanged
himself Sunday in a redwood grove on Santa Rosa Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The ``community alert'' flier, which included a color photo of
the 5-foot-5-inch, 220-pound Patton and a list of the crimes of
which he had been convicted _ forcible rape, assault to commit
rape, sodomy and forced oral copulation with children under 14 _
was distributed June 30 to all homes within two blocks of the
College Avenue apartment where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Under Megan's Law, named after a New Jersey girl murdered in
1994 by a paroled sex offender who lived in her neighborhood, the
police are allowed to notify neighbors about convicted sex
offenders living nearby if they believe the offenders pose a danger
to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea he was under stress,'' Miller said of Patton.
``We were as shocked as anybody'' to learn of the suicide.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance who lived in Patton's apartment house, who
flashed a Chicago police badge but declined to give his name, said,
``They should turn the page. They do that for auto thieves and
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors interviewed for this story said they were surprised to
receive the flier, but did not object to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any idea,'' said next-door neighbor Kendra
Levitin.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Rosa police took an antiseptic view of Patton's death.
The department was simply following state law on neighborhood
notification, said Sgt. Ernesto Olivares. He said that Patton had
not seemed upset when informed of the planned distribution last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But a neighbor who had known Patton for about three years said
the notices had bothered Patton a great deal. When the notices
arrived, ``I could see the social pressure stressing him,'' said
the neighbor, who declined to give his name. ``It was a knife
through the heart. ... He said, `I just can't get away from it. I
did my time, but society still has the ability to crush you.' He
just felt he couldn't get away from underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Rosa police, using eight officers and an equal number
of volunteers, distributed community alert fliers about six such
offenders, including Patton.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County Deputy Coroner Steve Rapp said Patton had not
mentioned the flier or its effect on him in the suicide note he had
left for his family.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Patton had been out of Atascadero State Hospital for the
Criminally Insane for less than a year when he kidnapped and raped
a 17-year-old Rohnert Park high school girl in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1982, Patton pleaded guilty to charges of rape, oral
copulation, sodomy and kidnapping and was sentenced to 25 years in
prison in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in six years that Patton had committed a
violent sex offense. He had been sent to Atascadero as a mentally
disordered sex offender in 1977 for the kidnap-rape of a
23-year-old female hitchhiker.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Patton had been placed on probation and given a 90-day
sentence for kidnapping four female hitchhikers, ages 14 to 16, and
trying to molest them.
</P>
<P>
   Patton would have completed his parole in a little more than one
week, when he committed suicide.

IT'S TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER ROY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More often than not, a celebrity obituary will include something
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra died, and even heartfelt tributes by Sinatra's
devotees in the media included passing mention of his alleged mob
connections and his penchant for slugging photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mitchum died, and every story dredged up a decades-old
marijuana conviction.
</P>
<P>
   It's as predictable as this year's ``Titanic'' Oscar binge: A
show-business legend expires, and the obits are awash with tales of
the late great's forays into barroom brawling, substance abuse,
marital infidelity and who knows what other indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much the public reveres them, the rich and famous
have a way of getting their names on a court docket _ and the bad
publicity follows them to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen so many celebrity ``heroes'' who turned out to be
severely flawed individuals whose talent as performers might have
been worthy of admiration but whose performance as human beings
left much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   So the ubiquitous tributes to Roy Rogers, who died Monday at age
86, are all the more remarkable for containing no hint of scandal
or bad behavior by the movie-and-TV star who was known as ``King of
the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Rogers was the same white-hat-wearing good guy
in real life that he portrayed on screen. In a rare and gratifying
cohesion of truth and fiction, the reel hero was a real hero.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was devoted to his wife and family, treated his fans with
respect and affection, and practiced in private the very same brand
of Christianity that he preached in public. He never abused the
position of trust awarded him by a public that treasured the image
he conveyed as America's best-loved show-biz cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, several days after his death, and not a disparaging
word has been spoken or written about Roy Rogers. Usually, two days
is about all it takes for the typical movie star's ex-wives and
estranged children to start hyping their soon-to-be-published books
detailing what a jerk the guy was when the cameras shut down.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to figure that there would be a cynic or two in this
cynical age who would feel compelled to find fault with Rogers'
acting or his singing or maybe his decision to stuff ol' Trigger
after the ``smartest horse in the movies'' went to the big corral
in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. Movie historians praise him as the greatest of
moviedom's singing cowboys. Music critics write fondly of his early
crooning with the Sons of the Pioneers and his solo singing later
on.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took a moment out from the demands of
globe-trotting and scandal-managing to appreciate what Rogers
``stood for, the movies he made and the kind of values they
embodied.''
</P>
<P>
   Onetime rival Gene Autry saluted his fellow singing cowboy as a
``great humanitarian'' and a ``true Western hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one disparaging word.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Star-Telegram sports columnist Jim Reeves reminisced
about his boyhood idol Tuesday and bemoaned the shortage of
Rogers-like role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest lament today,'' Reeves wrote, ``is that my own
sons, growing up in a far more complicated world, didn't have a Roy
Rogers to emulate and learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an interesting question. What would happen if Roy
Rogers came along today? Would an adoring public make him a star,
or would the skeptics scoff him out of show business?
</P>
<P>
   Would the critics dismiss his movies as corny and
one-dimensional? Would Rogers' songs be shrugged off as trite and
oversimplified? Would his sense of right and wrong be ridiculed as
naive and uncompromising?
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that Roy Rogers should leave this life as a focal
point of universal approval at a time when just about everything he
stood for and believed in seems to be under attack by a society
that scorns the values he espoused.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's being given his due because even those who no longer
cherish his values just might suspect that the world was a better
place when Roy Rogers reigned as King of the Cowboys.
</P>

News Service for Thursday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   For information and repeats call the News Service at (212)
556-1927. And be sure to look for other stories from our partners:
Bloomberg News, The Boston Globe, Cox News Service, Hearst

</P>
<P>
   HUT-ARCHITECTRE (Undated) _ If summer is the season for
celebrating simple things, ``A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the
Circle of Architecture'' (MIT Press), by Ann Cline, is well-timed.
Its small subject _ the hut _ defines the field of architecture
like a cricket in the grass. Hand-built and homemade, usually
wooden, scraped together with pieces of scrap or engineered with
standard lumber, the hut is barely design. It is as ordinary as a
structure can be. But the hut has an extraordinary ability. It
understands what to bring in, and what to leave out, to craft the
wonder of being.
</P>
<P>
   HANNAH-HOME (Oxford, Miss.) _ It's not easy to imagine what sort
of house Barry Hannah might live in. His characters, who saunter
and stumble and soliloquize through his heavily autobiographical
fiction seem to have no home: they are drunk at the controls of a
jet or bargaining with God atop a horse or roaring down the road in
a Lincoln with beer cans rattling around the floorboard. So it is
strange to step out of Mr. Hannah's Jeep Cherokee, with a basket of
bright new tennis balls in the back seat, and onto the driveway of
his modest, Eisenhower-era house in this pretty, antebellum town.
</P>
<P>
   REFRIGERATORS (Undated) _ Of all America's migratory species,
perhaps the strangest is the refrigerator. This summer, when the
fridge is crammed with watermelon and seems to heave like an
overweight jogger, it may be worth pondering the increasingly
nomadic nature of this once-monumental appliance. The magnet-laden
stalwart of the kitchen has started to appear in the weirdest
places, popping up in closets and dresser drawers where sweaters
and mothballs used to be.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPER (Livingston, Texas) _ For years, whenever vacation time
rolled around, LaVere and Ginny Keller would roll out of Salt Lake
City in their camper truck and explore the West. ``It was pretty
tight quarters, especially when our three daughters were with us,''
he recalled. ``But we loved it. We'd get home, and we'd say,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could just keep going?''' In 1994 they
did just that. The Kellers retired, sold their house, bought a
trailer and a truck to tow it, and took to the road full time. At
Rainbow's End, a camp for up to 400 recreational vehicles here in
the piney woods of East Texas, they joyously described the changes
in their lives _ the 17 states they have toured, the new friends
they have made at RV camps along the way and most of all, the new
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Some modern kitchens may be geared up
with enough equipment to retool the Mir space station, yet they
manage to invoke the well-bred charm of Jane Austen's parlor. Tea
anyone? It can be steamed up on the Aga or zapped in the microwave
oven, then served in a room newly commodious with a kitchen sofa,
pillows, even an armchair. The designer has arrived in the kitchen,
bringing an eye for creature comforts and materials once reserved
for more showy parts of the house. The last barrier between rooms
has finally come down. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   DESERT-MOTEL (Desert Hot Springs, Calif.) _ For 15 years Miracle
Manor, a divey 40s motel 10 miles northeast of Palm Springs, seemed
scripted more than operated by Lois Blackhill, a sometimes topless
facialist noted for chanelling a spirit named Omra. Ms. Blackhill
attracted an unusual cast of characters to this Southern California
Lourdes, which sits atop a geyser reputed to gush the most
``balanced'' mineral water in America into its spa and pool. When
she died of cancer in 1996, her ashes were sprinkled under the
fronds in the garden. It seemed she would be a hard act to follow.
Could there ever be a sequel to Lois? Today, the rusty neon sign is
lighted again. The modest stucco establishment, with zoomy roofs
lifting off toward a long desert view, now belongs to a Los Angeles
designer, April Greiman, and an architect, Michael Rotondi, both
regulars at the motel since the 1980s. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>
<P>
   FROGDESIGN (New York) _ ``It's industrial Wheatena,'' Michael
McDonough, a New York architect, said. He is talking about a
product made from the stumps of wheat left after a harvest, a
caramel-colored material he fashioned into pipes that hide
electronic cables in the new 6,000 square foot office of Frogdesign
in Manhattan. Frogdesign, an industrial design company, wanted the
finished space to follow two concepts: waste not, want not, and
make sure everything can be disassembled. By Elaine Louie.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.

   ABCs: Kaffir lime is called ``makrut, makrood, bai makrut'' or

citrusy leaves as well as for its fruit. It can reach 8 to 10 feet
in height.

planting is a good idea. Use rich, well-draining soil. Add bone

soup.

MEET `PRETEND CHEF' BOB _ HE'S THE SURREAL THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that many members of Generation X are past the slacker phase
and are living life rather than searching for its meaning, they
need a domestic role model, someone they can relate to more than
Martha Stewart or Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bob Blumer, aka The Surreal Gourmet. His sense of
domesticity _ and fabulous hair _ ought to suit
almost-thirtysomethings. The basic life philosophy: Work,
experiment, play and stay healthy. And that goes double for food.
</P>
<P>
   An artist at heart _ his pieces use such bizarre juxtapositions
as a head of broccoli in chef's attire or an ear of corn on the
grille of a Buick (grilled corn, get it?) _ Blumer is also a
cookbook author who came to the field indirectly. In between
bartending jobs and managing musical artists such as ethereal
Canadian singer Jane Siberry, Blumer dabbled with food.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't learn entirely by watching cooking shows or rummaging
through cookbooks, but by mix-matching ingredients and developing
ideas according to whatever struck his fancy. His first mission: to
perfect the Caesar salad. ``It's really not a complicated thing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Caesar, new ideas emerged: cream of broccoli soup with
white wine, shrimp sauteed with fennel and Pernod, salmon grilled
between romaine lettuce leaves. He even simmered whole cloves,
cinnamon sticks, anise, orange slices and honey with a cup of
orange juice, a cup of Calvados or Southern Comfort and two bottles
of cabernet sauvignon to make a nice, hot comfort drink.
</P>
<P>
   With all those ideas running through his head, there was only
one logical thing for him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I just decided to write a book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``The Surreal Gourmet: Real Food for Pretend
Chefs,'' (Chronicle Books, $14.95), and it's not your
run-of-the-mill church-ladies cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of it as more than just a cookbook,'' he said.
``I like to think of it as a guide to better living.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Blumer explores ideas other than how to make easy
meals that are aesthetically pleasing. He explains how to stock
your kitchen with the essential utensils and spices (fresh ginger
root and garlic are ``Reasons to Live'') and how to make your
kitchen environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first book, he has made occasional guest appearances
on the Food Network and various TV shows, and he continues to do
his art. He created 18 surreal martini glasses for an auction
benefit for the Salvador Dali Museum's endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``The Surreal Gourmet Entertains: High-Fun,
Low-Stress Dinner Parties for 6-12,'' was published in '95, and he
is working on a third. ``Champagne Tastes on a Spaghetti-O Budget:
How to Get a Lot Out of Life, Regardless of What Your Lot in Life
Is,'' is tentatively scheduled for fall 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To Blumer, dining is more than just food, so he covers such
aspects as playing mood-setting music when cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyle Lovett has a lot of good food songs,'' he said,
explaining why the Texas singer-songwriter is one of his favorite
artists. That can also be assumed from Blumer's hair, a cross
between that of Lovett and The Cure's Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestions range from Gipsy Kings to Tom Waits to the
Bulgarian State Female Vocal Choir. Often, the music complements
the cuisine: blues for barbecue, Dylan's ``Highway 61 Revisited''
for making flavored olive oil (because it's a ``pick-me-up''), k.d.
lang for grilling asparagus, yams and Japanese eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you won't get from the Surreal Gourmet is an
extravagant dessert. ``Baking is about alchemy,'' he says.
``There's too much involved, and I usually don't want to mess with

dessert port.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Eight great books
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letter from a student:
</P>
<P>
   ``What books do you suggest for a high school senior that reads
and writes a lot and dreams of being a teacher or writer, maybe
even a journalist?
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, what books really impacted you when you were
almost 18 and trying to find your place in the world?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure books are the place to look for what you seek. My
experience has been that books tend to raise more questions about
life than they answer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Here's a crate of eight that I've pulled from the
bookshelf. Think of them as points on the compass:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1960) by Harper Lee, the story of a
little girl growing up in the South during the Depression. Harper
Lee's father was the inspiration for the character Atticus Finch,
and Atticus Finch is an inspiration for everyone who reads this
book.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Thanksgiving Visitor'' (1967) and ``A Christmas Memory''
(1956) by Truman Capote, a pair of novellas available in a single
volume. Beautifully written, these stories serve as companion
pieces to ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' Truman Capote and Harper Lee
grew up together, and he is also a character in her book. Indeed,
there's literary hearsay that Capote may have helped Lee with the
writing of ``Mockingbird,'' her only published novel.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Sun Also Rises'' (1928) by Ernest Hemingway, one of his
first and arguably his best novel, the story of expatriates at play
in postwar Europe. The book is prefaced with Gertrude Stein's
quote, ``You are all a lost generation.'' Even more poignant are
the novel's concluding lines: ``Oh, Jake,'' Brett said, ``we could
have had such a damned good time together.'' ... ``Yes,'' I said.
``Isn't it pretty to think so.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Moveable Feast'' (1964) by Hemingway, published
posthumously, recounts a nonfiction version from the same era as
``The Sun Also Rises.'' Here's Hemingway's quote that introduces
this memoir: ``If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a
young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays
with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Great Gatsby'' (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the
defining novel of the Jazz Age that has a place on most everyone's
list of great American literature. ``There was music from my
neighbor's house through the summer nights,'' recounts Nick
Carraway in telling the tragic story of Jay Gatsby. ``In his blue
gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
whisperings and the champagne and the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939) by John Steinbeck, who
chronicles the plight of improvised American farmers, Okies
searching vainly for a workers' paradise in California. ``They had
hoped to find a home, and they found only hatred. Okies _ the
owners hated them because the owners knew they were soft and the
Okies were strong, that they were fed and the Okies hungry.'' Songs
have been written about this novel, such is the lyrical quality of
its prose.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``All the King's Men'' (1946) by Robert Penn Warren, perhaps
THE novel of American politics, with the fictional Willie Stark in
the role of legendary Huey P. Long. ``It might have all been
different,'' Stark says as he lay dying from an assassin's bullet.
The lament of man's history on Earth has never been summed up so
simply.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Gay Place'' (1961) by Billy Lee Brammer _ the title is
from a poem by Scott Fitzgerald, ``I know a gay place nobody
knows,'' and has nothing to do with gender preference _ is
considered probably the best novel ever to come out of Texas.
Brammer does for Lyndon B. Johnson what Robert Penn Warren does for
Huey P. Long. The period is the late 1950s and the location is
Austin, though the reader is never told. Like Harper Lee, Brammer
never published again.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: ``The Last Picture Show,'' Larry McMurtry; ``The
Sound and the Fury,'' William Faulkner; ``From Here to Eternity,''
James Jones; any of the Travis McGee books by John D. MacDonald;
and all of the essays of E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the books that mean the most to me. The fun is
in finding your own.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for writing. Thanks for reading.

SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN WITH DINAH'S COOKBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lou Ann Morey of Burleson, Texas, wrote a couple of weeks ago
looking for two recipes that had been, ahem, chewed up by a new
family member _ a puppy named Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Dinah Shore's recipe for cioppino, that wonderful
San Francisco fish stew. Apparently, lots of readers have Dinah's
cookbook in their kitchen. Wanda McNeely sent in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe Lou Ann had ``lost'' was from our microwave
column from a few years back. Here they both are, and good luck
with the obedience classes.
</P>
<P>
   CIOPPINO
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, trimmed, well-washed, and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 green bell peppers, cored, seeded and cut into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   4 cups canned tomatoes (preferably imported, chopped)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fish stock PLUS 1 cup bottled clam juice OR 3 cups fresh
clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 pound firm-fleshed fish such as striped bass, red snapper,
rock cod, or sea bass, cut into bite-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shrimp, shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   1 dozen well-washed clams in the shell

green peppers and continue cooking, stirring until peppers wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, salt and pepper to taste, bay leaf,
oregano, thyme, basil and about 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Add
fish stock or clam juice and cook slowly about 2 hours, stirring

</P>
<P>
   Add wine and continue cooking about 10 minutes. The soup may be
made in advance to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes or so before serving, remove bay leaf, return
soup to boil, and add striped bass or other fish. Cook about 3
minutes and add shrimp. Cook 2 minutes more and add clams. Cover
and simmer about 6 minutes. Uncover, add oysters, scallops, lobster
tail and crab.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes or until clams open. Serve in
warmed soup bowls with red pepper flakes on the side.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Brain,'' William Finn's latest chamber opera, is the
composer-lyricist's attempt to deal with what was obviously a
doomy, seriously traumatic experience: the preliminary diagnosis of
an inoperable brain tumor, which he received in 1992 just two weeks
after winning Tonys for his book and score for ``Falsettos.''
</P>
<P>
   In the program for ``A New Brain,'' which is now at the Mitzi E.
Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center, he reports that all he could
think about in the days before the diagnosis was revised ``were the
songs I had planned to write but hadn't finally written.'' The show
we're now seeing, he says, is not meant to be a medical drama since
what eventually happened was ``much worse than anything that's on
the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``A New Brain'' means to recall what it's like to spend
five weeks thinking you're going to die, and then living. A
Dostoyevskian experience full of dread, anger and hopelessness?
Possibly, but in Finn's hindsight it also seems to have been
therapeutic: a time to recognize priorities, the ephemeral nature
of existence and the alternately sustaining and lacerating effects
of the artist's merciless vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show that has come out of all this is a major
anticlimax. ``A New Brain'' is a peculiarly random collection of
pale characters and unrevealing incidents that seem more like an
exercise in composition than an urgent expression of the creative
impulse restored.
</P>
<P>
   The new show is especially wan after the exuberant wit,
originality and technical virtuosity of ``Falsettos,'' in which
Finn explores the awakening of one of the musical theater's most
charming heels. He is Marvin, an aggressively feckless fellow who's
thunderstruck to realize that he can't put together a household of
his ex-wife, his troubled adolescent son, his male lover and his
shrink (who has fallen in love with and married the ex-wife).
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Michael Schwinn, the central character in ``A New
Brain,'' could use a little of Marvin's redeeming chutzpah. Instead
he's a passive character whose grand aspirations would seem quite
unrealistic. Like Finn early in his career, Gordon is a composer
and lyricist who dreams of writing great songs while turning out
ditties for children's television programs, in this case for a
loathsome man-size frog named Bungee.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the 100-minute ``New Brain,'' which is played
without an intermission, we move in and out of Gordon's woozy mind
as he deals with his mother, his agent, his lover, Bungee and
assorted doctors, nurses and other types found in hospital
corridors. Hovering on the fringes of his awareness is a mysterious
woman who wears rags and has a smudged face, identified in the
program as Lisa, ``a homeless lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn's principal associates are Graciela Daniele, the show's
director and choreographer, and James Lapine, who collaborated with
him on the book. ( Lapine earlier worked with Finn on ``March of
the Falsettos'' and ``Falsettoland,'' which, combined, became the
material for the Broadway production of ``Falsettos.'') Both Ms.
Daniele and Lapine appear to have worked overtime to give this new
project some sense of cohesion and energy, but it never takes off
on its own. ``A New Brain'' seems always to be on artificial life
support.
</P>
<P>
   Quite early in the show, not long after Gordon has been
hospitalized, Ms. Daniele stages a big, energetic song-and-dance
number (''Ya gotta have heart and music/Heart and music make a
song''), enthusiastically performed by all the principal
characters, including the dreaming Gordon. Yet because the number
comes so early in the show, before the audience is aware of what
the stakes are, it seems to have no point, either as a genuine
anthem or as a send-up.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the number reflects the weaknesses of Finn's entire
score, which is never as evocative, pointed or disarmingly cheeky
as ``Falsettos.'' So much attention is devoted to subsidiary
characters that Gordon remains no more than a puzzled ego. It's as
if he sees everything through a squint, so that the show becomes as
out-of-focus as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Especially disappointing are some of the lyrics, whose banality
can't be excused as intentional. I think of the number (``I'd
Rather Be Sailing'') sung by Gordon's lover, Roger, who, as
imagined by Gordon, describes his joy at being on the sea by
rhyming ``sailing'' with ``railing,'' which is the thing he leans
against as he's ``inhaling'' the fresh salt air.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's better songs is sung by a robustly gay male
nurse, who rues his fate in ``Poor, Unsuccessful and Fat.''
Meanwhile, the mysterious homeless lady pops up from time to time
as a kind of tough, streetwise psychiatrist prone to enigmatic
pronouncements in song. As the show pushes doggedly on, Gordon
himself becomes even more of a cipher than he was at the beginning.
Perhaps Finn should have spent more time on the real horrors of
Gordon's craniotomy and hospitalization rather than attempting to
compose a half-heartedly upbeat musical testament to his survival.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele's production looks great and is well sung,
especially by Malcolm Gets (Gordon), Penny Fuller (Gordon's
mother), Liz Larsen (his agent), Michael Mandell (the nurse), Chip
Zien ( Bungee) and Mary Testa (the homeless lady).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH'
</P>
<P>
   Thornton Wilder's cosmic comedy, ``The Skin of Our Teeth,''
which triumphed on Broadway in 1942 under the direction of Elia
Kazan, is still some kind of great play, but it's not easily
revived today. That's clear in the earnest, jokey, sometimes
colorful Joseph Papp Public Theater production that closes Sunday
at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   When you read it, ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' is a free-form
delight: the history of the world as experienced by and Mrs. George
Antrobus, an average American couple from Excelsior, N.J. During
their 5,000-year marriage, he invents the wheel and the alphabet,
among other things, and she keeps the family together while he
periodically threatens to run off with other women, all played by
the Antrobus maid, Sabina. Plucky optimists that they are, the
Antrobuses survive the Ice Age, the Flood, various depressions
large and small, and World War II, which America was just getting
into when Wilder wrote the play.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Life,'' Kazan describes the form of
the play ``as novel and constantly surprising,'' but says that
``the author's values'' are ``conventional and finally stuffy.'' He
adds: ``Other plays I've liked were conceived out of the life
experience of the dramatist; this play seemed to have been hatched
in the library of a financially secure college campus.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a devastating though not inaccurate assessment. Wilder
was a cerebral artist for whom the mind was the only logical locale
for his Grand Tours. Part philosopher, part professor, part yarn
spinner, he created tales that depended less on particular
experience than on his imagination. He was a fantasist of the
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its conception, ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' is full of
irresistible moments that are especially difficult to recreate in
today's theater, which is far less bound by conventions than was
the Broadway theater of 1942. In Wilder's script, the actress
playing Sabina is constantly interrupting the performance, as if
ad-libbing, to say she hasn't a clue as to what the play's about,
to remember other, better roles, or to refuse to say a particular
line of dialogue she finds distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   This was pretty lively stuff in 1942, especially when Tallulah
Bankhead, at her most grandly volcanic, was playing the outspoken
actress who plays Sabina.
</P>
<P>
   Today's audiences have grown up watching television comics step
in and out of character, break up at their own jokes and make rude
remarks about their material. Such badinage has become an accepted
form of contemporary humor, almost obligatory. This may be why the
Delacorte audience with which I saw the play accepted these
interruptions as comic. It wasn't because the interruptions really
were funny (which they weren't, at least not as played by these
actors), but because it was recognized they were supposed to be
funny. Television has taught us that intentions are enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' is showing its age these days, but
there's nothing wrong with that unless, as sometimes happens in
this staging, you have the feeling that the actors are patronizing
their material, patting it on the head. What is more difficult to
accept is Wilder's conviction that man will somehow muddle through.
</P>
<P>
   In this time of the Bomb, environmental pollution and global
warming, such optimism seems utterly mad, until you understand
that, in 1942, optimism was a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Delacourt production, directed by Irene Lewis, has the great
good fortune to have John Goodman playing Antrobus, which may be
the best role he's had since his early years on ``Roseanne.''
Goodman is a fine, big stage performer, disciplined, commanding and
unfussy. His George Antrobus pats no one on the head. He's a
salesman, traveling through the ages, meeting the eye of each
person he's talking to. Frances Conroy is also stalwart as Mrs.
Antrobus, not an easy assignment since it's almost entirely
humorless.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Johnston, of television's ``Third Rock From the Sun,''
looks stunning as Sabina, with a voluptuous figure that seems to
have been sewn into her saucy maid's costume. She also has the
seductively husky voice required of a siren still operating at peak
efficiency after 5,000 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   What she lacks, however, is an apparent willingness to be the
bitchy opportunist who might alienate the audience. She tries too
hard to please, which is the manner of the entire production. This
``Skin of Our Teeth'' seems geared to convince the audience that
it's a warm, cuddly teddy bear of a show.
</P>
<P>
   It was to guard against such interpretations that Wilder mocked
his own highfalutin aims in Sabina's asides to the audience. If
anyone was going to wink at the audience, Wilder would do the
winking. The members of the cast were expected to play it straight.

`YOU SAY TOMATO' BEARS A CROP OF LUSCIOUS RECIPES

<P>
   Ahhh, finally.
</P>
<P>
   No more ersatz tomatoes from the supermarket. No more pretending
you're biting into summer when you know full well that the only
right thing about winter tomatoes is the color of the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to revel in tomatoes: those from your garden, those
from your friends' gardens, those from the farmers markets. Still
warm from the sun and aromatic with their flavor, local tomatoes
are the culinary highlight of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Say Tomato'' by Joanne Weir (Broadway, $15) agrees. If
you're lucky enough to have your own crop of lovelies, Weir tells
you how to peel, seed, core, roast, oven-dry, freeze, can or make
them into tomato paste. If you're limited to the bounty from the
market, Weir gives recipes for fried green tomato ``sandwiches''
and Cheddar-crusted tomato flan.
</P>
<P>
   Not limited to this season's fresh offerings, the book offers
plenty of recipes using canned tomatoes _ arguably the best canned
fruit or vegetable going. ``You Say Tomato'' is a book for all
seasons.

ELECTRONIC SNOOPING ON FISH CAUSES CRY OF FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (Circuits) 
(bl) 
 By CARLA BARANAUCKAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKER, Minn. _ A video camera that reveals the secrets below
the surface of lakes in far more detail than other electronic fish
finders has renewed an intense debate about the use of technology
in the pursuit of game fish.
</P>
<P>
   The patented device, called the Aqua-Vu, can show a detailed
picture of a lake's water, bottom and inhabitants, using a video
camera small enough to fit inside a coffee mug. It is the invention
of Jeff Zernov of Brainerd, Minn., a 45-year-old lifelong fisherman
and entrepreneur. The setup, which costs $1,495 gives ``people such
enlightenment to know what was happening down there,'' Zernov said.
</P>
<P>
   But sentiments on the use of the fishcam differ sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources opposes the
camera, and it is setting up a committee to study all high-tech
devices for fishing and hunting. State Sen. Bob Lessard of
International Falls introduced a bill this spring to ban the
underwater video camera for fishing in Minnesota. The bill was
passed by the state Senate but never came to a vote in the state
House of Representatives, so it is dead unless it is reintroduced
in the next legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is fair chase and how far do we want to go before we do
away with sportsmanship and skill?'' Lessard, who has made his
living as a fishing guide since he was 13, said in a telephone
interview from his fly-in fishing resort in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Zernov said he had invented the Aqua-Vu after spending years
learning about fish and their habitats. He took up scuba diving and
founded and later sold Zercom Marine, a producer of sonar devices
that indicate whether fish might _ with an emphasis on the
``might'' _ be below the surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we know what sonar is telling us about fish, but we
don't know for sure,'' Zernov said. With a sonar device, blips on a
screen indicate that fish _ or other objects suspended in the water
_ are there.
</P>
<P>
   When Zernov was diving, he said, his presence and the noise of
the scuba equipment disturbed the fish so much that he could not
observe their normal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Then an idea came to him last summer: what if a video camera
could be put below the surface of the water with a monitor in the
fishing boat?
</P>
<P>
   In six weeks, Zernov said, he had a prototype ready. By January,
just in time for ice fishing, Zernov was selling the Aqua-Vu
underwater viewing system, with a 1{-pound black-and-white camera
(with a detachable fin and ballast weights), a 200-pound
tensile-strength power cable and a 5{-inch black-and-white monitor,
for $1,495.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard contends that technology is affecting the sport in a
fundamental way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have right now GPS,'' he said, referring to Global
Positioning System receivers, ``and we have faster boats. Our lakes
are charted and then we have state-of-the-art depth finders, which
I use, by the way. But even with those, you don't actually see the
fish. There's an element of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Zernov, who said he fished every day from a dock in his
backyard, said the camera did not take the sportsmanship out of
fishing. ``The right lure and the right presentation still hold
true,'' Zernov said. ``It doesn't force the fish to bite.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a recent demonstration on Leech Lake here in northwestern
Minnesota, the camera showed details of the lake bottom. It was
easy to differentiate among walleye, perch, weeds and the mayflies
hatching in the sandy bottom. Fish swam nonchalantly past the
camera lens, occasionally staring directly into it for an eerie
eye-to-fisheye view. The camera is maneuvered by pulling and
twisting the cable, requiring hand-eye coordination similar to that
needed for using a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mariners Classic fishing tournament on the lake, opinion
on the Aqua-Vu was sharply divided. The Leech Lake Area Chamber of
Commerce, the sponsor, does not permit the use of underwater video
cameras in its competitions, although sonar and GPS receivers are
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Zubke of Walker said he had used the camera forice fishing.
``You've got an advantage with it,'' Zubke said. ``You're looking
at the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might use a camera to examine the bottom of a lake.
``But I would never use one for fishing,'' he said. ``That would
just take the fun of it away for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Olson of Andover, Minn., said he saw no reason to ban the
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be fun to use it to see the structure that the fish are
sitting on and even what they're eating,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Michael, added, ``Sometimes the fish just won't bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Whittington of Bemidji, Minn., questioned whether a fishcam
would actually help a good angler. ``You've got some of the best
fishermen who ever wet a hook here,'' Whittington said. ``It
wouldn't have helped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough people are interested in the Aqua-Vu for sales to exceed
Zernov's initial expectations. Zernov said he had expected to sell
500 cameras in the first year. ``We sold that many in the first
three months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Arnold, owner of Reed's Sporting Goods in Walker, said he
had sold hundreds of the cameras. He said that some customers had
questioned whether he should sell the Aqua-Vu but that he responded
by saying, ``No one puts fish hooks on the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't catch them,'' he said. ``They only give us more
knowledge.'' If Arnold thought that the camera would help deplete
fish stocks, he would not sell it, he said. ``Fishing is all we
breathe and do here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the divide are the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources and the billionaire financier Irwin L. Jacobs,
whose Genmar Holdings owns boat manufacturing companies and
professional fishing tournaments, which have purses of up to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no bones about it,'' said the department's deputy
commissioner, Ron Nargang, ``we are opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nargang said the department was concerned about sportsmanship,
the potential depletion of fish stocks and the issue of keeping
fishing equally accessible to people who couldn't afford such
expensive devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual contact thing with the fish really takes us to
another level,'' Nargang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big business,'' said Jacobs, whose Wal-Mart FLW Tour is
televised on ESPN2, ``and if you create the legality of this, it
really takes the sportsmanship out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful from a nature and natural standpoint if you
take people out and just show the environment,'' he said, but he
said he thought the camera could easily be abused by fishermen. ``I
want to preserve as much of the sport as I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the debate goes on, Zernov has kept working. In August,
he plans to introduce Aqua-Vu II, which will have a smaller camera
and thinner cable and a monitor with a built-in sunscreen. He said
he expected the retail price to be less than $700.
</P>
<P>
   Nargang said, ``I'd be surprised if this did not come back to
the Legislature.'' &QL;

<P>
   HUT-ARCHITECTRE (Undated) _ If summer is the season for
celebrating simple things, ``A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the
Circle of Architecture'' (MIT Press), by Ann Cline, is well-timed.
Its small subject _ the hut _ defines the field of architecture
like a cricket in the grass. Hand-built and homemade, usually
wooden, scraped together with pieces of scrap or engineered with
standard lumber, the hut is barely design. It is as ordinary as a
structure can be. But the hut has an extraordinary ability. It
understands what to bring in, and what to leave out, to craft the
wonder of being.
</P>
<P>
   HANNAH-HOME (Oxford, Miss.) _ It's not easy to imagine what sort
of house Barry Hannah might live in. His characters, who saunter
and stumble and soliloquize through his heavily autobiographical
fiction seem to have no home: they are drunk at the controls of a
jet or bargaining with God atop a horse or roaring down the road in
a Lincoln with beer cans rattling around the floorboard. So it is
strange to step out of Mr. Hannah's Jeep Cherokee, with a basket of
bright new tennis balls in the back seat, and onto the driveway of
his modest, Eisenhower-era house in this pretty, antebellum town.
</P>
<P>
   REFRIGERATORS (Undated) _ Of all America's migratory species,
perhaps the strangest is the refrigerator. This summer, when the
fridge is crammed with watermelon and seems to heave like an
overweight jogger, it may be worth pondering the increasingly
nomadic nature of this once-monumental appliance. The magnet-laden
stalwart of the kitchen has started to appear in the weirdest
places, popping up in closets and dresser drawers where sweaters
and mothballs used to be.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPER (Livingston, Texas) _ For years, whenever vacation time
rolled around, LaVere and Ginny Keller would roll out of Salt Lake
City in their camper truck and explore the West. ``It was pretty
tight quarters, especially when our three daughters were with us,''
he recalled. ``But we loved it. We'd get home, and we'd say,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could just keep going?''' In 1994 they
did just that. The Kellers retired, sold their house, bought a
trailer and a truck to tow it, and took to the road full time. At
Rainbow's End, a camp for up to 400 recreational vehicles here in
the piney woods of East Texas, they joyously described the changes
in their lives _ the 17 states they have toured, the new friends
they have made at RV camps along the way and most of all, the new
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Some modern kitchens may be geared up
with enough equipment to retool the Mir space station, yet they
manage to invoke the well-bred charm of Jane Austen's parlor. Tea
anyone? It can be steamed up on the Aga or zapped in the microwave
oven, then served in a room newly commodious with a kitchen sofa,
pillows, even an armchair. The designer has arrived in the kitchen,
bringing an eye for creature comforts and materials once reserved
for more showy parts of the house. The last barrier between rooms
has finally come down. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   DESERT-MOTEL (Desert Hot Springs, Calif.) _ For 15 years Miracle
Manor, a divey 40s motel 10 miles northeast of Palm Springs, seemed
scripted more than operated by Lois Blackhill, a sometimes topless
facialist noted for chanelling a spirit named Omra. Ms. Blackhill
attracted an unusual cast of characters to this Southern California
Lourdes, which sits atop a geyser reputed to gush the most
``balanced'' mineral water in America into its spa and pool. When
she died of cancer in 1996, her ashes were sprinkled under the
fronds in the garden. It seemed she would be a hard act to follow.
Could there ever be a sequel to Lois? Today, the rusty neon sign is
lighted again. The modest stucco establishment, with zoomy roofs
lifting off toward a long desert view, now belongs to a Los Angeles
designer, April Greiman, and an architect, Michael Rotondi, both
regulars at the motel since the 1980s. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>

THE LIFE OF MUSICAL THEATER'S MODERN GENIUS EXPLORED IN NEW
BIOGRAPHY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  `STEPHEN SONDHEIM: A LIFE' by Meryle Secrest; (Knopf, $30) 
 
By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following well-received biographies of several key 20th-century
artists (painter Salvador Dali, architect Frank Lloyd Wright,
composer Leonard Bernstein), Meryle Secrest has turned her
attention to Stephen Sondheim, indisputably the most important
composer and lyricist in contemporary musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's bold and incredibly varied output encompasses many
stage milestones of the past 40 years _ from his Broadway
beginnings as lyricist of ``West Side Story'' and ``Gypsy,''
through his staggering early 1970s burst of creativity that
produced ``Company,'' ``Follies'' and ``A Little Night Music`` and
established him as his generation's pre-eminent composer/lyricist,
through such masterpieces of his maturity as ''Sweeney Todd,``
''Sunday in the Park With George,`` ''Into the Woods`` and
''Passion.``
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim continues the American musical's development as an art
form, taking up the mantle of composer Richard Rodgers and
librettist Oscar Hammerstein II _ the latter not only mentor to
Sondheim but virtually a surrogate father. No other Broadway talent
has consistently tackled such big, meaningful and challenging
subjects, always pushing the musical into new territory, both in
theme and structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Overtures,'' for instance, depicts the forced opening
of Japan to trade with the West after centuries of isolationism and
the subsequent effect on Japanese society _ a musical about the
price of progress. ``Sunday in the Park With George'' uses Georges
Seurat's creation of his landmark pointillist painting ``A Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte'' to explore the process
of creating art, what it costs its creator and how its meaning
reverberates beyond his lifetime. Two typically ``Sondheim''
musicals _ and who else would have had the nerve to attempt them,
much less the genius to realize them so brilliantly?
</P>
<P>
   While there have been other books on Sondheim, the most crucial
being Craig Zadan's pioneering work ``Sondheim &AMP; Co.'' (first
published in the mid-1970s but revised and expanded in recent
years), Secrest's is the first to combine discussion of Sondheim's
public career with an in-depth look at his private life, heretofore
largely unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Secrest's capably written and painstakingly researched
volume boasts inherent interest and will be widely read and
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   True, much behind-the-scenes show-biz lore reiterates material
from earlier sources. Secrest relies heavily on excerpts from
contemporary reviews of each Sondheim work, keeping her own
analysis of his music and lyrics minimal and fairly standard,
seldom supplying the depth and insight one might expect. But then,
virtually every one of Sondheim's rich and complex works could do
with a full-length study.
</P>
<P>
   In exploring Sondheim's personal life, Secrest describes his
privileged upbringing as the son of a successful dress manufacturer
and his upwardly striving wife. Parental affection seems to have
been in short supply for the child, who was ``institutionalized''
in the best schools and summer camps.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' divorce, when he was 10, became the pivotal crisis
of Sondheim's early life, while his thorny relationship with mother
Janet Fox Sondheim, a bright, aggressive and maddeningly difficult
woman aptly nicknamed ``Foxy,'' would go on bewildering them both
until her death in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age Sondheim's friendship with Hammerstein and wife
Dorothy gave needed emotional support while guiding Sondheim toward
his career in the theater. Secrest delves into Sondheim's
apprentice works written in college and under Hammerstein's
tutelage, finding early signs of blossoming talent as well as the
emotional ambivalence that would characterize much of his mature
work.
</P>
<P>
   Secrest shows how alliances formed by the unusually
well-connected Sondheim led to early career opportunities _ and
helped overcome such setbacks as the cancellation of his first
Broadway-bound show (``Saturday Night,'' for which he penned both
music and lyrics) when its producer, Lemuel Ayers, died of leukemia
in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Yet early triumphs with ``West Side Story'' and ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum'' remained shadowed by Sondheim's
own highly self-critical nature and the reluctance of some key
theater figures to acknowledge his gifts as a composer.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this biography abounds in colorful glimpses of the
fascinating, infuriating production process. Secrest details the
crucial impact of longtime Sondheim collaborators like
producer/director Hal Prince, librettist Arthur Laurents and
director/librettist James Lapine. Brilliant figures like Jerome
Robbins reveal their tempestuous and difficult side but also come
to the rescue at crucial moments _ as when Robbins, after dithering
over whether he would direct ``Forum,'' finally oversees a new
opening that saves the show.
</P>
<P>
   Secrest's book is the first to deal with Sondheim's
homosexuality _ handled with a welcome logic and lack of
sensationalism but also a discretion bordering on reticence. In his
entire adult life, only two or three relationships merit fleeting
mention. The only one treated at length is Sondheim's recent, rocky
but apparently continuing relationship with young composer Peter
Jones, whom he met in 1991; their love story clearly influenced the
course of Sondheim's emotionally charged ``Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief virtue of Secrest's biography is that it relates
Sondheim's personal life to his much-admired creative output. In
``Sunday in the Park'' the artist's mantra is, ``Connect, George.
Connect.'' Secrest has connected Sondheim the human being with
Sondheim the genius.
</P>
<P>
   One can consider Secrest's work to be definitive for the time
being, though it is equally clear that the last word has not been
written on Sondheim's life and career.

   It's celery with an attitude. An onion with a mane. Dill with
some weight on it.
</P>
<P>
   It's fennel _ the brightest bulb on the American food scene.
</P>
<P>
   New York City caterer-to-the-stars Pamela Morgan has several
recipes for the licorice-flavored vegetable in her just-published
``Flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fresh and crisp,'' she says, ``and you can use the
tops for garnish. And it's available just about year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. You can use the whole plant, from the bulb to the
feathery fronds to the seeds. It's three, three, three foods in
one.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple in Mediterranean cuisines, fennel has made its way
to the heartland of America. And the newest cookbooks are brimming
with the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan offers an olive melange with fennel seeds, and low-fat
tuna and fennel salad pitas. Steven Raichlen stuffs the bulb into
sea bass in ``The Barbecue! Bible.'' Raichlen also dries the stalks
and throws them on the fire to perfume the smoke. James Peterson
even deep-fries fennel in his just-published ``Vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Fennel's natural season is fall through late spring, but with
the miracle of modern supermarkets and importing, it's available
all year. Which is good, because the clean, crisp flavor is a
welcome summer taste.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes labeled ``anise,'' larger bulbs will probably be
fibrous and should be peeled with a vegetable peeler. To maintain
crispness, don't cut up fennel until ready to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   COLD RED PEPPER AND FENNEL SOUP WITH SUMMER HERBS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 as first course, 4 as main course
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 large red bell peppers (about 2 1/3 pounds), roasted, peeled
and chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chopped fresh fennel
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped carrot
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chopped leeks (2 medium leeks, white and pale green
parts only)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken stock or reduced-sodium canned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup medium-dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Pernod
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped chervil
</P>
<P>
   In a medium-large pot over low heat, warm the olive oil. Add
chopped peppers, fennel, onion, carrot, leeks, thyme, garlic,
fennel seeds and bay leaves. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally,
until vegetables are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Add chicken
stock, wine, Pernod and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a simmer,
partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables
are very tender, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool soup and remove bay leaves. Puree soup in batches in food
processor or blender, or force it through the medium blade of a

   Adjust salt and season the soup generously with fresh black
pepper. Sprinkle basil, parsley and chervil over soup and serve

<P>
   1 fennel bulb (about 1/2 pound), trimmed and cut in matchsticks
</P>
<P>
   28-ounce can peeled Italian plum tomatoes in juice, or 28-ounce
can crushed tomatoes in puree
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest (orange peel) of 1 orange, preferably organic
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried Italian tubular pasta, such as penne
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, snipped with scissors
</P>
<P>
   In an unheated skillet large enough to hold the pasta later on,
combine oil, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, bay leaf and a pinch
of salt, and toss to coat with the oil. Place over moderate heat,
cooking just until garlic turns golden but doesn't brown, 2-3
minutes. Add fennel, stirring so ingredients blend together and are
evenly coated in the oil. Cover and sweat for 10 minutes over
moderate heat. Toss fennel with wooden spoon from time to time to
assure that pieces don't stick or burn.
</P>
<P>
   Add tomatoes. If using whole canned tomatoes, place a food mill
over skillet and puree tomatoes directly into it. Crushed tomatoes
can be added directly from the can. Add orange zest. Stir to blend
and simmer, uncovered, until sauce begins to thicken, about 15
minutes. Taste for seasoning. Remove and discard bay leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to rolling
boil. Add 3 tablespoons of salt and the penne, stirring to prevent
pasta from sticking to bottom. Cook until tender but still firm to
the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Add drained pasta to skillet with fennel sauce and toss. Cover,
turn heat to low and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring to coat
pasta with sauce. Taste for seasoning. Add parsley and toss again.
Transfer to warmed shallow soup bowls and serve immediately.

   LOS ANGELES _ Someone, somewhere may be wearing a wool suit, but
not you.
</P>
<P>
   It's summertime, and you're hula-happy, going on a surfin'
safari, headed for Maui-wowie styles or at least dreamin' about a
weekend in Santa Barbara in clothes that don't have to go to the
dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   No-sweat cotton is the annual summertime fabric of choice,
although you'll still find some trendies showing no visible panty
lines in spandex capri pants and tube skirts. Or maybe an
easy-to-pack, hand-washable rayon or Tencel sleeveless slip dress
by the likes of David Dart or Ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the picture. It's a lazy, hazy summer that's big on
tropical brights and prints, whether it's a sarong, sun dress, clam
diggers with tank top, or a two-piece swimsuit with little boy
bottoms. Or merely a silk butterfly (they're at Nordstrom) or
flower (Saks has them) pinned on a linen lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's an alternative. It's the '50s, circa James Dean
and Sophia Loren, and everything they wore _ from his white tee and
dark denim jeans to her capri pants and halter dresses with
oversized sunglasses and high-heeled sandals _ are now hot looks
for warm days.
</P>
<P>
   Denim is back in a big way (even those classic jeans jackets
worn with cotton tank dresses) because of Levi's 125th anniversary.
It's also the 20th anniversary of Calvin Klein jeans, so in honor
of those early days in deep indigo (before we'd ever heard of
stone-washed), numerous jeans manufacturers (Levi's, Calvin Klein
and Jordache) are offering the original denim color and style, worn
extra long and casually cuffed. And cutting-edge designers such as
Max Azria of BCBG are going for total nostalgia with extra snug
(lots of spandex) jeans cropped to capri length that will remind
you of what the fast girls wore in ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides something tropical and a pair of jeans, you'll want an
oversized white cotton shirt to update your wardrobe. The
man-tailored type, worn like a jacket, makes a perfect cover-up for
those skimpy little tank tops. Just pull the collar up, roll the
sleeves back and add a neckerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the creation of casual Fridays, khaki is still with us
in classic pleated trousers and the newer flat front styles. And
its headquarters is the Gap, where you'll also find white shirts
and black cotton knit tank tops that look a lot like grandpa's
undershirts, with straps wide enough to hide bra straps.
</P>
<P>
   At department stores, you'll find fresh variations on khaki,
including Op's cargo-pocketed walking shorts. Note that those
pockets, which add 10 pounds (20 if you actually put something in
them), are tres chic for men and women this summer. If you're not
worried about your weight, also consider 26 Redsugar's hip-riding
khaki pants in a cotton/lycra blend.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories? Back from the '80s is the cardigan sweater, but
don't actually wear it. It's just a prop, to be tied around your
shoulders or waist and add color to your ensemble. You'll even see
them in black, worn over sleeveless black sheaths.
</P>
<P>
   Other must-haves include some shoulder-grazing earrings; an
oversized cocktail ring (platinum or silver); oversized sunglasses
with a black plastic ``necklace'' that lets them dangle around your
neck when you're not wearing them; a vintage-looking jeweled
barrette or hairpin, a hefty silver watch, and a choker or dog
collar-style necklace.
</P>
<P>
   DAY, EVENING PURSES: After a few seasons of carrying our
ladylike handbag, we discovered it only looks good at ladylike
places ... like the office, church or tea parties. Or shopping with
Mom. And rarely is it roomy enough for sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that Lady Di (Dior) or Kelly (Hermes) bag looks out of
place when you're hitting the beach, on vacation or spending the
day at the zoo with the kiddos.
</P>
<P>
   What you need is a tote, whether it's woven from leather, vinyl
or straw. The design options are myriad (ditto on the colors), but
the shape is boxy and utilitarian. It replaces the backpack but
carries the same loot: cosmetics, camera, sneakers, sunscreen,
shades, a book and a ball cap. The brand names to buy or copy: Kate
Spade, Princess Foufou, Anna Sui.
</P>
<P>
   For evenings out on the town, you'll want something really tiny,
such as a clutch (sooo '60s), or one of those beaded
``Titanic''-inspired bags with a short chain handle. Or go ultra
retro with a small handbag covered in old-fashioned fabric to
enhance a sleeveless summer shift or twin set with knee-length
pleated skirt.
</P>
<P>
   AND ON YOUR FEET...: There's plenty of toe exposure this summer,
whether it's a strappy sandal, a thong (and its beachy cousin the
flip-flop) or a sexy slide (also called a mule) with a tiny spike
heel. And, yes, those high-heeled platform sandals from last summer
are still in.
</P>
<P>
   Think of them as a way to show off all those weird nail polish
colors, your e-nail decals and your new toe ring ... and stock up
on Dr. Scholl's new pedicure kits.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion rage started in Paris, with Chanel thongs sporting
leather flowers on the toe and $455 price tags, but the look has
trickled down to drugstore prices and were also spotted this week
on sale at Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Too many bunions to share with the world? Go for a colorful
sneaker by everybody from Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger to
Sketchers and Keds. The latter even has a pointy-toed, high-heeled
sneaker-like slide designed by Cynthia Rowley and featured in her
L.A. boutique.
</P>
<P>
   To show your fashion edge and keep your back from hurting,
invest now in flats. Yep, that '50s staple worn by the poodle-skirt
crowd is coming back strong and looks great with a pair of pedal
pushers.

SHADES WITH STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Sunglasses do sooo much more than shade your eyes
from those nasty ultraviolet rays and camera flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about 'tude. Pull on a pair of oversized plastic shades
and you, too, can be a movie star like Sophia Loren in the '50s. Or
try some sassy cat's eyes and impress the mall rats with your
fashion savvy. Or look like you know the club scene (even if you
don't) with those new yellow or blue-tinted lenses. Or be square
with the style that's linked to Cary Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses are sold everywhere, from amusement parks to
drugstores to specialty spec shops. And the prices run the gamut
from $7.99 to $200. Just make sure that the lenses offer protection
from the sun's harmful UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're going for the total image concept, you'll want a
designer label (think of it as '80s retro), and you need to know
the key players. So, the European names to drop _ or wear
prominently on the temple piece of your sunglasses _ are Gucci,
Chanel and Frederic Fekkai, who recently opened a boutique on Rodeo
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   However, American designer Calvin Klein has a suave new design
with a bold oval contour plus UVA and UVB protection that's equal
to any of those European shades. It's called the Avenger, and will
be launched at sunglass and department stores to coincide with
Warner Bros.' Aug. 14 release of ``The Avengers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you'll need different pairs for all your
wardrobe changes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mitchell Simmons, a spokesman for Ray-Bans, this is
a dial-a-decade year, with numerous retro designs making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The company known for producing the first mass-marketed
sunglasses (and a fave with Tom Cruise) has brought back its
original styles from the '30s (delicate metal frames and spring
hinges); the '50s (cat's eyes and big squares); the '70s (oversized
plastic bubble shapes and aviators); and some futuristic wrap
styles in gunmetal gray.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to shape, almost anything goes, but rectangular
lenses are the newest trend, says Sunglass Hut spokeswoman Sherry
Lay. And the color palette is huge, with a strong interest in blue
and yellow, and metallics with shiny car finishes. You'll find them
in plastic or metal, or a combination, and often with tinted
lenses. The ``fade'' lense is back, too, but no word yet on
rhinestones and initials like we saw in the late '70s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CHARLES, La. _ Blind and comatose, Dan Ross succumbed to
brain cancer on Oct. 9, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A large and unpretentious man of 46, Ross had spent 23 years at
the Conoco _ later Vista _ chemical plant in Lake Charles. He had
made a good living, raised a family, saved for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   After his diagnosis, Ross came to believe that he had struck a
terrible bargain, forfeiting perhaps 30 years of his life through
his willingness to work with vinyl chloride and other
cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before he died, he said, `Mama, they killed me,'''
recalled his wife, Elaine. ``I promised him I would never let Vista
or the chemical industry forget who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's death set her and a local attorney, William
Baggett Jr., on a circuitous course of litigation that led to the
industry's well-insulated core.
</P>
<P>
   During the past eight years, Baggett has acquired thousands of
previously secret documents, most having to do with vinyl chloride
_ used to make one of the world's most common plastics.
</P>
<P>
   These documents suggest that major chemical manufacturers closed
ranks in the late 1950s to contain and counteract evidence of vinyl
chloride's toxic effects.
</P>
<P>
   Letters, memoranda and minutes of meetings depict a framework of
dubious science and painstaking public relations, coordinated by
the industry's main trade association.
</P>
<P>
   There are two dominant themes: avoid disclosure and deny
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a concerted effort to hide this material,'' said Dr.
David Rosner, a professor of public health and history at Columbia
University who has reviewed many of the documents as part of a
research project. ``It's clear there was chicanery.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the Chemical Manufacturers Association
called such charges ``irresponsible.'' The group said that it
promotes a policy of openness among its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the problem seriously,'' said Dr. Theodore Torkelson,
a retired Dow Chemical toxicologist who chaired the CMA's vinyl
chloride panel for 11 years in the 1970s and '80s. ``We did what we
thought was ethical, scientifically sound and morally
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents present another scenario: That the chemical
companies, through their silence and inertia, subjected at least
two generations of workers to excessive levels of a potent
carcinogen that targets the liver, brain, lungs and blood-forming
organs.
</P>
<P>
   Although they freely shared health information among themselves,
the companies were evasive with their own employees and the
government. They were unwilling to disrupt the growing market for
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic, used in everything from pipe to
garden hoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they may be competitive in some spheres, in others
they aren't,'' Baggett said. ``They have a mutual interest in their
own employees not knowing (about health effects), in their
customers not knowing, in the government not knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Put in context by hundreds of interviews, the documents flesh
out a story that made headlines during the first half of 1974, only
to be overshadowed by Watergate and Richard Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   And they accentuate the problem of occupational cancer, which,
by some estimates, takes more lives (50,000) each year than AIDS,
homicide or suicide, but receives far less attention.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, most manufacturers acknowledge only that vinyl
chloride causes angiosarcoma, an extremely rare cancer of the
liver. They insist that the exposure levels necessary to produce
the disease have not been seen in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, this is true.
</P>
<P>
   Because of government-required controls _ controls the industry
resisted _ vinyl chloride contamination in and around chemical
plants has been reduced dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Significant exposures in some places occurred well into the
1980s, however. And unusual cancers other than angiosarcoma
continue to kill chemical workers and retirees prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Henry Tousaint, who had spent 20 years at the PPG
Industries plant in Lake Charles, died of mantle-cell lymphoma at
age 54. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Tousaint and other PPG workers routinely cleaned chemical
storage tanks and mixed pesticides, inhaling vinyl chloride,
benzene and other carcinogens in the process. Those who complained
of dizziness or breathing difficulties were given cough syrup, kept
in gallon jugs, Tousaint said three months before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know no better,'' he said. ``But they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the company's Pittsburgh headquarters would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Baggett won large settlements for both the Tousaint and the Ross
families from PPG, Conoco and Vista, none of which admitted
culpability. He is building a conspiracy case against 29 other
chemical companies, the CMA and the Society of the Plastics
Industry, alleging that they obfuscated evidence of vinyl
chloride-related deaths and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope to achieve, through Billy, is that every man who
works in a chemical plant is told the truth and tested on a regular
basis in the proper manner,'' Elaine Ross said. ``I want the
chemical companies to be accountable for every little detail that
they don't tell these men.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TROUBLING TEST RESULTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1959, the evidence was beginning to accrue. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Manufacturers of vinyl chloride _ then known only as an
explosion hazard and an intoxicant _ came to realize that the
compound might be poisoning the people who worked with it.
</P>
<P>
   Dow had been discreetly testing the sweet-smelling, gaseous
substance on rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs at its Biochemical
Research Laboratory in Midland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The results were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse liver effects had been seen in animals that had inhaled
only 100 parts per million of vinyl chloride, a fraction of the
concentration to which many workers were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the B.F. Goodrich Chemical Co.'s industrial
hygiene director on May 12, 1959, one of the Dow scientists, V.K.
Rowe, outlined the experimental findings and concluded that vinyl
chloride could produce ``rather appreciable injury'' among workers
routinely exposed to 500 parts per million, then the voluntary
standard. Rowe ended his letter with a plea:
</P>
<P>
   ``... this opinion is not ready for dissemination yet and I
would appreciate it if you would hold it in confidence ...''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 years, the Goodrich hygienist and many others
responsible for worker health in the chemical industry did a
remarkable job of honoring such requests.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dow began its animal work in 1958, there had been few
investigations of vinyl chloride _ although acute effects had been
seen in guinea pigs as early as 1930, and liver damage had been
found in 15 of 45 vinyl chloride workers examined as part of a 1949
study in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow researchers published their data in the American
Industrial Hygiene Association Journal in 1961, recommending a
vinyl chloride exposure limit of 50 ppm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one outside of Dow listened.
</P>
<P>
   A 1963 Yale University animal study sponsored by Allied Chemical
found no significant effects below 500 ppm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry goofed up,'' said Torkelson, who helped conduct
the Dow experiments. ``Probably if they had listened to our 50 ppm
(recommendation), we wouldn't have had a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn't come
into being until 1970; consequently, there was no government agency
to force companies to act.)
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1964, Goodrich _ which would be commended for
revealing a cluster of angiosarcomas at one of its plants a decade
later _ sought help from the Kettering Laboratory at the University
of Cincinnati. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A puzzling hand disability had emerged among workers who
cleaned the reactors _ huge, blenderlike devices in which vinyl
chloride monomer is turned into PVC resin _ at a Goodrich plant in
Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, cleaners entered the reactors without respiratory
protection to chip away the residue that built up on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody felt like vinyl chloride was a problem,'' said Jerome
Heckman, a Washington attorney who has represented the Society of
the Plastics Industry for 44 years. ``The workers used to climb
down in those damned reactors and play around in them because they
got a great high out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1966, it had become apparent that the hand condition _
acroosteolysis, characterized by numbness and swelling of the
fingers _ was systemic, indicative of vinyl chloride's toxicity.
And it was not confined to reactor cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, an epidemiological study of vinyl workers
commenced at the University of Michigan. All company data, it was
emphasized, would be held ``in strictest confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Michigan researchers catalogued cases of acroosteolysis,
Dr. Pier Luigi &UR;  &LR; Viola, an industrial physician for the Belgian
chemical firm Solvay, attempted to produce the disease in monkeys
and rats exposed to vinyl chloride gas in a Rome laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he produced cancer, albeit at high concentrations. U.S.
manufacturers grasped the significance of this unexpected finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this report appears to be so convincing,'' Dr. George
Roush, medical director of the Ethyl Corp. in New Orleans, wrote to
a colleague on June 24, 1970, ``I suppose that we must consider
vinyl chloride as a carcinogen ...''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1972, Dr. Cesare Maltoni, an Italian oncologist,
had seen angiosarcoma in rats exposed to as little as 250 ppm of
vinyl chloride. The news traveled quickly across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   An Allied Chemical memorandum called Maltoni's results
``disconcerting,'' and a Uniroyal memo concluded, ``The work in
Europe indicates we have a problem which cannot be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WORKERS EXPOSED NEEDLESSLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Michigan acroosteolysis registry ultimately
collapsed from lack of industry cooperation, its keepers managed to
convey an important message to the Manufacturing Chemists
Association, the trade group that later became the CMA: Get people
out of the reactors, or at least limit exposures to 50 ppm. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The recommendation, included in a confidential report to the
MCA in February 1969, was not followed. &UR;  &LR; As a result, workers were
needlessly exposed to high levels of vinyl chloride.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Smith entered his first reactor at the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co. plant in Niagara Falls, N.Y., in November 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He died, at 40, of a brain tumor on Sept. 15, 1993, leaving
behind a wife and young daughter. He was hospitalized for the last
eight months of his life, unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I went to the hospital, and we would write on a
pad,'' said his wife, Holly Cummings. ``It took him half an hour or
45 minutes to get one stupid sentence down. It eventually got to
the point where he couldn't even nod his head.''
</P>

   The wall of secrecy surrounding vinyl chloride was not breached
until Jan. 23, 1974, when B.F. Goodrich announced that it had found
three fatal cases of angiosarcoma among workers at its PVC plant in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Goodrich was praised for its candor, it and other
manufacturers knew a great deal about the chemical's toxic
properties long before Louisville and understood the economic
onsequences of bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Goodrich _ fearful of a broad indictment of PVC _ had
tried to stop publication of a European researcher's paper in 1966,
according to a Monsanto memo. It is unclear whether Goodrich
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said in a prepared statement that it ``has always acted
responsibly in addressing potential health risks associated with
direct exposure to vinyl chloride.``
</P>
<P>
   (An article on acroosteolysis, authored by four Goodrich medical
officials, was published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1967. It was inconclusive, suggesting that the
disease was not serious or common, was restricted to reactor
cleaners and was due in large part to ``personal idiosyncrasy.``) &QL;

   The Louisville cancer revelation in 1974 set in motion months of
frenetic activity in Washington, highlighted by contentious OSHA
and congressional hearings. Labor leaders and public-health
advocates spoke of a cover-up by the vinyl industry; the industry
accused them of overreacting and threatening its survival.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA adopted an emergency temporary standard of 50 ppm and later
proposed a permanent standard of 1 ppm. A federal ban was imposed
on the use of vinyl chloride as a propellant in hair sprays,
pesticides and other aerosol products; a proposed ban on PVC liquor
bottles was averted when the industry found a way to limit
migration of vinyl chloride into the liquor.
</P>
<P>
   (Mindful of ``essentially unlimited liability to the entire U.S.
population,'' as Union Carbide put it in 1973, some manufacturers
already had begun to pull out of the aerosol market. Tests had
shown that it was not unusual for hair spray users of that era to
be exposed to hundreds or even thousands of parts per million of
vinyl chloride; a 1972 Carbide memo pointed out that ``beauty
operators applying hair spray on a daily, routine basis might
actually be a better population to examine than chemical plant
operators.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite the convincing animal data from Italy and public
pressure, the chemical companies did not acquiesce. A study
commissioned by the Society of the Plastics Industry concluded that
the new OSHA standard would eliminate at least 1.6 million jobs _
from reactor cleaners to plastics fabricators _ and have a minimum
economic impact of $65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The SPI challenged the 1 ppm standard before a three-judge
federal panel and lost on Jan. 31, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argued that it was arbitrary and capricious to say 1 (ppm),
that they pulled that number out of their ear,'' said Heckman, the
society's attorney. ``I got killed in court.''
</P>
<P>
   In the panel's opinion, retired Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark
wrote that ``the record shows what can only be described as a
course of continued procrastination on the part of the industry to
protect the lives of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire predictions, the industry did not disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Using technology developed in Japan in the late 1960s,
manufacturers installed reactors that greatly reduced the need for
manual cleaning. New ways were found to lower the vinyl chloride
content of PVC resin from hundreds of parts per million to less
than 1 ppm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry really, really changed,'' said Bill Carroll, a
vice president with Occidental Chemical in Dallas and an officer
with the Vinyl Institute, a trade association. ``If you look at how
close it might have come to being regulated out of existence _ to
come from that circumstance to the point of doing what had to be
done to make the product safe, I think it's a tremendous success
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There remained, however, the matter of cancer. &UR;

</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s, clusters of disease were beginning to spring
from plants such as the Monsanto chemical complex in Indian
Orchard, Mass. For vinyl workers who had started in the 1940s, '50s
and possibly the early '60s, the requisite latency for cancer had
passed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the summer of 1975, a group of Monsanto workers approached
the Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industries with the death
certificates of 56 former colleagues and a list of others who had
died.
</P>
<P>
   A department physician found additional deaths and determined
that there was a cancer excess among workers who had been assigned
to Building 85, where PVC resin was fabricated into vinyl
swimming-pool bottoms, wallpaper backing and other items.
Pancreatic cancer had killed at a rate five times the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health did a
study, as did Monsanto. Their conclusions were strikingly
different.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto found ``no occupationally related health problem'' at
the plant. NIOSH found an excess of digestive-system cancers and
said it suspected ``occupational factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers, understandably, were frustrated and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Wengstrom, who was laid off in 1973 and spent years
documenting cancer cases in hopes of holding Monsanto liable,
remains bitter about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were dying like flies,'' Wengstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1979, the vinyl industry was presented with another
potential crisis. OSHA had found a cluster of brain cancers at the
Union Carbide plant in Texas City near Houston, and vinyl chloride
was suspected as the causative agent.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case at Indian Orchard, concurrent studies yielded
conflicting results. NIOSH and Union Carbide could not even agree
on the number of brain cancer deaths; the former listed 23, the
latter 12.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Carbide number represented an excess. But the company
attributed it to chance, not chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in 1982, federal investigators gave details
of 25 brain cancer deaths among former employees of Dow's Texas
Division in Freeport. The deaths occurred between 1951 and 1977,
and most of the cancers were of two strains: astrocytoma and
glioblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   The average age at death was 55, and eight of the victims were
under 50. The conclusion _ with which the company disagreed _ was
that there was ``an increased risk of death due to brain tumor''
among ex-Dow workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early '90s, cancer became an issue for
Houston-based Vista, now known as Condea Vista. At least four
workers _ Dan Ross and another man at Vista's vinyl chloride
monomer plant in Lake Charles, and two men at its PVC plant in
Aberdeen, Miss. _ had developed brain tumors, and there had been
other cancers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Vista management held several meetings with workers in an effort
to quell fear and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Reynolds, Vista chairman of Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
Local 4-555 and an operator at the Lake Charles plant, said that
the company has been slow to respond to cancer concerns, despite
evidence that chemical exposures have caused illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money,'' said Reynolds, a gaunt man of 41 with
a baffling _ and, he thinks, work-related _ condition of the
nervous system that keeps him fatigued and in pain. ``All these
years, I believe, they've been killing people, but they've put a
dollar figure on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grumbles, Vista's manager of product safety and occupational
health in Houston, said that the 1991 meetings were tense but
productive, part of a ``fairly extensive effort to communicate with
our employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, personal medical issues are very emotional for
people,'' Grumbles said. ``There's little chance you're going to
satisfy everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SETTLEMENTS FAR FROM LUCRATICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some of the cancers out of the chemical plants gave
rise to workers' compensation claims and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these actions, however, resulted in lucrative judgments
or settlements; the burden of proof for occupational cancer was
simply too great, and the industry was able and willing to play
hardball.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband, Joseph, died of angiosarcoma in January 1989,
Dorothy Succi filed a claim against his employer, Gencorp Polymer
Products, which operated a PVC plant in Ashtabula, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Succi had spent 28 years at the plant (closed in 1983) as a
laborer, a mechanic and an electrician. He was diagnosed with
angiosarcoma _ irrefutably tied to vinyl chloride exposure _ in
1988, and was included in a worldwide, industry-maintained
registry. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; When his widow sought death benefits from the Ohio Bureau of
Workers' Compensation, however, Gencorp fought her, saying ``we do
not believe (Succi's) condition is the result of his employment
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing was held in Columbus in November 1989, and Dorothy
Succi won. But Gencorp appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 9, 1990, letter to Succi's attorney, Gencorp safety
and workers' compensation manager Kenneth Breyley offered $37,500
to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe we can convince the Industrial Commission the
angiosarcoma could not have been the result of Joseph's exposures
to `chemicals' at the workplace,'' Breyley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Succi said that she settled for $48,000 after being warned by
her lawyer that the case could go on for years. ``I just wanted a
closing to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gencorp spokeswoman Rosemary Younts said that the claim was
contested because Joseph Succi spent most of his career as an
electrician and would have had minimal contact with vinyl chloride.
A document from the angiosarcoma registry, however, indicated that
Succi had high exposures during his first few years at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Charles attorney Baggett maintains that the 5,000 or so
workers in U.S. vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride and PVC resin
plants aren't the only ones vulnerable to cancer and other serious
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 120,000 people work in PVC fabrication, turning the
white powder into flooring, siding, blood bags and other familiar
products. Might they, too, be at risk?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one (in industry) is going to study fabricators,'' Baggett
said. ``It'll never happen. What if they found something?''
</P>
<P>
   Quite by accident, a Swedish researcher did find something.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Dr. Lennart Hardell, an associate professor of
oncology and epidemiology at Orebro Medical Center, began
distributing questionnaires to testicular cancer victims and a
group of controls.
</P>
<P>
   Hardell was searching for possible occupational causes of the
disease, on the rise in Sweden and other industrialized countries.
By the time he had compiled his data, only one line of work stood
out: PVC fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't expected anything on PVC,'' Hardell said. ``We had
no suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was published late last year. Considering the high
risk he had observed for PVC exposure, Hardell called for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels, Belgium-based PVC Information Council responded
swiftly and decisively, as its U.S. counterparts had done many
times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see a cancer threat for (PVC) workers,'' the council
said.

FEELING OLD? BLAME IT ON YOUR CELLS
</HEADLINE>
 AGE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If Mother Nature doesn't get you, Father Time will.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the cause of death in people older that 85, says
the scientist who discovered in 1961 that human cells can divide
only a finite number of times before they age and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has cardiovascular disease at that age _ or any age _
and there are very few older people you can open up on autopsy and
not find cancer,'' says Leonard Hayflick, Ph.D. ``Doctors put down
some socially acceptable reason as the cause of death, but
ultimately in many cases, time has simply run out. The normal
process of aging has reached its limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The clocks that govern our lives are not all on our walls or on
our wrists. The clocks that age us are in our cells, and they
ultimately determine how many seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
months, seasons and years add up to one life, Hayflick says.
</P>
<P>
   He and other researchers in the young science of biogerontology
are trying to find out how our cellular clocks work and what they
can tell us about our biological destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Hayflick was in Fort Worth recently on a public education
campaign to promote
</P>
<P>
   early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The visit was sponsored
by the makers of Aricept, the new Alzheimer's drug.
</P>
<P>
   Hayflick's book, ``How and Why We Age'' (Ballantine Books, $14),
is based on more than 30 years of pioneering research in biological
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the concept of ``The Hayflick Limit,'' researchers
reported in the journal ``Science'' this year that for the first
time, healthy human cells growing in a dish have been made
immortal.
</P>
<P>
   The new research is based on the finding that the innate
potential for cells to divide and reproduce is controlled by a
chemical sequence called telomeres, found at the tips of
chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, its telomeres grow shorter
until they eventually become unstable, stop dividing and die.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists broke the cellular aging process by replenishing the
enzyme called ``telomerase,'' which telomeres need to continue
dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our understanding of telomeres, we now have the capacity
to immortalize a living cell with a finite capacity to replicate on
its own,'' Hayflick says. ``As our understanding of cell biology
increases and we understand the process of how cells age and die,
we will be able to develop means of interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayflick says that aging is not a disease, but it is terminal _
unless scientists find a way to give cells in the body an endless
supply of telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   Even if medical science were to find cures for all diseases and
all injuries, he says, people would die of cellular aging. Even
accidents are often caused by aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal process of aging increases your vulnerability to
the causes of death listed on death certificates, even if you are
hit by a truck _ you might not see it in time or react in time to
jump out of the way'' because of aging senses, Hayflick points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is why an old cell is more susceptible to
pathology than a young cell. That will explain Alzheimer's,
arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease _ heart attacks, strokes
_ and all the rest. Why don't 20-year-olds get those diseases in
most cases? There's something different about their cells,''
Hayflick says.
</P>
<P>
   Few question the goal of resolving all the causes of death
listed on death certificates, Hayflick allows. But most older
people would rather add life to their remaining years than
unlimited years to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living longer with a very important caveat: Life
expectancy and life span are not the same thing,'' he says. ``Life
span has not increased in 100,000 years; life expectancy has
increased more than 25 years in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy _ the average length of life for a just-born
person _ has increased from 45 years in 1900 to 75 years today. But
the ultimate life span _ the upper limit on human life _ has
remained about 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few serious scientists are directing their research to
extending human longevity or achieving immortality,'' Hayflick
says. ``The goal should be for all human beings to reach the
maximum life span, still in possession of full mental and physical
abilities, with death occurring quickly as we approach, say, our
115th birthday.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ It is evidently the quest for international status which
underlies India's determination to be, and to be recognized as, a
nuclear power. Pakistan also feels a need for protection against
India's overwhelming conventional force, and likes the idea of ``me
too.''
 &HT;    But despite India's references to the need for a ``minimum
deterrent'' against China, pointing out that it has neither ``the
resources nor the will for parity,'' New Delhi's statements make
clear that it is a long simmering resentment at what seemed the
world's disregard for India's weight that decided the
nationalist-leaning coalition government to hold and publicize
nuclear tests.
 &HT;    A European diplomat recently asked Indian officials why, if they
felt the need for nuclear weapons, they didn't copy the Israeli
tactic of building them without attracting the international
opprobrium of vaunting it.
 &HT;    At one point, that had been the strategy. An unidentified Indian
``senior official'' formally told Western correspondents last week
that aside from the recent nuclear tests, India already has atomic
arms it could use, and the systems to deliver them.
 &HT;    This, of course, has been suspected for some time. But beyond
the thesis for deterrence, India craved recognition.
 &HT;    A New Delhi communique, denouncing the joint U.S.-China summit
call for both India and Pakistan to curb a possible arms race, was
blunt. It said, ``India categorically rejects the notion of these
two countries arrogating to themselves joint or individual
responsibility for the maintenance of peace, stability and security
in the region. This approach reflects the hegemonistic mentality of
a bygone era in international relations and is completely
unacceptable and out of place in the present day world.''
 &HT;    The Indians have a point in complaining that despite their size
and numbers, they are routinely put in a class well below China in
status. And they can make a fair argument that with the end of a
two superpower world, permanent membership in the U.N. Security
Council is by no means an evident measure of importance.
 &HT;    It happens that the five permanent members are all nuclear
powers, the only avowed ones until the Indian and Pakistani tests.
None had atomic weapons when the Council membership and its rules
were adopted, not even the United States. The distinction is ex
post facto.
 &HT;    Status, ranking in the world, has always been a consideration
for states alongside the influence that actual power brings. Now,
however, it is becoming a prime factor which distorts conventional
strategic analysis and cannot be overlooked.
 &HT;    Russia is the most obvious current example. Whatever else it
disagrees on, the Russian establishment is unanimously
hypersensitive to making sure their country continues to be
regarded as a great power, in big things and small. That, many will
tell you, is the real reason they are so upset by the expansion of
NATO, which they do not see as a military threat but as a
psychological one which could produce a backlash of nationalism.
 &HT;    Likewise, China's satisfaction with the deferent warmth
displayed by President Bill Clinton on his nine-day trip was more
what I call ``geo-psychics'' than any substantive gain or
agreement. What mattered to Beijing was the symbolism, given added
relative weight by his willingness to skip a courtesy stop in
Japan.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ It is evidently the quest for international status which
underlies India's determination to be, and to be recognized as, a
nuclear power. Pakistan also feels a need for protection against
India's overwhelming conventional force, and likes the idea of ``me
too.''
 &HT;    But despite India's references to the need for a ``minimum
deterrent'' against China, pointing out that it has neither ``the
resources nor the will for parity,'' New Delhi's statements make
clear that it is a long simmering resentment at what seemed the
world's disregard for India's weight that decided the
nationalist-leaning coalition government to hold and publicize
nuclear tests.
 &HT;    A European diplomat recently asked Indian officials why, if they
felt the need for nuclear weapons, they didn't copy the Israeli
tactic of building them without attracting the international
opprobrium of vaunting it.
 &HT;    At one point, that had been the strategy. An unidentified Indian
``senior official'' formally told Western correspondents last week
that aside from the recent nuclear tests, India already has atomic
arms it could use, and the systems to deliver them.
 &HT;    This, of course, has been suspected for some time. But beyond
the thesis for deterrence, India craved recognition.
 &HT;    A New Delhi communique, denouncing the joint U.S.-China summit
call for both India and Pakistan to curb a possible arms race, was
blunt. It said, ``India categorically rejects the notion of these
two countries arrogating to themselves joint or individual
responsibility for the maintenance of peace, stability and security
in the region. This approach reflects the hegemonistic mentality of
a bygone era in international relations and is completely
unacceptable and out of place in the present day world.''
 &HT;    The Indians have a point in complaining that despite their size
and numbers, they are routinely put in a class well below China in
status. And they can make a fair argument that with the end of a
two superpower world, permanent membership in the U.N. Security
Council is by no means an evident measure of importance.
 &HT;    It happens that the five permanent members are all nuclear
powers, the only avowed ones until the Indian and Pakistani tests.
None had atomic weapons when the Council membership and its rules
were adopted, not even the United States. The distinction is ex
post facto.
 &HT;    Status, ranking in the world, has always been a consideration
for states alongside the influence that actual power brings. Now,
however, it is becoming a prime factor which distorts conventional
strategic analysis and cannot be overlooked.
 &HT;    Russia is the most obvious current example. Whatever else it
disagrees on, the Russian establishment is unanimously
hypersensitive to making sure their country continues to be
regarded as a great power, in big things and small. That, many will
tell you, is the real reason they are so upset by the expansion of
NATO, which they do not see as a military threat but as a
psychological one which could produce a backlash of nationalism.
 &HT;    Likewise, China's satisfaction with the deferent warmth
displayed by President Bill Clinton on his nine-day trip was more
what I call ``geo-psychics'' than any substantive gain or
agreement. What mattered to Beijing was the symbolism, given added
relative weight by his willingness to skip a courtesy stop in
Japan.
 &HT;    France's Charles de Gaulle practised geo-psychics to the hilt,
in purely ceremonial and sometimes peevishly iconoclastic ways as
well as by insisting on joining the ``nuclear club.'' From the
French point of view, it worked.
 &HT;    In fact, there is a profound contradiction between the U.N.
founding principle of the sovereign equality of all states and
reality. Geo-psychics is an attempt to bridge the gap by induced
perception. The urge cannot be ignored. There is no inherent reason
why possession of nuclear arms should be the test, and many reasons
for rejecting it.
 &HT;    But then there has to be some other way to acknowledge that some
states are, at the least, more equal than others. This is a problem
of the gradual transition in the way nations deal with one another.
New measures, new protocols are needed to satisfy the need for
symbolic importance, so it doesn't have to go nuclear.
 &HT;    Psychologists should be recruited alongside diplomats and

don't really require weapons, or spheres of influence, or even

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all of America's migratory species, perhaps the strangest is
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, when the fridge is crammed with watermelon and
seems to heave like an overweight jogger, it may be worth pondering
the increasingly nomadic nature of this once-monumental appliance.
The magnet-laden stalwart of the kitchen has started to appear in
the weirdest places, popping up in closets and dresser drawers,
where sweaters and mothballs used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: On New York's Long Island, a woman in the Hamptons
recently built a 15,000-square-foot, two-story shingle-style house,
installing a compact Sub-Zero refrigerator next to the socks and
cuff links in her husband's bathroom closet. Asked why, she cited
geography. ``With 15,000 square feet, I didn't want him asking me
to go downstairs to get him a club soda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus dawns the era of the so-called integrated refrigerator, in
which, for the first time in human history, it is possible to reach
for the face cream and instead wind up with rotting zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between hiders and flaunters _ those who want to show
off the latest gizmo versus those who want it camouflaged _ seems
to have taken a critical turn with the introduction of the 700
Series by Sub-Zero, in which a small refrigerator or a
fridge-freezer combo can be custom-installed in a cabinet or
armoire _ or even a drawer _ with nary a visual tip-off to what may
be found inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,
18.1 percent of U.S. households now have more than one
refrigerator, the highest double dipping for any appliance.
</P>
<P>
   The decentralization of the fridge _ can the glove compartment
be far behind? _ seems to have several reasons, not the least of
which is marketing. (Sub-Zero Co.'s latest catalog compares a
refrigerator in every room to a chicken in every pot.) Escalating
house sizes and remodelers bent on master bedroom suites are also
playing a role.
</P>
<P>
   Under-the-counter refrigerators are selling briskly, inspired
perhaps by hotel mini-bars, said Phil Uihlein, chairman of U-Line
Co. of Milwaukee. His product is increasingly turning up in
heretofore unlikely places, for instance, the playroom, the
bedroom, the workout room and, especially, in barbecue areas.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the refrigerator the only appliance having an
out-of-kitchen experience. Fisher-Paykel of Laguna Hills, Calif.,
has introduced a dishwasher that pulls out like a drawer and
disappears into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is now moving out of the kitchen,'' said Paul
Deffenbaugh, editor of Remodeling magazine. As the kitchen becomes
more public, the theory goes, many affluent homeowners are
retreating to the bedroom. ``They want to reward themselves, not
necessarily with an object, but with a leisure experience,'' he
said. One experience, apparently, is barricading oneself away from
the children for extended periods, an act that cannot be
accomplished comfortably without a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   For designers, it is a heady moment. Kathleen Donahue, a kitchen
and bathroom designer in Portland, Ore., said that the refrigerator
came unmoored in Europe. ``Now that it's breaking apart, it enables
designers to think outside the box,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The drawer idea came largely from designers, who wanted the
fridge to be less conspicuous, said Paul Leuthe, the marketing
manager for Sub-Zero. Indeed, Jerome Caruso, who invented the
company's drawer refrigerators, contends that ``the refrigerator
should disappear,'' a sentiment shared by many supermarket shoppers
when the cash register regurgitates the total.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Carlos Adharsingh, a designer for the Edward Nieto
Design Group, installed a drawer refrigerator for a soccer fan's
television room so that a cache of six-packs could be cleverly
concealed. And as refrigerators start to look and act more like
furniture, they're being outfitted as never before, with
Colonial-style paneling, for instance, that creates the illusion
that George Washington snacked here.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding open a refrigerator takes getting used to, owners say.
But Kim Kane of South Burlington, Vt., said that putting
double-drawer refrigerators under her vegetable sink was ``the best
thing I ever did.'' She now has her fruits and vegetables where she
needs them, beneath the sink and cutting board. The twilight zone
of forgotten decomposing vegetables is no more. ``You open it up,
and you see everything,'' she said. ``It stays fresher, because I
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pull-out Sub-Zeros are costly, from $2,000 to $3,400,
depending on the configuration. Like holiday motorists, they vent
themselves, but the compressors and condensers are hidden in a tray
beneath the bottom drawer. The control buttons are concealed along
the top drawers' inner edge. A snap-in crisper is optional.
</P>
<P>
   Whether homeowners who stash refrigerators around the house,
will be able to remember which drawer holds the eggs and which the
Absolut, it's too soon to say, although Uihlein of U-Line, for one,
believes that Americans are ready for in-drawer refrigerators and
that his competition, Sub-Zero, is 5 to 10 years ahead of the
curve.
</P>
<P>
   Will magnets go the way of ashtrays? Can shaving cream and
shrimp cocktail find happiness together in the boudoir? The
American home, ever adaptable, marches on. Just don't freeze the
underwear.

USING THE INTERNET TO LIFT THE SHADOWS OF CANCER'S DARK DAYS

<P>
   Cancer was not the diagnosis I had hoped for. But it did expose
the root of a baffling year and a half of poor health.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, I had taken the coolest job in the world,
catalog manager at Amazon.com, knowing that long hours would be the
norm. I had worked 60 or 70 hours a week most of my adult life. But
after just a few months, I couldn't continue on that schedule and
left the position.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, moving into the slow lane on the Infobahn wasn't
the solution. I started to get weary every afternoon and began
lying down for two or three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of a trip that my girlfriend, Lynn Warner, and I
took to Connecticut in December 1997 to visit her parents, I had a
24-hour flu with a fever of 102 degrees. The fever subsided but
wouldn't stay away.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare snowy day in mid-January, when less than an inch of
powder kept most Seattle drivers off the road (the absence of
Seattle drivers making it the safest driving day of the year), my
Utah-reared doctor, Garrison Bliss, made it into his office for our
appointment. He listened carefully, took chest X-rays, did an exam
and made a preliminary diagnosis of lymphatic disease, probably
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   One CAT scan and a biopsy later, the diagnosis was confirmed:
Hodgkin's disease (also known as Hodgkin's lymphoma), nodular
sclerosing subtype.
</P>
<P>
   My only truly bad day followed as Lynn and I absorbed the news.
I knew little about Hodgkin's disease besides knowing about a
couple of people who had had it. Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder
and a local billionaire, had beaten it in the mid-1980s, leaving
his company to fight the disease. And a talented college
acquaintance, Dave Saltzman, an author and illustrator of
children's books, died of it eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss is not, he stressed, a cancer specialist, and he suggested
that I hold my questions until I could meet a week later with an
oncologist, Dr. David White of the Polyclinic in Seattle. But, with
no real knowledge at hand, and my stomach dancing the fandango, I
found it impossible to wait for answers.
</P>
<P>
   The place I would turn for information was obvious: I had used
the Internet and other networks since 1986 and had spent most of my
days and nights on the modern Net since 1994, when I co-founded
Point of Presence Co., a commercial Web site developer (which I
sold to join Amazon).
</P>
<P>
   An Infoseek search for ``Hodgkin's'' and ``disease'' in close
proximity turned up thousands of pages. Some seemed unquestionably
credible: Onco Link (oncolink.upenn. edu) at the University of
Pennsylvania was vouched for by its address. But a click away from
the most serious cancer institutions were sites promoting laetrile,
herbs and obscure Hawaiian fruits as sure-fire cancer cures.
</P>
<P>
   I lacked the knowledge to evaluate those sites. Just like a
high-school student who cannot find Africa on a map of the world, I
couldn't even point to my liver on a map of the internal organs.
Onco Link and similar resources educated me rapidly about my
disease and the chances for remission and long-term survival. (They
also confirmed my suspicions about laetrile.)
</P>
<P>
   My Internet readings led me to the two main chemotherapy
regimens for treatment of Hodgkin's disease, both of which involved
four drugs and about six months of every-other-week treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One treatment was disturbing because it includes mustard gas,
mechlorethamine, as a cell-killing element (I pictured World War I
doughboys in gas masks laid out in medical examining rooms), and it
almost always causes sterility. The alternative treatment, which
has a similar rate of success, can cause heart and lung damage, but
patients have a much better chance of remaining fertile.
</P>
<P>
   This reading and surfing led Lynn and me to think that the
second treatment was the better option. I found several sites
explaining the regimen and the administration and even nailed down
a site listing the wholesale prices for all the medications I would
take.
</P>
<P>
   My first meeting with White must have taken him aback: Lynn and
I had two pages of questions prompted by our reading. He didn't
show any surprise or impatience, though, and spent almost three
hours giving us answers and options. His recommendations coincided
fairly closely with the course of treatment I had hoped to go
through.
</P>
<P>
   Just after getting a definitive diagnosis, I had sent out dozens
of e-mail messages to friends and business colleagues. Because of
my slightly peripatetic career, my friends are scattered around the
country and the world. I explained my disease, how I felt and how
optimistic I was about a positive outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As I started treatment and began experiencing side effects like
nausea, hair loss, weight gain and clotting problems, I found that
there was a gap between the more technical information at sites
like Onco Link and the practical patient-education manuals that the
National Cancer Institute and nonprofit cancer societies hand out.
That gap is filled by personal Web sites set up by people who are
going through or have gone through treatment as a way of sharing
their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   While Onco Link describes alopecia (hair loss), and the National
Cancer Institute literature reminds you that wigs bought for
chemotherapy-induced hair loss may be tax deductible, it is the
personal sites that have links to online wig stores and give advice
on what kind of wigs look best.
</P>
<P>
   The personal sites also provide more descriptive details about
some of the more bizarre side effects. Without finding the
informally named Mike's Lymphoma Resource Pages _ an incredible,
well-organized descriptive list run by Mike Barela, comprising
hundreds of links _ I might have screamed when I saw red urine
after my first chemotherapy treatment. I would not have known that
one drug I was taking, Adriamycin, can cause urine to turn red for
hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   More directly, a list called the Hodgkin's Disease Mailing List
linked me to people who have the disease or have family members
with it; others on the list went into remission as long as decades
ago and stay on the list to offer encouragement and information.
</P>
<P>
   A few treatments into the process, I decided to set up my own
Web page, just as many others had done. Putting my health out there
for anyone to read might seem strange, but a Web page would make it
easier for those who cared to find out about my progress without
feeling compelled to call or write. It would make it easier for me,
too, as I was not sure how much e-mail I would be able to respond
to, and it would help comfort those particularly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I had first thought that I might keep a real diary on the Web,
but I realized that there were plenty of issues _ fertility, for
example _ that I didn't want to share with the world. Other issues,
like the experience and joy of having an intravenous catheter and
port put in, were easier to share.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends have said that they have used the links I provided
to go out and research the disease themselves to assuage their own
fears about the disease. By checking Web logs, I see that a number
of people search for ``lymphatic cancer'' at Alta Vista or another
search engine and wind up at my site.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't end up posting daily, as I didn't always have enough
news. (``Feeling great! Walked three miles! Ate lunch!'') I had
some bad days, the worst of which was after the surgery for my
intravenous catheter and port about a month after starting
chemotherapy. I had the surgery and chemotherapy on Friday, and I
was injected with GCSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) on
the following Monday to improve my white-cell counts. Feeling
depressed for the first time since getting the diagnosis, I put off
writing about it until I'd bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Posting my own site also resulted in more interesting phone
conversations: the people who called were up-to-the-minute on my
status, and we talked of other things. The most draining task after
the diagnosis has been explaining the disease to every new person
who finds out about my condition. The number of people who see a
bald head and say, ``What, you in chemo or something?'' is
staggeringly high.
</P>
<P>
   After a few treatments, my health began to improve. My immune
system stopped trying to throttle me, and the miracle drug Zofran
almost entirely suppressed the chemotherapy-induced nausea. At that
point, the Hodgkin's list started to freak me out. It had too many
posts from folks with terrible side effects, extreme cases or just
no hope. Even reading about other people's chemotherapy could
nauseate me, despite the drugs I had at hand. After just a few
weeks, I had to unsubscribe from the list, planning to return after
chemotherapy to put something back into the kitty I had drawn from.
</P>
<P>
   By April, I was updating my health page less frequently, as the
news was uniformly good. The lymphoma had started retreating almost
immediately after chemotherapy began and I felt better and better.
X-rays taken at 6 weeks and 12 weeks into treatment confirmed what
I was already feeling. Fatigue never really hit me, although my
mental abilities had turned a little sluggish. A Bugs Bunny
marathon on Comedy Central struck me as a bit funnier than it would
have a few months before. (Posts to the Hodgkin's mailing list
assure me that this effect is temporary.)
</P>
<P>
   In late May, an MRI scan showed no traces of the disease; I was
in full remission, right on schedule. When I padded out of the
magnetic resonance imaging machine in my socks and a hospital gown
and the imaging technician pinned up the image of my insides _ my
cancer-free insides _ I could point to the liver without any
hesitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I moved to Texas in the spring of 1982,
after a winter on the western plains of North Dakota, where the
temperature did not rise above 30 degrees below zero for three
weeks straight. That's without wind chill. I'm not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the days during that singular stretch were sunny and
windless, yet cross-country travel was discouraged because at that
temperature, a breakdown on a country road could be fatal within
minutes. Coaxing dead car batteries back to life with jumper cables
was part of the daily morning ritual. The teeniest piece of skin
exposed to those temperatures felt pricked by a thousand tiny
needles. The cold literally took your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   Which, right now, all sounds kind of nice. I have just come from
a noontime jog along the Trinity River. The sign at the downtown
YMCA says it's 104 degrees outside, and Have A Nice Day.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to hit the public library to see whether any references
to North Texas pop up in Dante's ``Inferno.'' On the two-block walk
there, my legs perspire heavily and stick to the inside of my
jeans. The air feels like engine sludge as it enters my lungs.
Blanketlike.MDNM/ humidity saps my spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Please, give me a bracing gust of Canadian January wind. Hand me
a snow shovel _ and some snow. Compared with.MDNM/ this, a
Midwestern winter is frolic, or if not exactly fun, certainly the
lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   Up there, for instance, you could always add another layer. In
Texas, .MDNM/you can take off only so many clothes. In a Midwestern
winter, the ice-fishing antidote was available to cure cabin fever.
In Texas, there only alternatives are shopping malls and the
increasingly tepid waters of outdoor pools.
</P>
<P>
   I hate this weather. Have I said that? It makes me grumpy. One
recent night, my wife and I saw a TV news report that said domestic
abuse cases generally rise during the hottest weather. Something
about irritability, combined with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I ever glad you don't drink,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She, by the way, is one of those unfortunate souls whose
personal thermostat is hopelessly out of whack. When
it.MDBU/'.MDNM/s 95 degrees, she thinks it's 75. She must wear
sweaters and thermal underwear to movies. She LIKES this heat.
Worst of all, she has forbidden me to whine about it.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I think that whining about the heat is more than
appropriate. It's almost obligatory. But she is firm. So whenever
the two of us leave air conditioning together and step outside, I
take several appreciative gulps of 100-degree air and stretch my
arms wide, like Julie Andrews on the mountaintop in the ``Sound of
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My,'' I say. ``Isn't this invigorating?''
</P>
<P>
   I think she picks up on my sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   THE CRAPE MYRTLE THEORY.MDBU/
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/I am pleased to learn that Dr. Bob Lanier, the local TV
personality, is a kindred spirit. I call him to ask why heat makes
the human body feel so lousy. Instead, for most of our
conversation, the two of us take turns whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread this time every year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, too,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier has a couple of theories about the heat, neither of which
has anything to do with medicine. One is that the really terrible
weather begins when the crape myrtles bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see those darn crape myrtles coming out, I said, `Oh,
% &LR; !. Here it comes,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The other is his theory of five seasons. Autumn in Texas lasts
four or five days, Lanier says, followed by a day or two of winter.
``From December through the end of May, we have spring, and this is
a fabulous place to be. From the end of May until the second week
of June, we have summer.'' Then, from the end of the NBA playoffs
to the Dallas Cowboys first home game is the fifth season, he says,
``the season from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   His theory holds up most years, but not this. This year, the
temperature hit 100 degrees for the first time on May 6 _ 38 days
before Michael Jordan launched his historic,
NBA-championship-winning jump shot. Five other days in May, the
temperature rose to 95 or worse; 23 more times in June, a month
when the average high temperature is supposed to be 92.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of heat rightfully belongs in the last week in July or
the first week in August. Not June. Certainly not May. No wonder
I'm grumpy. As oppressiveness goes, this year promises to be a
doozy. I'm no scientist, but I know exactly where to point the
finger of blame. Two words.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   UNLIKELY SUSPECTS.MDBU/
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Not so, says Dave Martin, a meteorologist for the National
Weather Service. El Nino has pretty much played out. He has another
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's summer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder immediately whether this guy has been talking to my
wife. To describe the heat we've all been withstanding, he uses
irritating words like, ``slightly above normal.'' He insists on
comparing everything with the summer of 1980, when it was 113
degrees on June 26 and 27, 112 on the 28th, 108 on the 29th. I want
to say that I don't care how hot it was in 1980. But I bite my
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No. Not El Nino. Instead, this torment is due to the massive
high pressure systems that tend to linger around the region in the
summer, Martin says. High pressure means that the air in the upper
reaches of the atmosphere is forced downward toward Earth. When air
is forced down, its molecules are scrunched together, and they heat
up.
</P>
<P>
   All that plus the fact that the sun shines about 13 hours a day
this time of year, giving it plenty of time to make us miserable.
And the wonderful westerly winds that bring us cold fronts and rain
at other times of the year all move farther.MDNM/ north in the
summertime, vacationing in the Hamptons, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more thing to be ticked off at. Those darn westerlies.
</P>
<P>
   So now my wife won't let me watch the weather on television,
because she knows it will only tempt me to grouse, which I'm
forbidden to do. Me, I don't know why the weather forecasters don't
just take the season off. ``Here's your five-day forecast,'' they
say. ``High 101, low 82; high 100, low 81; high 102, low 82,''
blah, blah, blah, etc. etc. etc. I mean, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   So now, I whine about the weather whenever I'm not at home. I
dream of January in North Dakota, and 30 below. Did you know that a
frozen earlobe feels as heavy as a ball bearing when it starts to
thaw, or that eyelashes crust over with ice in about two minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, heaven.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One common measure of computer function is the way the central
processing unit handles information. The terms 8-bit, 16-bit,
32-bit, 64-bit and, occasionally, 128-bit are tossed around by
people who may be trying to impress others with the horsepower of
their machines.
</P>
<P>
   This statistic has some value, but as with most numbers used by
computer marketing divisions, its real value is complex, nuanced
and not necessarily the same for all people. The number of bits
measures the capacity that a chip has for moving data around. A
16-bit computer and an operating system tailored to run on it can
perform better than some 32-bit computers in much the same way that
a four-cylinder Porsche 944 can blow the doors off some
eight-cylinder cars.
</P>
<P>
   The measurement refers to the number of pieces of data that are
pushed around by the computer at a time. An 8-bit computer handles
data in chunks of 8 bits, that is, in binary numbers eight digits
long. Because they are binary, each place is either 0 or 1.
</P>
<P>
   In binary numbers, the place values are based on 2, not 10. So
moving from right to left for the number 01100111, the place values
are 20, 21, 22, 23 and so on. That means that for the number
01100111, the values, from right to left, are 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus
0 plus 0 plus 32 plus 64 plus 0, for a total of 103.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible combinations of eight 0's and 1's is 256,
so any 8-bit chunk of data can have only 256 different values.
Numbers with 16 bits can have 65,536 possible values, and numbers
with 32 bits can have 4,294,967,296 possible values.
</P>
<P>
   A common joke is that the world must move to 64-bit computers
because 32-bit machines aren't big enough to hold the number that
represents Bill Gates' personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of 32-bit computers also run into this problem
because that capacity is not enough to count each byte in a hard
drive that holds 4.3 gigabytes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Computer designers must choose one common size for data _ a
standard number of bits _ and use it throughout each machine.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to understand the problem is to think about buying
eggs. While eggs can be bought in packages of 6, 12, 24 or 100 or
more, the most efficient package size depends upon consumption
patterns. People who eat only six eggs every two weeks don't need
to buy a dozen at a time. But short-order chefs might go nuts
opening a new box every 12 eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest microprocessors were 4-bit machines and were more
curiosities than useful tools. They were limited to 4 bits because
manufacturers could build only simple circuits efficiently. Now
chip designers are able to build more complex chips, increasing the
number of bits that can be handled at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Using more bits to store each number is a great feature, but it
chews up resources. Doubling the number of bits, from 16 to 32, for
example, in the standard number means that the circuits used to
handle these values must be doubled. That rule holds for most other
parts of the chip, including the temporary storage locations and
the lines used to carry the values around the chip. Some problems
take up even more resources.
</P>
<P>
   So computer manufacturers try to find one size that fits most
users. That is not easy, so the designers try to ease problems and
prevent incompatibilities by finding ways for machines to operate
in different modes. Sixteen-bit machines can act like 32-bit
machines by treating the data as two 16-bit values, then gluing
them together. And 32-bit machines can act like 16-bit machines by
padding the values with 16 extra 0's. In fact, 32-bit machines can
also act like 64-bit machines, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, computer architects are like egg marketers trying to
decide on the right size for packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Any solution that forces a machine to move information in a
nonstandard size makes a computer work more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Intel and Microsoft did not perfectly
synchronize the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit machines. For a
time, Intel's hottest chips were 32-bit, while Microsoft's main
operating system was designed for 16-bit machines. That led to
slower performance on newer, supposedly faster machines because the
chip spent more time converting 16-bit numbers to 32-bit numbers
and back. That anomaly is largely gone, but it may return when
Intel starts adopting 64-bit chips in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics cards used in computers and popular console video
games also measure their capabilities in bits. In that case, the
value refers to the size of the data moved around in the process of
updating, or refreshing, the screen. For larger values, like 64 or
128 bits, larger chunks are moved in each step and the refreshing
process is accomplished faster. Faster means smoother animation and
more time to add slime and green objects to the faces of aliens.
</P>
<P>
   If 64-bit machines are on the horizon, can 128-bit machines be
far behind? Is there anyone who can count that high? Will Bill
Gates ever be that rich? Astronomers might need numbers that high.
There are 1057 atoms in Earth's Sun, and 185 bits would be needed
to count each of them.
</P>
<P>
   But even average humans could need larger numbers if current
trends in the computer industry continue. The number of megabytes
you can get per dollar continues to double every 12 to 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two bits is already not enough to count all the bytes in
the standard-issue 4.3-gigabyte drive. Since each additional bit
doubles the maximum value, it should be about 32 years until 64-bit
machines cannot handle the number of bits in the addresses used for
data by hard disks. Of course, 64 bits should suffice for that
period only if present trends continue, and if Bill Gates doesn't
get much wealthier.

<P>
   French polishing is a classic finishing technique developed by
French furniture makers in the early 19th century. It's a shellac
finish that's applied by rubbing the shellac onto the wood by hand.
The technique is laborious and takes time and practice to master.
Nevertheless it is an essential technique for anyone who wants to
recreate the look of authentic period furniture.
</P>
<P>
   French polishing is done in three stages: filling the wood pores
with paste, applying and polishing the finish and removing residue
oils. While this technique can be applied to any furniture surface,
the beginner should first practice on flat horizontal surfaces,
like table tops, before working on more complex surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a perfectly smooth surface, it is essential that you
fill the pores of the wood. Traditionally furniture finishers made
their own filler paste by adding pumice to a thick cut of shellac.
</P>
<P>
   To make your own paste filler, dissolve four ounces of shellac
flakes ( available from mail order suppliers) in four ounces of
denatured alcohol. This amounts to an eight-pound cut and it is not
sold in stores, you must mix your own. Add about three ounces of
pumice (available at paint stores) to the shellac solution and stir
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   You will need a stiff-bristled brush, a rubber squeegee and a
few clean cotton cloths for filling. First vacuum the surface to
remove all dust and dirt, then brush on the filler and work it into
wood pores. When the entire surface is covered, scrape across the
grain with a rubber squeegee to remove excess filler. Work quickly
because the shellac has a brief set-up time. For the final cleanup,
dampen a clean cotton cloth with alcohol and wipe the surface using
a circular motion. As the cloth becomes loaded , discard it and use
a fresh cloth.
</P>
<P>
   If making your own pumice/shellac filler sounds too difficult
you can use a commercial wood filler (available at paint stores and
home centers), but the final finish may not be as clear as with the
shellac filler.
</P>
<P>
   After the surface has been allowed to dry (allow at least 24
hours for this), scuff-sand it with 600-grit wet/dry sandpaper. Put
down a few drops of mineral oil as a lubricant and use your hand to
back up the paper. The purpose of the sanding is to remove any
bumps or imperfections in the filler coat and not abrade the
shellac film.
</P>
<P>
   You are now ready to apply the finish. For this you will need a
plastic squeeze bottle filled with shellac (purchase a can of white
shellac in a paint or hardware store), another squeeze bottle
filled with denatured alcohol and a polishing pad.
</P>
<P>
   The polishing pad consists of two parts: an inner core and a
covering. The core is a small wad, about the size of a golf ball,
of cloth. You can use cotton, cheesecloth or flannel for it. Use a
piece of lint-free cloth about 10 inches square for the covering.
Linen or muslin are suitable but avoid using cotton because it will
leave lint.
</P>
<P>
   Place the core in the center of the cover and dampen it with
alcohol. Then squeeze about a thimbleful of shellac into it. Fold
the sides and corners of the cover back over the core and twist
them so the cover tightens around the core. The pad should look
like a soft ball with a twisted handle. The face of the pad should
be smooth with no seams or wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze a little more shellac onto the face of the pad, then
squeeze an equal amount of alcohol. Rub over the entire surface
with small circular stokes. If the pad starts to dry out, squeeze
on more shellac. Sometimes the pad may stick to the surface. If
this happens, apply a few drops of mineral oil and continue
rubbing. Keep rubbing with the pad until the entire surface is
coated with an even film of shellac.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the surface to dry overnight, then repeat the procedure
with a new pad. Only this time, as the pad begins to dry out, do
not recharge it. Use the dry pad to buff the finish. You may use a
few drops of mineral oil if the pad begins to stick. When you have
polished the entire surface, allow it to dry for at least three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The final stage is to remove the any oil deposited in the
polishing stage. Make a round pad of clean cheesecloth and dampen
it with alcohol. Wipe across the surface with light pressure. Keep
the pad moving and do not stop or it may stick to the surface.

HARD DRIVE BY ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT MAKE ITS OWNER BLUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often there's news about the most popular baby names _
Chelsea, Dylan, Diana and the like _ which are thought to reflect
the cultural moment, the Zeitgeist. The pressure a parent feels in
naming a child can be tremendous; after all, once the name is on
the birth certificate, it's there forever.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to humanize technology, some people are
choosing monikers for their computers _ or, more specifically, for
their computers' hard drives, the data storage mechanisms that are
represented on screens by tiny, customizable icons.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a PC, and on the desktop you'll see a gray computer box with
the words ``My Computer'' underneath; buy a Mac, and there's a
little box labeled ``Macintosh HD.'' Click on either and the field
shades over, waiting like an infant to be named.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official registry of hard drive names, and there are
no birth certificates for laptops, so it's hard to know exactly
who's naming a machine what. The best indication comes from those
at the front lines of computer culture _ repair technicians.
</P>
<P>
   At J&AMP;R Computer World in Manhattan, where hundreds of customers
bring in their machines every month, sports star names are said to
be popular.
</P>
<P>
   Tekserve, a Macintosh repair shop in Manhattan, reports that
cartoon characters from ``The Simpsons'' or ``Dilbert'' are hot.
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert's creator, Scott Adams, finds the trend flattering,
though he hasn't been inspired to personalize his own hard drive.
``I like my computer to be as uncustomized as possible,'' he said.
``I don't want it to have a personality. Sooner or later, I'm going
to have to drop-kick it out the window, and I don't want to have to
feel like I'm scolding a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Adams, whose ``Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' novels
provide fodder for countless screen savers and drive names, also
disdains high-tech anthropomorphisms. ``My hard drives tend to be
called boring things like `Mac G3 HD' and `WORK,''' he said in an
e-mail message. ``I gave up cute names about a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Coupland, the author of the novels ``Generation X'' and
``Microserfs,'' enthusiastically named his hard drive Ziggy
Stardust after one of David Bowie's alter egos. ``I think a
definite tendency is for people to give hard drives names that are
simultaneously romantic and doomed and ironic,'' he said in an
e-mail message. ``The other tendency is to give hard drives the
names of the characters they'd most liked to be dressed as on
Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   This infusion of emotions is all part of the plan, said Peter
Lowe, a MacOS product line manager at Apple Computer. Renaming a
hard drive, he explained, fulfills the same purpose as other
personal touches, like an ``X-Files'' pattern for a desktop or a
particular voice for a text-to-speech program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esthetic customization is a very important part of interface
design,'' he said. ``How someone feels about their computer is
going to impact the time they spend using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people give their hard drives the names of people
significant in their lives. Of course, that can have drawbacks.
Consider the jazz executive who was laughed out of a computer
repair shop when he went to pick up his PC.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked out the door, the techies snickered. ``Bye-bye,
Wootie Wootie,'' they said. The lesson to be learned: naming a
computer can indeed be like naming a child: don't choose something
that will get ridiculed at school.

DREAM OF MARRIAGE ENDS WITH SHOOTING FOR FIANCEE OF SLAIN AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NATHALIE TREPANIER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Melissa Barela should be planning her wedding
instead of making funeral arrangements for her finace, who was one
of two U.S. Border Patrol agents shot dead Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Salinas, 24, and fellow agent Susan Lynn Rodriguez were
killed helping the police hunt for a man wanted in an earlier
shooting that left a 53-year-old woman and her 31-year-old daughter
dead in the South Texas town of Rio Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   Barela, 23, had known Salinas since she was 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would ever have thought that last night was the last time
I would tell him that I love him,'' Barela said Tuesday night from
the San Antonio-area home of Salinas' parents. ``It just shows you
need to live life to its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   As visitors gathered at the gray brick home that the Salinas
family has lived in for nine years, Ricardo Salinas Sr. recalled
that his son always had wanted a career in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my pride and joy,'' Salinas said. ``He never got into
any trouble. He was a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Salinas Jr. graduated from Judson High School in 1992.
In 1996, he received a degree in criminal justice from the
University of Texas at San Antonio. While he was happy in the six
months he had been with the Border Patrol, his ultimate goal was to
join the FBI, according to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Barela was concerned the FBI might be too dangerous, but she
knew better than to stand between her fiance and his dream, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown arrived at the Salinas family home. As he was
greeted by Ricardo Salinas Sr., the two embraced, tears welling in
their eyes. Brown, 24, was to be the best man at the Salinas-Barela
wedding. The two had known each other since childhood, and Salinas
had even convinced his friend to join the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still going to do it?'' the slain agent's father asked
Brown. ``Are you still going to join the patrol?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Brown said. ``I'm doing it for him as well as for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Barela were planning to marry next year. Both were
children of military officers. They had met as children while their
parents were posted in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Barela sat in the Salinas home on Tuesday, surrounded by family,
friends and two Border Patrol agents. Cradled in her arms was one
of the few pictures ever taken of the two. ``Ricardo hated having
his picture taken,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The man identified as the gunman, Ernest Moore, 24, died in a
Harlingen hospital late Tuesday following surgery for multiple
gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The two women killed in Rio Hondo, a small community northeast
of Harlingen, were identified as Dalia Morin, 31, and her mother,
Margarita Flores, 52. Her son, Danny Morin, 22, was wounded, as was
Cameron County Deputy Sheriff Raul Rodriguez, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, was the first woman Border Patrol agent killed on
active duty. Since its founding 74 years ago, 81 agents have been
killed while on duty.

NO MONKEY BUSINESS IN BROWSER FOR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (Editors: in the 11th graf, the substituted symbols are four
telephone pound signs)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the phrase ``kid friendly'' actually
referred to something that was fun for kids instead of good for
them. In my own childhood, for instance, I once created what I
considered a kid-friendly ant farm by sprinkling several teaspoons
of sugar onto the front steps.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on that definition, I was excited to hear about a new
software program called Surf Monkey, described as a kid-friendly
browser. I figured that it could teach my daughters to build an ant
farm online.
</P>
<P>
   Surf Monkey is not, in truth, a stand-alone browser; it runs on
top of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, replacing the toolbar and
on-screen window with the image of a rocket ship hurtling through
deep space in search of Web sites. As stars and asteroids whiz by,
my daughters Zoe, 9, and Ella, 7, would be able to click on the
ship's instrument panel to navigate, activating commands like Back
or Forward or Help.
</P>
<P>
   Surf Monkey also has a tour guide, an animated monkey whose job
is to hop around on the bottom of the screen and narrate the
mission. Though no Jane Goodall myself, I respect the fact that
some people think monkeys are charming and so was willing to give
this one the benefit of the doubt. After all, the monkey was able
to perform such useful tricks as reading aloud the text of any
e-mail message, a feature that could alert my kids to any spelling
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Before inviting my daughters to test Surf Monkey, I decided to
install it on my own because software installation has never been
my idea of a kid-friendly activity. Nor was it adult-friendly. The
first time I tried to run Surf Monkey, the program clashed with
Windows 98, prompting my computer to crash after announcing
tragically that ``Surf Monkey caused an invalid page fault in
module KERNEL32.DLL,'' a core chunk of code in the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   After I restarted the computer, Surf Monkey behaved for a while,
but I was unable to register my review copy. That would have been
fine with me, but the instructions warned that if I skipped that
step, Zoe and Ella could not send e-mail. Getting impatient, I
phoned David Smith, chief executive of Media Live, the company that
makes Surf Monkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is working fine at our end,'' Smith reported.
``Let's try it again.''
</P>
<P>
   After he showed me how to get Surf Monkey on line without
registering, Smith offered to demonstrate the program's finer
points. He guided me to a button on the control panel that would
explode the on-screen image of a Web page and another that would
hurl a blob of green slime across the page. ``Kids like that sort
of thing,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   So do I. In fact, I was just about to summon my daughters for
some family slime hurling when Surf Monkey's dark side surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Smith mentioned that Surf Monkey had licensed the Surf Watch
filter to block what Media Live calls ``unsuitable'' content. He
said that category included pornography, profanity, sexually
explicit language and many other topics. ``Go ahead, try to go to
the Playboy site on line and see what happens,'' he said. Yes, Surf
Monkey blocked me, with an on-screen suggestion to try visiting
someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Surf Monkey's filter _ unlike the typical
censor-your-child program that some parents buy in a retail store
and load onto the computer _ was unique because it was constantly
updated. Every time a child tries to visit a Web site, the request
is processed through Surf Monkey's computers, which check to see if
the destination is on Surf Watch's blacklist, updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filter works with e-mail, too,'' Smith said. ``Type an
e-mail message with an obvious profanity and then ask the monkey to
read it aloud.'' Sure enough, the monkey refused to speak the
four-letter word I had typed. In fact, the program changed the
letters of the word on-screen as well, substituting
``(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU),'' which the monkey pronounced soberly as
``number-number-number-number.''
</P>
<P>
   I worried that this feature might upset my daughters if they
happened to type a forbidden word. Could fear of displeasing the
monkey prompt ``Planet of the Apes'' nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you decide what to censor?'' I asked. ``How many words
are on the list?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith explained that his company had reviewed 2,700 words
blacklisted by Surf Watch and winnowed the list to 1,300 that Media
Live deemed truly objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. As a test, I typed, ``My name is Michelle, and I am gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The monkey said, ``My name is Michelle and I am
number-number-number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why won't the monkey say `gay'?'' I asked. ``There is nothing
wrong with being gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ouch,'' Smith said. ```Gay' is not supposed to be blocked.
`Gay' is not a bad word.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say. In fact, just the previous week I had addressed this
same topic with Zoe and Ella, who had been troubled by a third
grader on the school bus who shrieked ``gay'' as an insult. The
last thing we needed was a painful follow-up discussion about how
some adults can be as bigoted as third-grade bullies. Or monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Smith assured me that the ``gay'' gaffe was a glitch in the
program. But then I learned that Surf Monkey also blocked the word
``breast,'' as in, ``My name is Michelle and I am eating a chicken
number-number-number-number-number-number.'' Who knows how many
other perfectly suitable words are blocked as well?
</P>
<P>
   Surf Monkey illustrates the problem with filters: they transform
``kid friendly'' into ``ignorant.'' Under the guise of protecting
children, filter makers seek to impose their values on my
offspring. I would rather do the child-rearing myself, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   After I got off the phone with Smith, I realized that my only
choice was to censor the censor. I barely had time to remove Surf
Monkey before my daughters came bounding up the staircase.
``Where's the monkey?'' Ella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're old enough to be exposed to him,'' I
said, shielding the CD-ROM from view. ``He wasn't kid-friendly.''

CLOSED CREMATORY CAN'T DISPOSE OF ALL ITS BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stymied at first by the fire department and then
by a state investigation into consumer complaints, the Hidden
Valley Memorial Park crematory is struggling to dispose of its
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, state Department of Consumer Affairs officials said
17 bodies _ some which had been there for more than three weeks _
were cremated at other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Rogers, an owner of the Martinez crematory and two other
funeral homes, said the state investigation and newspaper reports
last week had slowed processing of the remaining bodies. She would
not say how many bodies remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several steps for transferring bodies from one place
to another,'' Rogers said. ``And the state wants to see the bodies
and the paperwork, which takes a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to delays is that other crematories in the area are now
reluctant to process the body backlog, said Nancy Luke, a lawyer
representing Rogers and her husband Chris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (others) are understandably worried and reticent because
they don't want to get involved in a scandal that's been in the
papers,'' Luke said. ``Other crematoriums have said they would help
out and then backed out and left (the Rogerses) in the lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Affairs inspectors believe they have seen discrepancies
between the Rogerses' operations and state codes on at least two
occasions, spokeswoman Nancy Hardaker said. Hardaker said that she
could not reveal the nature of the code violations or complaints
until the investigation was completed, and could not estimate when
that might be.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District
temporarily closed Hidden Valley because of a malfunctioning
smokestack. Once repairs were made in late June, fire inspectors
gave the crematory permission to resume business. On June 27,
however, the state asked the Rogerses to keep the business closed
while it conducted a separate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing everything I can to resolve this,'' Laurel Rogers
said. ``The bottom line is that we are good people who have helped
thousands of families and have had thousands of cases and never had
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A Better Business Bureau complaint was lodged against the couple
in February.
</P>
<P>
   California law sets no time frame for the disposition of bodies,
as long as they are stored properly. But Ernest Landauer, spokesman
for the San Francisco Bay Area Funeral Society, said the cremation
process usually takes about seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Landauer said delays not only were difficult on families
emotionally, but also interfered with the administration of bank
accounts, insurance, investments and trusts of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   If the state investigation reveals code violations, the case
will be filed with the State Justice Department, which in turn
could present the case to an administrative law judge, Hardaker
said. The judge could then impose a range of penalties on the
Rogerses, including suspending or revoking their license, placing
the crematorium on probation or fining them.

<P>
   In the wake of Ginger Spice's departure from the Spice Girls,
Sony is trotting out Spice World, an interactive piece of
Spice-iana designed for the preadolescent girls who are buying
Spice albums, T-shirts, lip gloss and plastic dolls. At minute 13{
of the fab five's fame, it's now or never.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Spice World (Psygnosis; $29.95; to be released July
28; Playstation) is a make-your-own-music-video project starring
the Spice Girls as cartoon characters with oversize shoes, tiny
bodies and huge heads (this is not a stretch).
</P>
<P>
   In stage one, the Mixing Room, you splice together bits and
pieces of the Spice Girls oeuvre, stringing sound samples into
Cubist versions of their songs. If you're dying to hear a phrase
from ``Wannabe'' (``I'll tell you what I want, what I really really
want!'') 20 times in a row, that's also an option. Somewhere there
is a special hell for parents where this sequence is looped ad
infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   From the Mixing Room you move into Dance Practice, a
choreography tutorial, and hit button combinations as they appear
on the screen to see the full repertory of shimmies, sashays and
shoulder rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have mastered the Spice Girls' moves, it's time to
record their routines by programming their dance steps one by one,
Spice by Spice. Then on to the TV Studio, where you choose camera
angles, zooms and close-ups to show them off. It's a customized
Spice Girls experience, MySpiceGirls, if you will, followed by a
20-minute popumentary _ video footage of the Spice Girls being
interviewed in the South of France _ that is completely
nonparticipatory.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Spice World is the latest in a series of
interactive music videos and enhanced CDs produced on a variety of
platforms in the last 10 years _ music titles for the Sega CD,
David Bowie's Jump CD-ROM, Devo's Adventures of the Smart Patrol,
interactive offerings from Bob Dylan and Sting, and the list goes
on. All of them combine recycled content with the illusion of
choice, the fake empowerment of mixing your own version of someone
else's music with a keyboard or a joystick.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of Peter Gabriel's Real World CD-ROM,
all these products have fallen flat because they cannot compete
with the albums and music videos they supposedly enhance. What
shows up on your computer monitor is not the beautifully produced
entertainment you see on television, and it doesn't offer the
full-throttle interactivity of a genuine video game. It's a sterile
hybrid that compromises both media. Interactive music videos are
the mules of digital entertainment. To add insult to injury, they
are generally overpriced. At 12 bucks, the Spice Girls game is
cute. But $30? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   It's irksome that Psygnosis should take this bone-headed
approach with Spice World because the company is one of the top
video game developers on the planet. These are the people who gave
us Wipeout XL and Colony Wars. ``The guys had been working on
Porsche Challenge and Total NBA '97,'' said Peter Eley, who managed
the Spice World project at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in
London. ``At first a lot of them weren't that keen. Some of them
viewed it as a bit of a ludicrous prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   One can almost picture them gazing longingly at their co-workers
play-testing space shooters, then casting a plaintive glance at
their boss. (``No. You cannot work on the new driving game until
you finish Spice World.'') Judging from the final product, it is
obvious that these lads were not applying their talents
wholeheartedly to the joy and wonder that is Spice.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a shame because they have deprived the world of the
Spice Girls interactive experience it really deserves. Think of the
missed opportunities: A Lara Croft adventure game with five pinups
on the screen instead of one. An interactive version of MTV's Spice
Girls vs. Hanson Celebrity Death Match. The Spice Girls can't stop
screaming about Girl Power. Where are the weapons? Sporty Spice
behind the barrel of a semiautomatic machine gun _ that's Girl
Power.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't these designers even bother to rip off Barbie Fashion
Designer? A Spice Girls video game where you can't change their
clothes? Five Spice Girls videos and no costume changes? What were
they thinking?
</P>
<P>
   The video shows them chatting up Nelson Mandela and other world
leaders. ``Meeting Prince Charles and having the opportunity to
squeeze his bum. That is what you remember,'' quoth Ginger Spice.
If Spice World were a role-playing game, that could be her
signature move: bum-squeezing the famous for bonus points. Sporty
could turn back flips. Baby could foil enemies by rapidly batting
her eyelashes. And Posh could suck in her cheeks, unleashing the
Glare of Death. The Spice Girls are comic book characters anyway.
Why not have them act like comic book characters?
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, half of this game's title is ``world.'' There is no
world in this game. There is nothing to explore. This band is
supposedly on an international tour, and backdrops are no big trick
in a video game. But do we get to see the Spice Girls perform in
front of the Forbidden City, in Red Square, along the Amazon, on
the African veldt, against the foothills of the Himalayas? No. And
where is the warren of backstage areas? Where is the inside of the
Spice Girls' bus? Even the movie gave them a more engaging place to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, most girls prefer PC games to console games. And they
prefer the Internet to video games, period. So where is the Spice
Girls 3-D virtual community on the World Wide Web, with all those
preteen-age girls joining little guilds _ the Sporty Zone, the
Scary Zone, Posh.com.
</P>
<P>
   The music is derivative and shallow. The game didn't have to be.
And if it succeeds commercially, it's only because its audience is
all but neglected by digital media. The pickings are anorexically
slim. So much for Girl Power.
</P>
<P>
   Bad job, boys.

ON-LINE POLLING IS MORE BUSINESS THAN SCIENCE

   MCI issued a press release last week declaring America's
Internet literacy on the upswing. Touting the results of a survey,
MCI heralded baby boomers, Generation X-ers and residents of
Delaware as among the most Net-savvy segments of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: The survey did not test the population at
large, but only regular Web surfers and visitors to the MCI site,
who were presumably already fairly Internet-literate. MCI did not
claim otherwise, but it used a bit of sleight of hand to overstate
the survey as a basis for ``the American public to gauge their `Net
know-how,''' prompting several news outlets to report the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it did not mean for people to misinterpret the
findings as comprehensive. ``The survey is not scientific in any
way,'' conceded an MCI spokeswoman, Mary Matalobos.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace is filling up with surveys and polls. In fact, news
junkies can participate in dozens of polls posted on line on any
given day.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, for instance, ABC News polled visitors to its site
on whether they worried about online privacy. CNN's online quick
poll asked if Netizens supported an anti-flag-burning amendment to
the Constitution (as opposed to the ``in-depth'' CNN poll, which
asked about China and democracy).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN queried visitors about who would make it to the finals of
the World Cup; a daily survey by the search engine Excite asked,
``What's gone wrong in fighting Florida's fires?'' and Time
magazine's Web page posed a question about trust and the news
media: ``Whom can you believe anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises another question: Which, if any, of these
polls can be taken seriously?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that is not many, some polling experts say,
because for the most part, the polls are marketing ploys designed
to attract traffic. Getting more poll participants means more page
views and that, in turn, can produce advertising revenue, said Dan
Murphy, director of research and analysis for Relevant Knowledge, a
market research company in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they create polls, they create page views,'' Murphy said,
referring to the number of Web pages that visitors call up. ``It's
methodical. It's a business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the sites do not present their polls as anything more
than an unscientific sampling of opinion. The CNN site, for
instance, plainly states that its ``poll is not scientific and
reflects the opinion of those Internet visitors who have chosen to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the polls' creators say, the polls are meant to be fun.
Scott Woelfel, editor in chief of CNN Interactive, said CNN's polls
gave people the opportunity to express themselves and to see where
other people stand. Tens of thousands participate in CNN's more
popular polls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woelfel also said that CNN had taken steps to prevent virtual
ballot-box stuffing by making it possible for each individual to
vote only once. That effort took on new importance after an
advocate of nuclear testing by India overwhelmed a CNN poll on the
subject and made it seem as if testing had widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of skewed results followed an effort by the
radio broadcaster Howard Stern, who urged visitors to the People
Magazine site to vote for ``Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf'' as the
most beautiful person of the year. Hank crushed Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's one person, one vote,'' Woelfel said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet presents significant challenges to
prospective pollsters, it offers certain advantages, too. Indeed,
some scientists and polling organizations are seeking to capitalize
on some of the inherent advantages of conducting surveys in
cyberspace, like the medium's wide reach and affordability.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Black International in Rochester, N.Y., the publisher of
the Harris telephone polls, says that online polling, if done
correctly, can be statistically valid.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, Harris has begun using the Internet to
conduct popular-opinion polls. Leonard Bayer, chief scientist for
Harris, said the company believes that understands the population
on the Net well enough to find samples that are representative of
the population at large. The company is creating a sampling pool of
five million e-mail respondents, which Bayer said would be far
larger than most off-line pools.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was easier to find rare subsets of the population
using the Net because there were so many people to draw from. ``If
we need to reach 10,000 people with a particular medical condition,
say multiple sclerosis, we can do so virtually overnight,'' Bayer
said. Previously, he added, ``it was unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bayer and others emphasize that there was a major difference
between a study that sought to survey a representative sample and a
mere popular opinion poll. ``You can't just hang out a couple of
questions, say, about which university has the best fight song and
expect it to be representative,'' he said.

   ``Every Hidden Thing''
</P>
<P>
   By Athol Dickson
</P>
<P>
   Zondervan, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   Dallas writer Athol Dickson likes his theology front-and-center;
``Every Hidden Thing'' is a Christian mystery _ no doubt about it.
But that forthrightness doesn't mean that this author/architect
won't sneak up and whack you upside the head with his plot when you
aren't looking.
</P>
<P>
   When gunfire at an East Texas hospital leaves an abortionist
wounded and a Roman Catholic priest dead, the devout wife of
contractor Garrison Reed is the prime suspect. Worse, Mary Jo
disappears while out on bail, leaving her new-believer husband to
wrestle with a grotesque and violent web of circumstances, as well
as doubts about his faith and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Hidden Thing,'' a sequel to 1996's ``Whom Shall I
Fear?,'' gathers elements as disparate as abortion, religious
fanaticism, cancer and voodoo (yes, voodoo) and melds them into a
darkly effective tale. And don't think that the revelation of who
shot Melvin Milo and Michael McKay is the biggest surprise in
Dickson's repertoire.

   ``The Jesus Record''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Mullins &AMP; a Ragamuffin Band
</P>
<P>
   Myrrh Records
</P>
<P>
   Nine days before he died in a car accident, Rich Mullins sat
down in an old, abandoned church and, accompanied only by an
acoustic guitar and piano, sang nine songs into a cheap
battery-powered cassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
   For that, we can be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   The nine songs were part of a 10-song project Mullins was
calling ``The Jesus Record.'' The plan was to go into the studio
later and record them with a full band.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he never made it into the studio is tragic for
Christian music fans. When we lost Mullins, we lost the pre-eminent
songwriter of our time. Nobody matched him for the depth and
intensity of feeling of his lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   But at least we have this two-disc album.
</P>
<P>
   The first disc consists of the demos Mullins recorded in the
church. The second features the same songs recorded by his group,
the Ragamuffin Band, with guest vocalists including Michael W.
Smith, Ashley Cleveland, Phil Keaggy and Amy Grant.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to listen to this CD without feeling a tug of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain sense of melancholy in hearing the rough
recording of Mullins singing in the church, knowing that these are
his last songs. And also in listening to the finished songs.
Although the guest vocalists are uniformly excellent _ especially
Cleveland on Jesus _ there is a feeling of regret that it's not
Mullins himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the emotions come from the lyrics themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Mullins will be missed. But we can be thankful he left us
this parting gift.

THAT STRANGE KEYBOARD ISN'T BROKEN, JUST REDESIGNED

<P>
   People who experience wrist or forearm pain from using computers
often welcome the idea of so-called ergonomic keyboards, which are
supposed to reduce the risk of injury and increase comfort. But do
they really help prevent repetitive stress injury, known as RSI?
And if so, which ones are best?
</P>
<P>
   With the widespread use of personal computers, the incidence of
repetitive stress injuries has greatly increased, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration calls RSI one of the
fastest-growing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   RSI is an umbrella term for many injuries caused by overuse of
the nerves, muscles and tendons; the ailments include carpal tunnel
syndrome, tendinitis and trigger finger, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the risk factors for RSI _ including typing speed,
repetition, poor posture, sedentary behavior, poor technique, too
much force and awkward positioning _ is informative. Changing the
angle of the keyboard will help with awkward positioning, but it
won't solve any of the other problems, and therefore can be of only
limited use in preventing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And as problematic as the keyboard is, many ergonomists consider
its alternative, the mouse, to be far more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that better engineering won't vastly improve
the standard keyboard, which has many faults. It forces users to
put their wrists into a palms-down position (the medical term is
pronation). It encourages the user to make a sideways twist of the
wrist to reach the Enter key (called ulnar deviation) and to take
the bent-wrist position of a police officer halting traffic (called
dorsiflexion).
</P>
<P>
   The standard keyboard also has a right-hand bias: the number pad
and important keys are placed on that side, forcing overuse in what
for most people is the dominant hand. In addition, many frequently
used keys, like Enter, Shift, Backspace and Control, are placed
near the weakest finger, the pinkie. The space bar taxes the thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Certain keyboards billed as ergonomic address some of these
problems, but many merely place the keys in two angled banks with
few other improvements. Labeling an input device ``ergonomic'' can
be a lot like calling a food loaded with sugar, salt and fat
``natural.'' Some accessories bearing this term are in fact not
useful in preventing injuries and can actually promote problems.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a keyboard, here are features to look for:
</P>
<P>
   _ True split. Some keyboards _ like the Microsoft Natural
Keyboard, Kinesis Maxim, Kinesis Ergonomic, and Pace _ separate
keys into two banks with space in between, but they are fixed in
place. This arrangement may work if your dimensions happen to fit
that keyboard, but may not split widely enough apart if you are
broad-shouldered. When the keyboard is actually split into two
separate pieces, as with the IBM Options keyboard, you can position
the banks where you want them. Sometimes, professional assistance
from a doctor or therapist may help in the positioning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Angle rotation. The shallow V-shaped angle on some ergonomic
keyboards is intended to help users avoid twisting their wrists to
the side. On some keyboards, the angle is fixed; others allow
infinite adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tilt. The upward tilt toward the middle keys helps to move the
hand out of an extreme palms-down position and into a less
stressful, near-handshake posture. Touch-typists will have an
easier time using this feature than those who hunt and peck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Layout of keys, especially function and edit keys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Springy ``end feel.'' A great deal of cumulative force runs
through your fingers, especially if you pound the keyboard. Keys
that give slightly as you press them help soften the landing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feedback, meaning that the user feels the key give or click to
the touch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Detachable number pad. Lefties (and righties who want to
distribute hand work more evenly between two hands) can move the
number pad to the left side. Or if you rarely use these keys, you
may exclude it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Streamlined design. Many of the newer ergonomic keyboard
designs are quite large or are mounted on platforms, which may make
them awkwardly high. Before making any purchase, consider whether
your current platform is wide enough to accommodate both the
keyboard and the mouse at a comfortable height.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good hand-to-key fit. Hands, like feet, come in all shapes and
widths. Key design varies subtly from maker to maker; notice
whether one keyboard allows more comfortable spacing for your hand
span than another.
</P>
<P>
   _ System compatibility. Some keyboards work only with PCs, not
with Macs.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting again that keyboards are only one aspect of
an ergonomically sound workplace. Adjustable keyboard holders,
light sources and chairs are also elements of a well-thought-out
computer set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some keyboards that offer useful ergonomic
features:
</P>
<P>
   IBM OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   This keyboard, which was formerly known as the Lexmark and is no
longer manufactured, had an intelligent design. The right and left
key banks were separated in two distinct pieces, and feet on the
midsection allowed upward tilt. Keys were arranged so that work was
more evenly distributed between both hands: the left space bar
could be used either as Delete key or for spacing, and there were
cursor keys on both banks. The Options keyboard had a detachable
number pad so you could use either hand for this function.
</P>
<P>
   If you were using the number pad exclusively, as an accountant
might, you could move the keyboard out of the way and place it
directly under your hand. (Depending on the software, this may not
be applicable.) More important, if you rarely used the number pad,
you could remove it entirely, freeing up valuable space. Word
Perfect users were often annoyed to find the F7 key on the
left-hand side of the board, but users quickly became accustomed to
it. The keyboard was simple to install _ you just plugged it in.
</P>
<P>
   A similar keyboard with some new features will be available in
September from Goldtouch Technologies. (Goldtouch Keyboard, for PC
only, $99; www.goldtouch. com; (800) 593-2453.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a keyboard is akin to buying a pair shoes _ to insure
the right fit, you need to try it out first. To get a better sense
of a new keyboard, sit down and position yourself properly as you
type. If possible, buy from a vendor that accepts returns. That
way, you can try the keyboard out on your own desk.
</P>
<P>
   Take your time as you test. Different angles and key locations
may take getting used to; avoid buying or using a new keyboard
under time pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Trust your instincts. If a keyboard causes pain or strain the
moment you try it, don't buy it thinking you'll adjust to it later.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to solve a medical problem with an ergonomic gadget.
If you are experiencing soreness, fatigue, tingling, clumsiness or
other signs of RSI, see a good doctor immediately.

NUCLEAR STORAGE SITE IN WEST TEXAS `VERY MUCH ALIVE,' AGENCY HEAD
SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Maine and Vt.) 
(See optional trim) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The head of the state agency charged with
disposing of low-level nuclear waste predicted Wednesday that a
storage site near Sierra Blanca will eventually be approved,
despite an unexpected setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing is very much alive,'' said Lawrence Jacobi
Jr., general manager of the Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think yesterday's ruling was just a bump in the road to
success.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two administrative law judges who had conducted 10
weeks of technical hearings recommended against issuing an
operating license for the project in the West Texas desert.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi said his agency, which would operate the facility, will
appeal the recommendation to the three-member Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, which can accept or reject the
judges' findings. TNRCC is expected to rule by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative judges cited two factors in their opposition
to the facility. They said the waste disposal authority hadn't
adequately determined whether a geological fault at the proposed
site posed an environmental risk.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the agency hadn't adequately answered questions
about the socio-economic impact on Sierra Blanca, a small, isolated
town about 90 miles southeast of El Paso. Sierra Blanca already
disposes of sewage sludge from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi said evidence presented to the judges had proved
``conclusively that the fault is not a problem.'' He noted that the
judges had ruled in the agency's favor on 15 other issues
considered in the application.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the evidence is sufficient to support the
application,'' said Bill Dugat III, a private attorney representing
the waste disposal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear disposal facility is backed by utilities and medical
centers that generate radioactive waste. Texas also has plans to
accept waste from Maine and Vermont, which are decommissioning
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal has drawn opposition from some Sierra Blanca
residents, environmentalists and some Mexican officials. The site
is about 16 miles north of the Rio Grande River.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC staff has issued an environmental assessment that
concluded that the license should be granted. All three members of
the TNRCC are appointees of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he doesn't want to proceed with the project if it
is determined to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the TNRCC to ``thoroughly review this recommendation
and the facts and to make their decision based on sound science and
the health and safety of Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic challenger Garry Mauro, who opposes the
disposal site, called on Bush to urge his appointees to the panel
to vote against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two independent hearing examiners have confirmed what a lot of
us have been saying. You don't put a radioactive waste disposal
site near a geological fault with strong earthquake potential,''
Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the $34 million Sierra Blanca site to begin
accepting waste in 2000 for disposal in concrete canisters that are
to be placed in deep trenches.

of whatever is in the Top 40, but I'm usually going for the more
obscure stuff,'' said Auman, who figures that 10 percent of the 500
CD's in his collection have been ordered from CDnow.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in turning to the Internet to satisfy his
musical needs. While music sales nationwide through online
retailers will reach only $81 million this year, according to
Jupiter Communications, a new-media research company in New York,
they are expected to grow to $1.1 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On-line music retailers are essentially mail-order vendors who
post interactive catalogs on the Web. Those catalogs are searchable
databases attached to distribution and credit-card billing systems;
orders may also be placed by phone. Auman occasionally pays extra
for overnight delivery so a hot new release can be delivered to his
desk before Raleigh's stores open.
</P>
<P>
   On-line music stores can offer a vast selection, long lists of
CD's that would dwarf most real-world inventories. The entries are
often supplemented with song titles and cover art. Even ardent fans
may be surprised by the availability of imported recordings and
other rarities by their favorite performers.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit can be price: the time spent waiting for music
to arrive in the mail is often offset by attractive Web prices. An
informal survey of eight music retailers, four on line and four off
line, showed that a trio of chart-topping disks bought from CDnow,
Music Boulevard or Amazon.com was as much as 4 percent cheaper than
the same albums purchased at the lowest-cost chain store, once
shipping charges and sales taxes were factored in.
</P>
<P>
   But every music vendor's prices fluctuate regularly, especially
with sales on current hits. It pays to shop around: choose several
sites and open a browser window for each site, then register at
each, pick identical items and choose the store with the lowest
price. The options include Sound Stone  &UR; (www.soundstone.com) &LR; ,
Tower Records  &UR; (www.towerrecords. &LR;   &UR; com) &LR; , Total E of Columbia
House  &UR; (www.totale.com) &LR;  and Tunes.com  &UR; (www.tunes.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Virtual merchants also capitalize on the Web's multimedia
capabilities by offering hundreds of thousands of 30-second song
snippets that encourage you to sample before you buy. Auman said he
had been inspired to buy a John Wetton album _ a disk he would
never have found at a Tower Records listening station _ after
sampling its tracks on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In online music catalogs, as in any database, accuracy is
critical for conducting searches. An errant keystroke can alter
results _ is that band's name Figdish or Fig Dish? (It is the
latter.) Nor should the data necessarily be trusted; two sites list
``Some Girls,'' a 1978 Rolling Stones album, as having been
released in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a database by itself is valuable, as is the case with
the Global Electronic Music Marketplace  &UR; (www.gemm.com) &LR; , a
clearinghouse for used, out-of-print and esoteric recordings that
is little more than an enormous text-based registry. Other online
retailers routinely decorate their shops by adding digital bells
and whistles, typically including album recommendations meant to
spur further buying.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers truly seeking guidance should turn to specialty
retailers like Descarga, a Latin-music purveyor in Brooklyn that
opened its Web site  &UR; (www.descarga.com)  &LR; in June.
</P>
<P>
   Or they might consider returning to the real world. Chicago
Compact Disc in Evanston, Ill., had the highest prices of the eight
sites participating in the informal survey. But its owner, Michael
Bernard, has been selling used CD's to this collector for nearly a
decade. Asked to suggest a new disk he thought I might like, he
immediately volunteered a recently reissued Miles Davis title. ``I
don't even have to think about it,'' Bernard said. He was right.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WWW.CDNOW.COM
</P>
<P>
   What led to the start of CDnow was the passion of Jason Olim,
the company's co-founder and chief executive, for the music of
Miles Davis. After hearing the trumpeter's ``Kind of Blue'' in
1988, he went to a nearby music store. ``I asked them, `What can
you recommend?''' Olim recalled, ``and the answer I got was, `Oh,
Miles Davis is in the jazz section.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Olim and his twin brother, Matthew, now 29, opened CDnow on
the Web in October 1994, their goal was to build a music store
where the virtual staff was well prepared for that sort of inquiry.
Like its rivals, CDnow maintains an editorial team to write
articles and reviews (invariably positive) and to compile buyer's
guides on genres like Celtic music. And more content is coming from
sources like the archives of Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A central feature of the site is the Audio Advisor, which
recommends other titles based on the preferences of like-minded
listeners. For fans of ``Kind of Blue,'' CDnow's somewhat odd
suggestions include albums by Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and
Radiohead, as well as an apt tip for Thelonious Monk.
</P>
<P>
   CDnow has a workmanlike interface, and registering at the site
is a snap (as it was for all the services reviewed here). Shipping
costs $2.99 for the first CD, plus 99 cents for each additional CD;
the maximum fee is $4.97. Sales tax is collected for California,
Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where the company is based.
</P>
<P>
   CDnow says it offers 250,00 titles and 315,000 audio clips. Like
Music Boulevard, it sells a few exclusives, like a limited-edition
disk of remixed tunes by David Byrne, former leader of the Talking
Heads.
</P>
<P>
   While sample sound clips are offered for some albums on CDnow,
many albums have none. That is particularly true for classical
music; half-minute clips rarely do justice to an hourlong concerto.
Also, none of the sites have a search engine that works well for
classical titles, an impression confirmed when a quest for Bartok's
``Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'' confounded the CDnow
software.
</P>
<P>
   CDnow's customer-service area invites visitors to e-mail
inquiries to its staff of experts. After three days, a question
about a Charlie Palmieri-arranged album by Cal Tjader, a cool-jazz
vibraphonist, drew this response: ``I have not yet had the
opportunity to listen to `Primo,' so I am unable to tell you if you
will like it or not. Also, I think that only you can be the true
judge of what music you will like.'' Compare that with the response
from a specialty site, Descarga. Bruce Polin, Descarga's founder,
sent this message: `` `Primo' is not a typical Tjader release. . .
. It's a classic that smokes from beginning to end. `Mama Guela' is
worth the price alone.'' Polin's expertise comes at a premium:
Descarga charges $15.98 for the disk; at CDnow, it's $11.49.

<P>
   WWW.MUSICBLVD.COM
</P>
<P>
   Music Boulevard is a nice ride if you are willing to tolerate
the speed limit. With its colorful graphics and glossy black
backdrops, the site creates a visually appealing environment, a
Barneys among two Bloomingdale's and a Kmart. The trade-off is the
wait while the graphics-rich pages load.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1996, Music Boulevard carries 260,000 titles and
provides 350,000 audio clips. On-screen annotation comes from the
All-Music Guide, among other sources, but large amounts of original
content can be found by following the links to Classical Insites,
Jazz Central Station and Rocktropolis, genre-specific sites also
operated by N2K, Music Boulevard's parent, based in Manhattan. One
oddity: despite the company's attention to classical music, the
search function does not permit hunting for compositions by name.
</P>
<P>
   Music Boulevard offered a few more sound samples and
consistently lower prices _ this week, anyway _ on an offbeat array
of 10 titles, like NRBQ's ``Tapdancin' Bats.'' Shipping is $2.49
for the first item and 49 cents for the next, but a total of only
99 cents for three or more. Taxes are assessed in Pennsylvania,
California and New York. Repeat customers are rewarded with a free
CD after buying 10.
</P>
<P>
   Good customer service is essential for online retailers. When a
CD arrived with a cracked case, I wrote to Music Boulevard via
e-mail. Just as when I placed my order, my message was immediately
acknowledged. Four days later, the company informed me that a
replacement had been shipped; three days after that, it was
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   I also got an explanatory note intended for another customer.
Wild, I hope your problem was solved, too.
</P>
<P>
   WWW.AMAZON.COM
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has been selling books on the Web since 1995, but its
music site is the new kid on the block, appearing just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its well-developed literary counterpart, the music area
remains very much a work in progress. The look is simple, the
recommendation system is in its early stages, and plans for a
classical section are still being drafted. At the moment, the site
also has the dinkiest selection, a mere 125,000 titles and 225,000
clips. Shipping is $2 per order, plus 95 cents per item, and taxes
are levied on residents of Washington State (the company is based
in Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com deserves praise for its search engine, which yielded
a recording by the Three Baritone Saxophone Band that other sites
did not when queried with the word ``baritone.'' Similarly, the
site's song-title search is also the most effective, a useful
feature for those who are unable to identify a tune heard on the
radio _ you know, the one with the chorus that goes ``something,
something, mmm, hmm . . . baby!'' Only on the Amazon.com site did a
search on ``corner'' lead to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ``Down
on the Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing review excerpts from about a dozen
publications, Amazon.com allows visitors to sound off about
recordings. While these comments are rarely illuminating, they can
be entertaining, as in this analysis of a new release by Master P:
``Could've been better, but could've been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   WWW.GEMM.COM
</P>
<P>
   When a friend's romantic relationship ended recently, she lost
more than a beau. A treasured CD by Timbuk 3 also vanished from her
life. The disk was not available at several music sites on line,
but rather than scour the used-CD bins, she searched the Global
Electronic Music Marketplace's listings. Six entries popped up,
ranging in price from $7.95 to $35.66.
</P>
<P>
   The credit goes to Roger Raffee's mom. When Raffee decided to
unload his vinyl LP's in 1994, his mother suggested that he meet
with Jim Hall, a programmer, about cataloguing the collection on a
PC. Over dinner, the pair hatched a plan for an open marketplace on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Born as a bulletin board system, GEMM hit the Web that fall. It
has become a huge online flea market with 1,500 retailers selling
everything from old 45's and posters to new-release CD's and
concert videos.
</P>
<P>
   The GEMM database has an astounding 2.7 million items, although
entries from different merchants for the same title do pad that
count. ``I'm pretty sure we've got everything CDnow, Amazon and all
the other music sites combined have _ and a heck of a lot more,''
Raffee said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its unrefined appearance, GEMM's functions are quite
polished, enabling users to customize their searches by filtering
out, say, older disks, imports or any item that costs more than
$12. Buyers can order through the site, operated from San Diego, or
get in contact with the seller directly, possibly avoiding a
commission of up to 15 percent that GEMM sometimes collects. GEMM's
site is devoid of news, commentary and audio clips, although there
are easy-to-follow links to noisier locales, and the text-heavy
look derives too clearly from the site's bulletin-board roots. Hall
promised a graphics update soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the blend of used CD's, vintage vinyl and unusual
memorabilia is a collector's dream. Raffee said he regularly
received e-mail messages of thanks for fulfilling decades-old
desires, like an unused ticket from a Beatles concert at Shea
Stadium. Because GEMM is not the actual retailer, it monitors
sellers to make sure that transactions actually take place. Raffee
said only five vendors had been banned from the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seduced by Money,'' a power-pop CD by the Thieves, has long
been on this writer's wish list, but GEMM did not have it. Ever
mindful of the vagaries of data entry, I tried again after
reversing the middle vowels in ``Thieves.'' The out-of-print disk
was delivered Monday, a week after it was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   On a lark, I also tried the site's ``best price'' filter to look
for the same three chart-topping titles I had used to test the
other sites. GEMM directed me to a site that beat all the others
 &UR; (www.cdcellar.com) &LR; .

VATICAN LAICIZES PRIEST CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY BLANEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudolph ``Rudy'' Kos is no longer a priest, and the convicted
pedophile can no longer be involved in Catholic Church ministry of
any kind, the Vatican has decided.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a request from the Catholic Diocese of Dallas, the
Vatican has taken the rare step of returning Kos to lay status. The
action cannot be reversed, and Kos has no course of appeal, canon
law experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Kos' ordination was not nullified, which is a more extreme
measure, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it happened,'' said the Rev. Robert Williams, who
served with Kos at a church in Ennis, Texas. ``He was an affront to
everything the priesthood is about. He violated the priesthood in
every way he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's action prohibits Kos from being called ``father''
or ``reverend,'' although he can remain a Catholic, officials said.
It also relieves the Dallas Diocese of financial responsibility for
Kos if he is ever released from prison, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this action will bring some closure for the victims and
their families as well as for all of us,'' Bishop Charles V.
Grahmann of Dallas said in a written statement Tuesday. ``This
forced laicization sends a definitive signal that the Diocese of
Dallas will make every effort to see that this abuse does not occur
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kos is serving a life sentence at a prison in Huntsville, Texas.
He was convicted of molesting four boys more than 1,350 times
between 1987 and 1992, while he was assigned to St. Luke's Catholic
Church in Irving and St. John's Catholic Church in Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old inmate apparently does not know of the Vatican's
decision, friends said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an April interview after his criminal trial, Kos said of his
priesthood, ``They can't ever take that away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kos was suspended from priestly functions and benefits in 1993,
shortly after accusations surfaced that he had molested altar boys
at three area churches between 1981 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the boys sued. In July 1997, a civil jury awarded
$119.6 million in damages to 10 former altar boys and the parents
of an 11th who committed suicide. The amount of the damages was the
largest ever against a diocese. Three plaintiffs have settled for
$7.5 million, and the remaining eight are close to reaching a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the diocese filed a petition seeking to nullify
Kos' ordination. Nullification, which is rarely used in
disciplining priests, would have meant that Kos was never a validly
ordained priest.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the Vatican told diocese officials that a
unilateral laicization was a faster course to remove Kos from the
priesthood, and the diocese resubmitted the required paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil and criminal trials made it clear how much he
deceived and defrauded the diocese about his lifestyle,'' Monsignor
John Bell, the diocese's chancellor and judicial vicar, wrote in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken June 26 while Grahmann was in Rome to
report on the Dallas Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Unilateral laicization means that Kos is returned to the status
of a lay person and cannot administer the sacraments, Williams
said. Priests can request laicization, but it is unusual for a
bishop to seek it for another priest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kos' removal is the second of its kind in a month in the
United States. A 62-year-old retired Boston priest was laicized in
June. He was accused of sexual abuse, an official with a Catholic
publication said. No criminal charges were pursued, but a
settlement was reached, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Genny Carder of Irving, a friend of Kos' who testified on his
behalf at his criminal trial, voiced her anger at his removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's quite right. I think he is a priest, and
I think he always will be,'' Carder said. ``He has my total support
and, yes, he still is my priest.''

Y2K BUG COULD HAVE BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday July 10)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not too early to begin breaking out in nervous hives over
the ``millennium bug,'' that minor computer glitch that, come Jan.
1, 2000, will simultaneously detonate every nuclear warhead on the
planet, crash the world's stock markets and, perhaps most alarming
of all, make it impossible to buy a lottery ticket at your
neighborhood convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Or not, depending on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what's so unsettling about the millennium bug, also
known as ``Y2K'' for reasons that are altogether clear: You do not
know whether you should be stockpiling your underground compound in
Wyoming with emergency rations and automatic weapons or popping
another cold one and watching ``Ren and Stimpy'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug refers to what might or might not happen in
the first few seconds of 2000 when all the world's computers
advance the date from 99 to 00. Although computers are incredibly
clever to the point that they can run power plants and create the
special effects for movies like ``Armageddon'' (is there a
connection here?), they are also incredibly stupid in that they
cannot figure out that the year after 1999 is 2000, not 1900.
Apparently, once a computer decides that the year is 1900, it goes
crazy with grief, which is understandable considering that
computers hadn't been invented yet in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   What this means to us is unclear or perfectly clear, depending
on whom you wish to believe. There are Internet forums where
``doomsayers'' debate ``Pollyannas'' over the severity of the
millennium bug's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Turner (whom it would be safe to label a doomsayer) of
Cartersville, Mo., manufactures ``Y2K survival domes'' and markets
them on the Internet for $7,000 apiece. Other alarmists have begun
storing survival food, building fortified hideouts in the
countryside and stockpiling guns and ammo to protect their turf.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, it does not take a great deal of incentive for a
certain percentage of the American population to build fortified
hideouts in the countryside or stockpile guns and ammo. A
penny-a-gallon rise in the price of gasoline might do the trick, as
might a tabloid news story reporting that the House of
Representatives is controlled by aliens.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its severity, the millennium bug is certainly bad news
for people like myself whose feelings about computers range from
vague mistrust to outright terror. Anyone who writes on a computer
has experienced a ``crash'' where days, weeks or even years of work
is suddenly beamed into a parallel universe from where it can never
be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of crashes, airline passengers are unlikely to take
much comfort from the millennium bug, particularly if they were
nervous to begin with. What fun it would be to be flying at 35,000
feet over the Rocky Mountains at midnight, Jan. 31, 1999, and have
the onboard computer suddenly reprogram itself so that it is no
longer flying the airplane but is, instead, colorizing the movie
``Casablanca'' or ordering one of Candace Turner's survival domes
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be interesting to go to the supermarket for a
half-gallon of milk and a loaf of bread and have the check-out
scanner tell you that you owe $35,000
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is also possible, I suppose, that the millennium
bug will cause all the world's automatic teller machines to
suddenly shoot out a stream of $20 bills and all the slot machines
in Las Vegas to hit ``jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   So you might want to plan on being in a big casino when the
clock strikes midnight Jan. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I just wouldn't advise taking an airplane to get there.

 &HT;    TEARFUL DAUGHTER OF JASPER VICTIM BACKS NEW HATE CRIMES LAW
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a month after the racially motivated murder of
her father in Jasper, Texas, a tearful Renee Mullins urged the U.S.
Senate on Wednesday to strengthen federal enforcement of hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Her delicate voice and compassionate words brought several
people in the hearing room to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all citizens to pray for these individuals who have
such low self-esteem and who are so full of fear and hatred that
they are cut out from the happiness of life,'' Mullins said,
referring to the three white men who allegedly chained her father
to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him more than two miles
until his head and one arm were ripped from his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal murder of my father, James Byrd, Jr. is for us a
tragedy that we have only begun to experience. I cannot get over
the horrid and deeply felt hatred of how he died,'' she said.
Mullins then began to cry softly and apologized for her emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, 27, and other witnesses testified before the Senate
Judiciary Committee in favor of a measure that would broaden the
federal statute against hate crimes to include those based on
gender, sexual orientation or disability. It would also make it
easier to prosecute hate crimes federally, by relaxing the rules on
which cases qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing this bill into law would give some mercy for my family
and for the families of future victims of such horrible crimes,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure was introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law covers hate crimes based on race, religion
or national origin, and includes restrictions, such as the crime
must occur while a victim is exercising a federally protected
right.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the current laws are so restrictive that federal
prosecutors have had to decline prosecution in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill does not undermine the role of states in
investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. It simply closes the
loops in the federal law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Byrd's death may not qualify for federal
prosecution because he was just walking down the street and not
exercising a federally protected right, Widen said.
</P>
<P>
   Several racial minority groups _ including the National Council
of La Raza and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People _ submitted statements Wednesday strongly supporting
the changes in the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House has scheduled a hearing on a similar measure
for July 22, the bill could have problems passing because of the
provision to add crimes based on hatred of someone's sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian groups are aggressively lobbying in favor of the
measure, and conservative groups are reacting accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement distributed outside the hearing room, the
Traditional Values Coalition said that ``President Clinton and his
leftist cronies'' are ``capitalizing on the recent atrocities in
Jasper, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the group, said that the
homosexual community, which has failed to gain society's acceptance
for their chosen behavior, is trying to gain acceptance through the
force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said the bill should not be a referendum on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is about deterring criminal violence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Mullins thanked the nation for all the prayers
being delivered to her family and said she will overcome the tragic
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to live for and many more accomplishments to
achieve, to continue to be _ in spirit _ the sparkle in my father's
eyes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Jasper County grand jury indicted the three men
accused of kidnapping and killing Byrd. The three men could be
executed if convicted of capital murder.

 &HT;    THE ENDLESS WAIT
 &HT;    By PAUL REID
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post/Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Don French _ retailer, world traveler, homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Surfer.
</P>
<P>
   He's been surfing Florida beaches for 28 years. That means he
knows what it's like to be a Chicago Cubs fan, knows how an
astronomer feels after a lifetime of looking for alien life forms.
</P>
<P>
   It means French knows how to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred miles of sandy beach from Jacksonville to
Hollywood sings a siren song for surfers. Azure waves lap every
inch of that beach. But that's the problem for Don French, surfer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida waves lap.
</P>
<P>
   They don't roll too often, are not swell swells, do not crash
with the power and grace of a Pacific monster wave upon the north
shore of Oahu, where French just spent two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They lap. That's why our beaches are crowded with happy
swimmers, sunbathers, treasure hunters wielding metal detectors.
And surfers, many surfers. Frustrated surfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go to the beach to enjoy the breeze, the clouds,
the sand underfoot. It's all there and it's beautiful,'' says
French, owner of Ocean Magic surf shop in Jupiter. ``You have to
appreciate the whole show, because if you go only to surf, you'll
be disappointed more often than not.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida surfing means shelving any dream of the perfect wave.
Any wave will do. During the high season of Florida surfing _
October through April _ French and his surfing buddies feel lucky
if they get 10 great surfing days. Last year they got two.
</P>
<P>
   Florida hosts the endless beach, the endless summer and, for
surfers, the endless wait. That's because the sandbar we call
Florida slopes so gently under the Atlantic that a 3-foot drop in
the sea level would extend our coastline out for miles, to where it
was 11,000 years ago, before the glaciers melted. The gentle slope
of our shore knocks down big ocean waves. That and a paucity of
good coves makes for inconsistent surfing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanic regions, like Hawaii, stick right up out of the open
ocean and capture passing swells. That's perfection. But what
Florida lacks in geological necessities it makes up for _ on
occasion _ with meteorological fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   An offshore storm can kick up good rollers, French says, but if
the storm is too far offshore and the winds from the south or
southeast, the Bahamas will knock the waves down.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are a surfer's friend, but only if the eye of the
storm is just far enough away and comes up the coast just far
enough offshore to send breakers our way without sending a wicked
storm surge. A 12-foot storm surge sounds good on paper but will
more than likely be the last ride a surfer takes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor'easters make for more chop than swells, but they sure can
kick up the surf, making for wild rides and broken boards, to say
nothing of bones. Trouble is, nor'easters are a winter phenomenon.
Summer offers little or no relief for the waiting surfer.
</P>
<P>
   The best waves come when autumn and winter Canadian cold fronts
push cool air from the west and ocean rollers from the north.
That's when Reef Road in Palm Beach becomes as good a surfing beach
as any in Fiji, Barbados or Costa Rica, says French.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part during surfing season it's wait, wait,
wait for waves that rarely come. During the summer it's an endless
wait, like in war and baseball where long periods of immense
boredom are punctuated by moments of sheer terror or exhilaration _
except Florida's summer surfers experience long periods of boredom
punctuated by brief periods of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the wait is rewarded by brief shock waves of
adrenalin when surfers spy far offshore the quivering crest of an
incoming gently curved, perfectly glassy roller.
</P>
<P>
   Good things sometimes come to surfers who wait, especially if
they wait at the Sebastian inlet, about 40 miles south of
Melbourne. That's surfing central for Florida surfers. National
champions Kelly Slater and Lisa Anderson hail from the Cocoa
Beach-Melbourne-Sebastian area.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Jon surf shop in Cocoa Beach draws surfers from all over the
Southeast. Melbourne is home to numerous surfing boutiques: Find a
dedicated surfer in the waves off Sebastian and there's a good
chance he made his own board in his own store.
</P>
<P>
   And when the wind is out of the west and the waves out of the
northeast, you'll find all those Sebastian denizens at Reef Road. A
natural cove augmented by two jetties, Reef Road beach offers
incoming waves the perfect venue for rolling in with perfect form.
You don't want to see white caps on the horizon, says French. You
want to see breakers waiting until they reach the beach to break.
That's what you'll see at Reef Road on a good day.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also see Palm Beach police ticketing surfers' cars
because there's no parking hard by Reef Road. Good waves mean a
boost in local enforcement revenues.
</P>
<P>
   And a boost in morale for Don French. And for all the surfers up
and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Guys such as Palm Beach architect Harry Gilbert, who has surfed
the world for 30 years and is not above rolling up the blueprints
and locking up the shop when the waves are right. And Bryon Rivers,
a writer for this newspaper who can smell good waves from his
windowless cubicle. And Danny Beaudoin, a Lake Worth native and
acoustic ceiling installer who has been known to be late for work
because the ocean has called.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin bought his custom-made board from Dave Freidank,
another Lake Worth lad for whom life does not exist west of the
mean high tide line. Freidank builds his boards at his shop, Blue
Earth Surfboards. His motto: Pray for surf.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing's still mostly a guy sport, 8 to 1 ratio, says French.
But it's a good way to meet girls, and other new friends, for the
simple reason that people on the beach have to talk about something
when faced with indeterminate waits.
</P>
<P>
   For those who elect not to socialize while they wait for the
perfect wave, French suggests some beach reading. Something long.
Such as ``Moby Dick.'' It's a good lesson in patience and
determination, says French.
</P>
<P>
   Just like waiting for the perfect Florida wave.

   Longhorns are No. 1 - at least in media guides
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Wangrin
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It is no cause for an orange Tower, riotous swarming of
the Drag, parades or gaudy trophies.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a proud University of Texas alum who needs
something in the athletic program to be proud about, there's this
recent development:
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, the Longhorns won six national titles, including a
sweep of the three big men's sports _ football, basketball and
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   For media guides.
</P>
<P>
   When bragging, that last part's on a need-to-know basis.
</P>
<P>
   At its recent convention in Spokane, Wash., the College Sports
Information Directors of America also honored the UT guides for
men's swimming and diving and men's track and field as tops in the
nation. The women's basketball guide cover was also chosen No. 1;
the guide itself No. 2 behind Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Of the school's 15 media guides, 11 finished in the top 10
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed that the Longhorns' sweep of the top three men's
sports was the first ever. Judges, one each from print and
electronic media and one with a graphics background, rate the
guides on content, convenience, organization and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become more than a media guide,'' said Mary Elliott,
UT athletic publications director. ``They're also used for
recruiting and marketing. But we still make sure it has everything
the media needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with publications specialists Mary Elliott and Donna
Seago on the guides were sports information staffers John Bianco
(football), Dave Saba (men's basketball), Mike Forcucci (baseball),
Mark Olsen (track), Penny Abrahams (swimming) and Barb Kowal
(women's basketball).
</P>
<P>
   In winning the football honors, the Horns nudged past perennial
media guide titan Notre Dame, which has won top honors seven times
in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's football guide has already been sent to the printer
and will include new sections on year-by-year statistics and a
comprehensive look at All- America halfback Ricky Williams'
records, rankings and stats. The 468-page effort _ up 28 pages from
last year _ is available for $18 at Longhorn Ltd., located on the
first floor of Bellmont Hall, or by calling 471-5583 or (800)
982-2386.

 &HT;    The guy next door might be a millionaire
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard and David Gulliver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He drives a Mercury Sable wagon, with three
hubcaps and probably some junk in the back. His designer label is
more likely to be Levi than Armani, and for lunch, the $5 salad,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Burton R. Saidel, the millionaire next door.
</P>
<P>
   Saidel is a dentist, not a stockbroker or a lawyer or a
high-tech whiz. He's not big on trappings of success. But through
hard work and smart investing the Dayton, Ohio, resident has built
a small fortune, and probably given one away as well.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the thousands of Americans who see themselves not
as tycoons, but as ordinary working folks who have gained financial
security through frugality and prudent investing.
</P>
<P>
   And he is part of a group that has economists, sociologists and
demographers scrambling for new definitions of what it means to be
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In their recent best-seller, ``The Millionaire Next Door,''
co-authors William Danko and Thomas Stanley found that many
millionaires in America today live rather quiet lives without
ostentation. Instead of splurging on expensive houses and cars,
they save and invest their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were walking down the street, you wouldn't be able to
pick them out,'' said Carrie Coghill, executive vice president of
D.B. Root &AMP; Co. in Pittsburgh. ``They're just average people, only
they have saved and invested to the point that they have achieved
financial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidel's income _ near $225,000 in peak years, now lower as he
limits his office time _ is high but neither spectacular nor
unheard of. Where he has made is wealth is through investments, for
which he credits his real estate partners and investment advisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the stock market,'' he said.
What he does know is the investment basic of compound interest that
bankers and brokers preach: Buy a stock, hold it, and reinvest the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Saidel has reinvested in real estate, and is currently a partner
in a Holiday Inn, a shopping center and, until recently, an
apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, an engineer from Pittsburgh who asked that his name not be
used, has an even simpler strategy. Tony has been saving and
investing, largely through his employer's 401(k) tax-deferred
retirement savings plan, for about 20 years. Only recently did he
realize that _ largely thanks to the roaring financial markets of
the past decade _ he had accumulated more than $1 million in
assets, 60 percent of it in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is the so-called ``401(k) millionaires'' like Tony who
confound the experts on income and wealth in America as they debate
who is truly rich.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, a millionaire was a person whose net worth
was $1 million. As recently as 1971, there were fewer than 100,000
of them in America, according to Internal Revenue Service
estimates. But by 1995, the number had reached 1.48 million _ one
in each 178 Americans, according to the most recent IRS estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But although much may separate savvy investors like Tony and
someone like Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who earns more than $1
million a day, the U.S. Census Bureau essentially treats them the
same. The Bureau, the primary source for wealth and poverty data on
Americans, statistically lumps everyone together above $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``we really don't know that much about the rich,''
said Dimitri Papadimitriou, executive director and chief economist
of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there is only sketchy statistical data on ``401(k)
millionaires,'' most of it coming from investment firms. For
example, T. Rowe Price of Baltimore, in a survey of its clients
last year, found 774 millionaires among the 1.4 million accounts it
services.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million Americans have such accounts. But only 10
percent have balances of more than $100,000, according to Access
Research, a Connecticut-based consulting firm. The average balance
is $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether any money saved for retirement should be
considered wealth. ``I wouldn't call it wealth,'' said Ted Benna,
president of the 401(k) Association, a national retirement account
advocacy group based in Cross Forks, Pa. ``It has to last you the
rest of your life.''

 &HT;    Flexibility is a key ingredient in success of a small business
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ When Susan Connett started her business six years ago,
she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do _ only that, like
other entrepreneurs, she wanted to work for herself.
</P>
<P>
   She started off with an idea of selling window shades. When that
didn't work, she switched to selling designer hats. When those
flopped, she switched to selling golf hats because, simply put,
golf is ``where people wear hats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her Hats Etc. supplies 200 accounts and is projected to
rack up $300,000 in sales this year. One of her largest customers
is rapidly expanding Golfsmith International Inc. of Austin, which
now has 20 golf superstores around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Connett says her Austin company is proof that one of the keys to
building a small business is remaining flexible and changing
directions if that's where the customers are. When one idea didn't
work out, she pursued another _ or maybe in her case, simply
changed hats.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is a business strategy that many companies rely on _
in Austin and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Antique Street Lamps Inc., for instance, used to
manufacture dune buggy bodies. Metal -Optics Inc. started out in
the mid-1980s doing energy audits for the City of Austin and now
makes reflective lighting devices.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, big companies will often diversify product lines to
remain flexible. Occasionally, they will switch businesses
altogether. Can manufacturer American Can, for instance, evolved
into Primerica, an insurance company that merged with The Travelers
Inc. Likewise, Houston-based Zapata Corp., a one-time oil company,
announced this week it is separating into two companies, one that
makes fish meal and sausage casings and one that invests in
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Bootstrapper's Success Secrets'' Kimberly
Stanse(accent)ll says initial setbacks are flags that an
entrepreneur may be trying the wrong market, courting the wrong
customers, or marketing the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give yourself permission to change your direction,''
Stanse(accent)ll advises. ``Misplaced determination or pride won't
pay your bills or move you any closer to building a better
business, so feel free to modify your business accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Connett got her idea to start a hat business when she was
marketing L'eggs hosiery for Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was traveling around the world and I was in the hosiery
departments in Iceland, Germany, Bermuda, where ever, I kept
looking through the hats (which were often hanging next to
hosiery),'' she says. ``I wondered, `What makes a hat $150 and this
one $30? Why isn't there something in between?' '' She left Sara
Lee and the corporate world with the idea of founding a hat company
or one selling corrugated paper window shades that could be
painted. When the window shade company stopped making the product
she was trying to market, she switched into designer hats, and
later, to golf hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved (to Austin in 1996) I sold my house in
Albuquerque and I had $15,000 in my pocket to live on and to start
my business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Connett, 38, says while she had built up 40 accounts, the
company wasn't making enough to pay the bills. She started
interviewing and accepted a job, but had second thoughts and backed
out. A few months later she got the Golfsmith account, her largest
account. According to buyers for Golfsmith, Hats Etc. is one of
only two Austin companies that sell products to the $180 million
retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   Connett still runs a lean business. She stores the hats in her
garage and the third bedroom of her Southwest Austin home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can keep about 4,000 hats in my garage,'' she says.
Sometimes, of course, flexibility doesn't always pay off with
profits. To bring in revenue during the slower winter months,
Connett once tried to sell a line of scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried golf scarves _ they didn't go over, but we tried
them,'' Connett says.
</P>
<P>
   But while being flexible is key, don't forget old relationships,
she warns.
</P>
<P>
   Friends at Sara Lee, for instance, once put her in touch with
the organizers of a golf tournament the company was sponsoring. As
a result, she landed an order for 300 hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't meet enough people,'' she says, ``and people will
come to you when you least expect it.''

 &HT;    ``This isn't a family that just hands you money''
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Chances are, her mom's maiden name is in your
purse. Or in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you duck into a 7-Eleven, it's there. Glance at a
vending machine, same thing. Pause in a Publix checkout line,
voila!
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   As in Doublemint (or U.S. Mint, considering the company is worth
$3.1 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Helen Rosburg, great-granddaughter of chewing gum magnate
William Wrigley Jr., is a very rich woman. But to meet her _ away
from her Bentley and her Arabian stallions and her Palm Beach
estate, at least _ you'd never know.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rosburg is an heiress without an attitude. An heiress,
you might say, for Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family believes in normalcy,'' says Rosburg, wearing a
sleeveless floral frock from a Spiegel sale catalog (``I did get it
on sale, right Laury?'' she hollers to her secretary. ``Good!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to public schools _ not all the time but most _ and it
was a given that we'd grow up and work. This isn't a family that
just hands you money.''
</P>
<P>
   And she means it. After high school, Rosburg studied to be a
secretary and even scrubbed kennels for a vet.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, her work is her passion: writing. In fact,
Rosburg's first novel, ``Call of the Trumpet,'' just hit
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   She and James Rosburg _ a sculptor she married 10 months ago _
sit closely on a couch in their living room, which overlooks the
Intracoastal. Outside on the dock is a bright yellow Jet Ski
(``that's Juicy Fruit,'' she says). And the big red Bentley with
the CHEW GUM license plate? That's Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more to Big Red, by the way, than a clever license
plate. Details to come.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the heiress/author even more real is that she sees
the humor here. A discount dress. A day job. Yet enough stock to
buy a whole town. (The Wrigleys, after all, already own an island _
Catalina Island _ 25 miles off the coast of L.A.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting dropped off by a chauffeur in first and second grade
was a little demoralizing,'' she says with a smile. ``I took a lot
of heat.''
</P>
<P>
   She also took some heat finding an agent for her book, a period
piece based on the Bedouin culture (as in desert nomads) of the
early 1800s. Seems some folks thought, you guessed it,
another-bored-socialite-spews-a-love-story. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to use my connections, but I did finally pull a
string to get a good agent because it's a Catch-22. You can't get
an agent without being published, and you can't get published
without an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I asked a friend of mine _ a broker in New York who had a
lot of high-powered clients _ if any of them were agents. I knew at
least one would be. And I said, `He doesn't have to take me on,
just have him read it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (He read it. He took her on.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The broker, by the way, was my own friend,'' she emphasizes.
``He wasn't a Wrigley connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The literal Wrigley connection, meanwhile, goes like this: In
1891, William Wrigley Jr. started a soap company in Chicago with
$32. (As a kid, he'd helped his dad peddle soap in Philadelphia.)
To lure merchants, Wrigley gave out free baking powder. The powder
became more popular than the soap, to his surprise, so he switched
to selling that.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he offered gum as an incentive: two packs per
can of powder. Again, the freebie took off _ really took off _ and
Wrigley was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife, Ada, had two children, including Philip K. Wrigley.
Philip K. went on to have three kids with wife, Helen, among them a
daughter named Deedie.
</P>
<P>
   Deedie married George Rich _ a jack-of-all-trades, Rosburg says
_ and they had three children: Helen Rosburg; Misdee Milligan, a
horse breeder in Ocala; and George T. Rich, who died of cancer
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (Deedie and George Rich eventually split up, but don't even try
to crack the ex-spouse code. Rosburg, when asked what marriage
she's on, turns to James and jokes, ``It's up there.'' Immediate
past prior is construction wheeler-dealer Willie DeGray, whom she
divorced in 1997 after nearly 11 years.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosburg recalls how she and her cousins teased grandpa Phil
during summers at the family estate in Lake Geneva, Wis. (There are
also homes in Chicago, Phoenix and on Catalina Island.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very quiet, even when he laughed,'' she says.
``We'd take the silver sugar thing and dump it out and put in
foaming sugar from the novelty shops. He'd put some into his coffee
and then very quietly say, `Replace my coffee, please.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on all summer. We did fake dog doo, fake everything,
and he finally got us back by inviting us into his office for some
chocolate. And, of course, it was rubber.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoic grandfather. Mischievous youngsters. Fake doo. Maybe the
rich aren't so different after all.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of pranks, a nearby table holds several real-looking
glass cocktail sculptures. James, with a straight face, points to
them and tells unsuspecting guests to help themselves to a
highball. Gotcha!
</P>
<P>
   Still newlyweds, he and Rosburg remain all a-bliss _ almost
always touching, often finishing each other's sentences, constantly
joking around. They ride Harleys together, too. Biker types.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him through the art world,'' she recalls. ``I'm the past
president of the Ann Norton Sculpture Gardens, and I went to a lot
of openings and stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross Ball was coming up, and I'm always the wine
chairman or the reception chairman or something, so I needed an
escort. I called up this friend and said, `Help me get a date,' and
she said, `Why not Jim?' And I said, `That stud would never want to
take me out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She literally dragged me to his Delray studio to renew old
acquaintances. When I walked in and we looked at each other, it was
like in the movies _ the drumroll, the orchestra . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Same here,'' says James, 41, in jeans and boots. ``When you
remember what they smell like _ their perfume _ and exactly what
they were wearing . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   That was Jan. 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following year we were a scandal at the Red Cross Ball,''
says Rosburg, 49, with a grin. ``We were at that stage in our love
affair where we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We were
really naughty _ and we were sitting right in front of Barbara
Wainscott Berger!''
</P>
<P>
   (Wife of New York attorney David Berger and a former social
secretary for President Nixon.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosburg says her relationship with James (``now I can write
about real romance''), fueled her to finish Call of the Trumpet, a
novel she started in the early '80s. She's already on her second,
another historic romance with horses and a heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Rosburg recalls always wanting to be a writer, although her mom
wasn't so keen on the idea. Said she wouldn't make any money.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to Stephens College _ a small, private girls school
in Columbia, Mo. _ to study nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, I figured, I could work four days a week and then
write. But when I took a literature course, the professor took me
aside and said, `Why are you taking all this psychiatric nurse
nonsense? You're a brilliant writer.' So I quit school after a year
and wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Book of Arabesque,'' a poetry collection she co-authored
with Christine Penfield, was published in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rosburg had two more kids _ Will DeGray, 11, and Ali
DeGray, 9. Her first child, Erik Wood, 29, lives in Australia and
is med-school bound.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Australia, Sydney is home to one of 13 Wrigley gum
factories worldwide. (The 14th is under construction in Russia.)
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1915, the down-under site was William Wrigley Jr.'s
second plant abroad _ the first was in Toronto _ so the young
entrepreneur was prospering. So much so, in fact, that he bought
the Chicago Cubs that same year. (That's how Wrigley Field got its
name.) The baseball team stayed in the family until 1981, when it
was sold to the Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   The gum giant went public in 1919, but the majority of stock
still remains Wrigley-owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have reunions, we plot about how to keep it in the
family,'' Rosburg jokes. ``Things happen, you know. There are a lot
of ex-spouses out there.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think there'd be packs of gum waist-high at Rosburg's
house, but au contraire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy it just like everybody else,'' she says, confessing that
a cousin keeps her supplied with P. K, a peppermint brand not sold
in the States. P. K, you see, comes in ``pellets,'' not sticks.
Americans, for whatever reason, dig sticks. Plus, Chiclet has the
U.S. pellet market nailed shut. ``And we hate that about them,''
Rosburg jokes, feigning dispair.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrigley Co., meanwhile, dominates the world gum market.
First quarter earnings this year were $76 million, up 12 cents a
share from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So how does it work? Do Rosburg and kin get a check every time
someone buys Spearmint? Or Winterfresh. Or Freedent. Or Hubba Bubba
. . .
</P>
<P>
   She hoots at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in a way, that is how it happens. Not literally, of
course. But when you buy gum, the stock stays up. It's
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosburg, she'll tell you, is in a good place right now. But just
a few years ago, this wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a really bad time. First, I was in a car accident, and
it took me a year to recover. Then, I had massive abdominal
surgery. Then, they discovered I had breast cancer, and during all
of this I was in a disgusting marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain red automobile, she says, put her on the road to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something for myself that would get me up and
out of bed, so before the surgery (she's now cancer free), I went
car shopping. I drove the BMWs and the Mercedes _ the fast cars,
the hot cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said, `While you're at it, why not try a Bentley?' I
said, `That is absolutely not my style.' But then they said, `It's
turbo.' So I drove it, and let me tell you, they could not get me
out of that car.''
</P>
<P>
   James nods his head in agreement, chuckling at the memory (``we
needed a crowbar'').
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back to the dealership, the salesman _ a
distinguished elderly English fellow _ got out of the car, turned
around and in a very clipped British way, said, `Well! I have never
had a lady client burn rubber in a Bentley!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Rosburg, lead-foot heiress.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had predicted six weeks of bed rest, but Rosburg was up
in 10 days ``thanks to that car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that car, and I drive the hell out of it,'' she says.
``So now that you know the story behind it, you realize I don't
drive a Bentley for the same reason that other people in Palm Beach
drive Bentleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Helen, we knew that already.

   On Monday and Tuesday, 2.5 inches of rain fell at McGrath,
Alaska, accounting for 15 percent of the town's annual average.
Downpours came as a low pressure system stalled over interior
Alaska, its progress blocked by unyielding high pressure over the
Arctic Ocean. More showers are possible Thursday over Alaska's
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Steering winds on the eastern flank of the blocking high will
direct a cool Canadian air mass toward western New England
Thursday. Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms will develop
along and ahead of the leading edge of the cool air mass from the
Adirondacks of upstate New York to northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of fog will reduce visibility over the northern Middle
Atlantic and southeast New England States Thursday morning, a
legacy of the rains of late Tuesday and Wednesday. After the fog
dissipates, a few showers and thunderstorms will blossom over the
central Appalachians as moist air in contact with the warming
ground rises into cold air aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and humid weather will persist over the Gulf Coast States,
with hit-or-miss showers and storms developing along and ahead of a
very weak front stretching across the region. Heavy rain is
possible in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will again develop over the southern and
central Rockies as invading tropical moisture combines with the
uneven heating of mountains to produce roiling cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isolated clusters of thunderstorms will patrol the
western high Plains from the Texas panhandle northward into the
western Dakotas and eastern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hollywood Hail &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hailstones with a diameter of three-fourths of an inch pelted
Hollywood, Florida, to the north of Miami on Tuesday. Hail is
unusual in Florida in July because hailstones typically melt
completely during their descent through the thick layer of warm air
above the ground. However, when updrafts in thunderstorms are
exceptionally strong, hailstones can be suspended longer in the
cold upper atmosphere, allowing them to grow larger as they collect
ice crystals and water drops. If hailstones grow sufficiently large
while suspended, they can avoid melting completely once they
plummet toward the ground.

 &HT;    Flexibility is a key ingredient in success of a small business
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ When Susan Connett started her business six years ago,
she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do _ only that, like
other entrepreneurs, she wanted to work for herself.
</P>
<P>
   She started off with an idea of selling window shades. When that
didn't work, she switched to selling designer hats. When those
flopped, she switched to selling golf hats because, simply put,
golf is ``where people wear hats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her Hats Etc. supplies 200 accounts and is projected to
rack up $300,000 in sales this year. One of her largest customers
is rapidly expanding Golfsmith International Inc. of Austin, which
now has 20 golf superstores around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Connett says her Austin company is proof that one of the keys to
building a small business is remaining flexible and changing
directions if that's where the customers are. When one idea didn't
work out, she pursued another _ or maybe in her case, simply
changed hats.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is a business strategy that many companies rely on _
in Austin and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Antique Street Lamps Inc., for instance, used to
manufacture dune buggy bodies. Metal -Optics Inc. started out in
the mid-1980s doing energy audits for the City of Austin and now
makes reflective lighting devices.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, big companies will often diversify product lines to
remain flexible. Occasionally, they will switch businesses
altogether. Can manufacturer American Can, for instance, evolved
into Primerica, an insurance company that merged with The Travelers
Inc. Likewise, Houston-based Zapata Corp., a one-time oil company,
announced this week it is separating into two companies, one that
makes fish meal and sausage casings and one that invests in
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Bootstrapper's Success Secrets'' Kimberly
Stanse(accent)ll says initial setbacks are flags that an
entrepreneur may be trying the wrong market, courting the wrong
customers, or marketing the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give yourself permission to change your direction,''
Stanse(accent)ll advises. ``Misplaced determination or pride won't
pay your bills or move you any closer to building a better
business, so feel free to modify your business accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Connett got her idea to start a hat business when she was
marketing L'eggs hosiery for Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was traveling around the world and I was in the hosiery
departments in Iceland, Germany, Bermuda, where ever, I kept
looking through the hats (which were often hanging next to
hosiery),'' she says. ``I wondered, `What makes a hat $150 and this
one $30? Why isn't there something in between?' '' She left Sara
Lee and the corporate world with the idea of founding a hat company
or one selling corrugated paper window shades that could be
painted. When the window shade company stopped making the product
she was trying to market, she switched into designer hats, and
later, to golf hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved (to Austin in 1996) I sold my house in
Albuquerque and I had $15,000 in my pocket to live on and to start
my business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Connett, 38, says while she had built up 40 accounts, the
company wasn't making enough to pay the bills. She started
interviewing and accepted a job, but had second thoughts and backed
out. A few months later she got the Golfsmith account, her largest
account. According to buyers for Golfsmith, Hats Etc. is one of
only two Austin companies that sell products to the $180 million
retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   Connett still runs a lean business. She stores the hats in her
garage and the third bedroom of her Southwest Austin home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can keep about 4,000 hats in my garage,'' she says.
Sometimes, of course, flexibility doesn't always pay off with
profits. To bring in revenue during the slower winter months,
Connett once tried to sell a line of scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried golf scarves _ they didn't go over, but we tried
them,'' Connett says.
</P>
<P>
   But while being flexible is key, don't forget old relationships,
she warns.
</P>
<P>
   Friends at Sara Lee, for instance, once put her in touch with
the organizers of a golf tournament the company was sponsoring. As
a result, she landed an order for 300 hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't meet enough people,'' she says, ``and people will
come to you when you least expect it.''

 &HT;    Need a wrench? It's a snap for a man with an inventory on
wheels.
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You stand in the back of Chris Holme's
white, 13-ton Snap-on tool truck and look up at the ceiling where
silver wrenches and screwdrivers and sockets and pliers hang on
little hooks and glow in the soft light and you think of Carl Sagan
looking up at the heavens saying billions and billions of . . .
</P>
<P>
   Holme is a few wrenches shy of billions, but he's got thousands
hanging in his truck _ tons upon tons of tools, $300,000 worth at
any time, from a 1-inch-long 4mm socket to a 3-pound, 18-inch-long
double open-end bolt remover.
</P>
<P>
   Tools? He's got 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Holme is one of a dozen Snap-on franchise owners who work
territories in Palm Beach and Martin counties in Florida, one of
3,400 nationwide. They own their business, own their inventory, own
their trucks. They're some of the last true American road salesmen,
drummers on a mission to those who use tools _ just about all of us
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   But their main clients are automotive mechanics. Holme's Stuart
territory is just large enough for him to know every customer by
name, and more. He knows what cars they specialize in, how old
their kids are, whether their wives are displeased when their
mechanic husband comes home with an $8,000 toolbox. He knows their
credit ratings, domestic status and football team preference.
</P>
<P>
   And they know that Holme has the tools they need. All the tools,
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   And they know something else. ``Chris Holme's tools are the
best, but his word is better,'' says Marty Lyke, a Stuart auto body
man.
</P>
<P>
   Lyke owns $30,000 worth of Snap-on tools. He uses them to turn
three wrecked cars into one functioning car. He keeps his tools in
a $10,000 bright red toolbox that measures about 4-by-6 feet. It's
the Snap-on model known as The Intimidator.
</P>
<P>
   Lyke's young sons, Marty and Matthew, have their own tools.
Snap-on. Lyke bought them tiny wrenches when they were born instead
of the usual silver bauble from Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   If Lyke needs a few hundred dollars worth of tools, Holme will
sell on easy terms _ no interest, pay when you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple equation,'' says Holme. ``An auto mechanic's
livelihood depends on having tools right now. No tools, no work. If
he doesn't work, I don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Holme, 37, with a ready smile and Tab Hunter all-American good
looks, has been selling Snap-on since 1987. Paid his $5,000
franchise fee. Bought his truck for $80,000, filled it with
inventory, went on the road. Hasn't been off the road since. Tools
are hot items.
</P>
<P>
   So isn't a tool a tool like a rose is a rose?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Americans spend on automotive repairs each
year,'' he says, ``but I know that auto mechanics spend about $3
billion on tools _ $3 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers use different standards, measures, fittings, screws,
gauges, meters, plugs, nuts, bolts and computer diagnostic
monitors. More

   WASHINGTON _ Just a month after the racially motivated murder of
her father in Jasper, Texas, a tearful Renee Mullins urged the U.S.
Senate on Wednesday to strengthen federal enforcement of hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Her delicate voice and compassionate words brought several
people in the hearing room to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all citizens to pray for these individuals who have
such low self-esteem and who are so full of fear and hatred that
they are cut out from the happiness of life,'' Mullins said,
referring to the three white men who allegedly chained her father
to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him more than two miles
until his head and one arm were ripped from his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal murder of my father, James Byrd, Jr. is for us a
tragedy that we have only begun to experience. I cannot get over
the horrid and deeply felt hatred of how he died,'' she said.
Mullins then began to cry softly and apologized for her emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, 27, and other witnesses testified before the Senate
Judiciary Committee in favor of a measure that would broaden the
federal statute against hate crimes to include those based on
gender, sexual orientation or disability. It would also make it
easier to prosecute hate crimes federally, by relaxing the rules on
which cases qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing this bill into law would give some mercy for my family
and for the families of future victims of such horrible crimes,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure was introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law covers hate crimes based on race, religion
or national origin, and includes restrictions, such as the crime
must occur while a victim is exercising a federally protected
right.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the current laws are so restrictive that federal
prosecutors have had to decline prosecution in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill does not undermine the role of states in
investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. It simply closes the
loops in the federal law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Byrd's death may not qualify for federal
prosecution because he was just walking down the street and not
exercising a federally protected right, Wyden said.
</P>
<P>
   Several racial minority groups _ including the National Council
of La Raza and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People _ submitted statements Wednesday strongly supporting
the changes in the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House has scheduled a hearing on a similar measure
for July 22, the bill could have problems passing because of the
provision to add crimes based on hatred of someone's sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian groups are aggressively lobbying in favor of the
measure, and conservative groups are reacting accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement distributed outside the hearing room, the
Traditional Values Coalition said that ``President Clinton and his
leftist cronies'' are ``capitalizing on the recent atrocities in
Jasper, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the group, said that the
homosexual community, which has failed to gain society's acceptance
for their chosen behavior, is trying to gain acceptance through the
force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said the bill should not be a referendum on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is about deterring criminal violence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Mullins thanked the nation for all the prayers
being delivered to her family and said she will overcome the tragic
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to live for and many more accomplishments to
achieve, to continue to be _ in spirit _ the sparkle in my father's
eyes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Jasper County grand jury indicted the three men
accused of kidnapping and killing Byrd. The three men could be
executed if convicted of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   John William King, 23, of Jasper; Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31,
of Sulphur Springs; and Shawn Allen Berry, 23, of Jasper are being
held without bond in what authorities say was a racially motivated
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said the earliest possible
trial date is January 1999.

 &HT;    Diamonds are a fan's best friend
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A GREAT AND GLORIOUS GAME: The Baseball Writings of A. Bartlett
Giamatti. Algonquin; 121 pages; $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   Reading this lovely, if brief collection of Bart Giamatti's work
made me realize it's been downhill for baseball since Giamatti had
the misfortune to die in 1989 after only five months as
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Giamatti was a fluke to begin with. He wasn't a
hack, a flunky, or a political appointee. He was a high-line
academic who knew baseball, loved baseball and carried a moral
authority because everyone knew that his primary allegiance wasn't
to the owners or the players, but to the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since Giamatti, we have had to endure Commissioner for Life Bud
Selig, an owner himself, a lackey to his peers, completely bereft
of credibility to the players or to any other sentient observer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Selig who meekly presided over the catastrophic strike
that washed out a World Series for the first time in history and
provided the game with its greatest crisis since the Black Sox
scandal. Bring back Ford Frick.
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti would probably not have been able to do anything about
some of the perils that have wounded the game. Wayne Huizenga would
still have broken up a World Championship team, expansion would
still water down the available talent, Michael Jordan would still
have electrified a generation of young fans, and Rupert Murdoch,
the Prince of Media Darkness, would still buy the Dodgers. Outside
the stadiums, the Balkanization of the culture that has affected
all other aspects of American life would have still worked to
decrease baseball's purchase on our emotional lives.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect Giamatti would have mediated that strike because
he had one eye on the past and the other eye on the future, and he
knew that the strike endangered the passion the fans have for
bygone times, and the interest they hold for days to come.
</P>
<P>
   And there can be little doubt Giamatti would have put his job on
the line had someone suggested scrubbing the Series. Listen to
this, written on the occasion of the 1981 strike, a modest
fireworks display compared to the bloody Verdun of the '94 strike:
</P>
<P>
   ``Call this baseball strike an example of deny-side economics,
which says you withhold from the consumer what he most desires so
that you may substitute discipline for satisfaction; call it a
symptom of the plague of distrust and divisiveness that afflicts
our land; call it the triumph of greed over the spirit of the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it what you will, the strike is utter foolishness. It is
an act of defiance against the American people, and the only summer
God made for 1981. . . . There is no general sympathy for either of
your sides. Nor will there be.''
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti was president of Yale when he was named National League
president, after which he ascended to the Commissioner's office. He
was a classicist in all things, and a fervent, small d democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Giamatti spent little of his life in baseball, he didn't
spend all that much time writing about it. This collection is
therefore a miscellany of pieces; here an essay for the Yale Alumni
Journal, there an op-ed piece from the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book falls under the heading of the
Elysian-fields-green-garden-of-our-lost-youth category of baseball
prose, to which I have a congenital resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But you can forgive a lot for writing like this: ``It breaks
your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in
the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in
the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon
as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti hammers home one continual theme _ that baseball is
quintessentially American in the way it simultaneously puts a
premium on the team and the individual, in the way it tells us that
no matter how far you go, the ultimate object is always the return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is counterpoint,'' he writes. ``Stability vying with
volatility, tradition with the quest for a new edge, ancient
rhythms and ever-new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   For Giamatti, baseball wasn't a metaphor for his country, it was
his country, innately pertinent to the moral and intellectual
bounty of our culture:
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all our other sports reflect the time clock, either
in their formal structure or their definition of a winner. Baseball
views time as if it were an endlessly available resource; it may
put a premium on speed . . . but it is unhurried. Time, like the
water and forests, like the land itself, is supposedly
ever-available.''
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti knew that time has a way of running out, although he
probably wasn't aware of how little he really had. This book
suggests that Giamatti would have become the poet laureate of our
beleaguered national sport.

   But the high end isn't crowing; instead, it is experiencing a
kind of existential angst, beset by demographic and economic issues
beyond its control and technological trends that threaten its very
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The best audio equipment is largely handmade, and therefore
expensive, and the high end has always been a bit of a cult with
its own language and customs, something that has scared away new
participants. What makes it special is the tireless devotion of its
practitioners to innovation and to a level of excellence that is as
much art as engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end audio may be the only electronic product whose
price has steadily risen in the past two decades, narrowing its
potential market to software millionaires and magnates of the Asian
tigers, now in eclipse, who made up as much as a third of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high end has been preaching to the converted for years and
hasn't branched out,'' said Wayne Garcia, editor-in-chief of Fi, a
three-year old magazine devoted to high-end audio. ``The
traditional two-channel music lover is either aging, burned out or
has enough gear and doesn't need to upgrade all the time, or has
other priorities,'' he said. ``At the same time, the high end
hasn't done a good job getting its message across to younger
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in the hobbyist days of what was then called hi-fidelity,
high-end audio blossomed in the late 1970s and '80s. Even as stereo
equipment became the domain of mass-market consumer-electronics
manufacturers, most of them Japanese, scores of small companies
sprang up in the United States and Europe to pursue the elusive
goal of nearly perfect sound.
</P>
<P>
   Though they remained small businesses, brands like
Conrad-Johnson, Martin-Logan and Spectral gained international
followings for their exquisite amplifiers and speakers. Spurred on
by magazines like Stereophile, The Absolute Sound and Fi, the
auteurs of audio aimed to recreate the sound of live music.
</P>
<P>
   While that goal may be forever elusive, a properly set up
high-end audio system, using only two channels, can produce a
musical experience that is startling real, a sound of a completely
different order than that offered by mass-market equipment, albeit
for a very few consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association
estimated total U.S. factory sales for the high-end audio industry
in 1997 at about $1.1 billion, out of a total market of about $75.6
billion. But the association did not differentiate between home
theater and high-end audio. Many manufacturers say they believe
that the industry is far smaller, not more than $500 million, and
even that total is spread among literally hundreds of companies.
Although sales grew in 1997, many companies have reported declines
in 1998, which they attribute primarily to the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Defining the high end is problematic. It's not just a matter of
expense because a music lover can easily spend thousands of dollars
on flashy gear that no self-respecting audiophile would condescend
to listen to. The entry point for a high-end system today is about
$10,000 for a CD player, preamplifier, amplifier, speakers and
cables, more if the system includes a turntable, tuner or tape
deck, less with savvy purchases of used equipment or with equipment
built from kits. For an all-out assault on the state of the art,
figure some multiple of six figures.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the high end's woes reflect the same kind of
changes that led to the decline of classical music radio stations.
Not so long ago, listening to a broadcast of a symphony was a
popular evening's entertainment; now most radio listening is done
in cars. Similarly, the audio hobbyist who used to spend hours
``tweaking'' his system, playing record after record, may now be
surfing the Web, even if it is to check in on rec.audio.high-end, a
Usenet newsgroup devoted to his old hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to how people spend their leisure time,'' said
Wendell Diller, president of Magnepan in White Bear Lake, Minn., a
maker of large flat-panel speakers that are much praised in
high-end circles. ``They can play with a computer, watch a movie,
but to sit and listen to music? C'mon, only the die-hard music
lovers continue to entertain themselves this way. Although the
economy is booming, I hear all my friends in the business saying,
`What's going on here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Labovitz, who manages technology transfer for the
University of California at San Francisco, has a roomful of
high-end gear, but he has not set foot in an audio store in a few
years. ``I still have all the equipment, and I listen to it all the
time, but I don't read audiophile magazines any more, and I don't
hang out at the Audible Difference,'' he said, referring to a Palo
Alto store that has outfitted many Silicon Valley luminaries.
Noting the huge cost increase for an incremental improvement in
sound, he said, ``You reach a certain level and you stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually the seeming paradox of a healthy economy and a flat
high end reflects a long-standing dichotomy in the industry, which
has only been exaggerated by three or four decades of rising
prices. Just as Porsche designs cars for race drivers but reaps
most of its revenues from the merely wealthy, so, too, the high end
may be driven by hobbyists and critics, but it survives on sales to
successful entrepreneurs and professionals whose level of interest
may not match their ability to spend. One does not need to be
obsessed to spend $100,000 on a music system, only well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the wealthy have grown less enamored of huge speakers placed
well away from walls for the best sound, racks of glowing
amplifiers and yards of garden-hose-size interconnect cables. Today
the demand is for custom installations that hide all the gear in
walls or bespoke cabinetry and, above all, for home theater.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are benefiting from this trend, devoting more of
their store space to theater systems and reaping good margins from
installation work. But the purists find it almost offensive. ``It
is the middle class, low to middle, who are fascinated with this,''
said Michael Kay, owner of Lyric Hi-Fi, Manhattan's temple to audio
excess. ``These people were never high end. They abandon the high
end for today's fad, that I can't consider really musical
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   With five speakers instead of two and an emphasis on video
projection, home theater systems attempt to make viewings
comparable to attending screenings at the best cinema, a far
different calling than recreating Carnegie Hall or the Village
Vanguard in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a huge increase in personal wealth, and one of
the ways people advertise their wealth to friends and neighbors is
putting in a big home theater,'' said Larry Archibald, publisher of
Stereophile, the leading audiophile magazine, which was acquired in
May by Petersen Cos. ``Our Guide to Home Theater is seeing big
advertising growth, and Stereophile is seeing flatness, and that is
what's happening in the stores as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While home theater is primarily the domain of big consumer
electronics companies like Sony and Pioneer, a number of high-end
manufacturers have developed products for this market. These
companies say they can apply some of the values of the high end to
home theater devices, like using the best components money can buy
and building equipment that can be updated rather than replaced as
technology improves and standards change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an opportunity,'' said John Herron, manager for
new product development at Madrigal Audio Laboratories in
Middleton, Conn., which produces the ultra-high-end Mark Levinson
line. Madrigal, a unit of Harman International, has introduced
multichannel amplifiers and a digital surround-sound decoder in its
more moderate Proceed line, with prices in the mid-to-high four
figures. Some in the high-end industry say music reproduction and
home theater are completely different goals. But Herron said the
incompatibility was ``not really the nature of the beast, it's the
nature of the presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree, on both esthetic and technical grounds. While
home theater stresses dynamic range, the ability to play very
loudly and have deep bass, to reproduce all those explosions in
``Terminator 2,'' high-end audio systems are all about high
resolution, the ability to recreate the most subtle tonal and
spatial details of a musical performance.
</P>
<P>
   High-end advocates also note that both Dolby Digital and Digital
Theater Systems, or DTS, the two technologies battling for
allegiance in home theater sound, employ compression technology
that effectively eliminates phase information. Without that
information, which delineates the precise timing of musical events,
a music system cannot reproduce a three-dimensional sound stage.
That is fine for theater systems, which rely on multiple speakers
around the room to generate a 3-D effect, but anathema to the
reproduction of live music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an absolute all-out audio system, you never want to use
compression,'' said Rick Frier, president of Spectral Inc. a maker
of high-end amplifiers, preamps and compact disk players in San
Jose, Calif. ``That has cleaved the high end and home theater
apart.'' Still, he added, the high end has to find a way to make
itself relevant in this market. ``Some can do it _ some swallow
their pride and make a stab at it _ some say, Over my dead body,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some high-end manufacturers who have introduced home
theater products have reservations about them.
</P>
<P>
   The five channels of audio used in home theater ``are going to
lead customers to spend much less per channel, and that doesn't
bode well for our part of the business,'' said Lew Johnson,
president of Conrad-Johnson, a maker of high-end amplifiers and
preamps in Fairfax, Va., that plans to offer a five-channel
amplifier in the fall. ``If you've got a $25,000 home entertainment
budget and you spend $10,000 to $15,000 on a video projection
system and spread the rest over five channels instead of two, your
budget per channel for amplifiers and speakers is very limited,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the high end may thrive again.
Johnson is part of a work group meeting to promote an advanced
audio disk based on DVD, which would take advantage of that
medium's higher data capacity to offer better sound quality than do
current CD's. But that effort comes just as CD sound, driven
largely by a technology called HDCD, for high definition compatible
digital, is finally approaching audiophile quality. HDCD,
commonplace in high-end CD players, is now beginning to appear in
mass market machines as well.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, sales of turntables have taken off this year,
mirroring a simultaneous rebirth of the vinyl LP. ``There is a
resurgence,'' said Kay, of Lyric. ``The small CD's that people buy
are convenient, but the fanatic knows better. The analog is still
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprising, The Absolute Sound, which went out of
business in March 1997 after all but coining the term high end, is
back, with a new publisher and new financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not share this gloomy vision that the high end is dead;
there's too much new and lively happening,'' said Harry Pearson,
Absolute Sound's founder and editor. ``They're confused, they're
worried about surround sound and home theater, but I think the
field is hopping.''

 &HT;    FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT UP TO SENATE
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a showdown vote looming on a constitutional
amendment to let Congress protect the American flag, senators
summoned a revered baseball manager, legal scholars, war heroes and
a TV star to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for an emotional debate on
the divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   After passionate testimony from both supporters and opponents,
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, predicted
the Senate would vote on the measure by this fall. It would let
state legislatures essentially override a 1989 Supreme Court
decision that flag desecration is a form of political speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   While detractors have argued that flag desecrations are rare and
Congress has more important matters to attend, the overflow crowd
at the hearing illustrated the intense interest of many veterans
and civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the proposed amendment sponsored by Hatch and Sen. Max
Cleland, D-Ga., a wheelchair-bound Vietnam veteran, goes to the
essence of national community and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American flag is the one symbol that unites a very diverse
people in a way nothing else can, in peace and in war,'' said
Hatch. ``Despite our differences, the American flag forms a unique,
common bond between us. Failure to protect the flag inevitably
loosens this bond, no matter how much some may claim to the
contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This country was built on more than symbols,'' countered Sen.
Russ Feingold, D-Wis. ``No laws or amendments that we can pass will
make anyone love or revere the flag, but we can and ought to
protect the principles of freedom, opportunity and democracy in the
Bill of Rights by opposing this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses reflected creative casting by leaders of both
sides. Former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda and former
``Dukes of Hazzard'' star John Schneider led the charge for flag
protection, while a disabled Green Beret veteran and a conservative
legal activist warned against infringing on the right to free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard law professor who boasted of his liberal Democratic
roots argued in favor of the amendment, as did a Medal of Honor
winner from Wisconsin, the home state of a committee opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can accuse me of opposing this proposed constitutional
amendment for political reasons,'' conceded Feingold. ``Indeed, it
may be the most politically unpopular position I could take.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates claim support from 80 percent of the populace for the
amendment, which says simply: ``The Congress shall have the power
to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed the House last year by a vote of 310-114,
more than the required two-thirds majority. The legislatures of 49
states _ more than the three-fourths needed for ratification _ have
passed resolutions calling for Congress to send them the proposed
amendment. So the fate of the issue likely rests on whether Senate
opponents can muster the margin needed to block the measure _
one-third of those voting plus one vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote is likely to be close. Hatch said the amendment
has 60 co-sponsors, but the final seven or eight votes may be hard
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are serious about protecting the American flag, it is up
to this body, at this time, to take action and send this proposed
amendment to the states,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the witnesses urged the senators to pass the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, because of the Supreme Court's decision, the flag is
just another piece of cloth that can be burned and soiled with
impunity,'' lamented Lasorda. He recalled an incident in which Rick
Monday, then the Dodger center fielder, grabbed a burning flag from
two protesters who had jumped onto the field. The crowd stood and
spontaneously sang ``God Bless America'' after Monday rescued the
flag, Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the amendment would ``somehow harm the First
Amendment'' is ``absolute, unadulterated hogwash,'' said Schneider,
an actor and singer who has recorded a song titled ``I Love Old
Glory'' that was written by Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court said that those who would defecate on the flag of
the United States _ theirs or another's _ are merely exercising
their First Amendment rights,'' said Gary Wetzel, who won the Medal
of Honor during the Vietnam War and now lives in Oak Creek, Wis.
``With decisions like this one, I sometimes wonder if our judges
have fallen out of step with the citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But other witnesses warned against ``amending the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, the flag is really just a symbol of that sacrifice
and, more importantly, our American ideals,'' said Marvin
Stenhammar, a disabled veteran of the Army Green Berets. ``This
flag amendment will place a higher value on an inanimate object, a
symbol, than on the rights of the people living under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bolick, a former intern in Hatch's office and director of
litigation for the Institute of Justice, said his former boss is
wrong on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we draw the line here?'' he asked. ``On what principle
can we punish someone who burns a flag, but not someone who burns a
cross?''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard University law professor Richard Parker, who
described himself as a lifelong Democrat whose heroes include the
late Robert Kennedy, said flag protection was allowed under the
Constitution for the 200 years before the 5-4 decision in the 1989
case of Texas v. Johnson. The amendment would restore the First
Amendment to its longstanding meaning and the ``tampering'' was
done by five justices, he testified.

NEWS WATCH: NEW KEYBOARDS FROM IBM;   SYNCING ON THE WEB;   PALM
PILOT UPDATE;   SWAPPING ON THE WEB;   MAC TYPES WANT ADSL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (mk)  
 By STEVEN E. BRIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM has made life easier for those who find it too much trouble
to click on those pesky desktop icons or move a mouse around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company has two new lines of keyboards, one with buttons
allowing ready access to popular functions and another with a
pointing device like those in the company's laptop line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rapid Access Keyboard includes four buttons to start up
favorite applications, one of which is programmed to start a Web
browser and connect to the Net. Three other programmable buttons
can be set based on a user's needs, whether opening time sheets for
an office worker or starting a child's favorite program at home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other buttons on the otherwise standard 104-key model control
audio CDs and speaker volume, put computers into a power-saving
mode and open Windows Help programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rapid Access Keyboard costs about $50 and comes in computer
beige. The company plans to release a black model soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IBM's other new line uses the latest iteration of the
Trackpoint, an eraser-head pointing device that replaces a mouse.
This keyboard, called the Trackpoint, is popular with laptop users
who like consistency and for those with limited desk space. It
costs about $110 and will be available later this month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My People, Your People: Contact Managers Go Online
</P>
<P>
   The Web is normally associated with surfing, not syncing, but
Puma Technology has teamed up with Planet All to change that. The
beneficiaries are those people who use personal information
database software, commonly known as contact manager programs.
</P>
<P>
   Planet All is a contact manager that, unlike others, is
Web-based and self-updating. That means that the user's information
is linked with that of his or her regular contacts, and users are
automatically notified of any changes in one another's contact
information.
</P>
<P>
   Puma, one of the market leaders in synchronization software, has
a new package that synchronizes a customer's existing contact
database with the Planet All database, allowing users to have
access to their contact lists from any Web browser. That allows
people to use their contact managers from borrowed computers
without having to copy a particular application and database to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Rowe, president of Puma Technology, said that synchronizing
a database to the Web and sharing selected parts of it was a good
way to keep people who talk to each other up to date. ``This uses
the Internet as a tool to stay in touch without much effort,'' Rowe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another version from Puma uses Orchestrate, a Web-based
universal in-box for faxes, e-mail and voice mail. That version
allows a user to retrieve messages from Orchestrate and respond to
them using their computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Pager to Lighten the Load
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot from 3Com has been wildly successful, capturing
more than 60 percent of the personal digital-assistant market. But
the Pilot's highly mobile adherents have needed to carry along
cellular phones and pagers to stay in touch. Now Palm Pilot people
can leave at least the pager behind with the help of Motorola, Page
Mart and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   For older Palm Pilots, Motorola has developed a memory card that
has most of the features of the new Palm III and also a pager chip.
The card, available through Page Mart, a paging and wireless
services company based in Dallas, allows Page Mart subscribers to
receive pages on a Pilot. The card is priced at $169, and the
nationwide paging service is $19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The pager software has been integrated into Pilot applications,
providing more than just paging. Incoming numeric messages will be
checked against the Pilot address book. If a phone number matches,
the corresponding entry will be opened so a user knows who sent the
page. Messages are also numbered, allowing the user to know about
out-of-sequence or missing messages. Like most pagers, the Palm
Pilot will only receive messages, but Bridget Cavanaugh, a
spokeswoman for Page Mart, said that the company was looking at
two-way options as it expanded its other services.
</P>
<P>
   To install the card, users need to remove the memory door and
memory card and insert the new card and door. Since many users put
copies of the character recognition help file on the memory door,
Page Mart will include a new copy. People taking advantage of the
vCard electronic business card and scheduling tool can also have
their schedules updated remotely. Motorola also has a software
developer's kit, so corporate developers can create and tailor
applications to their business.
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: The pager will not work with the newer Palm III, only
with older Palm units. In addition to the pager function, the card
brings two megabytes of memory and Palm OS3 to the older units.
</P>
<P>
   Users of the Pilot, of course, have a not undeserved reputation
for brandishing the unit a little too publicly. But the cachet of
older units suffered when the Palm III, with its redesigned shell,
was released. Some of that cachet may be recovered with the
pager-memory card. Ms. Cavanaugh, the Page Mart spokeswoman, said
11.6 million older Pilots were in use.
</P>
<P>
   New Barter Site on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   Auctions successfully moved from the auto lot to the Internet,
and now the barter system is going to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Ubarter.com is scheduled to start July 20, giving consumers a
chance to trade unneeded items for something they deem a bit more
important. (There were already barter sites for corporations.)
``Our guess is that people have things around the yard or business
that they don't need,'' said Steven White, president of
International Barter, Ubarter's parent company. Ubarter will take a
2 percent to 3 percent fee for helping set up the transaction.
Since it is a barter, the fee is determined by the value listed on
the item listed.
</P>
<P>
   Ubarter will have 10 categories, focusing on things like
electronics, vehicles, vacations and home furnishings as well as
several business-related groups. Users will be able to post an
item, along with its value, in a category. They also will list what
they would like in return. (``Exercise bike. Never used. $450 new.
Will trade for concave mirror or convertible.'').
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other people can look at the list and see if there is a match
for a trade. (``Sideshow sell-off. Closing House of Mirrors,
opening health club.'') Ubarter also opens up the opportunity for
cross-trading, in which a series of swaps are used to get people
the items they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an auction, the highest price gets the item,'' White said.
``With us, the right product gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will recommend that traders use an online escrow
service or a local lawyer to insure that products will be as
advertised. White expects that his company will be paid by credit
card, although in the spirit of the enterprise, ``Ubarter dollars''
are on the drawing board.

   BellSouth ADSL to Include Mac Users
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth plans to tap into the evangelism of the Apple market
as the phone company speeds up its rollout of the ADSL high-speed
Internet connection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the company, which provides local phone service in the
southeastern United States, first announced its rollout of ADSL
(asymmetric digital subscriber line) technology in May, it focused
on Windows computers. But the company then received what it called
a huge demand for the service from Macintosh devotees, something
that caught its attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working directly with Apple, we are bringing the Mac
version of BellSouth.net Fast Access ADSL service to market much
more quickly,'' said Andrew Dietz, director of product marketing
for BellSouth.net Services.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on Mac users, BellSouth hopes not only to increase
market penetration but also to promote its service to the wider
online community. ``We also are extending BellSouth's
lightning-fast capabilities to an important group of computer
users, who we believe are highly likely to have Internet access and
be evangelists for new Internet services,'' Dietz said.

   &UR; Nasturtiums &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In May, I planted Creamsicle nasturtiums (Tropaeolum majus)
from seed in a large pot on my windowsill, which faces east and
gets lots of morning sun. They came up quickly, but now I have very
few flowers and a great tangle of leaves and stems. I have cut back
the greenery, but it simply returns. How can I encourage the growth
of flowers? I fertilize with Miracle-Gro every two weeks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your nasturtiums would like to be left alone for a while,
preferably on the outside of that windowsill, to recover from all
your kindnesses. Nasturtiums like a lean life: not much fertilizer,
a porous, well-drained potting mixture like Pro-Mix BX, and plenty
of sun. Overfeed them, and they'll just grow lots of foliage. Shear
the foliage back, and they'll do their best to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, soilless mixtures like Pro-Mix contain very few
nutrients on their own, so some fertilizing is necessary. Soluble
liquid fertilizer at one-quarter to one-half strength every three
weeks is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Give them what they want and they will flower, but not until
they reach a certain size. Many nasturtium cultivars can sprawl or
mound, reaching 12 or more inches. If that is too large for your
space, try a more compact growing nasturtium, like the Tip Top
hybrids, which grow to about seven inches and hold their flowers
above the foliage for a showier display.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwindling Peaches &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year, my five-year-old peach tree produced scads of
peaches only to lose them all. I blamed the squirrels at the time.
This spring, the tree again produced scads of baby peaches, and
when I saw some of them on the ground I placed netting around the
tree. I am now left with about four or five peaches that still seem
to be growing. What is going on here? Am I lacking something, like
fertilizers? Or is this the nature of the beast? I would like a few
suggestions on how I can raise my peach production.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I hope you have apologized to the squirrels. This is the
nature of the beast, although your harvest can be improved.
</P>
<P>
   A mature tree will produce about 500 peaches from its 30,000
blossoms, a ratio of about 1 to 60. That sounds as if there is a
natural conspiracy, and there is, sort of. Fruit may fail to mature
for several reasons. If pollination isn't complete, the seed inside
may not be viable, and the fruit is aborted early.
</P>
<P>
   Win Cowgill, an agricultural agent with Rutgers Cooperative
Extension in Hunterdon County, N.J., said cloudy weather like this
spring's forces fruit trees to make a choice: use the limited
sunlight to produce more leaves for photosynthesis, or produce
fruit. Leaves win. And finally, there's the phenomenon called June
drop. For about two months after bloom begins, roughly from late
May into early July, fruit trees self-thin, dropping enough fruit
that the tree can support the rest, both nutritionally and
literally. Overloaded branches can break.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most from your tree, don't overfeed it (nitrogen
promotes foliage growth, not fruit), keep the ground below the tree
free of weeds, thin the small peaches so there is six to eight
inches between fruit, and prune every March or early April, while
the tree is still dormant. Prune a few older branches to promote
new growth, since peaches fruit on wood that is a year old. Of
course, the easiest way to increase your production is to buy more
trees. &QL;

HATCH SAYS SENATE WILL VOTE ON FLAG AMENDMENT THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that the full Senate would vote
this fall on a proposed constitutional amendment that would empower
Congress to ban flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he has 60 other Senate co-sponsors for the amendment,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. The flag
amendment needs 67 votes or two-thirds of the senators present to
pass. The Citizens Flag Alliance, a group pushing the amendment,
says it can count 64 senators for the amendment as of now.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a Republican from Utah, predicted the Senate vote would
come in September or October.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment, which would carve out an exception to
the First Amendment by giving Congress the power to enact laws
against flag desecration, has already won House approval. If it
passes the Senate, the amendment would require ratification by
three-fourths of the states. Polls indicate a majority of voters
favor the flag amendment and 49 states have passed resolutions
asking Congress to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment would overturn U.S. Supreme Court rulings in
1989 and 1990 that struck down state and federal flag desecration
laws as unconstitutional violations of freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said in an interview that the issue has personal
significance for him because he lost his older brother in World War
II, a fact that makes him empathize with veterans who want to
protect the symbol they fought for.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most prized possessions I have in my life was the
flag that draped his coffin,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also said he thinks the 310-114 House vote in favor of the
amendment in June 1997 gave the issue enough momentum to win Senate
approval this session.
</P>
<P>
   However, after a flag protection amendment passed the House in
1995 by a 312-120 vote, it fell three votes short in the Senate.
That amendment would have allowed state legislatures as well as
Congress to enact flag protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   To drum up support for the amendment, supporters enlisted Tommy
Lasorda, general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, to testify
before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He told the lawmakers
Wednesday that flag burning was an act of ``violence and
intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda recalled an incident during a 1976 baseball game at
Dodger Stadium against the Chicago Cubs in which two protesters ran
onto the field, soaked the American flag with lighter fluid and
ignited it.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rick Monday ran at the protesters, grabbed the
burning flag and fled with it into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who saw the incident then, and now, knows that the
protesters were doing something terrible, offensive and wrong,''
Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who favors the amendment, told
the hearing that ``desecrating the flag is like spitting on the
memories of these brave men and women ... who made the ultimate
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said he strongly opposes the
amendment because it would limit Americans' First Amendment right
to freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``America stands today as the leader of the free world because
it tolerates varying forms of dissent,'' Feingold told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said the United States should not align itself with
``oppressive, tyrannical'' governments like Cuba, Iran and Haiti,
which imprison people who desecrate the country's flag.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said those totalitarian countries protect their flags
out of fear ``that their citizens will gain free speech rights and
stand up in opposition to their oppressive regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a coalition of civic, fraternal and
veterans groups, says there have been 20 acts of physical
desecration against the American flag in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill, a foe of the flag amendment, said
the nation has seen an increase in flag burning because Congress
keeps talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By engaging in this discussion, we encourage copycats,''
Durbin said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If summer is the season for celebrating simple things, ``A Hut
of One's Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture'' (M.I.T.
Press), by Ann Cline, is well timed. Its small subject _ the hut _
defines the field of architecture like a cricket in the grass. It
makes a song of the air around it.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-built and homemade, usually wooden, scraped together from
pieces of scrap or engineered with standard lumber, the hut is
barely design. It is as ordinary as a structure can be. But the hut
has an extraordinary gift.
</P>
<P>
   From Tang dynasty Chinese poets' pavilions secluded in the
mountains to present-day Puerto Rican casitas sunning themselves in
the Bronx, the hut is a shelter for the imagination. Marie
Antoinette had her hameau of huts. George Bernard Shaw wrote in a
shack at the foot of his garden. Seated outside civilization, the
hut, like Shaw, has had a good view of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston Bachelard, in his 1969 book, ``The Poetics of Space,''
called the dream of life in a hut ``the taproot of inhabiting.''
Nothing goes straighter to the source of the delight that springs
from dwelling. Second homes take a stab at it. There are now an
estimated five million in the United States _ indication enough
that informality is looking for a frontier upon which to reinvent
the house itself. Recreation homes reintroduce the necessary
connection between people and the rudiments of place. But huts
recreate the echo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cline, a professor of architecture at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, is one of many calling for a return to first
principles to re-engage her profession with its public. The
architects Frank Gehry and Cesar Pelli are among those who agree
that a study of basic structures could inform richer human sympathy
in the design of houses. Though Ms. Cline is not advocating life in
huts, they hold the power of illustration for a new generation of
architects and their audience.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to be talked into the satisfactions of the hut. It is
architecture's inner child. Many people who wouldn't know or
couldn't care where a design began or ended have built a fort from
a box, or put a house in a tree, created a workshop in a garage or
covered a porch to make a room. As the subtitle of Ms. Cline's book
makes clear, life goes on outside architecture's charmed circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cline likes huts, as a kind of quick example of what a
building can do, and of what can be done with a building. She has
built two herself, with off-the-shelf materials from a suburban Ace
hardware store and the help of a hired laborer. They stand in the
yard outside her Civil War-era house in Oxford. She plotted them
out as she put them up. Ms. Cline uses the smaller of the two,
which lives like an owl in a tree at the back of her property, as a
teahouse. The larger hut is an exhibition space for a rotating
collection of favorite objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my way of tiptoeing out of architecture,'' she said
recently, serving mugs of coffee and local strawberries in the
gallery of the large hut, built in 1995. A morning rain hit the
plywood roof three feet above like fingers lightly drumming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much,'' she explained. ``If you have a corner
somewhere that's visually private, that corner could be developed
with one of these huts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cline maintains that huts have much to teach. As pieces of
pure construction, they translate the natural world into sensory
experience. It is a different kind of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be in a wilderness,'' she said, pausing to let the
pattering above make its presence heard in the acoustically close
space. ``Because you really can't tell. It's the rain on the roof
that's the signal. When you go inside a house, you don't have
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If houses are interventions in the landscape, huts are
interpreters. They are like musical instruments or box cameras. A
window goes up and the outside comes in, like wind entering a
flute. A door opens and the inside walks out. One sees by the light
of its picture.
</P>
<P>
   Though her interest in huts is something of a hermit's pose, Ms.
Cline, 56, is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much in the air in schools,'' said Jaan Holt,
director of the Washington-Alexandria Architecture Consortium at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Alexandria, Va., which invites
architectural professors and students from Europe and Asia to work
together. ``There is a desire to have an architecture based on
materiality and discreet experience. I think it's a hunger for
architecture that's not programmatic _ that a building can exist
because one finds one's way into it, like a forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Frampton, a professor of architecture at Columbia
University, concurred that there is an interest in ``grounding the
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduction of architecture to imagery and style has
consumed architectural practice and discourse for two decades,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To Frank Gehry, one-room structures have been the sparks that
ignite inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you strip a building down to its essence,'' he said,
``you're left with what it actually is: a shelter. A room that
engenders emotion. I think a lot of architecture hides behind
functionality and technology _ as architects, we have tremendous
excuses and denial mechanisms to make something special. How to get
around that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry recalled watching friends who were artists begin to paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you make the first mark? The one-room building _ the
hut, if you like _ is the closest you get in architecture to that
moment of truth. I think it's powerful _ I would urge young
architects to play with that. It gets you to the point a lot
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cadwell, a professor of architecture at Ohio State
University, used the idea of hutlike construction as the kind of
sketching exercise an artist might employ. In the 1980s, Cadwell
built four structures based on the seasons, which he called ``a
pastoral quartet'' in a pamphlet, ``Small Buildings,'' published by
Princeton Architectural Press in 1996. Sited in open country at a
colleague's vacation home in Vermont, they are essays on
insideness. ``Drum-Barge,'' the summer building, floats on a lake.
One enters it by diving below it and hoisting oneself by rope
through its chamber to an observation deck at the top. The scene
drifts with the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Though a fascination to architecture, the hut remains outside
its circle. It belongs to lay builders, a bit of fire that the gods
would wish to steal. As well as a sensual life and a life of the
mind, it has its association with the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction of huts is associated with metaphysical
thought,'' said Cesar Pelli, who teaches architecture at Yale
University, speaking of nomadic structures like the black tents
built by Middle Eastern and North African cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are low-slung huts, built by women,'' he said. ``Air
passes through the skins of the walls, but not water.''
</P>
<P>
   When teaching, Pelli began lectures with huts. ``They are
dwellings in the most important metaphysical sense,'' he said.
``They carry with them the center of the cosmos. Once established,
they connect you with the earth, but put you at the center. It is
the world around that changes.''
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, the hut has taken one of its most remarkable
stands in New York. In the last 10 years, it has created an
architecture of exile for immigrants, in particular Puerto Ricans,
who have built casitas on vacant lots throughout the city, as
public meeting places within community gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Casitas are based on the ``casita de madera,'' or ``little
wooden house,'' that appears in the vernacular architecture of the
Taino Indians in Puerto Rico. For immigrants in New York, the
casitas are emblems of home, if home is how you hug the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are powerful memories, '' said Daniel Winterbottom, a
landscape architect who has been documenting New York's casitas for
four years with photographer Ejlat Feuer. ``They were summer
residences that were reminiscent of the Jibaro _ real but mythic
figures in Puerto Rico who made a life of their own in the
mountains. This myth of independence is what you see represented in
the casitas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Museo del Barrio in New York is organizing a show on casitas
in November, based on the work of Winterbottom and Feuer. Feuer
estimated that there are 500 casitas in New York, concentrated on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan and in the Melrose section of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``These casitas are a metaphor for the old land,'' Winterbottom
said, ``but they are also a cultural healing: by creating a new
place, of respect and dignity, they are a declaration of control.
They have pretty tough neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Milagros Rodriguez stood on the porch of a casita
that she and Enrique Diaz initiated and preside over on Manhattan's
Lower East Side, at Fourth Street between Avenues C and D.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is a celebration,'' she said. Friends walked in and
walked out. A family played cards beneath a tree. The red and white
hut was built on in 1992 by Diaz from abandoned lumber he hauled
there in his pickup truck. A kitchen and veranda were added last
year. ``The good thing about it, everybody pitches in,'' Ms.
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Built and furnished with donations, the casita has a latrine
behind it and an outdoor shower. Inside, there are a Persian-style
rug on the floor, paintings on the walls, two chairs in plastic
slipcovers and a sofa, a brass coffee table and a veneered
Blaupunkt stereo console from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Because they sit on vacant lots, which are subject to
development, the casitas teach another lesson that one learns well
from huts. Many that have been built are gone; more are sure to go.
Ms. Rodriguez and Diaz's casita is built on a lot that is privately
owned. No one in the neighborhood who uses the casita knows whom
the lot belongs to. The house and its garden are living on prayers
for borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Bohio'' on South Second Street in the Williamsburg section
of Brooklyn, a garden with a casita and a wooden hut, or ``bohio,''
organized and built by Harry LeBlon and his community, has not been
as lucky. City-owned, the lot is being developed in three months as
a day care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where will it all go?'' asked LeBlon, pointing to the open
hut, whose roof is strung with artifacts of Puerto Rico, and a pine
tree, now 20 feet tall, that grew from a sapling on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Life, like huts, is temporary. That isn't stopping Ms.
Rodriguez, who has started over once before. She looked through the
front door of her casita.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is a beach,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to transfer important files from my old Mac to my
new PC. What are my options?
</P>
<P>
   A. Incompatible floppy-disk formats have kept Mac and PC users
from freely transferring information on disks, but times have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are several programs available, like Dataviz's Mac Opener
and Pacific Micro's Mac-in-DOS, that will let your PC read a Mac
disk. And Apple Computer began including its PC Exchange software
in its operating system years ago to allow Mac users to read a
PC-formatted disk if you ever need to go the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Word-processing programs used in both worlds, like Microsoft
Word, can often open files on either platform with minimal
difficulty. If you don't have one of those programs but the files
you want to transfer are word-processing documents, you can open
them in your Mac's word-processing program and save them as ``plain
text'' files onto a floppy. Most word-processing programs on any
computer platform can open one of these basic text files, although
any special formatting or type styling will be stripped out. Move
the floppy to the PC and open (and save) your files with the PC's
word-processing programs. Or if you have Internet access on both
machines, try e-mailing text files to the new computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have graphics files, spreadsheets, databases or specially
formatted documents like manuscripts, you can buy file-translation
software, like Dataviz's Conversions Plus for Windows, that will
convert them in their Mac applications to the nearest PC
equivalent.

<P>
   While the creator of ``Star Wars,'' George Lucas, has been
toiling on a new megamillion-dollar installment of the science
fiction saga, a weekend filmmaker with a home video camera, a
personal computer and some well-placed friends is discovering fame
and opportunity with a $1,500 vision of the ``Star Wars'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, Kevin Rubio, said he had been inspired to create
``Troops'' by last year's special edition release of the ``Star
Wars'' trilogy. Rubio, 30, a cartoon animation worker in Los
Angeles, took six months to write the script and complete his
10-minute movie, which has lots of ``Star Wars'' technology and
dazzling special effects. It also offers what Rubio describes as a
comical, sympathetic take on the faceless, bad-guy minions of
``Star Wars,'' the imperial storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troops'' has become immensely popular this year as an
underground film distributed at no cost on the Internet
 &UR; (www.TheForce.net) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Rubio said the film, which he also directed and co-produced, was
less a ``Star Wars'' pretender than a parody recast in the guise of
an episode of the syndicated television show ``Cops,'' which
follows real police officers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just guys with jobs and happen to be on the Empire's
side,'' Rubio said of his storm troopers, whose head-to-toe body
armor uniforms, a dead-on imitation of the real ones, help give the
production a striking aura of authenticity. His troopers also
deliver their darkly comedic lines in a quirky ``Fargo'' accent as
they trudge and rocket over a barren, desert planet (a dry lake bed
in Southern California).
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, storm troopers gun down desert-scavenging Jawas
when they try to flee. A trooper says dryly, ``Well, what we had
here was that these Jawas had stolen some imperial property and it
unfortunately turned violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the film's popularity and near-cult following, Rubio
said, he is now shopping around ideas for feature film projects,
has a development deal with MTV and is represented by the William
Morris Agency _ though he hasn't quit his day job.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention that Rubio is receiving does not surprise
Chris Gore, publisher of Film Threat Weekly, a magazine that covers
underground filmmaking and that picked ``Troops'' as the best
underground film of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was especially impressed with the movie's special
effects and their implications for the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this film means is that basically anyone with a home
computer can do the same kinds of fantastic special effects we see
at the movie theaters,'' he said, though he said it also took
talent like Rubio's to use the technology artistically.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects _ including sand-skimming speeders and
low-flying imperial attack ships _ were created in three days by
Shant Jordan, 30, and Patrick Perez, 29. Both work for Netter
Digital Entertainment of North Hollywood, Calif., where they
supervise the making of special effects for the television space
series ``Babylon 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Perez, co-producers of ``Troops,'' said they used
off-the-shelf software, Lightwave 3-D, and a 600-megahertz Digital
Equipment Corporation computer to crank out the effects shortly
before the film's debut last July at the San Diego Comic Con
International. ``It was pretty scary,'' Perez said with a chuckle,
``but we wanted to have a crack at it.''

ONLINE MEDICAL DATA CHANGES DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One Sunday afternoon last March, 9-year-old Robert Lord fell
from a rope ladder in his backyard in San Diego. His neck snapped.
As he lay unable to move, he told his little sister to run for
help.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a doctor told Robert's parents that the injury was
so severe that there was a strong possibility that their son would
not regain the use of his body below his arms. Desperate, Robert's
father, Stephen, said he called a researcher he knew at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and got the advice, `` `Look on the Web
_ that's your best chance.''' Lord logged onto the World Wide Web
and typed the words ``spinal cord injury'' into a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours, Lord came upon a report about an
experimental drug, GM-1 ganglioside. When given within 72 hours of
a spinal cord injury, the drug seemed to improve the chances of
recovery, the report said. Lord told his son's doctor immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It was 78 hours after the accident when the boy took the drug.
On the following day, he could move his arms, and on the day after
that, feeling began to return to his legs. Eleven weeks after the
accident, he left the hospital, using a walker, a result that could
be part of the boy's normal recovery or could be linked to the
drug. The Lords will never know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lord family's experience was unusual, patients have
been finding ways to be better-informed and have been acting as
their own best advocates for some time. AIDS and breast cancer
patients have helped publicize research issues concerning those two
diseases, and managed care has forced health care consumers to take
medical matters into their own hands as never before.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer quantity of information available on the Internet
_ more than 10,000 sites with information from experts, amateurs
and quacks on diseases ranging from common complaints to the more
unusual, like Lou Gehrig's disease _ combined with instant
accessibility is bringing about an unparalleled shift in the way
doctors and patients interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a highly involved patient was possible before, but only
for the most dedicated, committed people,'' said Dr. Tom Ferguson,
editor and publisher of The Ferguson Report, a newsletter about
online health information based in Austin, Texas. ``Now all the
information is available to anyone with an Internet connection.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the Internet elevates a doctor-patient relationship
into a partnership and even saves lives. At its worst, information
found online is misleading or inaccurate. Reliance on the Net can
waste a doctor's time, dash a patient's hopes and put a life in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's good information on the Internet, but there's
got to be an increase in people's skepticism because it's so easily
retrievable,'' said Dr. John Renner, a family doctor in
Independence, Mo., who is president of the National Council for
Reliable Health Information, a nonprofit watchdog group. ``People
turn off their reality checkers because they desperately want to
find something that will help them be young forever or be healthier
or better-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Robert Lord's case included not only useful
information but also a positive combination of people,
circumstances and good luck. The boy's father was able to work as a
team with the boy's pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Hal Meltzer, who
sent faxes to the Food and Drug Administration to ask permission to
use the drug on a ``compassionate use'' basis. Stephen Lord
grappled with the logistics of transporting the medicine to San
Diego from the pharmaceutical company's office in Washington. As
soon as the package arrived at the airport, Lord was in his car
rushing it to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While such cases are not common, more people than ever are
turning to the Internet for health advice. According to a recent
survey conducted jointly by the Institute for the Future in Menlo
Park, Calif., and Princeton Survey Research Associates, nearly
two-thirds of the people who use the Web seek medical information
and referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors generally say they welcome a more educated patient. Dr.
Michael Tedford, an ear, nose and throat specialist in Minneapolis,
said he first became aware of the volume of information his
patients were able to find online when someone came to him three
years ago for a second opinion on an unusual ear condition. Not
only had the patient used the Internet to investigate his problem,
but he was also able to discuss it in minute detail. ``My job was a
piece of cake,'' Tedford said. ``All I had to do was sit there and
nod.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedford said he had welcomed the level of knowledge the patient
possessed. ``It moved us more quickly through the most
time-consuming part of my job, which is patient education,''
Tedford said. ``Then I could talk about his options for treatment,
with his values and priorities guiding his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Teitel, a professor of pediatrics and chief of
pediatric cardiology at the University of California at San
Francisco, agreed. ``It's a phenomenally powerful thing when you're
not just sitting down and drawing pictures about the plumbing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who has worked extensively in the area of online
health information and its effect on the doctor-patient
relationship, said that while a doctor must be familiar with
hundreds of different diseases and conditions, a patient becomes a
specialist in one condition _ his or her own _ and its effect on
daily life. ``Sometimes your patients think they know more than
they do, but sometimes they know more than you do,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Robert Lord, a situation in which the
openness of the doctor played a crucial role. Meltzer said that
although he had been aware of the ganglioside experiment, it wasn't
until the boy's father presented him with greater detail and a
strong desire to try it that he had seriously considered it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, no one person can know every single medication, every
trial and all that's on the Internet,'' Meltzer said. ``Here we
have a situation where a child is very severely injured and you'd
like to do anything you can to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since dangerous side effects did not appear to be a risk, the
question was whether the drug worked. ``If the family was willing
to accept the risk, and the government was willing to provide the
medication, then I said, Let's go for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still more unusual was the way Stephen Lord found out about the
drug. In his all-night search of the Net, after hours of clicking
on reports with bleak scenarios, Lord found a report about the
ganglioside drug in a paper written by a high-school senior for her
English class. Only the Internet would have produced such a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is part of the information age,'' Lord said.
``The connections aren't logical any more in any real sense. It's
not a matter of calling some medical data bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer cautioned that it was impossible to know whether Robert
had regained his mobility because of the experimental drug he was
given, the surgery he had to help speed his healing, the standard
medication he had taken or a combination of the three. Or the boy
might have recovered on his own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The more collaborative approach to medicine stands on its head
the tradition in which a doctor gives orders and the patient obeys.
And that makes some doctors nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for physicians because once you get the education
out of the way, you can get to more depth of humanity, and a lot of
physicians have never had discussions like that before,'' said Dr.
Richard Rockefeller, president of the Health Commons Institute, a
nonprofit organization in Falmouth, Maine, that promotes the use of
computerized information tools in clinical settings.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors warn against relying too heavily on information
found on the Internet, as it can be difficult to distinguish
between amateur medicine, even chicanery, and valuable data.
According to another Institute for the Future survey, this one a
poll of doctors done with Louis Harris &AMP; Associates, 67 percent of
those surveyed said that patients came in with information they had
found on the Internet but that only 12 percent referred patients to
the Internet for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding information their doctors may not have
seen, and sometimes it is welcomed and sometimes it is not,'' said
Dr. Jerome Kassirer, chief editor of The New England Journal of
Medicine. ``The issue is the validity of the information.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger in turning to the Internet as a virtual
Lourdes, particularly when it comes to life-threatening illnesses.
The explosion of interest in alternative medicine and holistic
approaches to health has brought with it plenty of Web sites
promoting nutrition, vitamins and herbs to remedy everything from
chronic fatigue to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to diagnose diseases oneself also worries
doctors. Dr. Laurel Warner, an infectious-diseases specialist in
Santa Rosa, Calif., said a patient who had been looking up his
symptoms on the Internet had shown up convinced that he had Lyme
disease.
</P>
<P>
   After examining him, Warner said, she doubted that he had the
disease, but he insisted on blood tests anyway. When the test
results were negative, she added, he remained unconvinced and told
her that according to what he had found on the Internet, false
negatives when testing for Lyme disease were common. It wasn't
until his symptoms eventually disappeared on their own that he
finally believed her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said she grew still more frustrated when people came to
her with information about, say, an experimental drug. ``Someone
comes in with information about a new drug for Parkinson's or
Alzheimer's, and it's very sad because you really have to sit
people down and burst their balloons a little bit,'' Warner said.
``At the same time, you don't want to discourage the dissemination
of information. I just wish there were a better way to filter the
informatio.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitel, of the University of California, agreed. ``I spend a
fair amount of my time saying, `Well, that's very interesting, but
it was a test done on pigs, not humans.' People take everything off
the Net as gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Separating gospel from prayer has become something of a
specialty for Hamilton Jordan, White House chief of staff in the
Carter administration. Jordan, 53, has educated himself on and off
the Internet through three different bouts with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he was now free of the disease and had turned to
helping others with cancer. When Gayle Reinsch, the employee of a
friend of Jordan's, turned to him in early 1997 after she was found
to have small-cell lung cancer, an especially virulent cancer,
Jordan went to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   His search quickly turned up an experimental vaccine program at
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and he told
Ms. Reinsch about it. Her doctors at the cancer center where she
was being treated were not enthusiastic. But Ms. Reinsch, 50,
stopped being passive and spoke her mind to her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `You have a reputation for being Midwestern,
middle-of-the-road and conservative. Well, I don't want that,'''
she recalled. She enrolled in the Sloan-Kettering program. Eighteen
months after the diagnosis, Ms. Reinsch's cancer remains in
remission. ``Information may not save us all, but it will give more
of us a chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the Internet had played an important role in his
willingness to help a stranger. The search took him 10 minutes.
``If I'd had to get in the car and drive to a university library,
left to my own devices, I'm not sure I would have done it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, still a distinct minority, are going well beyond
simply welcoming their patients' input. More doctors and nurses are
logging on as moderators of, or participants in, online health
discussions and chat groups. Some are using their visits to such
groups to overcome one of the age-old problems of doctor-patient
relationships: patients who withhold information because they
consider it unimportant to the doctor or fear that they are taking
up too much time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mangiardi, chief of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital
in New York, said he had had no inkling that his patients were so
upset about unsightly incision scars until a few years ago, when he
began logging onto discussion groups and heard patients complain
among themselves. Since then, he has tried to keep incisions less
noticeable, even making them behind patients' eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carvel Gipson, a headache specialist in Tampa, Fla., has
been the host of a headache forum on Compuserve for three years.
``It has been as useful for me as it could possibly have been for
the patients,'' he said. It was a revelation to him, for instance,
that patients were so concerned about suffering from a condition
that is so easily dismissed. ``They're as interested in finding
someone who will take them seriously as they are in getting
complete relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More doctors and nurses are communicating directly with patients
through e-mail. ``It creates greater intimacy in a bounded
relationship,'' said Dr. Beverley Kane, chairwoman-elect of the
American Medical Informatics Association Internet Working Group,
who has helped establish the association's guidelines for such
e-mail. ``But the main problem is that it adds uncompensated time
to the doctor's day, and it's hard to know whether it requires more
time than it saves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you just found out that you have diabetes or high blood
pressure, or someone in the family has asthma or cancer, and you
need to learn about it. Search engines provide thousands of hits
for a word like asthma with no evaluation of the information. Where
can you turn?
</P>
<P>
   For people who want basic information from sources deemed
reliable by the government medical establishment,
www.healthfinder.gov is a good way to start. The site, created by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, lets users search
by subject and provides links to information from government health
agencies, public health and professional groups, universities,
support groups, medical journals and some news sites. The
Healthfinder site also gives information about enrolling in
clinical trials for cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Healthfinder covers an impressive array of topics, including
common illnesses and some uncommon ones like leprosy, the Ebola
virus and mercury poisoning. But the search engine can be stumped:
it produced nothing in response to queries about pinworms,
tapeworms, hookworms, common asthma medications, swimmer's ear or
popular supplements like echinacea and ginkgo biloba. ``Bee sting''
and ``St. John's wort'' led nowhere, but ``sting'' and ``wort'' got
results.
</P>
<P>
   Another searchable site, Medscape (www.medscape.com), answered
all the queries that Healthfinder did not. Medscape, which carries
advertising, offers access to journals, news and other links
relating to medical specialties and drugs. It has a medical
dictionary and a link to Medline, the medical database at the
National Library of Medicine. Med-scape offers technical material
for doctors and a special section geared to lay people, but it does
not bar ordinary folks from the technical information.
</P>
<P>
   For people who want to search medical journals, two of the
best-known offer nonsubscribers limited access to their contents on
the Web. The New England Journal of Medicine (www.nejm.com) and the
Journal of the American Medical Association (www.ama-assn.org) post
abstracts of their research papers. The New England Journal also
posts complete versions of some material, like letters, editorials
and book reviews, but charges nonsubscribers $10 for the full text
of an article.
</P>
<P>
   Another general medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine,
posts the full text of current and past articles
(www.acponline.org/journals/annals/annaltoc.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Ferguson, who publishes a newsletter about online health
information called the Ferguson Report, said the real value of the
Internet emerged when people got beyond the generic information
found on most sites and started to talk to one another via support
groups, chat rooms, news groups and mailing lists. People with the
same illness can compare notes about treatment and sometimes
consult doctors who join online groups. ``That's where things are
headed,'' Ferguson said. Many such groups, he said, ``contain a
high proportion of health professionals interested in that topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's site (www.healthy. net/selfcare) helps guide people
to self-help groups and other sources of information. To find
online groups, the doctor also recommends www.dejanews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ferguson's own site includes his e-mail address, he
said he did not practice medicine and cannot answer personal
medical questions. An alternative-medicine advocate, Dr. Andrew
Weil (www.drweil.com), does answer some e-mail questions. At the
other extreme is www.quackwatch.com, run by Dr. Stephen Barrett, a
longtime scourge of alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The site www.childrenwithdiabetes. com, created by the parents
of a diabetic daughter, has a volunteer staff of 16 doctors, nurses
and other health professionals who answer medical questions.

 &HT;    TROUBLES BEHIND THE LINES IN THE DRUG WAR
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton heads to Atlanta to launch a
$2 billion antidrug advertising campaign Thursday, new government
studies point to mismanagement and stalemate on other fronts of the
nation's long-running war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Three reports issued in recent weeks by the U.S. General
Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, cite
intelligence teams that don't communicate, drug-intervention ships
that can't sail, planes with the wrong gear, and corruption within
police ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The government runs a drug intelligence-gathering effort that
is spread among 1,400 workers in more than 20 organizations, most
of which operate independently of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found it was difficult even to determine which agencies
are involved in gathering drug intelligence. It estimated the total
cost of the effort at $298 million, not counting efforts by the
Central Intelligence Agency, whose budget details are kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The report underscores complaints by some critics, including
budget expert Scott Hodge, who wrote in a study for the
conservative Heritage Foundation that the dispersed
intelligence-gathering centers are ``among the most blatant
examples of government waste and mismanagement,'' especially since
much of the information is considered secret and not shared with
fellow agencies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recent U.S. attempts to bolster Mexico's drug-fighting
capacity have been a near-comedy of logistical disasters, even as
the drug-smuggling cartels in Mexico have grown stronger and the
flow of drugs into the United States has continued unabated.
Although the Defense Department provided tens of millions of
dollars in equipment to Mexico, much of it has been of little use,
the GAO said in a report issued in late June.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon sent 73 UH-1H helicopters for
counter-narcotics missions. However, these aircraft do not operate
well at altitudes above 5,000 feet, where most drug activities,
including cultivation of opium poppy, occur in Mexico. Also, spare
parts were in short supply, so that many of helicopters have been
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also gave Mexico four C-26 airplanes that were
intended for surveillance missions, but they arrived in the fall of
1997 with no surveillance equipment. The GAO investigation found
that as of this June, the Mexican Air Force had not used the planes
for any purpose and had no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a third instance, the Mexican Navy purchased two surplus U.S.
frigates and then discovered they were not operational. As of this
spring, it was unclear when the ships will be repaired and ready
for service. Even so, the U.S. Navy has already provided about $1.3
million worth of training to about 110 Mexican Navy personnel to
sail the ships.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the results of stepped-up U.S. aid and joint
U.S.-Mexico commitments dating to 1996, the GAO cited evidence that
``the amount of drugs flowing into the United States from Mexico
remains essentially unchanged, and no major drug-trafficking
organization has been dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drug corruption within police departments of American cities
is widespread and kept hidden by the ``code of silence'' among
police officers. In a survey of experts, studies, and police
officers, the government investigators found that no data are kept
on the overall extent of the problem nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the lack of systematic data, the
(anti-corruption) commissions and some academic experts described
cases of drug-related police corruption in large cities such as
Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New
Orleans, New York, and Philadelphia,'' said a GAO report released
in May.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that drug-related police corruption is
especially serious because in addition to protecting criminals,
these officers ``were more likely to be actively involved in the
commission of a variety of crimes, including stealing drugs and/or
money from drug dealers, selling drugs, and lying under oath about
illegal searches.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed solutions: stressing integrity as a top
priority in the department, changing the police culture, and
raising the age and educational requirements for recruits.

 &HT;    SENATE AIRS DIGITAL TV WOES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first high-definition telecasts are only months
away, but the problems posed for consumers, broadcasters, cable
operators and programmers by the new technology are as razor-sharp
as the images that will soon go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has ordered the industry to relinquish its current VHF
and UHF channels by 2006, the date when nearly all Americans will
supposedly be watching sets equipped for digital television (DTV).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to put their feet to the fire in keeping that
commitment,'' Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., said Wednesday after holding a hearing on a host of
unresolved DTV issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``But frankly,'' McCain added, ``meeting that deadline was a
joke from the very beginning. We wrote that law because the auction
(of the current TV channels) was supposed to bring in $20 billion
and balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the imminent promise of much higher quality wide-screen
images and sound resulting from the first basic change in U.S.
television standards in 60 years, McCain often focused on the dark
side of the picture. He put skeptical questions to a panel of
industry witnesses who, often as not, found themselves at odds with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cable subscribers face the possibility of losing valued
channels of cable programming as the price of their systems' having
to accommodate all their local broadcasters' new digital
channels,'' the senator noted.
</P>
<P>
   Full-scale DTV transmissions will require cable outlets to use
at least double the number of current channels to accommodate the
same amount of programming.
</P>
<P>
   New TV sets arriving in the stores before Christmas can handle
all 18 DTV formats approved by the Federal Communications
Commission. But if station owners decide to ``multiplex'' their
signals, adopting a lower-definition format, as many as eight cable
channels may be required for each one that is in use today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to get squeezed out,'' McCain predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That was the prime concern of Brain Lamb, C-SPAN's founder,
chairman and frequent on-air host, who saw the coming conversion to
DTV as ``a large train wreck in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If 'must carry' status is granted to (local) digital broadcast
signals, the C-SPAN networks, and, most important, the American
people who watch the Senate and the House on television, will be
harmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Murphy Burns, who heads a family-owned
broadcasting firm with four stations in Washington state and
Wisconsin, claimed an industry smashup would occur if the FCC fails
to adopt ``must carry'' rules.
</P>
<P>
   If initial buyers of DTV sets ``cannot get their local DTV
stations over cable, and if they lack assurance that expensive DTV
sets will operate with their cable systems and other digital
devices, the transition to DTV will falter and ultimately fail no
matter how many signals we put on the air or how we program them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first DTV sets will go on sale in November and cost about
$7,000, said Alan McCollough, president of Circuit City Stores, a
major electronic retailer.
</P>
<P>
   McCollough said that ``what will entice our customers is a
dramatic breakthrough in picture performance'' for the new
wide-screen format.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, noted that
the 18 approved DTV formats offer a range of improved picture
quality. While all are sharper than today's pictures, some formats
sacrifice a degree of picture quality in exchange for the ability
to transmit other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers cannot notice the difference between competing
formats, using the most efficient format will best serve consumer
interests,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the fuzzy scene for the broadcasters, Gregory Schmidt
of Lin Television Corp. said: ``We are full speed ahead towards
DTV, although cable carriage is uncertain at best and consumers'
buying DTV sets will be frustrated by uncertainty about these sets
working with cable and about reception of DTV signals, both via
cable and over the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a potential consumer voiced his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to run out and buy one of these sets,'' Sen.
Conrad Burns, R-Mont., told the panelists. ``I don't have enough
money. I think I'll wait until you make a set that Joe Six-Pack can
afford.''

RETIRED RV'ERS RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNRISE, TO KEEP THE SUNSET AT
BAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT W. STOCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ For years, whenever vacation time rolled
around, LaVere and Ginny Keller would roll out of Salt Lake City in
their camper truck and explore the West. ``It was pretty tight
quarters, especially when our three daughters were with us,''
Keller recalled. ``But we loved it. We'd get home, and we'd say,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could just keep going?'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, both at age 59, they did just that. The Kellers
retired, sold their house, bought a trailer and a truck to tow it,
and took to the road full time. At Rainbow's End, a camp for up to
400 recreational vehicles here in the piney woods of East Texas,
they joyously described the changes in their lives _ the 17 states
they have toured, the new friends they have made at RV camps along
the way and most of all, the new freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 years of working and raising a family, we get to go
wherever we want, do whatever we want,'' Mrs. Keller said. ``I
still feel it's like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kellers are not alone on the road. Some 8.6 million families
in the United States own recreational vehicles, most dedicated to
occasional family trips or annual winter flights to the Sun Belt.
The Recreational Vehicle Industry Association says that more than a
million of those families are ``full-timers,'' houseless nomads
like the Kellers, who set out on their greatest adventure at an age
when most people traditionally are looking forward to a rocking
chair. Experts say their ranks are growing, with baby boomers
taking early retirement and an older generation holding higher
expectations and an energy level to match.
</P>
<P>
   Full-timers typically traverse a bittersweet life cycle. They
start out as nonstop sightseers in a motor home or pulling a big
trailer. Sooner or later, aches and pains make driving difficult;
they trade down to a smaller rig and spend more time at favorite
camper sites. Eventually, they and their rig reach full rest in one
of those camps _ or in a driveway, connected by electric and water
life-support lines to the house of a son or daughter. Some sell
their rigs and enter nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But now, when it comes time for them to hang up their keys, as
they put it, some full-timers have a new option. At Rainbow's End,
the site of the national headquarters of a recreational vehicle
club called the Escapees, ailing members can get the help they need
while remaining in their motor homes and continuing the RV life.
The program is called CARE, for Continuing Assistance for Retired
Escapees, and those in this peripatetic world say it is the first
of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, life in a recreational vehicle is not for everyone.
Even in a luxurious, $180,000, 36-foot-long motor home, as my wife
and I discovered during a four-night stay, privacy is nonexistent _
you can't get out of each other's way _ and claustrophobia is high.
Every experienced full-timer has a story to tell about a couple
whose marriage broke up after six months of nonstop intimacy.
Wives, in particular, complain about the shortage of space _ for
clothing, for family heirlooms, for the paintings and furniture
that helped give structure and warmth to their old stationary
homes. But most of all, they miss their children and grandchildren.
The occasional letter, phone call or once-a-year visit turns out
not to be enough for some full-timers, who either quit the life or
markedly cut back their road time.
</P>
<P>
   Family weighs on the minds of Barton and Martha Anderson. In
February 1996, a week after the last of their three daughters
married, the couple _ he was 70; she, 68 _ set out from southern
Connecticut as full-timers. They have traveled 29,000 miles since,
and they have no intention of stopping. But they do miss their
grandchildren. ``Martha wants to spend the summer back in
Connecticut,'' he said. ``I want to go for a few weeks.'' He
shrugged and added, ``We'll probably stay the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-timers have their own special customs and ethos, including
nonstop sociability and an eager readiness to help a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings, the lawn chairs go out under the vehicle
awnings, the dog walkers parade and everybody gets acquainted. Some
full-timers go sightseeing. Some attend camp classes in crafts or
line dancing or count their laps in the swimming pool. Others
putter, repairing or polishing their rigs or reading maps or
history books for the next leg of their journey. After an early
supper in the rig, or an occasional campwide potluck dinner, there
is more strolling and chatting. By day's end, new friendships have
been formed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having given up their old communities, these nomads consciously
set about creating new ones based on their identity as full-timers,
say David R. and Dorothy A. Counts, a Canadian husband-and-wife
team of anthropologists who wrote ``Over the Next Hill: An
Ethnography of RVing Seniors in North America'' (Broadview Press,
1996). The full-timers join together in clubs, design their
itineraries around meetings of club chapters and seek each other
out at campsites. Friendships develop rapidly, because full-timers
know they will be moving on.
</P>
<P>
   For LaVere Keller, that took some getting used to. ``You meet
wonderful people, you get so close and then they leave and you know
you may never see them again,'' he said. ``I'm a real sentimental
kind of person. I still cry when they leave, but I've learned to
let go.''
</P>
<P>
   For many full-timers who must retire from the road, the prospect
of losing their adopted community is devastating. Dorothy Jackson
felt that way when her eyesight worsened and forced her off the
road, but she learned about the CARE program at Rainbow's End and
in 1995 became one of the first participants.
</P>
<P>
   D.J., as she is known, is tiny, spirited and 84. After her
husband died, she raised their four children alone, working as a
psychiatric nurse in Gallup, N.M. In the 1970s, she set off on her
own in a recreational vehicle. ``I learned how to do it the hard
way,'' she said. ``When things broke down, I read repair books.''
She was primarily a boondocker, a full-timer who spends most nights
not in organized camps but in church or school parking lots or
highway rest areas. Boondockers can be footloose and spontaneous in
their travel and in saving camp fees _ a consideration, because
many live on a shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   At CARE, she is one of 28 participants; the center and the
parking area are being expanded to accommodate 14 more. The
participants pay a basic fee of $450 a month, which covers parking
and hookup for their rigs, housekeeping and laundry services, and
exercise and crafts classes at the center, where a nurse is on duty
to monitor their blood pressure and general health. Breakfast and
lunch are available at extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   Half the participants, like D.J. Jackson, stop in for meals or
exercise classes but go their own way most of the day. The other
half receive full-time care during the center's hours, which costs
$100 a month more. The staff bathes them, changes their dressings
and gives them their medicines. Nurses are on call nights and
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Countses, the Canadian anthropologists, say they would like
to see the CARE concept spread to other sites around the continent.
``Full-timers need to be able to maintain their personal
independence,'' David Counts said. ``CARE does that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the communal breakfast table one day, a husband sat patiently
feeding his wife. The husband, Ray Gearing, is a retired
Presbyterian minister from Little Rock, Ark., a film-star-handsome
man of 72 who lives in his recreational vehicle in the CARE parking
lot. His wife, Ruth, 71, has Alzheimer's disease and lives with him
but spends eight hours a day at the center. ``When she got angry
once in a while, I could deal with that,'' her husband said. ``But
when it would go on for hours or a whole day, I just needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gearings had dreamed of being full-timers for 15 years, ever
since the night they heard mysterious music while camping out in
sleeping bags on a deserted beach on the Texas coast. ``I thought
my teeth were receiving radio waves,'' Gearing recalled, but in the
morning they discovered a motor home, occupied by a concert harpist
and her husband, parked nearby. ``They were our first
full-timers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he retired, and they sold their house in Little Rock
and set forth in a 32-foot motor home. When his wife's health began
to fail, he took over more responsibilities and they drove on,
visiting 49 states. But after a final trip, to Alaska in the summer
of 1996, he guided their vehicle to its resting place at Rainbow's
End.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing takes his wife along to camp events, when her health
permits. ``She's a happy person at the center most of the time,''
he said. ``She has a life, and I have a life.''

 DESIGNERS ARRIVE IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some modern kitchens are geared up with enough equipment to
retool the Mir space station, yet still manage to invoke the
well-bred charm of Jane Austen's parlor. Tea anyone? It can be
steamed up on the Aga or zapped in the microwave oven, then served
in a room newly commodious with a kitchen sofa, pillows, even an
armchair.
</P>
<P>
   The designer has arrived in the kitchen, bringing an eye for
creature comforts and materials once reserved for showier parts of
the house (yes, even the limestone from the entrance hall). The
last barrier between rooms has finally come down.
</P>
<P>
   Never have there been more soft, rounded edges and waxable woods
than in the state-of-the-designer's-art kitchen by Sandra
Nunnerley, a Manhattan interior designer, for Annemarie and Michael
Garstin and their three children. Working with Douglas Moyer, a Sag
Harbor, N.Y., architect, Ms. Nunnerley took advantage of a level of
sophisticated craftsmanship more commonly found in other parts of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Using strong cornices and tongue-and-groove paneling for the
cabinetry and turned edges on work tables, the designers have
created an elegantly inviting ambiance for the once nitty-gritty
working kitchen. Thus, the return of the copper sink from the tool
shed, to be used as a basin for cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to make it look like I'd never been there, while
making everything work in an absolutely efficient way,'' said Ms.
Nunnerley, who with the architect reshaped half the ground floor of
a 1906 shingle-style cottage in East Hampton to accommodate a
sumptuous 950-square-foot kitchen and eating area, sweeping from
the formal front to the terraced back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   At the room's center, an island establishes the kitchen's roots
as solidly late-20th-century American. But the island is not the
standard rectangle recognizable in every prime-time situation
comedy. It has an angular Z-shape, with eight usable sides and a
Five Star range in the middle. The island has two heights _ one at
chopping height for preparing vegetables; the other, a limestone
counter eight inches higher, for bar-style meals on the fly. (The
limestone makes a great looking buffet for hot dishes straight out
of the oven.)
</P>
<P>
   The original old-fashioned kitchen had been exceedingly dark and
riddled with small, unusable spaces. Ms. Garstin is the kind of
weekend chef who wants her family and friends in close proximity as
she cooks. The most striking idea was to add a new bay with
built-in window seats, casement windows and a five-foot-round table
beneath a nine-foot ceiling. ``We barely use the dining room
anymore, even for parties,'' said Ms. Garstin, who owns a public
relations agency in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For families like the Garstins, said Johnny Grey, the author of
``The Art of Kitchen Design'' (Cassell, 1996), the big kitchen is
not a luxury, but the last rendezvous and thoroughfare. ``So much
of daily life, not just socializing but the coming and the going,
is focused on the kitchen that in 10 years it will probably have a
different name,'' he said, adding that the kitchen is no longer the
room in the back. ``It's the largest downstairs room in the house,
pulling in elements from all the other rooms around it.''
</P>
<P>
   As romantic as it looks, the Garstin kitchen works with commando
efficiency. Ms. Nunnerley asked Ms. Garstin to run through the
daily drill: Here's a bag of groceries from the car. Now what?
First off, there had to be plenty of clear counter space near the
two most likely ports of entry, for grocery bags. Within easy reach
of the counters, two Sub-Zero refrigerators were installed: one for
food, one for drinks. The sink for vegetable preparation is on the
island next to the stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you clean the veggies, you can turn right around and pop
them into the pot,'' Ms. Garstin said. For anyone brandishing a
colander of hot dripping pasta, it's a relief to know there's also
a 30-inch-wide porcelain farm sink across from the range. A
hand-hammered copper bar sink was positioned by the door to the
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Precision planning has not translated into a steely streamlined
esthetic. Ms. Nunnerley used careful design detailing and a lot of
woodwork to disguise the hardware with sitting-room elegance. Even
the refrigerators are paneled, and the counters are made of
mahogany. The designer, who grew up in a creaky old house in New
Zealand, said she shared her enthusiasm for using lots of wood with
Ms. Garstin, a close friend, who was born in Scotland. Ms.
Nunnerley pointed out that the wooden surfaces and stained floors
add softness and warmth, making the kitchen feel inviting
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if it gets a burn mark here and there,'' Ms. Nunnerley
said, scoffing at the notion that wood might be impractical.
``Americans are such cleanliness freaks. Imperfections are the soul
of a beautiful house.''

IT'S CLEMENS ALL OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ I hate contract stories more than you do. Like most
sports fans, I'd rather just hear about it when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   I also loathe today's agents and ballplayers for their greedy
practice of scorekeeping. If you're offered $37 million over four
years, what more will you be able to buy if you can jack the price
up to $42 million? This is what ballplayers really mean when they
say it's not about the money. ``Not about the money'' is code for
(itals)``Nine million a year? You mean you don't even think I'm as
good as Roy Hobbs, who's making $9.5 million?''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, I hate when the word ``insult'' appears in the same
paragraph with a $20 million offer to play baseball. Have we all
lost our minds? Market value is market value, but it's offensive to
talk about ``insulting'' million-dollar offers to ballplayers when
there are millions of people working two jobs trying to keep food
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   There. Now that I've addressed all that, let me blast the Red
Sox for getting themselves into this silly situation with their
heart-and-soul, blood-and-thunder first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox said this would not happen. They said there would be
no repeat of the Roger Clemens fiasco. They said they would never
again put themselves in position to lose a franchise player in
exchange for a mere draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   But if you've just turned on your radios, ladies and gentlemen,
it's happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks were held when the Sox brass convened with Mo
Vaughn's people at the All-Star festival in Denver. The Sox
reportedly added two years to their offer, going from $20.4 million
over two years to $37 million over four. Vaughn's people turned it
down. Sox general manager Dan Duquette says trading Mo is not an
option. The All-Star break is over, play resumes in Baltimore
Thursday night, and both sides agree there will be no more
negotiations until the completion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This means Mo will have the option to walk just like Clemens
did. The Sox will lose their exclusive right to negotiate with
Vaughn about six weeks after the World Series ends. And if Mo
chooses to accept an offer from the Orioles, Blue Jays, Yankees, or
Mets, there is nothing Boston can do.
</P>
<P>
   We can argue the merits of the offer. Thirty-seven million
sounds pretty good to most of us, and the offer would put Mo in the
same category with the estimable Mark McGwire, who took the
``hometown discount'' to stay in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   It is a legitimate offer, one that any player would have to
consider if he (itals)were(unitals) serious about staying here.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the Sox' other contract offers has been the
``insulting'' aspect for Mo. A two-year offer to a 30-year-old
player with Vaughn's resume was, in fact, a message to Vaughn that
he was not wanted. But now the Sox have gone to four years. That's
a big step for an organization which has expressed concerns about
Vaughn's lifetsyle and future fitness.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year offer should be negotiable for the Vaughn camp. If
it's not we can only assume that either Mo is totally annoyed with
the ``joint chiefs of staff'' (his expression) in the front office,
or he's already made up his mind that he'd look better in Blue Jay
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox are left with the egg on their faces because
management had a chance to deal with this earlier and chose to let
Vaughn twist in the wind while the Reggie Jefferssons, Scott
Fletchers, and Troy O'Learys were rewarded with multi-year pacts.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been a melodrama when contract talks concern Vaughn,
and I always wonder if it's because he's not a Duquette ``find.''
</P>
<P>
   From the ground crew to the starting lineup, folks at Fenway
know that people who were here before Duquette have been held to a
different standard than those brought in by the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette is having a sensational season. It looks as if the Red
Sox are bound for the playoffs and it's not a stretch to see them
upsetting one or two giants (Indians, Yankees?) in a short series.
Life should be good on Yawkey Way, but the cloud of Mo hangs over
the local nine and the Sox should never have gotten themselves back
in this position.
</P>
<P>
   They should have learned their lesson from Clemens.
</P>

ASTRONAUT STILL FEELING EFFECTS OF LONG STAY ABOARD MIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A month after his return to Earth from a visit to
Russia's Mir space station, U.S. astronaut Andy Thomas said
Wednesday that he's regaining the physical strength drained by 141
days of weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old, Australian-born engineer returned to Earth on
June 12 aboard the shuttle Discovery, the seventh and final
American to live and work aboard Mir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been having a wonderful time,'' said Thomas, who looked
tanned and rested during a succession of interviews at NASA's
Johnson Space Center in far south Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas blasted off for Mir in January. His return signaled the
start of a lengthy rehabilitation effort to rebuild his bones and
muscles as well as retune his nervous system to gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The initial wave of nausea and disorientation that followed his
landing has subsided. The muscles in his neck and shoulders still
respond with pain, though he's graduated from the initial
low-impact exercise regime of the swimming pool at NASA to aerobic
workouts, jogging and lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I have professional commitments,'' Thomas said,
``I have a lot more freedom than I've enjoyed for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, NASA assigned Thomas to the months of Russian
language training and demanding technical preparations for a
mission to Mir as a backup. However, the near disastrous collision
in June 1997 between Mir and a rogue Progress cargo capsule changed
the physical requirements for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   An astronaut of smaller stature who could not wear a Russian
space suit was pulled from the original lineup of U.S. visitors,
creating a flight opportunity for Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (long) missions are very difficult, perhaps the hardest
thing I've ever attempted in my professional career,'' he said.
``It takes a lot of determination and a lot of soul searching. The
personal reward is that I was able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mir is staffed by cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and
Nikolai Budarin, with whom Thomas served.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians plan to replace the cosmonauts in August with
another crew.
</P>
<P>
   Mir is nearing its scheduled demise, and NASA has no plans to
send another space shuttle to the aging orbital outpost unless some
sort of emergency required it, said Jim Van Laak, the deputy
manager of the agency's cooperative human spaceflight program with
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA and Russia begin the orbital assembly of the U.S.-led
international space station in late November as scheduled, the
Russians plan to propel the more than 200,000-pound outpost into
the ocean in mid-1999. Agreed to by the United States and Russia
last spring, the scheme was re-verified by the Russians earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans, which could be derailed by Russia's financial
problems, would place a final three-man crew aboard Mir in
February. They would be joined by a new larger version of the
Progress supply ship configured with the propulsion needed to
provide the the push that would send Mir into the South Pacific.

NEW ENGLAND NUMBERS INDICATE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An index of business activity in New England fell in April and
stayed low in May, adding new evidence that a recession sweeping
through Southeast Asia and Japan is causing a slowdown in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The economic index, prepared by BankBoston Corp., was below the
crucial 50-mark for two consecutive months, its worst reading since
the 1991-1992 recession. The index measures shipments, profits, new
orders, and employment of companies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are watching indicators such as these closely for red
flags. There is a widespread belief that the US economy will shift
into low gear later this year as Asia's crisis hits home.
</P>
<P>
   The US economy is nowhere near a recession. The economy is still
growing, albeit more slowly, and unemployment has held at record
lows both nationally and in Massachusetts for months. The state's
jobless rate was 3.6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   But BankBoston's index shows that the Asia effect is ``showing
up earlier in New England,'' said Wayne Ayers, the bank's chief
economist.
</P>
<P>
   During the long-running economic expansion of recent years, New
England has ``moved in sync with the rest of the country,'' Ayers
said. ``It's curious we've seen this weakness showing up in the
region and it seems to be more severe. What I'm saying is this may
be a leading indicator for the US as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil in Asian economies can affect US firms in many ways. The
most obvious is that exports fall as Asia's recession reduces sales
by Asian companies both internally and to trading partners in the
troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is that US companies find it is more difficult
to compete in global markets against Asian products that are
dropping in price due to the plunging value of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting anecdotal evidence of Asia fallout in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Parametric Technology Inc., one of the Boston
area's hottest companies, watched its stock plunge by more than a
third due to concerns Asia's troubles were choking demand for its
software. Sales by companies that make semiconductor equipment and
products for the Japanese chip industry have been hard hit. More
evidence is expected when companies begin reporting second-quarter
sales later this month.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are part of a national trend, according to a
bellwether index of US growth derived from a survey of American
purchasing managers. The purchasing managers' index also dropped
below the 50 mark _ to 49.6 in June _ for the first time since the
plunge in the Mexican peso and Latin American currencies rocked the
US economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact in this country of Asia's crisis is expected to
last far longer than did the crisis in South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the difficulties about 1998 is that the areas that are
affected are far larger, if you include Japan,'' said Fred
Breimyer, chief econmist for State Street Bank &AMP; Trust Co. in
Boston. ``It is not contained. We're looking for the Japanese to
contain it not only for themselves but for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Troubles are most acute in the high-technology sector but are
not limited to that sector, economists said. BankBoston's index is
derived from surveys of 1,100 chief executives of manufacturing and
non-manufacturing companies in the six New England states.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's index fell from 52.8 in March to 47.0 in April and
remained virtually flat at 47.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been below 50 for three of the past five months.
That is the index's worst showing since the 1991-92 recession, New
England's worst economic slump in the post-war period. When the
index is above 50, the economy is expanding; below 50, the economy
is contracting, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although the unemployment rate remains low in Massachusetts,
the pace of job growth is slowing. The jobless rate increased to
3.6 percent in May, from 2.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The US jobless rate also rose, by 0.2 percentage points, to 4.5
percent in June, and labor force grew by 83,000, an indication of
less demand for new workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic slowdown has a silver lining: It calms fears
that inflation is starting to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Asian situation were not hitting, the Federal Reserve
would be raising rates,'' Breimyer said. ``Even bad news translates
to good news in this country.''

 &HT;    Come to this `Cabaret' for a bawdy '90s bash
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not Liza Minnelli's ``Cabaret.'' Forget the shimmer.
Forget the shine. This is a decadent ``Cabaret'' for the '90s,
deliciously delivered to disc by Tony Award winners Alan Cumming
and Natasha Richardson. It's a sexy, raw, in-your-face ``Cabaret,''
one that makes the 32-year-old musical seem brand-new. Every inch
of its bawdy veneer _ the desperation of those living on a
shoestring, the chin-up fortitude of an old maid pondering her
future, the sex-with-a-shrug nature of its bruised and
needle-marked dancing girls _ comes through, chillingly.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal of a cast album is to re-create the theater
experience, and it should be, ``Cabaret'' succeeds mightily. The
listener almost expects to see Cumming's likable, lascivious Emcee
come slinking around a corner or Richardson's needy Sally Bowles
smoking on the divan.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Cabaret'' has jettisoned several songs from the original
(``Meeskite,'' ``Why Should I Wake Up?'') and added several from
the 1972 movie (``The Money Song,'' ``Mein Herr,'' ``Maybe This
Time'' and ``I Don't Care Much''). The changes make this album
essential listening for any lover of ``Cabaret'' or its musical
team, composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. It may also be
the only way fans can experience Richardson's Bowles. ``Cabaret''
is one of Broadway's toughest tickets, and she finishes her run
Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge of her performance, Richardson has said more than
once, is being ``not Liza.'' She needn't worry. Her Sally is worlds
away from Minnelli's, and in this time, at this place, worlds
better.

<P>
   RCA Victor. 19 tracks.

<P>
   The verdict: A perfectly marvelous cast album.

 &HT;    Florence Harding _ confined to obscurity because of her
husband's scandals _ gets her due
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If first ladies were judged on their own deeds, Florence Harding
would rank among the achievers, writes historian Carl Sferrazza
Anthony. ``Instead she was doomed to be known as the wife of the
greatest failure in the presidency.'' Volumes have been written on
Jacqueline Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt, but Mrs. Warren G.
Harding has dwelt in footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony restores her to history and presents a strong case for
her importance as a prototypical 20th-century first lady. His
research seems meticulous, but excessive documentation often makes
for tortuous reading. Florence's portrait, reconstructed from
shards after she burned many of her papers, emerges as distantly
seen, almost as if she lived in the 18th century instead of our
own. Still, the fascinating book makes the adventures of Hill and
Bill seem tame.
</P>
<P>
   The 29th president left a sordid trail: scandals, affairs,
alleged illegitimate children and blackmail funds. Florence herself
was no Victorian. She became pregnant out of wedlock, relied on
astrology, was rumored to have poisoned the president and destroyed
official documents after his death. But she was a force in the
first election in which millions of women could vote, and her
legacy is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Flossie Kling, born in 1860 in Marion, Ohio, was the daughter of
a domineering father who developed her head for business. At 19 she
became pregnant, probably by Henry De Wolfe, whom Anthony says she
never married. Henry left her and son Marshall, and after
struggling financially she gave up the child to her father, and
``essentially ended her obligations of motherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence admired the ``stalwart physique'' of Warren G. Harding,
owner and editor of the Marion Star, even if his moral fiber was
less resolute. He enjoyed drinking and playing poker and had a
``ravenous appetite for sexual adventure with women.'' Florence
courted the younger Warren, enraging her father, who furthered
rumors that the Hardings had African blood.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying in 1891, Florence took over the newspaper's
business dealings, but her main profession was Warren Harding. One
wonders at her faith in his potential. Three years into their
marriage, Harding had an affair and a child with Florence's
childhood neighbor, Anthony writes. Florence developed the
philosophy that the happy wife makes ``the best of what she has
got.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Warren was elected to the Ohio Senate, in 1903 to the
lieutenant governorship. He was maneuvering toward the
gubernatorial nomination in 1905 when Florence became ill with the
nephritis that plagued her for years and finally killed her. During
her hospitalization, he began a long affair with her best friend,
Carrie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   When the Duchess (Warren's nickname for Florence) discovered the
betrayal, she threatened divorce, but backed off. ``She had
invested everything she had into the very idea of `Harding' as her
career,'' Anthony writes. She channeled her energy toward getting
him elected to the U.S. Senate in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Alice Roosevelt Longworth introduced Florence to
Evalyn McLean and they became unlikely lifelong friends. Flamboyant
Evalyn was married to the Washington Post heir and owned the Hope
diamond. Some presumed she and Florence were lesbians, but Anthony
concludes theirs might have been a ``romantic friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren had passions of his own, carrying on simultaneous affairs
with Phillips; Nan Britton, who claimed they begot a daughter in
his Senate office; and Grace Cross, one of his staffers. Still, he
was mentioned as a presidential hopeful, although Florence was
uncharacteristically leery of his candidacy. Madame Marcia, her
favorite astrologer, had predicted that Warren would be elected
only to die in office. But politics was in Florence's blood, and
when it seemed her husband would lose, she ordered him to stay in
the 1920 race. After he was nominated, Florence wrote socialist
Norman Thomas that she ``was very much afraid.'' She had reason.
Several women used Warren's love letters as blackmail and some
Republicans set up a payoff fund.
</P>
<P>
   During the Hardings' 2 1/2 years in office, Florence was loved
by the public. She supported veterans' causes, initiated press
conferences for women reporters, flew in an airplane, spoke up for
women's equality and physical fitness and opposed vivisection. She
opened the White House to the public, helped immigrant children and
fostered the first federal prison for women.
</P>
<P>
   Just as scandals loomed, the president died, most likely of a
heart attack, 75 years ago in San Francisco. Anthony finds no
evidence of foul play but concludes there was a cover-up to protect
a family doctor who may have misdiagnosed the illness.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, Florence took on the task of
salvaging his memory, burning everything that could be
``misconstrued'' _ about half his papers. Ultimately, her efforts
came to naught: Warren's reputation soon unraveled with the Teapot
Dome scandal. Her own stature slipped months after her 1924 death.
Florence's astrologer peddled her revelations to magazines, her
destruction of presidential papers made headlines and a 1930 book
charged that she had conspired with the family doctor to kill the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Florence Harding!'' a Senate wife recalled. ``If only she
had married differently, or if she could have dared for herself, as
in some other day she might!'' Yet, 75 years after her reign,
little has changed. Hillary Rodham Clinton's reputation still will
largely rise and fall according to her husband's. And no woman has
yet dared for herself to the highest office in the land.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Plato apologist raises postmodernists' ire
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anonymous mail is the sign you've struck the right nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Grabar had the temerity to write an essay for the opinion
page of The Atlanta Constitution recently, only to find herself the
target of cowards in hoods. She shouldn't have been surprised. You
can say things that most intelligent people would think
commonsensical. But graduate students in the humanities aren't most
people.
</P>
<P>
   Grabar is herself a graduate student _ in English, no less _ and
that is what made her opinion-page piece unusual. It was the kind
of heresy not tolerated in the faculty lounge. The trendinistas
took over the place in the '80s, and only a fool asks about free
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In universities today, free inquiry is a relic of the
``hegemonic'' past, when ``power relations'' were not yet fully
understood and the gospels of Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and
Michel Foucault were not yet nailed to every classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are, no one dares question them _ not if she
expects to get tenure.
</P>
<P>
   What Grabar said was obvious enough, even if it failed by the
standards of a good manifesto. Her tone was too reasonable. But
then, she was proposing that a liberal education restore reason and
logic, twin pillars of the Western tradition, to their former
place. Specifically, she suggested that students had more to learn
from Plato than from the postmodernists whose drivel is dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alarmingly,'' she wrote, ``Plato, even in graduate seminars,
is popularly referred to as totalitarian, fascist and sexist _
without a respectable and close investigation of his works and
arguments. That the Western philosophical aspiration to use logic
and reason can be traced back to him is rarely acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead ... Foucault is popularly accepted as the high priest
of postmodernists, the group that espouses the ideals of relativism
and multiculturalism and disdains Western institutions and ideas.
With such a point of view in vogue, we cannot expect that history,
literature or philosophy will be taught evenhandedly or
impartially. Sad to say, politics has replaced philosophy in our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate injustice
</P>
<P>
   I cheered that paragraph, even as I disputed the implication
that Plato was liberal in his premises and conclusions. It's a
complicated subject, long debated by scholars. The important point,
as Grabar made in a telephone conversation, is that Plato, in ``The
Republic,'' asked the important questions _ above all, What is
Justice? _ and let readers wrestle not only with competing ideas
but with their own.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find students wrestling with them these days. For one
thing, they're out of shape (``Most freshman I teach at the
University of Georgia, the state's flagship institution of higher
learning, know little or nothing about Plato''). For another, their
masters on the faculty don't want that kind of intellectual
exercise. They want to dispense their dogmas, imported from Paris,
potted like so many petunias, without dissent.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the Western intellectual tradition, from Plato on,
is a sham. Remember that songfest at Stanford back in the '80s when
the Rev. Jesse Jackson led the boys and girls in chanting, ``Hey,
hey, ho, ho, Western culture's got to go''? Some of the chanters
turned out to be not puerile, impressionable students, but
assistant professors _ who can be just as puerile, just as
impressionable as any sophomore. They called to mind Bazarov in
Turgenev's ``Fathers and Sons,'' the nihilist who would destroy for
the sake of destroying.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Grabar implies but doesn't quite say, the Western
intellectual tradition is anything but a closed church. Aristotle
parted with Plato on important points. Aquinas was indebted to
Aristotle. Machiavelli, misunderstood by most who utter his name,
anticipated the power theorists of Realpolitik. Kant and Hegel were
on opposite sides of a fence from Locke and Hume. Marx understood
freedom in terms of social class, John Stuart Mill in terms of the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance gets short shrift
</P>
<P>
   You cannot very well understand the conflicts that divide the
world without understanding the competing ideas that gave rise to
Western philosophy and literature. One of the byproducts of those
conflicts and those ideas is tolerance, a value that thinkers who
disagreed on everything else have held in common.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a value held in much regard in the humanities
departments. Mary Grabar's unsigned mail from people whose
convictions exceeded their courage was proof of that. One letter
writer accused her of being part of the hegemonic, Eurocentric
something or other _ one of the all-purpose cliches that
substitutes for thought.
</P>
<P>
   If Grabar was irritated, she had to be amused as well. ``I was
born in Slovenia, which didn't even gain its independence until
1991,'' she says. ``Yet here I am lumped in with the oppressors.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you respond to the nameless? What, in any case, can
you say to people who wouldn't know Plato from Pluto?

 &HT;    Making horses better comes naturally to Jan Weisman
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between, Ga.--Jan Weisman doesn't whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the horse trainer practices ``natural horsemanship'' or
``resistance-free'' training, the method mythologized in the 1995
Nicholas Evans novel, ``The Horse Whisperer,'' and its recent film
adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to her commanding voice, with its sorghum-thick
Southern accent, carry across the stables at Wellspring Farm and it
quickly becomes clear that it ain't about murmuring into the
animal's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that top lip pulled way down over the bottom lip. He's
a pouter,'' notes Weisman, 43, as she leads a skittish, bay-colored
Rhinelander named Rommell into the training pen. It's Rommell's
first official session at the 90-acre farm, nestled in the pines
off U.S. 78 about 40 miles east of Atlanta. Weisman's been the sole
trainer here for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The horse towers over his trainer's 5-foot-9-inch frame, and
Weisman says he has enough power in his neck ``to throw me to the
ceiling.'' But she's confident, as she has been with the countless
other young and problem horses she's eased into domesticity over a
decade as a natural horsemanship practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make any horse better,'' she says as she eyes Rommell,
who appears dubious. ``It's just a matter of how much money the
owner wants to put on top of what they've already spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the breed, a typical horse costs $2,000 to $30,000.
Add $550 a month to board and train them at Wellspring. And there's
no telling how long you'll need: Weisman's had horses graduate
after 30 days and others still trying after six months. Such as one
named Nido, nicknamed Piranha, who took a nip out of Weisman's calf
while she was trying to ride him. ``He needs to be in a can,'' she
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Natural horsemanship _ which relies on body language and lots of
patience _ is generally attributed to California equine expert Tom
Dorrance; his 1987 book ``True Unity: Willing Communication Between
Horse and Human,'' is considered the bible on the subject.
Disciples such as Buck Brannaman, the Wyoming trainer who inpired
Evans' novel and who served as an adviser on the movie, have
popularized it.
</P>
<P>
   In the May issue of Smithsonian magazine, Brannaman describes
getting the animals ``comfortable, to where they don't mind being
around you.'' Weisman puts it this way: ``I've just learned how to
set a situation up physically and let the horse figure out a way to
get out of it easily, on his own. Horses are lazy, and they'll
usually choose the easy way out. So you've got to let the easy way
be the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The method is not without controversy _ by Weisman's estimation,
only about a tenth of Georgia's 100 or so trainers practice it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as resistance-free training,'' says
Roger Sosby, a full-time trainer and former president of the
Georgia Quarterhorse Association. ``There are techniques that are
more humane, but there has to be some `resistance.' Just like
children will run wild if you don't use discipline, so will
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to argue with Rommell's progress. The horse
begins the session in flight, running endless circles around the
outer wall of the pen. ``It ain't worth it, baby!'' Weisman calls
from center ring. ``It's too hot today to do all that running!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she explains, the running is part of the horse's
learning experience. ``It can take five minutes or it can take 30
minutes, but eventually his lungs are going to hurt and he will try
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nonverbal commands that help Weisman achieve her goal:
She'll look the horse directly in the eye if he's doing something
she doesn't like, and she'll turn away from him if she wants to
take the pressure off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if a person is being held at gunpoint,'' she says.
``If they've got the gun pointed right at you, you're going to be
real nervous, but if they drop the gun and are walking away, you're
going to be a lot less nervous. That's how the horse feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the hour-long session, horse and
trainer have reached an understanding, and Rommell is willingly
dropping his head into a halter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best there is,'' says Leah Richards, a Forsyth
County homemaker who has been boarding her family's 3-year-old
thoroughbred Kateef with Weisman since September. ``The horse will
be done with what he needs to know soon, and then I'll come to her
to learn what I need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Robert Redford's character in the film, Weisman doesn't
have much time for city amusements. ``I know I won't see the movie
until it comes on pay-per-view,'' she says. ``There are days when
my truck never leaves this driveway.'' (Weisman, who is single,
lives in an apartment inside the barn.)
</P>
<P>
   The trainer doesn't know where her ability to ``read'' a horse
comes from, though she says she's always loved to ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little, my dad used to take me to a place called
Little Creek in Decatur. They rented horses by the hour, and I'd
just ride all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it must be some kind of God-given talent,'' she muses.
``I couldn't go take piano lessons and play like Beethoven. I can't
do anything but this.''

 &HT;    A little sugar goes long way to smooth legs
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, a sweet solution to shaving your legs.
</P>
<P>
   Sugaring, one of the newest salon methods for removing unwanted
hair, is also one of the oldest. The syruplike recipe _ sugar,
lemon juice and herbs _ has been used by Middle Eastern and
Mediterranean women for centuries, often before their wedding
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to waxing but gentle on the skin,'' says
Katherine Volkmann, owner of Atlanta's Salon Oxygen, which
``sugars'' 15 to 20 clients a week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette Hart, 19, usually waxes her legs but wanted to try
something less painful.
</P>
<P>
   First, Volkmann washed and dried the college student's leg, then
dusted on powder to remove all moisture. With a metal spatula, she
carefully applied the sugar mixture from a heated pot, using long
smooth strokes. On the leg, it looked like a sheer strip of
cellophane. ``It feels a little warm,'' said Hart. ``But not as hot
as wax.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Volkmann applied a muslin strip to the leg, making certain
the sugar mixture adhered. Then she quickly pulled the strip off _
in the opposite direction of the hair growth _ removing the hair by
the root. When each leg was finished, she spritzed on toner to
remove any sugar residue, then applied a soothing lotion. Volkmann
recommended Hart not go swimming or put any lotions on her legs for
the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And did the process hurt? ``There was a little bit of a sting
when Katherine pulled off the strip,'' says Hart. ``But it didn't
hurt nearly as much as a wax treatment and my legs are super soft.
I'm a convert.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugaring legs takes about half an hour and costs $25 to do from
ankles to knees; a full leg sugaring (ankle to thigh) is $45; a
full leg and bikini sugaring is $60. For best results, you should
have 1/4-inch hair growth on your legs. Treatments generally last
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While there are sugaring kits on the market _ Sweet Simplicity,
Surgi-Sweet and Body Sugar _ Volkmann urges caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulling the muslin strips off improperly can cause bruising,''
she says. ``Better to go to a licensed esthetician who has been
trained in sugaring.''
</P>
<P>
   The high and low ends of new hair removers
</P>
<P>
   High tech: Laser
</P>
<P>
   By targeting the hair follicle, lasers slow hair growth. Some
patients have permanent hair removal; others will have ``peach
fuzz'' or a combination. No guarantee that hair won't grow back.
</P>
<P>
   Procedure: Legs must be shaved first before being scanned with a
laser. Treatment can take minutes or hours, depending on size of
target area.
</P>
<P>
   How it feels: Like the snap of a small rubber band or static
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Works best on: Dark-haired people with pale skin; not
recommended for African-Americans, Hispanics or Asians because it
can damage surrounding skin.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance: After initial treatment, touch-ups needed every six
to eight weeks; then every eight to 10 weeks until hair is gone;
time differs with patient.
</P>
<P>
   Fees: Lower legs from $400 to $700 per treatment; legs and
thighs from $750 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Source: Dr. David H. McDaniel, director, Laser Center of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Laser info: 1-800-441-2737.
</P>
<P>
   Low-tech: Hair Off Mitten
</P>
<P>
   Hoping you'll ``get smitten with the Mitten,'' CCA Industries
touts the ease and safety of this buffing glove.
</P>
<P>
   Procedure: Rub hair off dry skin a circle at a time. Easy
enough, but requires a little elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   How it feels: Like fine-grade sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Works best on: Those who fear the razor or want to work the
upper arm.

 &HT;    With the great reception her songs are getting at packed shows,
the road is bliss for singer-writer Lucinda Willaims
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn.--The perfect sound can live in your mind like a
landscape you know by heart. You can circle around it, tirelessly,
until maybe, just maybe, you capture it on tape. When others
finally hear it, they will heap praise upon you for getting it so
right. Until then, you may be dismissed as a ``nutty
perfectionist'' by band mates or even The New York Times. And
instead of talking about your music, every interviewer will want to
chat about being obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Lucinda Williams' nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, she is revered by other musicians, critics and fans for
making country blues that are closer to poetry than pop. She's
never charted, and every label she's ever signed with has folded,
so she's largely unknown to the average consumer of popular
entertainment. ``Passionate Kisses,'' her most famous song, only
hit country radio when Mary Chapin Carpenter covered it, winning
them both a Grammy in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Though her fifth album, ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' is being
greeted with raves (see ours on Page L3), it did not come without a
price: three sets of producers, an ever-expanding cast of
musicians, take and retake, mix and remix.
</P>
<P>
   The usual question is ``why does Lucinda Williams take so long
to make a record?'' She's gladly sacrificed volume for creative
control on each disc _ her last, the acclaimed ``Sweet Old World,''
came out in 1992. Unlike, say, Van Morrison or Bob Dylan,
notoriously bad judges of their own vast output, she has brutal
clarity about each song. Plenty have damned her exactitude, but
others consider it an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a pet peeve of mine,'' says Emmylou Harris,
who sings harmony on the new record. ``A lot of times male artists
take a long time between records and rerecord (them) _ and people
call them geniuses and laud them for having control. They can't
heap enough accolades on them. Yet Lucinda's taking a lot of grief.
The only thing I can think of is it's because she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Car Wheels'' has music writers tripping over
superlatives _ senior rock critic Robert Christgau gave it 4 1/2
stars out of 5 and called it ``more perfect than perfect'' in
Rolling Stone magazine _ the question Williams wants to ask is,
``Why does anyone care how long it took?''
</P>
<P>
   Poets' wanderlust
</P>
<P>
   Moving on has been a way of life since childhood. Her father,
the poet Miller Williams _ who read at President Clinton's most
recent inauguration while she played at one of the balls _ took his
family from one Southern university job to the next. As a
20-something songwriter in the early '80s, steeped in the folk
revival and wanderlust of the '60s, she followed suit, blowing from
Louisiana to Texas to California.
</P>
<P>
   So it's interesting to see her parked in Nashville, in an older
suburb called Green Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The house, with its hardwood floors, tall windows and tree-laden
yard, is a roomy older model she rents from the man next door. If
living rooms reveal favorite things, hers are music, Mexican folk
art and Bob Dylan: A print of his 1970 album cover
``Self-Portrait'' hangs over her brown leather couch; his face
looks out from other walls and a magnet on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like the home of a ``nutty perfectionist.'' It's
orderly (CDs arranged alphabetically) but not obsessive (cookbooks
are not). Navajo rugs, framed poems by Dad, photos of blues heroes
John Lee Hooker and Sunnyland Slim. Guitars in cases and on stands.
``Snakes, skulls and crosses,'' she jokes later, summing up the
decor. A brick from Woody Guthrie's house rests in the bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   The only clutter is contained in an office she hasn't unpacked
since she and boyfriend-band mate Richard Price moved in six months
ago. Which is, naturally, where the photographer for Newsweek is
hoping to pose her on a hot Saturday in June.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly 5 p.m.; Williams was due at 3 from a photo shoot a
few miles away. Those in wait _ representatives from her management
company and the record label, a neighbor, a reporter _ have
gravitated from the porch steps to the air conditioning.
Photographer Michael Tighe has staked out the yard and is making
one more sweep inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This room is perfect!'' he yells from the top of the stairs.
``Looks like a bomb went off.'' Paid to be low-key, the management
rep tells him it's probably off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Providentially, car wheels on a gravel road announce Williams'
arrival. As she pulls up in a Ford Explorer, you wonder if she'll
be up for the last two rounds of publicity that were wedged into
what had been her day off. Especially since she's known to prize
``cool quiet and time to think'' _ and her privacy. But she's not
dragging when she climbs out of the driver's seat and pulls off her
shades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' she says, sticking out a hand. ``I'm Lucinda.'' She
doesn't give you the flat hand, but a real grasp. Tired, maybe, but
she seems almost grateful to be able to push ``Car Wheels,'' the
best and the hardest thing she's ever done.
</P>
<P>
   She's high on the sounds that are finally blaring out from
Americana stations across the country, but still feels defensive
about a September 1997 New York Times article that portrayed her as
the ultimate diva. Haunted by the sound in her head and struggling
to catch it on tape, she came across as the worst kind of neurotic:
driven but indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Times article ran, her album was still nine months from
radio or record stores. American Records honcho Rick Rubin was
doing the final mix when he dissolved his label and moved to Sony _
without Williams. Until Mercury Records bought her contract and
released ``Car Wheels,'' she couldn't respond to charges of being a
control freak by cueing the sound or brandishing a rapturous
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can be criticized for being a
perfectionist and still have people like what you do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just that her personal standards are so high.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, in 1995, she had recorded the 13 songs with
her longtime band and the inside word was that they were perfect.
Something was missing to her ear (``it needed more oomph,'' she
says) and she rerecorded the entire set in Nashville with the
twangtrust songwriter Steve Earle and his engineer-partner, Ray
Kennedy. Their vintage recording equipment snared a rawness that
had been eluding her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make the same record I made before,'' she
says, ``with different songs.'' A layering of guitarists, including
Buddy Miller, Johnny Lee Schell, Greg Leisz and Charlie Sexton,
added what she calls ``different textures and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   By that fall, Los Angeles-based producer Roy Bittan (formerly of
Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band) was, in her words, ``putting the
icing on the cake,'' which included additional vocal tracks by
Emmylou Harris and Jim Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's chewing over the most recent issue of the music
magazine Spin. Though the article was favorable _ it dubbed ``Car
Wheels'' album of the year _ she's only talking about the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the pictures of me in the latest Spin?'' she
asks. Framed by a worn cowboy hat, a bleak, harshly lighted,
older-looking version of her stares into space, as if spellbound at
a trailer park. She hated the photo shoot so much that she had her
cool blond highlights warmed into chocolate and hired a makeup
artist. Tell me, she asks, would a control freak even allow those
pictures to exist?
</P>
<P>
   Stylist Melanie Shelley asks Tighe if Newsweek should shoot her
in the same outfit _ blue jeans, black tank top and a big silver
concho belt _ she wore that morning for the music magazine Request.
``Maybe something softer?'' They trail Williams upstairs to
consider the contents of her bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, she's in an apricot negligee and black
shoes, trying to find a bug-free patch on the tree she's been asked
to hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate posing,'' she says, flicking an ant off her arm. ``I
never know what to do with myself. My face gets all ...'' she rubs
the muscles that cradle her mouth, ``... tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice, even when she's talking, sounds like music: an
Appalachian sadness filtered through Delta grit. The descending sun
backlights her smile and frames her eyes, a summer-sky blue. A
black bra strap peeks out from one shoulder. She presses her face
close to the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' says the photographer. ``Now let's move to the
front yard.'' Williams would rather be looking through the
viewfinder, focusing on anything but herself. In frustration, she
flops onto the ground, arms at her side, looking for a second like
Tennyson's ``Lady in the Lake'' floating on a sea of grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was an actor,'' she says, rubbing her hands as if
removing something sticky. ``Then I would know what to do in front
of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple song of home, longing
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, squeezed into a stairwell, she pulls
her guitar into her lap and aims the neck of it into the camera,
making jokes about penis envy. She's comfortable enough to let the
subject of ``Right in Time,'' the album's driving first single,
lust after a memorable lover _ then take matters into her own hands
when he doesn't show up. But she's a serious enough writer to keep
all that implied.
</P>
<P>
   In the song, a woman stands over a stove, watching water boil.
She turns off the TV, bites her nails and turns out the lights. ``I
see it as a little movie,'' Williams says. ``We're watching this
woman go through her routine. It's not like she's sad, it's more
like a longing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the longing thing. It courses through most of her songs,
making you wonder if she writes about it because it's easier or it
just suits her cast of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both,'' she says later. She has changed back into jeans, lit
incense and put on a John Lee Hooker record. ``I mean, I think I'm
just going through that in my life right now. I'm in this stage
where I'm looking back on things. I've got a lot of history, and
I've lost people close to me, and all those changes make for more
powerful songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that hers ever lacked force. The songs on the acclaimed
third album, ``Lucinda Williams,'' her second set of originals but
the first that crystallized her mature style, are so
heartbreakingly rendered that some feared it might be as good as
she could get. (Koch International just reissued this out-of-print
1988 classic, which includes ``The Night's Too Long,'' ``Crescent
City'' and ``Side of the Road.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I always compare it to the way poets write, which is the world
I grew up in,'' she says. ``They write about anything and
everything; there aren't any boundaries. I always work off of notes
that I already have, that I've collected over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't throw anything away if I think I can use it at some
point.'' Unless dad, her most exacting editor, detects a
repetition. Like the word ``angel,'' which shows up here in a song
called ``Drunken Angel'' and on her '92 release in ``Little Angel,
Little Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You can't ever use that in a song ever again. You've
already done it twice. You've broken the cardinal rule,''' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   He can quibble. But most will be grateful to finally have ``Car
Wheels'' in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about this (album) than I have any of the ones
before just in terms of the sound,'' Williams says. ``It feels
closer to what I've been going for. I think something was captured
in my vocals that before I didn't think really came across. That's
why I went in and did it over again with Ray and Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Star-studded congratulations
</P>
<P>
   She must have told her version of the saga a hundred times by
now, and in the coming months, she'll tell it a hundred more.
She'll tour throughout the summer, including stops at the Lilith
Fair and the Newport Folk Fest, and each appearance will mean more
interviews. No one but the most dedicated industry types can keep
it straight, or, by this point, care.
</P>
<P>
   Today she has a payoff of sorts. The Rolling Stone with
Christgau's rave in it has just hit the stands, so ``4 1/2 stars''
has become the salutation du jour.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:40 p.m. before she gets to favorite haunt Tin Angel, a
nuevo Mexican restaurant south of the Vanderbilt University campus.
She orders catfish and substitutes green beans and sweet potatoes
for the black beans and rice. The waiter congratulates her, as does
fellow singer-songwriter Kevin Welch, who stops by to pat her on
the shoulder. ``You must be so proud,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   She is. The praise helps dim her feelings of being judged. A
little wine, a couple of espressos (she stirs the black liquid with
a lemon strip, as close as she comes to dessert), and she's ready
to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the server brings her boxed leftovers with inky blue
stars (4 1/2 of 'em) drawn across the top, she's downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she says, with a weary glee. ``I'm really just a
mild-mannered, regular old salt-of-the-earth neurotic
perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   By the parking lot, she's talking about which part of that would
fit on a T-shirt.
</P>

 &HT;    Sheers, pastels key to cool, polished look in the summer heat
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question of which _ if any _ hosiery to wear in the
summertime qualifies as a ``Darned if you do, darned if you don't''
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Thin though it is, hosiery's still one extra layer that many
women would rather leave home when the temperature climbs. But many
don't have a choice: Due to social or professional dictates, they
simply can't go bare-legged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a meeting or presentations to make, I make mad
dashes from the apartment to the car and from the car to the office
because wearing stockings in 90-degree heat for more than five
minutes makes you feel sticky and uncomfortable,'' said Cherry
Banez, a 32-year-old who works for the Atlanta Hawks' special
events division.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, there's the difficulty of finding hosiery
that goes with summer styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go for the nudes,'' said Banez, ``because they work
with summertime clothes, they're sexy and they're professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out in the heat, sheers are probably the most
comfortable thing to wear,'' said Felicia Leyva, hosiery and
accessories manager for Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom's Lynn Clune recommends stockings and thigh-highs,
``because then you don't have the panty top to deal with.'' Both
Leyva and Don Purcell, manager at Bob Ellis Shoes at Phipps Plaza
in Atlanta, tout Donna Karan's new seven-shade ``Nudes'' collection
as their customers' preferred choice. The seven shades span the
gamut of skin tones and look just as refined as the sheer black
hosiery worn during the cooler months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ultra-sheer,'' said Purcell. ``They look like you have
nothing on your legs at all, but they give a nice finished look.
They're great with open-toed shoes, and they're woven loosely to
let a little more air in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cool looks this season include hosiery in pale pastel
shades of pink, lavender, yellow and green to be worn as
alternatives to the traditional summer off-whites, and styles woven
from ultra-thin nylon fibers to make them feel lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least to let you look like the heat's not beating you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' said Banez. ``You know how it is with us
women sometimes; it's as much about appearance as it is about
comfort.''

 &HT;    Tillis bumped, bruised and better than ever
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul McCartney once said that his best work came out of times of
greatest pain. Two decades later, here's country singer Pam Tillis
proving that theory. This material, recorded during the breakup of
her long-term marriage, is perhaps the most creative and richest
work she's ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis has turned her personal trauma into a musical strength
never heard during her hit-driven career. She's abandoned her
perky, cowgirl style for a more mature sound, not unlike Trisha
Yearwood's best country outings. But don't think slick. Tillis
hasn't turned into a VH1 diva. As in a comfy old farmhouse, the
country foundations are all still here: crying pedal steel,
acoustic guitar, mandolin and searing fiddle. And despite the
personal bumps driving the music, Tillis hasn't taken the morose
route.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she has concentrated on finding tunes that are fresh
without being contrived, and as hard-hitting as a whiskey chaser:
``Ain't tried cigarettes; / There's always alcohol. / I could stay
up all night long. / I've got credit cards; / I could run 'em up. /
If I really want to hurt myself, / I know where to find you.''
``Not Me'' is an I'm-not-gonna-take-it-anymore anthem in which she
declares, ``I won't go through that again, no, not me.'' She's
closing down the bar in ``After Hours,'' getting up and ``going
through the motions of my life'' in ``A Great Disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of country album that makes the repeat button
worth having. There simply isn't a bad track on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Time''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Tillis. Arista. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: She transcends the pain.

 &HT;    Audio reviews of the latest sounds
 &HT;    By Susan Elliott, Doug Hamilton, Shane Harrison, Sonia Murray,
and Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- FOLK-ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Mermaid Avenue''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bragg and Wilco.
</P>
<P>
   Elektra. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Folk music eminence Woody Guthrie left behind more than a
powerful influence on Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. There are
more than 1,000 complete Guthrie lyrics in the archives. His
daughter Nora approached Billy Bragg _ like her father a
left-leaning, politically charged songsmith _ with the offer of
putting tunes to the words. As a result, and enlisting the help of
talented Americana poster boys Wilco, Bragg has been inspired to
make some of the best music of his career. It swings and tugs at
the emotions in equal measure. The ``In the Midnight Hour'' bass
line, singsong organ figure and nonsense lyrics of ``Hoodoo
Voodoo'' make for one of the most joyous pieces of music so far
this year. Guthrie should rest easy with his words in such capable
and respectful hands.
</P>
<P>
   -- ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Stunt''
</P>
<P>
   Barenaked Ladies. Reprise. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Already adored in their native Canada, these often amusing
pop-rockers are primed for superstar status stateside. ``Stunt,''
the Ladies' fifth full-length album, is garnering major airplay,
and they'll co-headline this summer's H.O.R.D.E. tour. As with
previous efforts, the new release is a mishmash of styles and
influences. ``One Week'' sends a hilarious, tongue-tripping rap
skittering over a solid frat-rock riff. ``Leave,'' an
end-of-the-romance lament, recalls Crosby, Stills and Nash at their
most countrified. Perfect pop tunes such as ``I'll Be That Girl''
suggest that the band has a brilliant album in them. ``Stunt''
isn't it _ too many slow tempos drag it down _ but it's an
agreeably imperfect diversion.
</P>
<P>
   -- CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   ``Dedication: Lieder of
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven, R. Strauss,
</P>
<P>
   Schumann, Liszt''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Heppner. BMG Classics.
</P>
<P>
   16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Among the hottest tenor sensations in classical music, Ben
Heppner raises the bar here on an already high standard of
musicianship and interpretation. Having earned his stripes singing
such burly Wagnerian repertoire as ``Die Meistersinger,'' he delves
into the more intimate turf of German lieder. Heppner shows an
impressively wide tonal and emotional range, as adept at essaying a
folk-like Beethoven phrase as a lyrical Schumann melody. Liszt's
operatic ``Three Sonnets of Petrarch'' thrusts him over the top at
times, but taking chances is among Heppner's most admirable
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   -- RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Poly Sci''
</P>
<P>
   John Forte. Ruffhouse/Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   John Forte made his bow on the biggest-selling rap album by a
group, the Fugees' ``The Score,'' then lit up the remix of Fugee
Wyclef Jean's ``Gone Til November.'' So, in the words of Forte's
own single, ``All You Gotta Do,'' all he had to do was make a
record and this debut should have been a hit by affiliation.
Instead, it suffers from his affiliations. Too often Forte's mild
delivery is too much like Jean's, whose real strength, by the way,
is production. So even with Jean's assistance on the production
boards, what Forte comes up with is a second-tier Wyclef record.
</P>
<P>
   -- SOUNDTRACK
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Columbia. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Space rock, heavy on buzz-and-crunch impact. That's what you'd
expect to find on this soundtrack of the doomsday-asteroid thriller
``Armageddon.'' And you'd be wrong. Instead, Columbia has assembled
a surprisingly lightweight collection of pop-rock, little of it
new. There's a generous helping from the ever-feisty Aerosmith,
including two new songs: the gleefully boisterous ``What Kind of
Love Are You On?'' and the ballad ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.''
Folk-rocker Shawn Colvin adds a bubbly cover of World Party's
``When the Rainbow Comes.'' But the rest is strictly fluff and
filler, with lackluster efforts from Journey, Bob Seger, Bon Jovi
and former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin.

 &HT;    For McCorkle, charm goes only so far
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED

<P>
   In recent years, almost every Southern fiction writer has faced
a common problem when publishing a book. If the author is male, he
will be compared to Faulkner; if female, to Eudora Welty or
Flannery O'Connor. The reviewer will complain either that the
author is derivative of these illustrious forebears or is guilty of
New South trendiness, ignoring the richness of Southern literary
tradition. Either way, it often seems the contemporary writer can't
win.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Cormac McCarthy must grind his teeth each time he
encounters the adjective ``Faulknerian,'' and few reviews of Mary
Hood's work fail to mention O'Connor. So it isn't surprising that
Jill McCorkle, author of five novels and two collections of
stories, recently has been called ``our contemporary Eudora
Welty.'' Like the great Mississippi writer, McCorkle has a deft
comic touch and is a keen observer of Southern manners, in all
their complexity and frequent absurdity; her vision is also
similarly humane, revealing the foibles of her characters but
withholding harsh judgments or violent epiphanies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, McCorkle's new collection lacks the penetrating
insight into human nature and the storytelling artistry that mark
the work of her most talented contemporaries, let alone Welty.
While notable for their headlong energy and surface charm, most of
McCorkle's new stories are merely clever rather than memorable.
</P>
<P>
   This cleverness is plainly visible in some of her titles. In
``Your Husband Is Cheating on Us,'' a mistress addresses her
lover's wife, suggesting they join forces and poison their mutual
friend. ``It's a Funeral! RSVP!'' is narrated by a woman who throws
parties for terminally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   A line from the latter story illustrates a problem that hobbles
many of these tales: ``I know I'm rambling,'' the woman admits,
``but it's important that I lead you to the moment of
realization.'' Rather than tell a story, McCorkle's obtrusive
narrators merely harangue the reader, and though their monologues
are sometimes entertaining, they seldom achieve much narrative
coherence or dramatic impact.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the characters particularly likable: In ``Life
Prerecorded,'' a pregnant woman finds it amusing that she cannot
stop smoking cigarettes; in ``Last Request,'' an even more callous
narrator observes that her dying mother ``struggled up a little
from her pillow and squeezed my wrist. I didn't trust her as far as
she could spit, which at that moment was no further than her bottom
lip.''
</P>
<P>
   The best story, ``Paradise,'' actually has a plot, dialogue and
a satisfying resolution. A northern Jew named Adam meets a Southern
girl named Eve at a wedding; after enduring predictable jokes about
their names, they embark on a touching, beautifully observed
romance. McCorkle's descriptive gifts are at their best here. When
the couple goes to a motel for their first tryst, Eve's dress lies
``crumpled in the corner, like some ghost of the Victorian era that
had pulled up a chair to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   If most of the stories in ``Final Vinyl Days'' strain to be
clever and amusing, it must be acknowledged they often achieve this
aim. One can't help feeling, however, that this talented author is
settling for too little, cheating not only her readers but herself.
</P>
<P>
   Final Vinyl Days and Other Stories. By Jill McCorkle. Algonquin.
$18.95. 212 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Clever and amusing, but not quite memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Johnson's most recent books include ``Pagan Babies,'' a
novel, and ``I Am Dangerous,'' his third collection of stories. He
teaches in the graduate writing program at Kennesaw State
University.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't

 &HT;    NEA head Ivey pledges to forge new ties, move beyond past gaffes
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 12: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking in his Capitol Hill office earlier this year, Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-N.C.) described himself as ``a conservative who thinks
the National Endowment for the Arts has done some good things but
has got to stop doing dumb things.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaned forward, thumped his forearms on his desk for emphasis
and added, ``The NEA has to prove that it matters to more than 5 or
10 percent of the voters, not just Barbra Streisand and that
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to swing congressmen such as Ballenger _ a hearty
plastics manufacturer who plans to vote for maintaining the NEA's
budget at $98 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ the
loved-and-loathed agency is enjoying its most encouraging prospects
in several summers. Thanks to a recent Supreme Court ruling against
Karen Finley, the so-called ``chocolate-smeared woman,'' the NEA
can continue to follow an 8-year-old law mandating ``general
standards of decency'' in its grants and therefore avoid the ``dumb
things'' in its past _ controversial grants that had remained
targets of anger and ridicule long after they occurred, during the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to last month's swearing-in of NEA Chairman William
Ivey _ a presidential choice so popular that he required no
confirmation hearings _ the 33-year-old agency appears to be on the
populist road Ballenger recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA has turned a corner,'' says Adrian King, a former
agency staffer who now heads arts and education programs for the
Coca-Cola Foundation. ``That old rag has been wrung out,'' he says
of the immorality charge. ``The question now is not so much `Will
the NEA survive?' but `How will it adapt to the demands of the
future?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey is already offering clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to form stronger partnerships with the business
community, rethink those relationships'' says Ivey, 53, who as the
former head of Nashville's Country Music Foundation enjoys close
ties with music industry executives. ``And the concern I'm hearing
from leaders in the arts as well as politics is: getting outside
the major cities, widening the circle for what constitutes artistic
excellence,'' Ivey adds from his Washington office. ``I believe in
what Vice President (Al) Gore says about a government of `customer
service' for the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) is now angrier that ``My
district doesn't get a penny from the NEA!'' than about the issues
of decency that have consumed him in years past. In a recent
telephone interview, he offered no complaints about specific grants
for fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Populist style, substance
</P>
<P>
   The process of shaking off the NEA's bicoastal, ``elitist''
image actually accelerated from 1993 to 1997 under the leadership
of actress Jane Alexander, who as agency chairman not only visited
all 50 states but championed such community-based events as Navajo
silversmithing in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under Alexander, working with tighter grant guidelines and only
about 60 percent of her predecessors' budget, money often shifted
away from such big-city flagships as the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra, which in spite of continued excellence could no longer
expect general support in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with arts education for young people emerging
as one of the few NEA missions that appeals to conservatives as
much as liberals, ``education'' has become a magical buzzword,
changing old patterns of grant distribution. That may explain why
the Atlanta Ballet, snubbed in the past for general support, this
year landed a $50,000 grant for an educational program.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was no elitist, but _ as a forthright female with a
Boston accent and many show business friends _ she sometimes
appeared to be. By contrast, Ivey, after 27 years in Nashville, has
the down-home style to go with the populist substance. Said
Ballenger, the Streisand nonfan, of Ivey on the eve of his
confirmation: ``I hear he's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Support in the Senate
</P>
<P>
   Two of the NEA's most powerful opponents, evangelist Pat
Robertson and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, declined to comment for
this story. Robertson was among the conservative leaders who
inspired Gingrich in May to form a ``Values Action Team,'' with the
elimination of the NEA among its goals.
</P>
<P>
   But even NEA critic Hoekstra concedes that the agency probably
will survive the perennial summer wrangling in Congress, largely
because of bipartisan Senate support. As Gingrich wrote in his 1997
book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way'': ``The social pressure of
(arts-loving) elites has always been felt more strongly in the
Senate than in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the support of President Clinton, who proposed
boosting the NEA's budget to $136 million, and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who made a passionate statement in defense of the
NEA at Ivey's swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons clearly want the arts to be an important part of
their legacy,'' Ivey says.
</P>
<P>
   A gun-shy agency?
</P>
<P>
   Though heartened by Ivey's popularity, many arts leaders are
dismayed that the social value of public grants to the arts _ which
are far higher, per capita, in many European countries _ is still
questioned in America. And they are troubled by what they see as a
timid, gun-shy NEA that has abandoned direct gifts to individual
artists in all categories but literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw out the baby with the bath water, took away money
from the very source of spontaneity and creativity,'' declares Rick
Hutto, chairman of the Georgia Council for the Arts, which
continues to receive hefty NEA grants but is prevented by both NEA
rules and the state from channeling money to individual artists.
</P>
<P>
   It may be no coincidence that Atlanta's Nexus Contemporary Art
Center recently received a $40,000 grant for the exhibition ``Home
and Place ... Traditional Southern Vernacular Arts and Crafts,''
which on the basis of the NEA announcement sounds surprisingly safe
by that intown museum's edgy standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves pre-editing grant applications,'' says Nexus
curator Teresa Bramlette. When asked whether she could mention
deserving projects that don't dare apply for grants now, she
replied with a rueful laugh, ``Yes, but I won't! We have to live
with this perception of whininess.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Vernell Marshall is a prime example of a painter who could
contribute to Atlanta's artistic life with an NEA grant. Without
one, she can no longer afford to maintain her studio-home here.
Marshall, who makes about $25,000 a year from her art, was packing
up, preparing to move in with her sister in Washington, when she
said by telephone, ``Artists are at the bottom of the food chain;
we get little respect. We're commentators on life, and the
marketplace doesn't always want to hear the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   John McFall, artistic director of the Atlanta Ballet, says the
future of the arts is imperiled when ``a choreographer in his 20s,
with a vision and a passion, can't get the kind of NEA grant that
got me on my feet in the '60s. And yet there's nothing to replace
the NEA for giving an artist presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Charles ``Pete'' McTier, president of the Woodruff
Foundation, says the NEA's stamp of approval remains as
indispensable as ever in leveraging grants from other sources, in
``an environment where the arts are in competition with other
social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reclaiming territory
</P>
<P>
   Despite his belief in ``partnering'' between the arts and
business, and in spreading the wealth around the map _ beliefs that
happen to have broad political appeal right now _ Ivey says he
won't retreat on the issue of funding individual artists. In fact,
he'll try to reclaim some of the territory of risk lost over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on us to go to Congress and argue our case about
getting back into the business of funding artists,'' Ivey says.
``Artists are at the foundation of our cultural life, and we must
find a way to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, McFall says, are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA has been falling away from a core value: free
expression. And isn't that what our whole country is founded on?''

 &HT;    Williams, Damon lend heft to touchy-feely `Good Will'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Good Will Hunting'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A superior After School Special for adults (with oral sex jokes,
no less), this Oscar-winning charmer, written by boyhood pals Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck, isn't the masterpiece the Academy Award
voters would have you believe. But what it is _ a literate,
beautifully acted, character-driven movie _ has become so rare at
the multiplex that it seemed revolutionary when it hit screens last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Damon plays Will Hunting, a Boston Southie who gets by as a
janitor at M.I.T. The truth is, though, that he's a mathematical
genius, emotionally hindered by a series of foster homes and bad
breaks. That's where Robin Williams steps in, as a court-appointed
shrink who spars with Damon in their sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics are familiar, whether it's Damon's faux father-son
relationship with Williams or the boy-meets-girl-loses-girl
subplot, with Minnie Driver as a brainy British college babe who
falls for Will. But thanks to Gus Van Sant's textured direction and
the smart performances (including a genuinely Oscar-worthy turn by
Williams), the flick is a shaggy charmer. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Other movies with Matt Damon: ``The Rainmaker,'' ``Courage Under
Fire,'' ``Chasing Amy'' (with Affleck), ``School Ties.''

 &HT;    `Plus' diapers let toddlers extend freedom of infancy
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's here and it's huge: the first plus-size disposable diaper
for full-figured babies and toddlers who run from the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pampers' diaper for children 35 pounds and larger hit
store-- this summer, the company's customer service line has been
jammed with parents calling to find out where the diapers can be
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Pampers developed the line because children are larger and
potty-train later.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sara O'Heron, who runs the Maternal Child Health Center at
the Emory Clinic in Fayetteville, Ga., can relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful. I know from my own daughter, kids are
bigger. We had to go to the adult Attends and she was just 2,''
O'Heron said, referring to disposable briefs for incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the largest disposable diaper was for children over
30 pounds. Diaper manufacturers assumed that children would be
toilet-trained by the time they outgrew that size. But the
convenience of disposables, coupled with more relaxed attitudes
from parents and pediatricians, has stretched a child's
diaper-wearing years well into toddlerhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, just 22 percent of children were potty-trained by age 2
1/2, compared with 90 percent in 1961, according to the American
Academy of Pediatrics. Although 60 percent had given up diapers by
age 3, about 2 percent still were not trained at age 4. The new
Size 6 diapers are aimed at children older than 2 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Denmark of Alpharetta, Ga., who at 100 is the country's
oldest practicing physician, said her children were going to the
toilet at 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd squat them down and say, `Grunt, sister, grunt,''' Denmark
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows that some children cling to their diapers like a
security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a child in here 4 years old who sits on his heels to
keep from going to the bathroom,'' she said.

 &HT;    Arnett not to be further reprimanded
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--CNN decided Wednesday not to take any further action
against correspondent Peter Arnett for his role in the Operation
Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett met with CNN chairman Tom Johnson, CNN International
president Eason Jordan and others Wednesday and defended his
involvement in the Tailwind story. Arnett has said he was only
reading from a script prepared by producers and was not responsible
for the story, which CNN was forced to retract July 30.
</P>
<P>
   CNN had announced a reprimand for Arnett, best known as the
network's correspondent in Baghdad during the Persian Gulf War, as
part of its retraction and apology. But it also had announced that
two producers had been fired, and Pam Hill, the senior executive
producer of ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conference calls between Johnson and CNN
employees Monday and Tuesday, staffers raised questions as to
whether Arnett had been given more lenient treatment than the
producers because of his status at the network.
</P>
<P>
   After executives talked to Arnett and deliberated for most of
the day Wednesday, CNN released a statement that read: ``Peter
Arnett's reprimand stands. No further personnel actions are
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was called back from his vacation in Oregon on Tuesday to
confer with Johnson. Before the meeting, Arnett had defended his
role in the Tailwind story, saying he had only conducted three of
the interviews, and then was reading questions prepared by the
report's producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of the team, but I didn't have surpervising
authority ... I was the face,'' Arnett told The New York Times
before Wednesday's meeting. ``There was nothing I could do to halt
the onward rush of this story.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which aired June 7 on the debut of ``NewsStand,''
alleged that U.S. military forces in Laos used sarin nerve gas in
1970. An independent investigation found that there was
insufficient evidence to support the charge, and CNN apologized to
viewers and military personnel involved.

 &HT;    TV newsmagazines have similar heirarchies
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executive producer. Senior producer. This producer. That
producer.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Tailwind story retraction has brought to the forefront the
myriad of personnel deep inside the broadcast and cable networks
who work on stories for TV's newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although every newsmagazine _ from ``Dateline NBC'' to CBS' ``60
Minutes'' _ functions somewhat differently, they have developed an
editorial heirarchy with very distinct roles:
</P>
<P>
   -- Executive Producer _ EPs, as they are usually called, are
responsible for the entire show. They are involved in hiring and
firing personnel, budgeting, the program's format, and approving
the final edits of the stories that are scheduled to appear on the
show. They rarely get involved in the reporting stage, unless the
story is sensitive or controversial.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senior Producers _ They function as traffic cops and are
responsible for sifting through story proposals from segment
producers. They green-light story ideas they deem newsworthy, and
reject those that don't make the grade. Once a story has been
approved, they keep tabs on its progress as its being reported, and
screen rough edits of subjects being interviewed for the story.
</P>
<P>
   -- Producers _ Responsible for generating story ideas, doing
legwork, lining up interviews, conducting pre-interviews, writing
scripts, and supervising the editing of the story. Producers are
considered the ground troops who must have a clear idea of where a
story is going, and make the necessary adjustments when it changes
course. At a newspaper, the producer would perform many of the same
functions as a newspaper reporter whose byline ultimately appears
on a story.
</P>
<P>
   -- Associate Producers and Researchers _ Perform adminstrative
and journalstic grunt work such as fact-checking and scheduling for
upper-level producers. May also be involved in some of the
preliminary reporting.
</P>
<P>
   -- Correspondents _ Some act as traditional reporters who are
involved in every level of the story from inception to editing.
Some are merely celebrity journalists who ``parachute'' in when
most of the work has already been done to conduct interviews that
will be seen on-air, provide narration, and tape opening and
closing segments. And in some cases, they are glorified script
readers who are merely ``fronting'' stories that have been prepared
in advance by production staffers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Attorneys _will ``vet'' the story, especially controversial
ones to make sure they are not slanderous and unnecessarily expose
the network to lawsuits. Depending on the nature of the story, the
attorney will view everything from the rough-cuts to the network's
on-air promotions for the story.

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

 c.1997 Consumers Digest
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 By ABBY TANNENBAUM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

 From American Way magazine. c.1997 Jim Shanin 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

MOTEL MAKEOVER: NO ROOM FOR KITSCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESERT HOT SPRINGS, Calif. _ For 15 years Miracle Manor, a divey
1940s motel 10 miles northeast of Palm Springs, seemed scripted
more than operated by Lois Blackhill, a sometimes-topless facialist
noted for channeling a spirit named Omra.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackhill attracted an unusual cast of characters to this
Southern California Lourdes, which sits atop a geyser reputed to
gush the most balanced mineral water in America into its spa and
pool. She was the crazy aunt in the desert whose eccentric family
charm attracted off-the-marquee movie-industry people and others
who wanted to park themselves in a balmy anonymous nowhere for a
good read and a long soak.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fashion model in Paris and a cabaret singer in North
Africa and later a globe-trotter with a particular interest in
China, Ms. Blackhill was the impresario of a real-time sitcom. When
she died of cancer in 1996, her ashes were sprinkled under the
fronds in the motel's garden. She would be a hard act to follow.
Could there ever be a sequel to Lois?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the rusty neon sign is lighted again. The modest stucco
establishment, with zoomy roofs lifting off toward a long desert
view, now belongs to a Los Angeles couple, April Greiman, a
designer, and Michael Rotondi, an architect, both regulars at the
motel since the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became available, we didn't think twice,'' Rotondi
said. ``We wanted a place in the desert with water as a second
home.'' As for running a motel, he said: ``It's real intimate, like
having house guests, except everyone who stays out here helps pay
the mortgage. We think of ourselves as managers who stay here for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   The internationally known designers want to maintain this pokey
corner of a town of 15,500 people that has seen better days: the
down-home retreat, a two-hour drive from Los Angeles built in the
late '40s with charm that only an architect would notice, is an
unlikely object of their affection.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the two set about remodeling the pool-side complex,
inventing a new character for the place, paying for the furnishings
with their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction cost about $100,000 total,'' said Ms.
Greiman, whose diversified practice includes the design of books,
dinnerware, interactive television and Internet prototypes and most
recently the graphic identity and image for the aviation exhibition
``2003 Dayton Century of Flight.'' (Her posters have been collected
by the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.)
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi, after a decade as the director of the avant-garde
Southern California Institute of Architecture, is now focusing on
his architectural practice. ``Our conceptual framework was to treat
every practical issue as an esthetic one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-room retreat, whose charm was its modesty, resisted a
glamorous makeover. The original 1940s design consisted of two
small stucco-covered frame buildings with angled roofs, wrapped
around a courtyard. The property also contained the pool and an
enclosed spa of naturally heated water. Rotondi, well known for
complex residential and institutional designs that refer to the
myths of the surrounding landscape, had to exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought of ripping the roof off to create a secondary
structure on top, but I got it out of my system,'' he said. ``A
real active physical design wouldn't be relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Naugahyde chair in every corner and wall-to-wall shag
carpeting throughout, the Manor was a minor miracle of kitsch, but
in the hands of Ms. Greiman and Rotondi, it was in for a life
change.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to put people in the desert without the interference
of decor. Their decision to simplify and clean out the rooms and
grounds meant returning the motel to its pre-Lois days, when it was
a set of rudimentary buildings. The pair inherited an architect's
large painted rendering of the complex, with happy-hour
champagne-bubble steppingstones around the pool and buildings with
a purity equal to the desert's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the buildings for being so straightforward
and generic,'' Rotondi said. ``They epitomize the problem of the
motel in the desert, this small building in a huge landscape. The
idea was to be elemental, not intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   They re-established the original shapes and, where the
air-conditioners had been, opened exterior walls with 2-by-8-foot
horizontal windows to capture desert panoramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many motels we've visited weren't conducive to the experience
of the desert,'' Rotondi said. ``Often they have wall-to-wall
carpeting, windows sized for ventilation instead of views, and
heavy furniture and curtains better in the city. The way the rooms
were cluttered with synthetic materials, you just wanted to crash
and leave.'' He added, ``What we talked about was how to keep
people in a room rather than letting the furniture force them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greiman said: ``A lot of people liked the kitsch _ it was
like a time warp. But we wanted it to be visually quiet and serene.
The desert outside is an awesome landscape, so we wanted the rooms
to be monastic, with a kind of interior life that allowed quiet and
peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greiman and Rotondi opted for understatement. Clothes hang
on a simple rod sticking out from a wall or go into boxes that
wheel under the platform beds. Simple birch plywood floor panels
are inset within cool-to-the-feet concrete borders. Long desks of
plywood (with snake lamps hanging from above) accommodate those who
arrive with their laptops. The generous headboards contain reading
lights. A room without a kitchen costs $80 a night; with a kitchen,
$125.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is happy with the makeover. ``It's like your
parents sold the house you grew up in, and it was renovated,'' said
Dane Holweger, a movie production designer, who remains faithful to
Ms. Blackhill's interpretation. ``The place is starting over again,
and that's fine _ it'll have to create its own history.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Holweger have done? ``I would have devoted each room
to a decade _ '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s period room. I wouldn't be
interested in doing a '90s room. There's no kitsch value in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The motel's exterior almost failed to get Jamie Adams, a
painter, and Stephanie Silverman, an actress and writer, out of
their car when they found the place by mistake. ``But it turned out
to be exactly our take: no TVs, nice and quiet,'' Ms. Silverman
said. ``In the other places around here, you don't want to stay
around _ very noisy, with karaoke rooms and deejays on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would Lois think?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I was here, strange things happened,'' said
Brandi Chase, who started working as caretaker at the Miracle Manor
motel several months ago. ``The hot spa would go up to 150 degrees
and then down to 80. So, I decided to introduce myself to Lois. And
after that everything mellowed out.'' &QL;

FAMILY OF DEAD NIGERIAN LEADER ACCUSES MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As experts from three countries flew to Nigeria to perform an
autopsy on Moshood Abiola, who had been Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner, Abiola's relatives accused the military regime
of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The government of General Abdulsalam Abubakar insisted again
Wednesday that Abiola _ widely seen as the winner of the country's
1993 presidential election _ had died of natural causes on Tuesday.
He collapsed during a meeting in a &UR;  &LR; government villa with visiting
US officials and was rushed to a hospital with US Under Secretary
of State Thomas Pickering at his side. Doctors could not revive him
and said the 60-year-old businessman had suffered cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After initially accepting the Abubakar regime's explanation that
there was no foul play, American officials were cautious Wednesday
not to concur with the military government. ``Up to this point, we
have seen no evidence that Chief Abiola died of anything other than
natural causes,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Wednesday. Acknowledging the Abiola family's doubts, though, he
expressed hope that a team of American, Canadian and British
pathologists would be allowed to perform an autopsy ``that is as
independently and credibly conducted as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The military anulled the 1993 election, which Abiola won by a
large margin. A year later the military imprisoned Abiola, a
millionaire from the Yoruba-speaking southwest region of Nigeria,
for declaring himself the country's elected president.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in solitary confinement _ with almost no
contact with friends, relatives, lawyers or doctors _ Abiola was
supposed to be released this week. The American delegation had been
negotiating a transition to democracy with the military regime.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the coronors decide, Rubin said, Nigeria's
military ultimately bears the blame for the death. ``We made very
clear that we think that he should never had been in prison, and
therefore any consequence of him being in prison is the
responsibility of the government that wrongly put him in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of Abiola's 18 children gathered in their apartment in
suburban Maryland Wednesday, accepting the calls of well-wishers
and democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Abiola's children do not believe that he died from
natural causes,'' said Randall Echols, the Abiola family's
representative in Washington. ``What is incredible is that the
military government did this in front of the Americans. You
couldn't even imagine that in a James Bond movie _ the elected
president of a country would be poisoned in front of American
diplomats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abiola children had spoken with US officials and heard
first-hand accounts of their father's death, but they continue to
believe that he had been poisoned shortly before Tuesday's meeting,
Echols said. ``The circumstances scream foul play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abubakar regime agreed to the Abiola family's request for an
independent autopsy. The United States sent two military
pathologists, Britain sent one and Candada sent the chief coroner
of the province of Ontario. In addition, Physicians for Human
Rights, a non-profit group, dispatched John Pless, head of the
National Association of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   The experts will probably conduct the autopsy today, said
Leonard Rubenstein, executive director for the human rights group,
which is based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hafsat Abiola, 23, the daughter who has become the family's
spokeswomen, said on Tuesday that she was considering a trip to her
homeland for the funeral, which is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because she has been so outspoken in her criticisms of Abubakar
and his predecessor, General Sani Abacha, Abiola has been warned
not to travel to Nigeria. She was unable to go to the funeral of
her mother, Kudirat, who was shot and killed a day before Hafsat
was to graduate from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives still blame the military government for that
killing, which was never investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is devastated _ they are complete orphans now
because their mother was murdered and now their father has been
taken out,'' Echols said.

JAPANESE LEADER OFFERS TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As support for Japan's government plummets and polls
show the ruling party slipping in the run-up to Sunday's
parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made a
late bid Wednesday to win votes and instill confidence in markets:
He promised to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to cut taxes is a time-honored crowd-pleaser. But what
makes Hashimoto's 11th-hour gambit so unusual is that it's his
third statement on taxes since last Friday _ and the second time
since then he's flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's waffling on taxes is understandable given that
Japan's deficit is one of the largest in the industrialized world;
the country needs revenue to meet the worst budget shortfall since
1981. Moreover, Japan has one of the world's oldest populations; by
2020, one in four Japanese will be on social security _ an argument
against cutting taxes now.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan also needs a cash injection into an economy suffering
its worst recession since World War II, and Hashimoto is under
intense pressure from investors and the United States to cut taxes
to jump-start consumption. The problem is that historically,
Japanese increase their savings, not their spending, when taxes are
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are running scared, and I think this is the last
big piece of ammo they're going to pull out and fire at the
opposition,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Matsui
Marine Research Institute. ``Hashimoto sees the specter of his
demise, and this is part of his strategy to stay on as prime
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's back-and-forth on tax cuts has exasperated and
disillusioned many here, but it is emblematic of the larger
confusion and disarray over how to revive Japan's long-suffering
economy. The economy has become the sole issue in the upcoming
elections, and the elections, in turn, have become a referendum on
the ruling party's competence.
</P>
<P>
   How well the parties sell their reform packages in these last
days of the campaign will determine who is able to form a
government to preside over Japan's long-overdue restructuring. &UR;  &LR; But
even the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, it seems, has not yet
decided what form restructuring should take.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Hashimoto said he wanted ``permanent tax reform,''
a statement widely understood to mean permanent, rather than
one-time, tax cuts. The next day, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
said permanent tax cuts were part of the government's platform. By
Sunday, however, Hashimoto insisted he had never promised a
permanent tax cut, and the next day a spokesman for Obuchi said the
foreign minister had issued a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Wednesday, after one newspaper survey showed support for
Hashimoto's government had dropped to 28.5 percent, and other polls
suggested his party might lose seats in the upcoming election _ a
failure that could force him to resign _ the prime minister said
again that he supported tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes these guys look like the Keystone Cops running around
with everyone saying something different, leaving people wondering
who is running the show. It further undermines the already
questionable credibility of the ruling party,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are confused too. A poll by Asahi Shimbun newspaper
published Wednesday said that 59 percent of voters are not
affiliated with a party, and most of them have not decided who they
will vote for on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuhiro Okudaira, professor emeritus at the University of
Tokyo's Institute of Social Sciences, said the government's
behavior has disillusioned voters: ``When the government hasn't
succeeded in improving the situation, people get tremendously
pessimistic and that doesn't necessarily'' inspire them to vote.
Okudaira called Hashimoto's latest statement on taxes ``too little,
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Hashimoto did not give many specifics Wednesday, saying
merely that he would not now raise the minimum taxable income to
pay for a tax cut for the rich, and that he wanted a decision on
corporate taxes by the end of the year. The tax rate for businesses
can now run as high as 46 percent, while the income tax rate for
the wealthiest individuals is 65 percent.

 &HT;      GORE SWEARS IN MAINER FOR CHILEAN POST
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 8 -- With his left hand on the Bible and his
right hand raised before Vice President Al Gore, Maine lawyer John
O'Leary swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States in
his newest job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, Mr. Ambassador,'' Gore said Wednesday,
welcoming O'Leary into the diplomatic world as U.S. ambassador to
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's tickets to Santiago have already been purchased, and
he'll arrive in Chile at the end of the month. His diplomatic
abilities will be tested quickly, as he deals with the aftermath of
a dispute between the Maine and Chilean salmon industries and the
continuing controversy surrounding the White House decision to
promote the sale of F-16 fighter jets to the newly democratic
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   After the 30-minute ceremony, O'Leary said his role was to
continue to promote the growth between the United States and Chile.
While Maine's salmon industry may claim that Chilean salmon fishers
are dumping their product at below-market prices in America,
O'Leary said that is only one element to a broad relationship that
covers $4.5 billion in U.S. exports and $2.5 billion in Chilean
imports to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time, there will be disputes,'' he said. The
salmon dispute, however, could be settled before O'Leary arrives in
Santiago, as the International Trade Commission is expected to
issue a final ruling on the dispute next week.
</P>
<P>
   A former city councilor and mayor of Portland, now a partner at
Maine's largest firm, Pierce Atwood in Portland, O'Leary was sworn
in in the White House Roosovelt Room, in front of such luminaries
as former Maine Gov. Joe Brennan and former Federal Communications
Commissioner Reed Hundt -- who was O'Leary's roommate at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   His years of work in the Democratic Party, and his connection to
Hundt, a close friend of Gore's, led to the Clinton administration
picking O'Leary to lead a 1993 U.S. delegation in helping Bolivia
craft new environmental laws. That pro bono work led to other
assignments in South America, and eventually to the nomination as
Chilean ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   With bipartisan support from Reps. Tom Allen, D-Portland, and
John Baldacci, D-Bangor, and Maine's Republican senators, Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins, O'Leary's nomination sailed through the
Senate for his confirmation and a swearing-in ceremony in two
months.

FRANCE IN THE FINALS AFTER DEFEATING CROATIA, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Les Bleus finally devised a way to solve
their scoring problems. They left the scoring to Lilian Thuram, a
Guadeloupe-born, Italy-based defender, to take a 2-1 victory over
Croatia in the World Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The result set up the tournament organizers' dream final -- the
host nation against Brazil at Stade de France Sunday. The French
appear capable of defending against the Brazilians, even without
Laurent Blanc, suspended after being ejected against Croatia, but
their offense remains extremely questionable.
</P>
<P>
   France's strikers have converted only five of the team's 12
goals in six games, so coach Aimee Jacquet started this game with
one forward. Predictably, the French produced little offensive
cohesiveness, even after striker Thierry Henry entered in the first
half Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Davor Suker's first-minute goal in the second half,
Thuram's forward forays caught the Croats off guard and produced
the tying score in the second minute and the winner 22 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to play against Croatia,'' Jacquet said. ``They
put you off stride and they have some extremely good individuals.
That is why it was hard for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prepared for this qualification and we deserve it.
Obviously, Brazil are the masters of world football and it is an
exciting prosepct to play against them. They are the greatest team
in this World Cup, as they showed against a Holland team which
played extremely well (Tuesday). They have dominated and beaten
teams at will.''
</P>
<P>
   Croatia has also been in a defensive posture in this tournament,
but the Croats seemed more dangerous than the French, at least
until Zvonimir Boban departed with an injury 20 minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   France did not have even a semblance of an attacking formation
-- it began with three defensive midfielders in an ostensible 4-5-1
alignment which has been described as an 8-2 -- until Henry
replaced Christian Karembeu in the 31st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's strategy of patiently waiting to capitalize on
opponents' mistakes nearly paid off in the final minute of the
first half. Robert Jarni, who scored the first goal in injury time
in the first half of a 3-0 win over Germany, advanced on the left
side and earned a free kick on the edge of the penalty area. Fabian
Barthez easily handled the free kick, and attempted to launch a
counterattack, but found only lone striker Stephane Guivarc'h
surrounded by two defenders with goalkeeper Drazen Ladic
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats seemed anything but underdogs. They attacked and
defended confidently, even arrogantly. In the 11th minute, Suker
forced a corner after penetrating to the edge of the goal area
against Blanc and Marcel Desailly. Suker then calmly walked into
the goal and drank from one of Barthez's water bottles, spitting
out much of the contents in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for Germany's aerial attack, Croatia coach Miroslav
Blazevic had used a war analogy, noting that how Rommel's tanks had
been vanquished by the English against the odds. Whatever Blazevic
used to motivate the team this time was equally effective.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia struck 25 seconds into the second half, as Aljosa
Asanovic skillfully dribbled through two opponents, and chipped a
pass against the flow to Suker. France retaliated desperately, as
Thuram moved into attack. Thuram took the ball off Boban, then took
a return pass from Youri Djorkaeff and slotted the shot to tie the
score in the second minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As so often happens, you score and the opponent scores
immediately after, they draw a lot of strength from that,''
Blazevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram put France ahead, working a combination with Henry, and
taking advantage of some leniency by Spanish referee Jose Garcia
Aranda by knocking Jarni off the ball inside the penalty area.
Thuram's left-footed finish into the far side of the net caught
Ladic flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Lizarazu was felled by Mario Stanic, who was
cautioned. Blanc advanced for the free kick, and tangled with
Slaven Bilic, who went down, embellishing the effect of a hard,
open-handed strike by Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram, the top-rated foreigner in Italy's Serie A with Parma
last season, has been making threatening runs on the right side for
the entire tournament, but seldom created scoring chances -- until
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the organization of the team, our defenders are
more attacking wing backs,'' Jacquet said. ``It's good for the team
that he scored and, in any case, great reward for how France
played. It's not really his position, but it is one he likes
playing, and it's good for the team to have him there.''

   WASHINGTON _ The first high-definition telecasts are only months
away, but the problems posed for consumers, broadcasters, cable
operators and programmers by the new technology are as razor-sharp
as the images that will soon go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has ordered the industry to relinquish its current VHF
and UHF channels by 2006, the date when nearly all Americans will
supposedly be watching sets equipped for digital television (DTV).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to put their feet to the fire in keeping that
commitment,'' Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., said Wednesday after holding a hearing on a host of
unresolved DTV issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``But frankly,'' McCain added, ``meeting that deadline was a
joke from the very beginning. We wrote that law because the auction
(of the current TV channels) was supposed to bring in $20 billion
and balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the imminent promise of much higher quality wide-screen
images and sound resulting from the first basic change in U.S.
television standards in 60 years, McCain often focused on the dark
side of the picture. He put skeptical questions to a panel of
industry witnesses who, often as not, found themselves at odds with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cable subscribers face the possibility of losing valued
channels of cable programming as the price of their systems' having
to accommodate all their local broadcasters' new digital
channels,'' the senator noted.
</P>
<P>
   Full-scale DTV transmissions will require cable outlets to use
at least double the number of current channels to accommodate the
same amount of programming.
</P>
<P>
   New TV sets arriving in the stores before Christmas can handle
all 18 DTV formats approved by the Federal Communications
Commission. But if station owners decide to ``multiplex'' their
signals, adopting a lower-definition format, as many as eight cable
channels may be required for each one that is in use today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to get squeezed out,'' McCain predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That was the prime concern of Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's founder,
chairman and frequent on-air host, who saw the coming conversion to
DTV as ``a large train wreck in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If 'must carry' status is granted to (local) digital broadcast
signals, the C-SPAN networks, and, most important, the American
people who watch the Senate and the House on television, will be
harmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Murphy Burns, who heads a family-owned
broadcasting firm with four stations in Washington state and
Wisconsin, claimed an industry smashup would occur if the FCC fails
to adopt ``must carry'' rules.
</P>
<P>
   If initial buyers of DTV sets ``cannot get their local DTV
stations over cable, and if they lack assurance that expensive DTV
sets will operate with their cable systems and other digital
devices, the transition to DTV will falter and ultimately fail no
matter how many signals we put on the air or how we program them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first DTV sets will go on sale in November and cost about
$7,000, said Alan McCollough, president of Circuit City Stores, a
major electronic retailer.
</P>
<P>
   McCollough said that ``what will entice our customers is a
dramatic breakthrough in picture performance'' for the new
wide-screen format.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, noted that
the 18 approved DTV formats offer a range of improved picture
quality. While all are sharper than today's pictures, some formats
sacrifice a degree of picture quality in exchange for the ability
to transmit other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers cannot notice the difference between competing
formats, using the most efficient format will best serve consumer
interests,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the fuzzy scene for the broadcasters, Gregory Schmidt
of Lin Television Corp. said: ``We are full speed ahead towards
DTV, although cable carriage is uncertain at best and consumers'
buying DTV sets will be frustrated by uncertainty about these sets
working with cable and about reception of DTV signals, both via
cable and over the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a potential consumer voiced his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to run out and buy one of these sets,'' Sen.
Conrad Burns, R-Mont., told the panelists. ``I don't have enough
money. I think I'll wait until you make a set that Joe Six-Pack can
afford.''

<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ It's not easy to imagine what sort of house
Barry Hannah might live in.
</P>
<P>
   The characters who saunter and stumble and soliloquize through
his heavily autobiographical fiction seem to have no home: They are
drunk at the controls of a jet or bargaining with God atop a horse
or roaring down the road in a Lincoln with beer cans rattling
around the floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   When they end up in places more domestic, they often lament what
one character in his latest collection of short stories, ``High
Lonesome'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1996), calls the ``farce of
playing house.'' They wrestle heroically, but not successfully,
with their lust. They get bored and turn to whisky or hashish or
guns. Sometimes they just wander out in the morning streets playing
a French horn and wearing an Indian headdress.
</P>
<P>
   So it is strange to step out of Hannah's Cherokee, with a basket
of bright new tennis balls in the back seat, and onto the driveway
of his modest, Eisenhower-era house in this pretty, antebellum
town.
</P>
<P>
   Susan, his wife, is the only one wrestling heroically, with the
front door, to keep their six dogs from running out. But a black
and white feist named Jill shoots across the street, where she
rousts the squirrels from the neighbors' yards. When she charges
back, Hannah squats down to her, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves for you to bow down to her when she comes back,'' he
says. ``Feists are squirrel dogs. She thinks it's her job. She
wants a little recognition.'' Then he herds her inside, where she
stretches herself out on the beige pile carpet near the big-screen
television.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Barry Hannah, the Deep South's answer to Charles
Bukowski and the man whom Truman Capote once called ``the maddest
writer in the U.S.A.,'' has mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   After a rambling life as a writer and teacher that has taken him
from South Carolina to Vermont to Alabama to Hollywood to Iowa _
and often to the depths of alcoholism and self-destruction _ Hannah
has called Oxford and the University of Mississippi, where he
teaches creative writing, home for 16 years now.
</P>
<P>
   He is nearing completion of his 12th book, a novel. He has not
had a drink in more than seven years, though he still speaks
glowingly of the insights he has gained while drinking. He says it
feels good, mostly, to be so rooted and comfortable after so many
years ``living out of a suitcase and on a motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be out at the reservoir to fish in 10 minutes,'' he
says. ``There's not a hell of a lot of things to do, but I like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long, lazy Saturday, and as the conversation wanders
easily from Elvis to Beckett to Southern women to Southern
Baptists, Hannah also seems more settled with his place as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Geronimo Rex,'' about his raucous Mississippi
youth, was nominated for the National Book Award when Hannah was
only 30. His first collection of short stories, ``Airships,'' now
considered a modern classic, prompted Larry McMurtry to call him
``the best young fiction writer to appear in the South since
Flannery O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   But while all of his books except one remain in print and he is
always mentioned on the short list of the South's best writers, he
endured a long period in which critics and even fans complained
that his frenetic, high-comic fiction had become strained. As much
as anything, it was a complaint that Hannah had fallen short of the
impossibly high mark he set for himself with his first books.
</P>
<P>
   But with his last two collections of short stories, ``Bats Out
of Hell,'' and ``High Lonesome,'' he seems to have worked himself
back to the searing, jump-cut electricity of his earlier work. At
56, Hannah says he is less bothered by bad reviews and now sees his
writing, always intensely personal, as even more of an exercise in
self-exploration. Of his new novel, tentatively titled ``Yonder
Stands Your Orphan With His Gun,'' he will say only that it is
about ``zombies of the new South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why I like writing: it's just jumping into a
pool,'' he says later in the day, smoking another of his
ever-present Marlboro reds on the balcony of Square Books, the
Oxford bookstore that has become a gathering place for Southern
writers. ``I get myself into a kind of trance. I engage the world,
but it's also wonderful to just escape. I try to find the purities
out of the confusion. It's pretty old-fashioned, but it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In what could be considered one of America's literary hometowns,
he says he works equably in the large shadow of Oxford's most
famous writer, William Faulkner, who immortalized the town's
residents as the Compsons and McCaslins, Sartorises and Snopeses.
(Hannah's father, William, who died recently, was an Ole Miss
student when Faulkner was university postmaster, and like many
townspeople then, he derisively referred to the grandiloquent
writer as ``Count No 'Count.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me to be writing in the place where he
wrote,'' Hannah says. ``I like the ghosts.'' In a piece to
commemorate Oxford's 150th anniversary, he wrote of Faulkner:
``Salute him or go away. You can't walk through a statue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah often describes his role in Oxford as a kind of lonely
bulwark against a creeping homogenization in American fiction that
has rendered it irrelevant or simply a servant of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blandness has taken over everywhere, or just idiot low
sensation,'' he complains, admitting that he would rather read good
journalism than most modern fiction. ``Because at least you've got
the truth to hang on to, whereas with fiction you just get
information with a little fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher (he recently returned to Mississippi from Iowa,
where he taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop), he also bemoans a
generation of young writers afraid to take risks. ``It's a problem
even with the talented students at Iowa, who come from
everywhere,'' he says. ``They're actually better than they used to
be, because they are older. But there is not a drunk among them.
Nobody takes drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up,'' he says, ``when people seemed actually to be
hurting themselves for their art. Of course, some of it was
phony.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds Hannah inflicted on himself for his writing were very
real. Unlike Hunter S. Thompson, he didn't cultivate a public
persona as a wild man of letters. But for years Hannah's reputation
for drinking and entertaining himself with guns was just as
legendary among writers. In an incident recounted in Esquire
magazine in 1988, he pulled out an unloaded pistol in a classroom
at the University of Alabama when students tried to walk out on his
impromptu soulful trumpet solo. According to the article, he waved
the gun, told the students, ``Now this is some bad soul _ you guys
had better learn the difference,'' and began to play again.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Hannah says, when he needed to make holes in the
walls of an apartment for stereo wires, he would use a shotgun.
When his car once filled with water during a rainstorm, he riddled
the floorboard with bullets to drain it. ``A lot of that stuff was
not a good idea, but it gets turned around by middle-class minds
into a cowboy thing,'' he says. ``It wasn't. It was just a need to
find something real, to do something that was real.''
</P>
<P>
   Of drinking, which eventually landed him in the hospital, he
stands by his comments in an interview several years ago. ``I'm not
going to come down on booze, because it's done a great deal for me,
frankly,'' he said then. ``It's like scolding an old friend now
that you don't need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Fisketjon, vice president and editor at large at Alfred A.
Knopf, who has known Hannah since the early 1980's, said that he
seemed remarkably content about ``hanging up his cup'' for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of high-wire act that goes with the
profession,'' he said. ``But I think it was closing in on him.'' He
compared Hannah's writing during that period to the playing of a
talented jazz musician that is still beautiful ``except there's no
tune there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hannah sticks mostly to a regimen of tennis, cigarettes,
coffee and iced tea. When he and his wife can, they go to Paris (a
map of the city hangs in his living room). When he is home, he sits
on the sunny porch just off the small room where he writes and
worries about the developers encroaching on his view of trees and
rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   He spends as much time as he can with his two sons and his
daughter, all of whom are now grown up and living elsewhere. He
sometimes sees his literary pals Thomas McGuane or Richard Ford, or
he talks to Robert Altman, for whom he briefly worked as a
screenwriter. And he exults in new interest in his work _ he has a
devoted following in France and recently read that members of the
rock band Pavement said he was their favorite writer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other writers he knows, Hannah does not keep regular work
hours, but when bursts of inspiration hit, he writes like a man
possessed. ``You can't expect them to come all the time,'' he says.
``You're lucky when they come.''
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, he simply settles into his living room with his
wife and their dogs to watch the Belmont Stakes on television. As
Real Quiet, the doomed favorite, rounds the home stretch with a
contender on his heels, Hannah smiles broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the noise they make when they come around that last
turn, man,'' he says. ``It sounds like the end of the world.''

MATTHEW J. HARVEY, 73; FORMER ADMINISTRATOR OF US AID AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthew Joseph Harvey, a former Boston teacher who was assistant
administrator of the US Agency for International Development during
the Nixon and Ford administrations, died at his Dennis home on the
Fourth of July. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harvey graduated from Milton (Mass.) High School and served
in the Navy before graduating in 1947 from Harvard College, where
he was a member of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduating from Harvard I taught algebra and geometry in
a Boston high school for a year and then decided to do something
about following a more active role in the world of politics,'' he
wrote in the 25th annual report of his Harvard class.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in the stock and bond business for several years while
devoting his free time to politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he was active in the Eisenhower campaign in
Massachusetts. This led to his employment as a member of the staff
of US Senator Leverett Saltonstall. He also served as an
administrative assistant to US Representative William Mailliard of
California for eight years before becoming a civil service employee
at the State Department, where he rose to assistant administrator
for US AID. He handled legislative affairs for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the Harvard annual report, he wrote that his work allowed him
to ``see firsthand the problems of the world through travel and
study'' and provided him with an opportunity to play a ``role in
trying to work out ways to alleviate the plight of people in the
less-developed countries.''
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the State Department in 1975, he was a
consultant on international and legislative affairs and taught
political science at Cape Cod Community College.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Mark of Dennis and John of Yarmouth, Mass.;
a daughter, Margaret Raunela of Dennis, Mass.; a sister, Rose
Garpestad of Staten Island, N.Y.; and a grandson.

   ``The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad
to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time,''
Jack Kerouac wrote in ``On the Road.'' The words could have been
his epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac portrayed himself as a free spirit and a wanderer,
boasting of having made love to more than 300 women. He died in
1969 at the age of 47 from the effects of alcoholism, leaving what
is believed to be one of the most valuable, and litigious, literary
estates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a new generation is discovering Kerouac and the Beats,
seeing them as agents of rebellion against middle-class
constraints. Since 1991, sales of ``On the Road'' have quadrupled,
with more than 3 million copies purchased since the novel was
published in 1957. Lines from the book are featured in ads for
Volvo, and Kerouac is pictured in his khakis in Gap ads.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the actor Johnny Depp purchased the author's old blue
raincoat from his estate for $15,000. Today, the entire Kerouac
estate _ including the royalties from his books and the sale value
of his manuscripts and belongings _ is believed to be worth close
to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac willed his estate to his mother, Gabrielle, who in turn
left it to Kerouac's third wife, Stella Sampas. When she died, she
left the estate to relatives who appointed her brother, John
Sampas, as executor. But in 1994, Kerouac's daughter from another
marriage, Jan Kerouac, whom her father had barely acknowledged in
his life, sued the estate, saying her grandmother's will had been
forged.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kerouac died in 1996. Now the fight over Kerouac's legacy
has been renewed. And it has become so bitter that a discussion
group on the Internet devoted to Kerouac and other Beat writers was
shut down in March because of accusations of threats and
harassment. Two new biographies, both claiming to unravel the myth
of Kerouac, say Kerouac created an image of himself through his
semi-autobiographical writings that was far from the truth, an
image that has lingered and has now captured the imagination of a
new generation of readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subterranean Kerouac,'' by Ellis Amburn, who edited the
author's last two books, will be published next month by St.
Martin's Press. Another book, to be released by Henry Holt in
November, ``Jack Kerouac: King of the Beats,'' is by Barry Miles, a
biographer of Allen Ginsberg and Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disparity between the image and the actual man,''
Miles said. ``He didn't live the actual Beat lifestyle. He really
lived in the suburbs with his mother,'' a fiercely overprotective
figure who was also a vocal anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   Miles depicts Kerouac himself both as a racist who said in ``On
the Road'' that he wished he were black and as an anti-Semite whose
best friend, Ginsberg, was a Jew. Kerouac banned Ginsberg from the
house because of his mother's bias. And as Kerouac grew older,
Miles said, ``he became more and more racist and anti-Semitic''
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding Behind a Playboy Image
</P>
<P>
   Miles said there was also a dissonance between Kerouac's image
as a Don Juan, and his true self. ``His sexual image is early
Playboy,'' he said. ``But in reality, he had a lot of boyfriends,''
and in his writings, Miles said, Kerouac skipped over his
homosexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pretended to be honest, which gave rise to whole idea of
spontaneous writing,'' almost free association, said Miles. ``He
was a tremendous influence on the new journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Amburn, who edited Kerouac's novels ``Desolation Angels'' and
``Vanity of Duluoz,'' based his biography on new material from the
Kerouac archives in Lowell, Mass., the author's hometown. While
other biographies have mentioned Kerouac's sexual relationships
with men, Amburn portrays his subject as a tormented figure, a
misogynist and a homophobe, torn between homosexual and
heterosexual desires and drowning his conflicts in alcohol. He said
that taking into account Kerouac's homoerotic feelings provides a
key to understanding his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most biographies say fame killed him,'' Amburn said. ``It was
alcohol that killed him because he couldn't accept his sexuality.
All the hateful streams in him are part of the same disease, of not
admitting who you are, and living your life truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   He traces Kerouac's life from what Amburn termed a crucial early
infatuation with Stella's other brother, Sammy Sampas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fell in love with Sammy Sampas, who drew him into the
Scribbler's Club at Bartlett Junior High School,'' in Lowell, said
Amburn. ``Kerouac said every Rimbaud needs a Verlaine. He said,
`Sammy was my Verlaine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amburn said Sammy was Kerouac's true love, and he married
Sammy's sister as a substitute. ``In denying that love, he went on
to lead what Henry James called `an unlived life,''' he said. ``If
you live a lie, you're going to drink and drug yourself to death.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amburn was editing ``Vanity of Duluoz,'' he said, ``Kerouac
would call me up and read me these cryptic passages. I would say,
`Would you clarify or decode these?' He would sometimes refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac's ambivalence, said Amburn, explains certain passages in
``On the Road,'' which was based on Kerouac's journey across
America with the charismatic drifter Neal Cassady. Kerouac's love
for Cassady, Amburn said, explains the devastation that the Kerouac
character, Sal Paradise, feels when Dean Moriarty, the surrogate
for Cassady, leaves him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Kerouac was fighting his sexual impulses,
said Amburn, he was desperately searching for transcendence in
Buddhism, struggling between its spiritual teachings and attempts
to drown his conflicts in drugs and alcohol. Amburn traces
Kerouac's prose style, the flow of words that Ginsberg called his
``spontaneous bop prosody,'' to Kerouac's Buddhist beliefs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Road'' was written in three weeks on one long stream of
Teletype paper. Using Kerouac's letters and his writings on
Buddhism (published last year by Viking Press in ``Some of the
Dharma,'' edited by John Sampas and David Stanford of Viking),
Amburn said he was able to depict Kerouac's style as an outgrowth
of his Buddhism. ``He would say, `You're not supposed to edit
sentences because our mind is God,''' Amburn said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Kerouac never found transcendence, Amburn said.
And he left a legacy as messy as the life he led.
</P>
<P>
   `A Gold Mine of Information'
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Kerouac's estate is embroiled in two lawsuits,
one involving the heirs of his daughter, the other with Gerald
Nicosia, author of ``Memory Babe,'' a Kerouac biography published
in 1983 by the University of California Press. Nicosia, who is Jan
Kerouac's literary executor, has charged that Jack Kerouac's
executor, John Sampas, is selling off the author's archives in
violation of his wishes that his manuscripts be given to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac said in a letter to his friend the novelist John Clellon
Holmes in 1962 ``that he wanted to create a gold mine of
information for scholars,'' with his papers, said Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
   But Jan Kerouac's heirs _ her ex-husband John Lash, who is the
general executor of her estate, and her half brother, David Bowers
_ have parted company with Nicosia. They want to settle the will,
and they are challenging Nicosia's right to block the settlement
with the Sampas family in court. A decision by a probate court in
Albuquerque, N.M., where Jan Kerouac died, is expected this summer,
paving the way for a resolution of her original lawsuit, which was
brought in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   John Sampas, who lives in Lowell, denied selling off the
archive. ``No doubt, I did sell some letters,'' he said, ``but 99
percent of the archive is intact.'' He said the material would be
``going to the public,'' after the completion, expected in 2001, of
an authorized Kerouac biography by Douglas Brinkley, a professor at
the University of New Orleans who has also written a biography of
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Nicosia said his opponents had threatened his life. ``Within the
last eight months, there has been major harassment and death
threats,'' he said. He pointed to a message on the Web site of The
Kerouac Quarterly, a literary magazine, from Paul Maher, editor of
the quarterly, who Nicosia said was allied with Sampas. The message
ended with these words: ``The Beat Generation where words still
carry the ammunition of guns. Gerry, I think they have an open
teaching post for you over at that Arkansas school.'' Nicosia said
that was an ominous reference to the recent shooting of a teacher
in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Nicosia said, ``I was sent an anonymous envelope
filled with ashes and obscenities.'' He said he did not know who
had sent it.
</P>
<P>
   Maher denied ever threatening Nicosia's life. Sampas denied any
involvement, saying, ``It's all baloney,'' and adding that he had
never participated in the Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sampas has accused Nicosia of ``stalking'' him.
``He was all over the place, yelling at me,'' said Sampas. Nicosia
called the accusation ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the various charges and accusations made their way
onto Beat-L, a Web site devoted to the Beats. ``The discussion got
so totally out of hand, it got really vile, that I closed it
down,'' said William Gargan, a librarian with the Brooklyn Public
Library, who set it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerouac's estate,'' Amburn said, ``is a divided and conflicted
issue, just as Kerouac was a divided and conflicted man: between
lies and truth, between men and women, between the drive for
instant gratification and the quest for a true and lasting
spiritual experience that would give him peace of mind.''

JAPANESE LEADER OFFERS TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As support for Japan's government plummets and polls
show the ruling party slipping in the run-up to Sunday's
parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made a
late bid Wednesday to win votes and instill confidence in markets:
He promised to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to cut taxes is a time-honored crowd-pleaser. But what
makes Hashimoto's 11th-hour gambit so unusual is that it's his
third statement on taxes since last Friday _ and the second time
since then he's flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's waffling on taxes is understandable given that
Japan's deficit is one of the largest in the industrialized world;
the country needs revenue to meet the worst budget shortfall since
1981. Moreover, Japan has one of the world's oldest populations; by
2020, one in four Japanese will be on social security _ an argument
against cutting taxes now.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan also needs a cash injection into an economy suffering
its worst recession since World War II, and Hashimoto is under
intense pressure from investors and the United States to cut taxes
to jump-start consumption. The problem is that historically,
Japanese increase their savings, not their spending, when taxes are
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are running scared, and I think this is the last
big piece of ammo they're going to pull out and fire at the
opposition,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Matsui
Marine Research Institute. ``Hashimoto sees the specter of his
demise, and this is part of his strategy to stay on as prime
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's back-and-forth on tax cuts has exasperated and
disillusioned many here, but it is emblematic of the larger
confusion and disarray over how to revive Japan's long-suffering
economy. The economy has become the sole issue in the upcoming
elections, and the elections, in turn, have become a referendum on
the ruling party's competence.
</P>
<P>
   How well the parties sell their reform packages in these last
days of the campaign will determine who is able to form a
government to preside over Japan's long-overdue restructuring. &UR;  &LR; But
even the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, it seems, has not yet
decided what form restructuring should take.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Hashimoto said he wanted ``permanent tax reform,''
a statement widely understood to mean permanent, rather than
one-time, tax cuts. The next day, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi
said permanent tax cuts were part of the government's platform. By
Sunday, however, Hashimoto insisted he had never promised a
permanent tax cut, and the next day a spokesman for Obuchi said the
foreign minister had issued a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Wednesday, after one newspaper survey showed support for
Hashimoto's government had dropped to 28.5 percent, and other polls
suggested his party might lose seats in the upcoming election _ a
failure that could force him to resign _ the prime minister said
again that he supported tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes these guys look like the Keystone Cops running around
with everyone saying something different, leaving people wondering
who is running the show. It further undermines the already
questionable credibility of the ruling party,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are confused too. A poll by Asahi Shimbun newspaper
published Wednesday said that 59 percent of voters are not
affiliated with a party, and most of them have not decided who they
will vote for on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuhiro Okudaira, professor emeritus at the University of
Tokyo's Institute of Social Sciences, said the government's
behavior has disillusioned voters: ``When the government hasn't
succeeded in improving the situation, people get tremendously
pessimistic and that doesn't necessarily'' inspire them to vote.
Okudaira called Hashimoto's latest statement on taxes ``too little,
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Hashimoto did not give many specifics Wednesday, saying
merely that he would not now raise the minimum taxable income to
pay for a tax cut for the rich, and that he wanted a decision on
corporate taxes by the end of the year. The tax rate for businesses
can now run as high as 46 percent, while the income tax rate for
the wealthiest individuals is 65 percent.

JASPER VICTIM'S DAUGHTER ASKS CONGRESS TO STOP HATE CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With tears streaming down her face, the daughter of
a black man who was dragged to his death in East Texas called the
killing ``a wake-up call for America'' as she urged Congress to
crack down on hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men who murdered my father had a choice that morning, and
they chose violence,'' Renee Mullins, 27, the eldest daughter of
James Byrd Jr., told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on
Wednesday. ``Therefore, the laws of the land should punish them.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 49, was beaten, chained to the back of a pickup and
dragged along a rural road June 7 near Jasper. Three white men with
links to racist groups have been indicted on capital murder charges
and are being held.
</P>
<P>
   John William King, 23; Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31; and Shawn
Allen Berry, 23, could face the death penalty id convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects in Byrd's death were charged under Texas law, but
legislation in Congress would make it easier for federal
prosecutors to take over similar cases. The bill, sponsored by
Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., would also
expand federal jurisdiction to include hate crimes motivated by
gender, sexual orientation or physical disability.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the proposal seeks an unnecessary and
unconstitutional expansion of federal power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would do little to prevent tragedies like the one in
Jasper, Texas,'' William Stunts, a University of Virginia law
professor, told the Senate panel. ``In short, I think this bill
would do no good and may do real harm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mullins argued that hate crimes are so heinous that they
deserve special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today to prevent any other acts of violence of this
nature from occurring in America,'' she said. ``I think there
should be federal jurisdiction over crimes so hateful. It is a pity
to die because of your race, handicap or sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins also urged Americans to pray for the three men accused
of her father's killing, saying that the jailed suspects ``are so
full of fear and hatred that they are cut out from the happiness of
life.'' She struggled to maintain her composure as she delivered an
emotional appeal for racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to talk peace and harmony at my most difficult times, so
that no sparks will ignite more hatred and retribution,'' Mullins
said. ``People should be judged by the content of their character,
and not by the color of their skin. I've learned from living 27
years _ it takes more energy to hate than to love.''
</P>
<P>
   The young woman ended her emotional testimony by thanking the
senators and adding, ``God bless America.'' Her comments hushed the
cavernous hearing room and left lawmakers struggling for an
appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really, really feel badly about what happened. I think
everyone in America does,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the panel's
chairman, said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added: ``You're very special to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could be strong,'' Mullins replied, embarrassed by
her tears. ``But thank you, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who is skeptical about Kennedy's bill, assured Mullins
that Congress will find some way to encourage the prosecution of
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should presume we're going to do something here,''
he said. ``We have too many hate crimes, and something needs to be
done about it.''

ECO-CHIC HEMPENTWINES INDUSTRY, ECOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (ART ADV: Photos are being sent to NYTNS photo clients)  
 By ANNE M. SPITZA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Hemp is eco-chic.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not yet consumed, bathed with or worn something made
from the hearty plant, you are seriously out of the loop _
ecologically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp _ seeds, oil and fiber _ are now the Earth-friendly raw
materials of choice among the environmentally correct.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, hemp's worldwide sales have exploded
from $5 million in 1993 to more than $75 million in 1997, according
to industry trackers at Hemptech in California. By 2001, they
predict that hemp sales will reach $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Byproducts of the fibrous plant are popping up in everything
from bath soaps and sunscreens to backpacks and bedding.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz is using hemp as soundproofing in some of its
cars. Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren have included hemp fabric in
their luxury home collections. Adidas and Vans make sneakers with
hemp-fabric uppers. And, the Patagonia catalog offers several hemp
garments, including a wrap-around skirt for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Finneran is founder of Crucial Creations, a 7-year-old
Tucson, Ariz. -based hemp garment company that sells its goods as
far away as Japan, the Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's absolutely crucial the work we are doing for the
planet,'' said Finneran during a telephone interview. ``Eventually,
we're not going to be able to sustain ourselves using
petrochemicals that are a limited resource. (Hemp) is a sustainable
plant resource that can be regenerated every year to produce over
25,000 different products _ everything from paint to building
materials and (organic) plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is hardly alone in his dedication to ``hemp for a
healthier environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Shop is the latest voice to join the chorus of
advocates singing hemp's praises. The British-based bath and
body-care company introduced a line of hemp-oil products worldwide
this spring. ``Hemp Is Hope, Not Dope'' is the message embossed
beneath the waxy contents of its Hemp Elbow Grease ($10) skin
moisturizer.
</P>
<P>
   Not too surprisingly, hemp has met with controversy and
confusion. The grass-roots movement to bring this ``premier
renewable resource for the 21st century'' back into the public eye
began in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, commercial hemp is a variety of Cannabis sativa.
Although it is a cousin of the plant that produces marijuana,
experts say industrial hemp contains no significant traces of the
psychoactive drug THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally, the appeal of hemp is that it grows without
insecticides, clears fields of weeds and replenishes nutrients in
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the magic about hemp,'' said John W. Roulac, president
of Hemptech. ``It helps regenerate the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   One acre of hemp can produce four times more paper than can 1
acre of trees. And, unlike timber, hemp grows back the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of hemp revolves around the gradual illegalization
of Cannabis sativa in the United States between 1937 and the
mid-1950s. The public outcry against marijuana ensnared hemp, too.
It's been pointed out that innovative plastics, cotton and
wood-pulp paper were making hemp obsolete anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp advocates, however, argue that the powerful timber and
petrochemical industries had a hand in the anti-hemp legislation.
The absence of a hemp crop, they contend, eliminated competition
for wood- and petroleum-based products.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, hemp was used in the production of fuel, paper,
fabric, rope, food, birdseed, livestock fodder and paints.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp cultivation remains illegal in America. Movements in
several states _ backed by environmental, agricultural, academic
and industrial interests _ are working to repeal the law.
</P>
<P>
   Importing hemp as a raw material _ sterilized seeds, oil, fiber
or fabric _ is legal. The bulk of the world's industrial hemp is
grown in China, India and Europe. Canada expects to harvest 45,000
acres of hemp this year, according to Roulac.
</P>
<P>
   Eye-popping price tags have put a damper on the current hemp
scenario. Import duties and limited supply of sterilized hemp
seeds, oil, fiber and fabric have made hemp-based products an
expensive option.
</P>
<P>
   A yard of hemp fabric costs between $18 and $40 retail. A pair
of Ecolution jeans sell for $73.50 on the Internet. Adidas' hemp
and recycled-rubber sneakers go for about $80 a pair. A queen-size
hemp duvet cover by Calvin Klein will cost a whopping $725.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, it (hemp) is a non-toxic alternative to our
toxic world,'' said Bill Gobus, owner of the Flagstaff Hemp Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see in my own store is that almost everybody is into
hemp _ contrary to the media vision that the people who like hemp
are a small minority. I get doctors and lawyers and teachers and
judges and even probation officers _ people you would think would
be against it, but are not.''

 `ULTERIOR MOTIVE' and `THE JOB': JUNGLE, MURDER, CONSPIRACY  
(Editors: this article consists of two book reviews, which can be
used separately if so desired) 
(Editors: publication notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Business was good today. I wheeled, I dealed, I schmoozed, I
CLOSED.'' Thus speaks Ned Allen at the opening of Douglas Kennedy's
harrowing tale of downward mobility, ``The Job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ned is the successful young Northeast regional advertising sales
manager for CompuWorld, the third-biggest computer magazine in
America. He meets his quotas. He earns his bonuses. He makes just
enough to support the free-spending Manhattan life he lives with
his wife, Lizzie, a rising star in a public-relations company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything looks good for Ned and Lizzie when a crisis suddenly
looms. A German company buys CompuWorld, promising not to interfere
so long as advertising quotas continue to be met. But when one of
Ned's salesmen fails to close a major deal, Ned is given the choice
of either accepting the loss and losing his job or rescuing the
deal and being promoted to publisher. The only catch is that by
taking the latter course he is forced to play dirty and
double-cross a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, everything blows up in Ned's face. Just as he is
about to take his promotion, the company is sold again and
CompuWorld is killed. Ned finds himself out of a job and unable to
find another because of the enemies he has made. Lizzie leaves him,
and he begins a downward spiral so powerfully narrated and dizzying
that you find yourself thinking of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman,'' David Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and Donald
Westlake's blackly satirical novel ``The Axe.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The novel's epigraph, by Kafka, seems apt: ``The true way leads
along a tightrope, which is not stretched aloft but just above the
ground. It seems more designed to trip one than to be walked
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so bleak and depressing is Kennedy's story that you
begin to wonder what the point of it all will be. Is the novel a
comment on ambition? Or a plea for moral conduct in business? Or a
variation on the Book of Job? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As things turn out, Kennedy appears equally at sea about what he
is up to in ``The Job.'' Instead of resolving the bruising issues
he has raised, he eventually turns his story into a thriller about
a murderous conspiracy that Ned runs afoul of in his endless search
for another job.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did in his previous novel, ``The Big Picture,''
Kennedy loses control of his material and leaves the reader not
dazzled or emotionally purged but merely entertained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This comes as a relief, in a way. By the time Ned sorts
everything out, you can say that one way or another your attention
has been held throughout. But there's a serious novel hiding inside
``The Job,'' and one of these days Kennedy may well write it all
the way through. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Daniel Oran's first novel, ``Ulterior Motive,'' you encounter
a murderous conspiracy in its opening pages. Going home from work
in the middle of the night, Jonathan Goodman, a project manager at
a giant Seattle-based computer company called Megasoft, realizes
that he has left his appointment book somewhere. On the way back to
the place he thinks it may be, he takes a shortcut through a
parking garage and witnesses the shooting of a man he is able to
identify from the name tag on the corpse as Walter Kaminski. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Jonathan wonders aloud to a colleague why the
company's security force is covering up the murder, the colleague
comments: ``Jon, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but do
you really think you're going to be able to figure that out? I
mean, you're no secret agent. You're not some private eye. This
isn't TV, with a guaranteed happy ending. You start snooping around
some more, and you may end up like that Kaminski guy.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, this little stab of realism doesn't work. ``Ulterior
Motive'' may not be ``TV, with a guaranteed happy ending,'' but
it's a cliche in practically every other respect.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind Kaminski's murder is a plot by the leadership of
Megasoft to make a dictatorship of America, and the clues are so
obvious that any idiot could figure them out. Even Jonathan
eventually catches on, and he's so dim that when Karen Grey, the
Seattle reporter for Business World magazine, telephones to ask him
about a promotion he received a month earlier, he thinks she's
talking about the murder he just witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the author's point in having Karen call is to get her
together with Jonathan to form a detective team. So, as keeps
happening over and over in the novel, plausibility is sacrificed to
Oran's heavy hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is intriguing about ``Ulterior Motive'' is its author's
background as, first, a collaborator with behaviorist B.F. Skinner
on chimpanzee-language research, and, then, the inventor of the
Start Button and Taskbar for the computer program Windows 95.
Anyone clever enough to design an important component of a major
piece of software ought to be able to plot a suspenseful overthrow
of democracy, one would think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while you get from ``Ulterior Motive'' a feeling of what
working for a company like Megasoft is like, as well as some
intriguing speculation on the future of computers, the plot of
``Ulterior Motive'' is feeble. Just imagine the leadership of
Megasoft not realizing that files deleted from a hard drive can be
retrieved! Is Oran kidding or just talking down to his readers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he's doing, there's less than meets the eye in
``Ulterior Motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas in ``The Job,'' there's more.

DAUGHTER OF JASPER VICTIM URGES PASSAGE OF HATE-CRIMES LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The eldest daughter of James Byrd Jr. on Wednesday
urged Americans to pray for the three white men indicted in the
racially motivated slaying of her father in Jasper, Texas. Renee
Mullins also pressed Congress to pass legislation that would
increase the federal government's authority to investigate and
prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all citizens to pray for these individuals who have
such low self-esteem and who are so full of fear and hatred that
they are cut out from the happiness of life,'' Mullins told the
Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering the proposed 1998
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as Americans, and human beings in general, we have choices
in life: to hate or not to hate; to kill or not to kill; to be a
leader or a follower,'' Mullins said in tearful testimony. ``The
men who murdered my father had a choice ... and they chose
violence. Therefore, the laws of the land should punish them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins' testimony followed the capital murder indictment of the
three men Monday in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper residents Bill King, 23, and Shawn Berry, 23, as well as
Russell Brewer Jr., 31 of Sulphur Springs, could face the death
penalty if convicted in the June 7 dragging death of Byrd, 49, who
was black. He was pulled behind a vehicle until his head and right
arm were wrenched from his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal murder of my father, James Byrd Jr., is for us in
my family a tragedy that we have only begun to experience,'' said
Mullins, who had to stop her testimony briefly to regain her
composure. ``I cannot get over the horrid and deeply felt hatred of
how he died. I want to thank the nation for all the prayers being
delivered to us and we _ my mother, brother, sister and I _ want to
express our immense gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation before the Senate, and a similar bill before the
House, would extend the U.S. hate crime statute to enable the
federal government to prosecute violent attacks on women, gays and
disabled people, as well as blacks and religious minorities, as
current law permits. The bipartisan proposal, which President
Clinton supports, also would remove a provision in the hate-crime
law that limits federal jurisdiction to instances when the violent
act interfered with the victim's exercise of a federally protected
activity, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, however, must cite a power it has under the
Constitution to take the broad step of making a state offense a
federal crime. The bill, therefore, cites Congress' authority to
regulate interstate commerce as the basis for allowing U.S.
lawmakers to federalize hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Byrd case, for example, the requirement could be met if
prosecutors could show the pickup used to drag the victim to his
death had parts that came from a state other than Texas. However,
the measure, if enacted, would not apply to Byrd's case because it
was not law at the time of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing this bill into law would give some mercy for my family
and for the families of future victims of such horrible crimes,''
said the 27-year-old Mullins of Lufkin. ``To not pass this bill is
unfair to the American people and to police officers and Justice
Department officials who work hard to keep people safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr., citing two Texas cases,
told senators that the bill would remedy two ``deficiencies'' in
the current law: the limitation to race- and religion-based hatred
and the requirement that a federally protected activity be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Holder noted the brutal 1996 stabbing death of a gay man in
Houston, allegedly by two men who belonged to a white supremacist
group in Montana. Federal charges could not be brought because U.S.
law did not protect people from violent acts based on their sexual
orientation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder also cited the 1994 acquittal by a federal jury in Fort
Worth of three white supremacists who were charged with assaulting
black people because of their race. The jury concluded the victims
were not engaged in a federally protected activity when they were
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal would permit the federal government to work in
partnership with state and local officials in the investigation and
prosecution of cases that implicate the significant federal
interest in eradicating hate-based violence,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   However, University of San Diego law professor Larry Alexander
criticized the proposal as an unconstitutional exercise of
Congress' limited authority to regulate activities that
substantially affect interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that to comply with its constitutional
responsibilities, Congress ... must actually believe that hate
crimes have a substantial effect on interstate commerce,'' he told
the committee. ``You will forgive me for believing, based on the
speeches in support of this bill, that the motivation for this bill
has little to do with its overall effects on interstate commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara of western New York objected
to the bill as the latest example of Congress turning into federal
offenses those crimes, such as murder, historically enforced by the
states. Such congressional steps have flooded overworked federal
courts with cases best left to state judges, said Arcara, who
testified on behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United
States, which represents federal judges. &QL;

`48 HOURS': FOR CRIME WITNESSES, SHOULD SEEING BE BELIEVING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't trust your eyes. That is the main message of Thursday
night's cautionary ``48 Hours.'' Experts, examples and exhortations
are arrayed against witness testimony, whether in a rape case or a
robbery or the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's report begins with the rape conviction of two
Alabama brothers who were picked out of a photo lineup by the
victim. They were freed after serving 14 years, when Peter Neufeld,
a lawyer and DNA specialist, showed that the semen on the accuser's
clothes did not match that of the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The case remains unsettled: the victim now says that the semen
was a boyfriend's but that she was raped later by the two suspects.
So a retrial is promised. Whatever the outcome, the episode draws
attention to other cases in which belated inspection of DNA
evidence has cleared convicted men of rape charges despite witness
testimony of their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, a defendant in a convenience store robbery
was acquitted after a psychologist explained to the jury why the
storekeeper's memory could not be trusted. But can the expert
witness' theory be trusted? Soon after acquittal, the suspect was
arrested in another convenience store robbery. (Do these stores owe
their titles to their convenience for robbers?)
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and others explain how memory can be a fooler. In
a punchy demonstration, a quick grab-and-run theft is staged in
front of a class at Brooklyn Law School. In photo lineups soon
afterward, most of the students choose an innocent man as the
culprit. Whether this is a comment on the power of suggestion or on
the people who become lawyers invites further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the program returns to the conflicts in witnesses'
recollections of the Kennedy assassination. But let's not get into
that.

   (Undated) - Although hemp products are relatively prolific, they
are not always readily available. Major manufacturers are dabbling
in hemp, but the bulk of hemp retail goods is coming from
cottage-industry companies.
</P>
<P>
   As such, hemp-driven Internet shopping sites and mail-order
catalogs are abundant. A bit of Web crawling and statewide
wandering uncovered the following finds:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Frederick Brewing Co. in Maryland uses hemp seeds in
brewing its Hempen Gold cream ale and a Hemp ale. (301) 694-7899 or

<P>
   _ The Rella Good Cheese Co. in Santa Rosa, Calif., sells hemp
tofu and hemp-seed veggie burgers. 800-656-9669 or www.rella.com
</P>
<P>
   _ The Oxford Hemp Exchange offers reusable hemp coffee filters
as well as hemp-flour hotcake, pizza and cookie dough mixes.

</P>
<P>
   _ The Hemptech Web site (www/hemptech.com) lists more than 400
hemp products under the categories automotive, body care, paper,
plastics, clothing and food.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Arizona, hemp boutiques have opened in several low-key
locales. There is Southwest Hemp Co. in Prescott, Hemp &AMP; Hawg in
Sedona and Flagstaff Hemp Co. in Flagstaff.

BOTH SIDES SPEAK AT ANTI-DESECRATION BILL HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wednesday was Flag Day at the US Senate as Tommy
Lasorda of the Los Angeles Dodgers and other Americans told the
Judiciary Committee of their love for the red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  During a hearing on a proposed constitutional amendment that
would allow Congress to protect the flag from desecration, others
testified that what the flag represented was more important.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the flag desecration amendment
last year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved it by a 10-7
vote June 24. A date has not been set for the full Senate to vote
on the issue, but a close vote is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda and most of the other panelists said they support the
amendment. The Dodgers' general manager told of a time he witnessed
protesters set fire to a flag at a Dodgers game against the Chicago
Cubs in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all watched dumbstruck as the man pulled out a match and
tried to light the American flag to burn it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday committed ``one of
the most heroic acts ever to take place on the field during a Major
League Baseball game'' when the player grabbed the burning flag
from the protester and ran toward the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``And without any prompting that I can remember, the whole crowd
stood and began to fill the stadium with an impromptu rendition of
`God Bless America,' '' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Another celebrity, actor and singer John Schneider, who played
Bo Duke in the former television show ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' also
encouraged the Senate to pass the amendment. Schneider has recorded
a song called ``I Love Old Glory,'' which was written by Senator
Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who sponsored the proposed amendment, said, ``While it
might be nice if a statute were all that was needed to permit
Congress to prohibit flag desecration, a constitutional amendment
is necesary because the Supreme Court has given us no choice in the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 and in 1990 that flag burning is
considered free speech and protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said ``it
may be the most politically unpopular position I could take,'' but
he opposes the proposed amendment. Although he is offended by acts
of flag desecration, Feingold said, people should have the right to
commit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand in opposition to this amendment because it will limit
Americans' First Amendment right to freedom of speech _ the most
fundamental of rights guaranteed our citizens by our Constitution
and the most fundamental of rights necessary to maintain our
constitutional democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin V. Stenhammar, a disabled veteran from Asheville, N.C.,
also urged the Senate to vote against the amendment. ``Flags, no
matter how honored, do not have rights. People do. Please protect
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be enacted, the proposed amendment must pass the Senate with
a two-thirds vote and then be ratified by 38 states. In 1995, a
similar amendment failed by three votes in the Senate.

IN DENVER, PRIDE AND PROSPERITY TAKE CENTER STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This year the city has been in an everlasting state of
Rocky Mountain high.
</P>
<P>
   January brought a stunning Super Bowl victory, and the champion
Broncos were honored by the president. This week sports fans were
focused on the baseball All-Star Game at Coors Field.
Tele-Communications Inc., based here, was recently scooped up by
AT&AMP;T, earning local entrepreneurs head-spinning billions.
</P>
<P>
   And last month the Denver Center Theater Company received a Tony
Award, named for Antoinette Perry, an actress and director who grew
up here a century ago. The award citation said that this regional
company has shown ``a continuous level of artistic achievement and
contributed to the growth of theater nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Marley, the company's artistic director, and Donald
Seawell, founder of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts,
delivered the award to the steel-and-glass theater complex, where
the medallion was passed hand to hand from one company member to
the next, up the front steps and down the galleria to the soaring
lobby of the Helen G. Bonfils Theater Complex.
</P>
<P>
   The theater company, founded two decades ago, is a dream turned
remarkable reality of Seawell, a former Broadway producer. He took
a nearly abandoned sports arena, a city jail, police headquarters
and numerous parking lots, and made an arts center of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the city's emergence on the national theater scene,
members of the American Theater Critics Association saw the theater
company's current repertory in May when they held their conference
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The company, part of the largest arts center between Chicago and
Los Angeles, includes as many as 230 professionals _ actors,
managers, technicians, artisans and publicists. Its annual $6.9
million budget is reserved solely for producing theater. Box office
services, development costs and rent are all paid by the performing
arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Seawell's stewardship of a foundation, now worth $110
million, that supports the arts center, the troupe has four
different theaters in the arts complex available for an average of
15 productions a year: the Stage, a 700-seat hall with a thrust
stage; the Space, a 450-seat theater in the round; the Ricketson, a
250-seat proscenium house, and the Source, with 200 seats and a
thrust stage.
</P>
<P>
   Across Arapahoe Street, the company has a wealth of downtown
space rare in international theater. There is a vast old tramway
building, built in 1911, which houses rehearsal rooms; workshops
for sets, props, wigs and costumes, and the classrooms for the
company's two schools, the Denver Center Theater Academy and the
National Theater Conservatory. The Theater Conservatory, chartered
by Congress and established in 1984, has a master's program in
acting. During their third year, conservatory students apprentice
with the Denver Center Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   Marley said the mingling of students and professionals was
vital. ``The theater is a very brutal world,'' he said. ``I want to
create a healing relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years as producing director of the Pacific Conservatory
of the Performing Arts, in Santa Maria and Solvang, Calif., Marley
came here in 1984, bringing several Pacific Conservatory members,
including Denver's current producing director, Barbara Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle Jackson, who has served as artistic director of the
Milwaukee Repertory Theater and the McCarter Theater in Princeton,
N.J., recently directed his poignant play ``Taking Leave'' here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing about the Denver company is that it
maintains what we all started out to do in the 1960s,'' he said.
``It is still a resident company in a community, creating good
theater. So many companies have moved in favor of more glamorous
pursuits in hopes of moving them on to Broadway. But then you might
just as well be a booking house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is just one of two or three companies that are very
well endowed and have been well managed over the years, so are able
to maintain a large company and do big works,'' he continued.
``Denver has kept the flame alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The company produces musicals as well as classic and
contemporary plays in its annual season, October through June.
Audiences come from all over Colorado and the neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Elk Speaks,'' which had its premiere in Denver in 1993,
was later staged by Marley in Hong Kong with Cantonese-speaking
actors, then went to the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1995.
``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' which originated in Denver in
1995, went to Cleveland for the opening of the Rock-and-Roll Hall
of Fame and later to the Arena Stage in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This past season, the company staged new versions of Carlos
Goldoni's ``Servant of Two Masters'' and Pedro Calderon de la
Barca's ``Life is a Dream.'' It also presented the world premiere
of Jackson's ``Taking Leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's forthcoming season features another world
premiere, Jackson's ``Elevation of Thieves,'' for which he won a
1997 Onassis Foundation International Playwriting Award, and a
fresh production of Derek Walcott's ``Dream on Monkey Mountain,''
with pulsing new choreography by Cleo Parker Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the company's Tony Award was announced, a theater
critic at The Rocky Mountain News accused the troupe of being too
complacent, considering the size of its endowment. But audiences
don't seem to agree. Attendance is rising despite the draw of
Denver's four major-league sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   The actors keep coming, too. ``Denver has a war chest that
cannot be matched,'' said Robert Westenberg, who came here last
August from the Broadway production of ``1776.'' ``The costumes,
the sets and lights are all first-rate. The work is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Church, who joined the Denver troupe in 1988 after 28 years
with the Royal Shakespeare Company, has found ``a huge artistic
family where the technical crew and the actors are all treated with
an equal respect that I have never seen in England,'' he said.
``The range of material is extraordinary.''

<P>
   Michele Shay, who has been a member of the Negro Ensemble
Company and received a Tony nomination for her performance in
August Wilson's ``Seven Guitars,'' said: ``The menu of things that
are being offered to people is really wonderful. I call Denver
actor-friendly. It feels like an oasis where you can relax and
work. It's holistic in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sellers said: ``We are able to reach a little farther
because we have been able to assemble a group in one place, in one
community and have a sense of security. It is a family kind of
feeling.''
</P>

   And the family felt proud to bring home Antoinette Perry's
award.

CIVIC GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO PASS BILL BARRING HATE CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hate crime victims and dozens of civic, church and
civil rights groups urged Congress Wednesday to pass a bill making
it a federal crime to attack someone based on bias against gays,
women, or people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal came at a news conference on Capitol Hill sponsored
by 74 organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, National
Council of Churches, National Education Association, National
Organization for Women and the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, Pat Cramer, who owns the Casa Nova Restaurant and
Lounge, a nightclub for gays in Boswell, Pa., said that on March 9,
1997, someone ``shot into the bar, injuring three of my
customers.'' She added, ``I have received numerous death threats,
and my business has received a bomb scare. My husband and I live
above the Casa Nova, and every day I fear for our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania does not have a law banning violence against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer and the groups attending the news conference praised a
bill offered by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. It would amend a federal statute
that currently bans violence against people engaged in a
federally-protected activity _ such as working, voting and going to
school or places of public accommodation _ on the basis of race,
color, religion, or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would add hate crimes based on sexual orientation,
gender or disability. It would also allow federal officials to
pursue a case even if the victim was not engaged in a
federally-protected activity _ so long as the violence is not
covered by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden explained, ``If there is no remedy on the (state) books,
our law will be there to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a case that could not be prosecuted under current laws,
Kennedy said a woman was raped in a train traveling from Miami to
New York, but ``because the woman couldn't identify which state she
was in, the rapist is still out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said 12 states have no laws against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's largest gay
political organization, released statistics showing that 61.6
percent of hate crimes are committed for racial reasons, 16 percent
because of religious bias, 11.6 percent because of anti-gay
sentiments and 10.7 percent for reasons relating to national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said that the torture-murder of James Byrd, Jr., of
Jasper, Texas, last month was not covered by federal law because he
was not engaged in any federally protected activity when he was
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a disabled 49-year-old black man, was walking on a Jasper
street in the early morning of June 7. He apparently accepted a
ride from three white men who allegedly beat him and chained him to
their pickup truck, dragging him down a country road. Dismembered
body parts were discovered in various places over a two-mile
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were indicted Tuesday by a Jasper County grand jury
on charges a kidnapping and murder, a capital crime.
</P>
<P>
   One of Byrd's children, Renee Mullins, said at the news
conference, ``Nothing that Congress does will bring my father
back.'' But she added that the bill would make ``hate crimes like
the terrible act that took my father a federal crime and (would)
ensure that anyone who commits a hate crime will pay a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the subject,
HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch testified that the
hate-crime bill would help homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally have stacks of newspaper clippings describing
gruesome hate crimes where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered
Americans are beaten, assaulted and murdered, solely because of who
they are,'' she said. ``This bill is vitally needed. It is
constitutional, and it will provide a sense of safety to the
millions of Americans who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or
transgendered.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee has not set a date for a vote on the measure.

   (Undated) - Hemp is a plant that has up to 25,000 reported uses,
ranging from fuel to fabric, paper to paint, and cosmetics to
comestibles. It can even be used in explosives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiny hemp seeds taste something like sunflower seeds and are
high in fiber and protein. Soy is its only organic nutritional
rival.
</P>
<P>
   _Man's earliest known fabric _ dating back to 7,000 B.C. _ was
apparently made of hemp.
</P>
<P>
   _ The word ``canvas'' is derived from the Greek word
``kannabis.''
</P>
<P>
   _Confucius' writings (550 B.C.) were transcribed on hemp paper.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gutenberg Bible (15th century) was put down on hemp paper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Columbus' ships had hemp canvas sails.
</P>
<P>
   _ The paintings of Rembrandt, Van Gogh and others were primarily
painted on hemp canvases.
</P>
<P>
   _``Make the most of the hemp seed and sow it everywhere,''
proclaimed George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hemp was a mandatory crop in the American Colonies until the
mid-1700s. Thomas Jefferson and George Washington grew hemp on
their estates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Benjamin Franklin founded one of America's first paper mills
using hemp fiber.
</P>
<P>
   _Old Glory, sewn by Betsy Ross, was constructed with hemp
fabric.

 &HT;    Arnett won't face further job action
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- CNN decided Wednesday not to take any further action
against correspondent Peter Arnett for his role in the Operation
Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett met with CNN Chairman Tom Johnson, CNN International
President Eason Jordan and others Wednesday to defend his
involvement in the Tailwind story. Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize
for his coverage of Vietnam for The Associated Press, has said he
was only reading from a script prepared by producers and was not
responsible for the story, which CNN was forced to retract last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN had announced a reprimand for Arnett, best known as the
network's correspondent in Baghdad, Iraq, during the Persian Gulf
War, as part of its retraction and apology. But it also had
announced that two producers had been fired and that Pam Hill, the
senior executive producer of ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' the program
on which the retracted story was run, had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conference calls between Johnson and CNN
employees Monday and Tuesday, staffers raised questions as to
whether Arnett had been given more lenient treatment than the
producers because of his status at the network.
</P>
<P>
   After executives talked to Arnett and deliberated for most of
Wednesday, CNN released a statement that read: ``Peter Arnett's
reprimand stands. No further personnel actions are planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was called back Tuesday from his vacation in Oregon to
confer with Johnson. Before the meeting, Arnett had defended his
role in the Tailwind story, saying he had conducted only three of
the interviews and then was reading questions prepared by the
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of the team, but I didn't have supervising
authority. ... I was the face,'' Arnett told The New York Times
before Wednesday's meeting. ``There was nothing I could do to halt
the onward rush of this story.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which aired June 7 on the debut of ``NewsStand,''
alleged that U.S. military forces in Laos used sarin nerve gas in
1970. An independent investigation found insufficient evidence to
support the charge, and CNN apologized to viewers and military
personnel involved.

 &HT;    TV newsmagazines have similar heirarchies
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Executive producer. Senior producer. This producer.
That producer.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Tailwind story retraction has brought to the forefront the
myriad of personnel deep inside the broadcast and cable networks
who work on stories for TV's newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although every newsmagazine _ from ``Dateline NBC'' to CBS' ``60
Minutes'' _ functions somewhat differently, they have developed an
editorial heirarchy with very distinct roles:
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer _ EPs, as they are usually called, are
responsible for the entire show. They are involved in hiring and
firing personnel, budgeting, the program's format, and approving
the final edits of the stories that are scheduled to appear on the
show. They rarely get involved in the reporting stage, unless the
story is sensitive or controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Producers _ They function as traffic cops and are
responsible for sifting through story proposals from segment
producers. They green-light story ideas they deem newsworthy, and
reject those that don't make the grade. Once a story has been
approved, they keep tabs on its progress as its being reported, and
screen rough edits of subjects being interviewed for the story.
</P>
<P>
   Producers _ Responsible for generating story ideas, doing
legwork, lining up interviews, conducting pre-interviews, writing
scripts, and supervising the editing of the story. Producers are
considered the ground troops who must have a clear idea of where a
story is going, and make the necessary adjustments when it changes
course. At a newspaper, the producer would perform many of the same
functions as a newspaper reporter whose byline ultimately appears
on a story.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Producers and Researchers _ Perform adminstrative and
journalstic grunt work such as fact-checking and scheduling for
upper-level producers. May also be involved in some of the
preliminary reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents _ Some act as traditional reporters who are
involved in every level of the story from inception to editing.
Some are merely celebrity journalists who ``parachute'' in when
most of the work has already been done to conduct interviews that
will be seen on-air, provide narration, and tape opening and
closing segments. And in some cases, they are glorified script
readers who are merely ``fronting'' stories that have been prepared
in advance by production staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys _will ``vet'' the story, especially controversial ones
to make sure they are not slanderous and unnecessarily expose the
network to lawsuits. Depending on the nature of the story, the
attorney will view everything from the rough-cuts to the network's
on-air promotions for the story.

 WEAPON4-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it seems strange to think that ``Lethal Weapon 4'' is part of
a franchise that's now more than a decade old, it's even stranger
to realize how safe these ``Weapons'' have become. Once a mean
series with some funny moments, it has become a comedy series with
some mean moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Mel Gibson first played wildman cop Martin ``Lethal
Weapon'' Riggs, the detective was a near-suicidal psychotic,
sticking guns in his mouth and keeping folks from killing
themselves by jumping off buildings with them. Now he's the class
clown, doing everything but sticking ``kick me'' signs on his
partner's back.
</P>
<P>
   And he's growing a sensitive side: He's gonna be a daddy,
although his companion Lorna Cole (Rene Russo from Lethal Weapon 3)
looks less like she's weeks from delivery and more like she just
decided to stuff that embarrassing load of dirty underwear under
her sweater. And partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is gonna be
a granddad. This may be the noisiest movie to have people cooing
``How sweet'' before the final credits.
</P>
<P>
   And boy, is it noisy, which isn't to say it's boring. It's about
as much stupid fun as you'd expect, maybe more after the
forgettable ``Lethal 3.'' Once again, Richard Donner directs with a
kick-out-the-jams attitude that simply says, if you keep things
moving fast enough, there won't be time for anyone to notice how
dumb they are. And, yes, when the movie hits the brakes, especially
in scenes in a dentist's office and the inevitable maternity ward,
it looks pretty dumb.
</P>
<P>
   If you're impatient by now to read some plot details, this
probably isn't the movie for you. More and more, the plots in this
series are beside the point; suffice it to say that this one
involves some Chinese immigrant smugglers, a slave ring, some
counterfeiting and some very important gangsters. But really, the
plot's just an excuse to get from place to place _ or rather, from
chase to chase.
</P>
<P>
   Donner makes sparing use of Asian action star Jet Li, who plays
a formidable villain in his first English-language (and first
bad-guy) role. It may seem that Li is being underused, but his
whipcrack-fast speed may simply be too much for a Hollywood camera
at this point; even in slow motion, this guy looks like he's going
faster than the speed of light, and he's really too much for the
aging Gibson to handle. To the script's credit, it acknowledges
this, but as we've seen before, no ``Lethal Weapon'' villain is
indestructible.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't see enough of Li, it's partly because of the
top-heaviness of the script, which is typical of the series. Every
new entry has added new characters, such as Joe Pesci's annoying
twerp Leo Getz and Russo's Lorna, and now Chris Rock is on board as
Lee Butters, a young detective who seems unusually fond of
Murtaugh. Put that many people into the mix, and someone's gonna
get cheated _ and that's just about everyone except Gibson and
Glover, whose chemistry remains the best thing about the series.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and the action, which is often preposterous but never
yawn-inducing. The litmus test here comes when Gibson (OK, his
stunt double) is skiing down the freeway on the bottom side of a
dining-room table with Glover and a bad guy in hot pursuit. If that
makes you roll your eyes, you'd better skip Part 4. The rest of us
will be sitting there munching popcorn, adrenalin rushing and
brains happily turned off.

A WET SUMMER BRINGS POISON IVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAY COOPER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Summer brings with it an onslaught of poison
ivy cases. This season many gardeners, landscapers and weekend
hikers already have had to coat their skin with goopy anti-itch
lotion more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Pereira, a horticultural education assistant at the
University Outreach and Extension, Jackson County, said weather has
been the main cause of the rampant poison ivy this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a lot of moisture has contributed to more poison ivy
(because) it promotes germination,'' Pereira said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that poison ivy has rooted itself across Missouri, the main
question is how to avoid it _ or get rid of it. The maxim ``leaves
of three, let them be,'' applies, but poison ivy isn't the only
three-leaf plant.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically poison ivy leaves are shiny and pointed. Poison ivy
also grows small, white or greenish-white berries at certain times
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect poison ivy, get away from it or dispose of it,
but do not burn it. When inhaled, fumes of burning poison ivy may
cause dangerous swelling in the throat or lungs. Herbicides are the
best way to fight the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira said the best time to spray is in the spring or fall
because as the plant grows, it will absorb the herbicide more
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   To dispose of the plant in midsummer, the university extension
recommended cutting it, forcing a grow cycle and then spraying it.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ashby, a dermatologist in North Kansas City, Mo., said
that if you're going to be around poison ivy, it's best to use a
barrier cream like Stokoguard or Ivy Block beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   If you do come in contact with the plant, Ashby said, try
over-the-counter antihistamine creams or anti-itch lotions. For
more severe cases, see a doctor for a prescription medicine or
cream.
</P>
<P>
   But who wants to spend a summer covered with rashes and lotions?
Identification and prevention are really the keys to avoid
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also said that if you come in contact with the plant,
shower right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get rid of the resin in five to 10 minutes, you may not
break out.''

WORLDCOM-MCI DEAL CLEARS EUROPEAN HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed merger between telephone giants Worldcom Inc. and
MCI Communications Corp. now appears to be on a fast track
following Wednesday's decision by European regulators to grant
antitrust clearance to the $46 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for approving the gigantic merger, however, the
European Commission insisted that MCI divest its entire Internet
business to ensure that the combined companies don't wield too much
power in the global market for Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ends a grueling, seven-month antitrust review by
the European Union's top regulatory agency, which wasn't satisfied
with earlier concessions offered by MCI.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is still subject to approval by the US Justice
Department and the Federal Communications Commission, but because
the Justice Department has worked closely with the EC in reviewing
the case, US approval is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, an industry consultant based in Atlanta, said he
expects quick US approval for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the EU has put the company through the ringer and two,
there's nothing else for MCI-WorldCom to give.''
</P>
<P>
   When antitrust objections to the merger first arose, MCI
responded by striking a deal in May to sell its wholesale Internet
business to Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless for $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed divestiture included MCI's worldwide Internet
backbone _ all of its lines and equipment that carry Web traffic _
as well as its reseller contracts with various Internet service
providers. But MCI planned to hold on to its own residential and
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Commission demanded that MCI sell all of its
Internet assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``WorldCom is currently the leading player in the market, with
MCI one of its main competitors. The merger would have given the
combined entity a market share of some 50 percent of the relevant
market,'' the commission said in a statement. ``The parties have
committed to divesting MCI's Internet assets, thus eliminating the
overlap with WorldCom Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom and MCI said in a combined statement that they expect
US regulators to approve the deal soon and anticipate completing
the merger before the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   MCI spokesman Jim Monroe would not identify potential buyers of
its Internet business, valued at about $1 billion, but Cable &AMP;
Wireless had indicated recently that it was still in talks with
MCI, even after the original deal was shot down by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The conditional approval seemed to appease rival GTE Corp.,
which had sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``GTE has maintained all along that the Commission should reject
the combination of the world's two biggest Internet providers
unless and until MCI and WorldCom agree to eliminate any overlap in
their Internet businesses through a complete divestiture. The
announcement by the Commission today thoroughly vindicates GTE's
position,'' said William Barr, GTE's executive vice president and
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But GTE maintained that safeguards must be placed to ensure that
the combined companies do not try to recapture divested MCI
internet customers who also buy other MCI services.
</P>
<P>
   While the forced sale of its internet business is a setback for
MCI, Kagan emphasized that the Internet industry is still young,
and there is plenty of time for the combined company _ to be called
MCI WorldCom _ to rebuild its internet business.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a telecommunications giant with combined
1998 revenue of about $32 billion, and about one-quarter of the $70
billion US long-distance market. The company would be the strongest
competitor to No. 1 U.S. long-distance company AT&AMP;T Corp. as well
as a formidable global competitor. MCI is the second-biggest U.S.
long-distance company while WorldCom is No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   MCI stock closed at 61 7/16, up 9/16, and WorldCom closed at 50
5/8, up 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

KANSAS CITY CULINARY CENTER IS REALITY NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ It has been a horse-and-buggy shop, the
butcher shop of a Thriftway store, a storage barn for Kansas City
Power &AMP; Light and a warehouse for junk.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest incarnation, co-owners Laura O'Rourke and Betsy
Titterington have transformed the 4,300-square-foot warehouse space
into the Culinary Center of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   They hope their culinary center, in downtown Overland Park, will
become to Kansas City cooks what the James Beard House is to the
nation's leading chefs.
</P>
<P>
   The home of the late culinarian, Beard's brick town house in New
York City has become in recent years a mecca for culinary education
and stylish entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was a need for a place for the average person,
as well as the professional chef, to learn about the culinary
arts,'' O'Rourke says of their own endeavor. ``We want it to be
interactive, and we want people to have an opportunity to get their
hands dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The center features a commercial//residential teaching kitchen
with state-of-the-art equipment, a comfortable dining area
featuring a 1,800-pound solid walnut table, a culinary resource
center with stone hearth and a large event space.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a ``breakout'' kitchen for pastry work, a
cooking//work station accessible for cooks in wheelchairs and an
herb garden outside the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The center will offer a variety of hands-on culinary classes
taught by area cooking professionals, but its founders plan to draw
on the skills of home cooks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is `Mi casa es su casa.' There is no intimidation
here,'' O'Rourke says.
</P>
<P>
   Forthcoming classes include such subjects as cooking with two
ripe tomatoes, basic knife usage and maintenance, recipes from
Under the Tuscan Sky, pairing beer with food, Chinese peasant
cooking, cooking with produce from the farmers market and a pizza
class for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful facility,'' says Karen Adler, owner of Pig
Out Publications and an accomplished gourmet cook who is scheduled
to teach at the culinary center. ``They have a broad view of what
their culinary center can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Before jumping off the career track to follow their culinary
dreams, O'Rourke worked as a lawyer and Titterington organized
running events. Although neither has a professional culinary
background, Titterington has taken classes at the Culinary
Institute of America in Napa Valley, and O'Rourke has taught
culinary classes at local community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very experienced in organizing events and
entertaining,'' O'Rourke says. ``It is a natural extension of who
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   They envision providing the cooking space for the community to
learn about food and wine while sharing the joys of the table. The
center will not have regular business hours.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide a space for culinary events and
affordable catering services. They also see it as a venue for
private dinner parties, bridal showers, corporate team-building,
cooking-show video production and even food-themed art shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are helping us evolve by letting us know what they
want. It's a canvas, and we're painting as we go,'' O'Rourke says.
``The biggest marketing challenge is helping people understand what
we're about.''
</P>
<P>

NEARLY EVERY CULTURE HAS ITS OWN VERSION OF SHISH KEBAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Shish kebabs are undeniably one of the most popular
foods cooked on a stick or skewer, and nearly every culture has its
own version.
</P>
<P>
   The word shish kebab comes from the Turkish, shish meaning to
skewer and kebab meaning chunk of meat. Culinary anthropologist
Elisabeth Rozin writes her book The Universal Kitchen that the same
word is shashlik in Russian and souvlakia in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   In India spit-grilled foods are called tandoori. The Persians
used pounded meat to form balls, croquettes and sausage-shaped
kebabs known as kofta. Satay is the Malay term for meat skewered
and cooked on bamboo skewers. The term is used throughout Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, skewer cookery became all the rage in the
'50s thanks to Russian immigrants who settled on both coasts after
World War I, leading New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne to
claim the ``shish kebab craze'' was second only to the national
rage for pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually anything that could be strung on a skewer was
barbecued in the Fifties,'' author Sylvia Lovegren confirms in
Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads (Macmillan).
</P>
<P>
   Word play
</P>
<P>
   Rozin notes the words grill and skewer are ``unabashedly
aggressive metaphors.'' To ``grill'' someone means to question them
relentlessly. To ``skewer'' someone means to puncture, defeat or
pin them to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboo or metal?
</P>
<P>
   Metal skewers are thought to be derived from the swords of
ancient Asian horsemen. But in Southeast Asia skewers usually are
made from bamboo. If you're using bamboo, don't forget to soak them
in water at least 30 minutes before holding them over the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Unskewering advice
</P>
<P>
   In his impressive new book, The Barbecue Bible (Workman), Steven
Raichlen gives this bit of advice for those who have ``tried to
unskewer too vigorously and sent cubes of meat sailing across the
dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   On his global barbecue jaunts, Raichlen noticed cooks in the
Near East and Central Asia employed this method to the madness:
``They hold the end of the skewer in one hand and grab the meat in
the other, using a piece of pita bread or a sheet of lavash as a
potholder. They pull the meat toward them a tiny bit to loosen it
from the skewer, then slide it off the skewer onto the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative skewers
</P>
<P>
   Not sure what to thread on your skewer? A few suggestions you
might not have thought about from The Complete Book of Outdoor
Cookery by James Beard and Helen Evans Brown:
</P>
<P>
   - Alternate cubes of turkey with oysters wrapped in bacon.
</P>
<P>
   - Wrap squares of veal and Swiss cheese in bacon.
</P>
<P>
   - Skewer cubes of cooked duck and green olives, then brush with
orange juice and butter.
</P>
<P>
   - Marinate raw shrimp in equal parts of soy and sherry, then
roll in sesame seeds.
</P>
<P>
   - Dip pineapple chunks in the juice of preserved ginger. Serve
with grated coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Fish sticks
</P>
<P>
   Too fancy-smancy for you tastes?
</P>
<P>
   As any seasoned camper will tell you, the best of campfire
cuisine is based on stick or spit cooking. In Roughing It Easy (The
Dian Thomas Company) you'll find methods for cooking eggs, fish,
meat loaf and apple pie on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't forget the marshmallows.

LABOR HAS LOST TOUCH WITH ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As America's labor movement struggles to revitalize
itself, its leadership should ponder the implications of the
National Education Association's rejection of a proposed merger
with the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The bid to create the country's largest union apparently
foundered because many of the NEA delegates considered the AFT too
militant. Those who voted no also were concerned about the merger
bringing the association into the AFL-CIO's fold. One Iowa teacher
said members feared losing the independence that has been a proud
part of the association's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The merger needed a two-thirds majority for approval but
received only 42 percent support. This was a stunning shortfall
considering the challenges facing those involved in traditional
public education. The voucher movement seeking wider freedom of
school choice is gaining momentum, as are other crusades to allow
public money to be used to subsidize private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge margin of disapproval, the NEA's leadership
vowed to continue pursuit of the merger, albeit in a form more
acceptable to members. Bob Chase, NEA president, said he believed
most delegates favored unification with the American Federation of
Teachers, ``but didn't think this plan was the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Chase may be suffering from the same inability to
read the public mood as other labor leaders. The anomaly of
organized labor is that while it continues to exert considerable
political power, it continues to lose membership. This is happening
both in terms of absolute numbers and as a percentage of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Although aggressive recruiting campaigns mounted by the AFL-CIO
last year added 400,000 union members to its rolls, this still
wasn't enough to produce a net gain for organized labor. What makes
this lack of progress all the more remarkable is that it's
happening during a job-creation boom that should be producing
substantial employment growth in unionized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind organized labor's declining appeal were
brought into sharper focus by the NEA vote. The leadership's agenda
seems too far out of step with the workplace hopes, dreams and
aspirations of ordinary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas organized labor's membership was once overwhelmingly
blue-collar Democratic, for instance, the political lines haveshifted. Many union members now are as likely to vote Republican as
Democrat and consider themselves moderates, if not outright
conservatives. To some degree this reflects the success labor has
had helping workers achieve prosperity through higher wages and
wealth accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, union executives act as if they were leading a mass of
undereducated working folk as economically and politically
oppressed as they were 50 or 100 years ago. As a result they fail
to connect often enough with today's worker, which makes recruiting
all the more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And when a few thousand General Motors workers in Michigan
strike and force huge layoffs of their brethren, it makes non-union
types all the more skeptical of the promised rewards of union
membership.
</P>
<P>
   When those representing the members of the NEA overwhelmingly
rejected a relationship with the harder-line leadership of
organized labor, their message was that they didn't think the
traditionalists could meet the challenges of a changing society,
workplace and economy.

COURT REVERSES CONVICTION OF `FREEMEN' CHARGED WITH FILING BOGUS
LIEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: In the first test of the state's new get-tough policy
on ``freemen'' and their common-law courts, a Missouri appeals
court on Tuesday reversed the convictions of 13 persons charged
with filing a $10.8 million bogus lien against a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled that though the
judge ``took great care in the trial of this matter and performed
admirably under the circumstances,'' he should have disqualified
himself at the defendants' request.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri legislators passed a law in 1996 banning the filing of
common-law court liens, with Secretary of State Rebecca Cook
calling it the toughest law in the country in fighting such actions
designed to vex public officials.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants who filed the multimillion-dollar lien against
the judge, nicknamed ``The Missouri 20'' by their sympathizers,
were the first prisoners in Attorney General Jay Nixon's war
against the so-called common-law courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, they were elated at the news of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed,'' said Donald Ray Schaefer, a Montgomery County
man who was released in November after serving 11 months of a
two-year sentence. ``We're quite pleased with finally maybe getting
some justice in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we did nothing wrong. They convicted us of a crime
that we did not commit because the judge was biased. We're not
against the government; we're against the people who are trying to
overthrow and run the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the attorney general's office were not happy with the
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unusual,'' said Mary Still, Nixon's spokeswoman.
``With all due respect for the judges, we fear that their leniency
with this group would set a dangerous precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   In their 17-page ruling, the justices said that the right of a
defendant to disqualify a judge in criminal and civil cases ``is
one of the keystones of our legal administrative edifice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No system of justice can function at its best or maintain
broad public confidence if a litigant can be compelled to submit
his case in a court where he sincerely believes the judge is
incompetent or prejudiced,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, statutes and rules are liberally construed in favor of
the right to disqualify....Therefore, if a request for trial judge
disqualification is in proper order, the trial judge's duty is to
sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law allows just one change of judge under those
circumstances, however.
</P>
<P>
   Still said the attorney general will ask for a rehearing at the
appellate court level ``so hopefully we will not have to go back
and have a new trial.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the defendants _ who represented themselves in court _
did not provide appropriate notice of their request for a new
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that standard rules of order in the court should be
followed and upheld, regardless of whether the defendant is pro se
or represented,'' she said. ``Had they followed appropriate rules
and provided notice that they were requesting a new judge, we would
not have objected to their request for a new judge. The fact is
they did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The convictions stemmed from the case of Amanda Lenk, a
17-year-old from Silex, Mo., who was stopped by the Missouri
Highway Patrol in February 1996 and cited for driving 78 mph in a
55 mph zone, failing to wear a seat belt and failing to drive
within a single lane.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Lenk filed a ``Declaration of Quiet Title,''
designating herself a ``sovereign citizen.'' When she appeared
before Lincoln County Associate Judge Patrick S. Flynn the
following month, her father, Melvin Lenk, warned the judge to drop
the charges. The judge refused and, two weeks later, received an
``Order to Appear'' in ``our one supreme court.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, 1996, a 20-member ``common-law grand jury''
convened in Bowling Green, Mo., and found the judge guilty of
violating Amanda Lenk's rights. The ``jury'' ordered that a $10.8
million lien be placed on the judge's property. The lien was filed
by Amanda Lenk's father and grandfather on April 1, 1996, with the
Lincoln County recorder's office.
</P>
<P>
   Following an investigation by the Missouri Highway Patrol, Nixon
ordered the arrests of those who had participated in the ``grand
jury'' for tampering with a judicial official _ a class C felony.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the defendants were tried in Lincoln County, with
Nixon sending his own special prosecutors to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn testified that he felt threatened by the lien and said he
saw two of the defendants in the courthouse after the charges were
filed against them. One of them, Flynn said, told the other that
the judge ``ought to be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   At their trial, the defendants requested a new judge, claiming,
among other things, that Circuit Court Judge Fred Rush was biased.
Rush denied their request, and all of the defendants were
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Patrick Logan of St. Peters and Clifford Keith Hobbs of
Auxvasse, the self-appointed leaders of ``our one supreme court,''
were sentenced to seven years. Most of the remaining defendants,
including Ima Deana Conklin of Oak Grove, received two-year
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs is still in prison. Still said she did not know yet
whether he would be released as a result of Tuesday's appeals court
action.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, who lives near Hermann in Montgomery County, said he
and the others now plan to sue the state for wrongfully convicting
them. And again, he said, they'll represent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never once had an attorney, wouldn't have an attorney,
because they're all part of the American Bar Association, whose
headquarters are in London, England,'' he said. ``They're all
taking this country over for England.''
</P>
<P>
   He said though he hasn't sat on a common-law grand jury
recently, ``I'm still teaching people about the constitution and
their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Still said Tuesday's court ruling would not discourage the
attorney general from prosecuting similar cases in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of procedure in court,'' she said. ``It
really doesn't have to do with the new law. Clearly, we feel that
no one has the right to threaten law enforcement and attempt to
sabotage the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sent a strong message, and we haven't had that much
activity ever since this case. I think that message still stands. I
think we'll get this straightened out in court.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and a woman whose daughter was
killed in a schoolyard shooting urged states and Congress on
Wednesday to tighten restrictions on children's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the series of recent campus killings ``seared the heart
of America,'' the president called for new laws similar to one
passed in Texas three years ago penalizing adults who fail to keep
guns away from minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still too easy for deadly weapons to wind up in the
hands of children, by intent or by accident, and then, to lead to
tragedy,'' Clinton said. ``No matter how you analyze this, it is
clear that the combination of children and firearms is deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced new federal regulations requiring
gun dealers to post warnings about laws barring the sale of
handguns to anyone under 18 and federal support for a Maryland
program designed to trace the sales and ownership of every gun
seized by police.
</P>
<P>
   The president's announcement followed emotional remarks from
Suzann Wilson, the mother of 11-year-old Brittheny Varner, one of
four students shot to death when two classmates opened fire at
Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark. A teacher also was killed
while trying to shield her students. Two boys _ ages 11 and 13 _
were arrested and charged in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Jonesboro could have been prevented,'' Wilson
said in a halting voice as she choked back tears. ``Two children
who should never have had unsupervised access to firearms were able
to put together a small arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To every gun owner in America I want to say please, please,
for the sake of the children, lock up your guns,'' Wilson said.
``Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen to your town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about gun rights, it's about gun safety,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the most recent school year, armed students opened fire
on classmates in Pearl, Miss.; Jonesboro; West Paducah, Ky.;
Edinboro, Pa.; and, seven weeks ago, in Springfield, Ore. Sixteen
students and teachers were killed in the incidents; 43 were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states have passed so-called ``safe-storage laws'' that
provide criminal penalties for adults who allow children
unsupervised access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged other states to follow suit. He also endorsed a
proposal by Sens. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and John Chafee, R-R.I.,
designed to encourage the use of so-called ``trigger locks'' or
other security mechanisms when storing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Durbin-Chafee proposal also would impose penalties on gun
owners who fail to safely store their guns or use trigger locks if
a firearm falls into the hands of a minor who uses it against
against another person, shows it in a public place, or takes it to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recent series of killings in our schools has seared the
heart of America about as much as anything I can remember,''
Clinton said. ``We can't shrug our shoulders and say, `well,
accidents happen,' or `some kids are beyond hope.' That's a copout.
Every one of us must step up to our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House has drawn criticism for brokering a
deal that would limit damage awards against small businesses _
including gun makers _ in product liability cases. The product
liability reform, which awaits action by the Senate, is a priority
of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, part of a tort-reform effort worked out during the
past 18 months by the White House and Senate Republicans, would put
a $250,000 cap on the amount small businesses must pay in punitive
damages for marketing defective products. Exempted from that cap _
which essentially means there are no limits to damages that be
awarded by the courts _ are makers of tobacco products and silicone
implants.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of
California, and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey announced plans
Tuesday to try to amend the legislation to allow unrestricted
damage awards against gun makers. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said he was ``not inclined'' to allow the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that if this bill passes in its present
form, it would limit product liability suits against gun makers and
sellers at the very time we are seeing such efforts that proved so
successful in the battle against smoking tobacco,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the amendment, Boxer said, ``this bill is a travesty, a
complete travesty.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire leads the major leagues in home runs
and in blank stares. Visualization, he calls it: Before each at-bat
McGwire will imagine the pitcher throwing the baseball, he'll
imagine how the ball will move, maybe a fastball or curveball, and
he'll imagine smashing the ball with his Paul Bunyan swing.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire stops there. In his mind's eye, the St. Louis
Cardinals slugger does not visualize home runs, which separates him
from just about everybody who follows baseball, fans and fellow
players alike.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are visualizing many home runs from McGwire, and Ken
Griffey, Jr., Sammy Sosa and others, as the second half of the
major league season starts. What they envision down the road is a
general siege on the single-season record for home runs _ 61,
established by the Yankees' Roger Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest record out there,'' said Tony Gwynn of the
San Diego Padres, the eight-time batting champion. ``It's bigger
than hitting .400. Breaking Maris' record is the biggest thing that
can be done in baseball today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the right fielder for the Chicago Cubs, has 33 home runs,
Seattle's Griffey has 35, and there are other sluggers who, with a
flurry of home runs, could join the pursuit. McGwire, however,
leads them all with 37 home runs, and he is considered the most
likely to scale the Maris mountain because of his extraordinary
power, and because of the refinements he's made as a hitter. Only
the pitchers' fear of him and their reluctance to throw him strikes
will prevent him from hitting 62 or more homers, most believe, so
long as he remains injury-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they pitch to him,'' said David Howard, the Cardinals'
veteran infielder, ``he'll hit 70 home runs. I have no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 52 homers in 1996, 58 last year. He's on a pace to
hit 70 home runs this season, averaging 1 for every 7.2 at-bats.
He's batting .310, .349 when there are runners on base, when
pitchers are more compelled to pitch to him. After Gwynn reached
first base against the Cardinals earlier this year, he turned to
McGwire and said, ``Everybody talks about your home runs, but
people don't realize what a good hitter you've become.''
</P>
<P>
   His home runs are titanic, their distances measured as far as
545 feet. His batting practice is a sideshow everywhere, fans
gathering in all decks of left field of whatever park he visits.
Opposing players stand and gawk like everybody else, their heads
turning with each blow, as if they're watching a space shuttle
launching.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in St. Louis, Glendon Rusch of the Kansas City Royals
made sure he was on the field to see McGwire's batting practice.
Two hours later, Rusch was on the mound, as the starting pitcher
for Kansas City, and in the seventh inning, he surrendered
McGwire's 37th home run, a shot of 472 feet. ``I'm going to do
everything I can to get him out,'' Rusch said the next day. ``But
once he hit it, I was going to watch it like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when opponents pitched to McGwire more without
such fear, and fearlessly. Though a dangerous slugger, McGwire had
a hole in his swing, and everybody knew you could get him out by
throwing fastballs inside _ even with average fastballs. Sure, if
you made a mistake, he'd crush the ball, but if you pitched him
correctly he had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire might be 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, his biceps and
quadriceps straining the fabric of his uniform, but the mechanics
of his swing were such that he couldn't get his bat around quickly
enough to hit the inside fastball. That's why McGwire had such a
terrible time against a hard thrower like Roger Clemens, with only
4 hits in 47 at-bats. Aim fastballs at McGwire's hands was the
conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Brad Ausmus, the catcher for the Houston
Astros, read in the team's scouting report that pitchers shouldn't
pitch inside to McGwire. Ausmus dismissed the intelligence, for he
played against McGwire in the American League two years ago and
knew that you could beat him with inside fastballs. ``When the
scouting report differs from my own experience,'' Ausmus said,
``I'll always rely on my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   With the left-hander Pete Schourek pitching to McGwire, Ausmus
called for a fastball inside. Schourek threw ``a good fastball,
89-90 mph, inside,'' Ausmus recalls. McGwire launched it into the
third deck, but just foul.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus wondered if McGwire's blast was a fluke, and later in the
series, with the right-hander Jose Lima on the mound, Ausmus called
for another fastball. ``Lima's fastball probably gets up to 92 mph,
and he put one right on McGwire's hands,'' Ausmus remembered. ``He
hit a missile over the fence that was never more than 25 feet off
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for conventional wisdom, so much for the holes in
McGwire's swing. He now has ``a perfect approach'' at the plate,
according to one of his former hitting coaches, after years of
evolution. Hitting, McGwire maintained last week, is the hardest
thing to do in sports. ``If it was easy, a lot more people would be
doing it,'' he said. ``You have half a second to realize whether
it's a slider, forkball, split-finger, or a 90-mph fastball. You've
got to be balanced at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have good hand-eye coordination. I guarantee, you
can get any athlete in any other sport, they wouldn't want to get
in that box to face the pitcher, but we do.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Nobody visualized McGwire as a great hitter when he was in high
school. The University of Southern California figured him for a
pitcher when he enrolled there in the fall of 1981, but after that
first year, Ron Vaughn, an assistant coach with the Trojans, took
McGwire with him to play first base in an Alaska summer league.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had seen McGwire playing for Damien High in Claremont,
Calif., and thought his swing was too long _ that it took McGwire a
long time to get the head of the bat through the strike zone _ and
that he lacked balance. But McGwire was willing to work, and he had
power. Vaughn can remember McGwire that summer in Alaska, driving a
ball all the way to the 30-yard line of a football field beyond the
left field fence.
</P>
<P>
   In time, and with work, McGwire became a star hitter and was
drafted 10th over all by Oakland in 1984. Three years later he hit
49 home runs in his rookie season for the Athletics. ``He was more
of a reactive hitter,'' recalled Merv Rettenmund, the hitting coach
for Oakland at the time. ``He just saw the ball and hit it. He
wasn't a student of the game, like he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire continued to hit home runs, but his average plummeted
from year to year, from .289 to .260 to .231, and in 1991, he
batted .201. He had that big hole in his swing, at his hands, and
he struck out about once in every three times at bat. Rettenmund is
convinced that McGwire's biggest problem was his eyesight. ``He was
squinting all the time,'' said Rettenmund. ``He just looked like he
had no clue where the ball was.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, McGwire first learned about his poor eyesight while
playing Little League. His father had replaced him as the pitcher,
sending him to shortstop, and when the boy stopped crying, he
realized he couldn't see home plate. McGwire now has 20/500 vision,
which he corrects with contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he addressed his vision trouble, McGwire started
suffering injuries, primarily to his left heel; he played a total
of 74 games during the 1993-94 seasons. He considered quitting and
becoming a policeman, but he thought about his father, John, a
dentist, who contracted polio at age seven. ``He never had a chance
to play sports when he was a kid,'' McGwire once explained. ``When
I think of my father, it makes my injuries seem so miniscule.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire kept playing, improved his physical fitness, and he
learned more about hitting. Slowly, McGwire plugged the hole in his
swing, where pitchers had thrown fastballs past him.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McGwire has streamlined his access to the news
media. But in several group interviews as well as interviews from
previous years, he has provided cursory descriptions of the
adjustments he's made in his swing. Former coaches and peers have
provided the more telling details.
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements were his ability to reduce the movement
in his hands. Rather than draw them back slightly, as the pitch was
being thrown, McGwire taught himself to lock them in place and
bring them forward. Before, McGwire had to cock and fire his swing
as the pitch was being delivered. With the adjustment, he
effectively cocked his swing before the pitch was delivered, and
then fired his bat. He had shortened his long swing, made it
quicker, and began hitting inside fastballs that once overwhelmed
him.
</P>
<P>
   He changed the positioning of his feet, too. Early in his
career, he had turned his toes inward as he prepared to hit. Now
his feet are turned outward slightly, and he takes one small stride
toward the pitcher of approximately eight inches.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball lingo, McGwire has quiet feet and quiet hands _
quiet, because there's so little wasted motion, and the reduced
movement allows him to keep his head in place, Rettenmund says, and
see the pitches better. ``He couldn't identify a breaking ball
before,'' said Rettenmund. ``Now he sees everything and he's much
more patient and better at not chasing pitches out of the strike
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet hands, quiet feet, loud bat. Robert Adair, a professor of
physics at Yale University, says that while most hitters generate
bat speed of 65 mph, McGwire's is ``at least 75 mph,'' maybe more.
If you slow down videotape of all the great hitters, Adair noted,
you'll see that at the point of contact, their bodies have stopped
their movement, the front leg is stiff, and all the energy
generated has been funneled into the head of the bat. ``That's the
beautiful part of the swing,'' said Adair.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire generates around 30 percent more energy than most
hitters, according to Adair, swinging a 34 1/2-inch, 33-ounce bat _
his is different than most power hitters, because he uses a bat of
regular proportions, rather than one with a tapered handle and a
wide barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Rick Reed allowed McGwire's 400th career homer earlier
this year at Shea Stadium. ``He hit it, like a mile high, and it
looked like a pop-up, but it kept going,'' Reed said. ``It was 800
feet in the air and it landed in the first row of the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed acknowledged the fear of pitching to McGwire _ a physical
fear, of the possibility he might hit the ball through the middle.
``If he hit it back at you, it might go through you,'' said Reed.
``He hits a nubber in front of the plate and you just about jump
out of your shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he hits a home run or strikes out, McGwire's demeanor
rarely varies. ``I've never seen anybody that intense,'' said
Howard, ``or someone that can concentrate like that. He hit a grand
slam once and when he got to home plate, he seemed a little
surprised all these guys were waiting for him. He got back to the
dugout and asked, `How many guys were on base?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands there with his eyes closed, and he's already
envisioning what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire begins to visualize as he goes to the bat rack, staring
straight ahead. Two batters removed from his at-bat, McGwire will
stand at the base of the dugout steps, resting the bat flatly
across his shoulder, watching the pitcher work. When the pitcher
goes into his delivery, McGwire draws the bat down, as if to cock
it.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire repeats this throughout his teammate's at-bat, and
continues the practice when he reaches the on-deck circle, watching
the pitcher, cocking his bat, then resting it on his shoulder,
staring downward between pitches, visualizing. In his mind's eye,
he's seeing the pitch perfectly, hitting it squarely; when hit
properly, a baseball is compressed to one-half of its original
diameter at the moment of contact.
</P>
<P>
   Now his name is being called, it's his turn to bat, and McGwire
slowly circles behind the catcher, bat on his shoulder, staring
downward, never looking at the pitcher. He steps into the box,
holding the bat in his right hand, and with his right foot, he
violently digs a hole, breastworks for his swing. His right foot is
like a pick ax. His biceps, 20 inches around, are only partly
concealed by his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He steps back, glances at his bat, steps back in, settles into
his stance, feet turned out slightly. Only then does he look at the
pitcher, a stare. McGwire is very large. The ballpark seems
smaller. His bat is drawn back.
</P>
<P>
   By then the pitcher probably is visualizing, too, along with
everybody else. &QL;

BROWN QUITS THE NEW YORKER FOR MIRAMAX JOB

<P>
   America's highest-profile magazine no longer has America's
highest-profile editor. In a move no less shocking for having been
speculated about for several months, Tina Brown resigned as editor
of The New Yorker Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is leaving the magazine after six years to start a joint
venture with Miramax Films. The New York-based firm will publish a
new monthly magazine, as well as produce films, generate television
programming, and publish books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partnership with Miramax is a unique creative and
business opportunity _ to own what we create and to expand our
vision into other media,'' Brown said in a statement issued by
Miramax, an autonomous division of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 44, will serve as chairman. The firm's president will be
Ron Galotti, who resigned Wednesday as publisher of Vogue. Vogue,
like The New Yorker, is part of Conde Nast Publications. Other
magazines Conde Nast publishes include Glamour, GQ, and Vanity
Fair, where Brown and Galotti previously worked together.
</P>
<P>
   No successor has been named at either The New Yorker or Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina Brown is the best editor in the world, with taste and
talent that is second to none,'' said Harvey Weinstein, cochairman
of Miramax, in a prepared statement. ``I couldn't be more thrilled
to be forming a business that will allow her to take that genius
and apply it to film, television, and books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it took this long,'' said Esquire film critic
David Thomson of Brown's move into new media. ``The possibility of
her involvement in films has long been there. Especially when she
was at Vanity Fair, there were overtures made,'' said Thomson, who
wrote for Brown when she was editor of Vanity Fair. ``Her father
was a film producer, and she's never made a secret of her interest
in the business. She certainly has no enemies in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   As editor of Vanity Fair from 1984 to 1992, the English-born
Brown established her reputation on this side of the Atlantic for
big-ticket, high-gloss editing. She made the magazine an emblem of
'80s excess _ and the antithesis of the sedate, reflective style of
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective clash of magazine cultures made for front-page
news when Brown was named editor of The New Yorker in 1992. While
largely retaining the magazine's intellectual cachet, Brown
enlivened The New Yorker's graphics, made it consistently topical,
and jettisoned the magazine's long-held reputation for propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she added to The New Yorker was getting people to read it
and talk about it in a way they had not in a long, long time,''
said Arthur Cooper, editor-in-chief of GQ.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's success came at a price. The New Yorker increased its
circulation from 450,000 to 800,000 but has never been profitable
under Brown. Last year, it lost an estimated $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Brown's departure began to circulate last spring.
Fueling the speculation had been reported unhappiness at The New
Yorker, which had been a separate business entity, over its being
consolidated into Conde Nast operations. In May, David Carey was
named president of the magazine without Brown's being consulted.
Her contract was reportedly up for renewal this month, although a
senior Conde Nast editor said Wednesday, ``I'd take the contract
issue with a grain of salt. Contracts aren't regarded all that
seriously around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will stay at The New Yorker through the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about her successor began as soon as news of her
resignation began to spread through the media world. Among many
names bruited about have been those of Graydon Carter, who
succeeded her at Vanity Fair, GQ's Cooper, Conde Nast editorial
director James Truman, House &AMP; Garden editor Dominique Browning,
New Yorker fiction editor Bill Buford, New Yorker staff writer
David Remnick, and New York Times Magazine editor Adam Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's resignation is this month's second major magazine
shake-up. It follows the departure last week of US News &AMP; World
Report editor James Fallows, who was fired by that publication's
editorial director, Harold Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is married to Tina Brown.

   &UR; Y2K BUG COULD HAVE BENEFITS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is not too early to begin breaking out in nervous hives over
the ``millennium bug,'' that minor computer glitch that, come Jan.
1, 2000, will simultaneously detonate every nuclear warhead on the
planet, crash the world's stock markets and, perhaps most alarming
of all, make it impossible to buy a lottery ticket at your
neighborhood convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Or not, depending on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what's so unsettling about the millennium bug, also
known as ``Y2K'' for reasons that are altogether clear: You do not
know whether you should be stockpiling your underground compound in
Wyoming with emergency rations and automatic weapons or popping
another cold one and watching ``Ren and Stimpy'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug refers to what might or might not happen in
the first few seconds of 2000 when all the world's computers
advance the date from 99 to 00. Although computers are incredibly
clever to the point that they can run power plants and create the
special effects for movies like ``Armageddon'' (is there a
connection here?), they are also incredibly stupid in that they
cannot figure out that the year after 1999 is 2000, not 1900.
Apparently, once a computer decides that the year is 1900, it goes
crazy with grief, which is understandable considering that
computers hadn't been invented yet in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   What this means to us is unclear or perfectly clear, depending
on whom you wish to believe. There are Internet forums where
``doomsayers'' debate ``Pollyannas'' over the severity of the
millennium bug's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Turner (whom it would be safe to label a doomsayer) of
Cartersville, Mo., manufactures ``Y2K survival domes'' and markets
them on the Internet for $7,000 apiece. Other alarmists have begun
storing survival food, building fortified hideouts in the
countryside and stockpiling guns and ammo to protect their turf.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, it does not take a great deal of incentive for a
certain percentage of the American population to build fortified
hideouts in the countryside or stockpile guns and ammo. A
penny-a-gallon rise in the price of gasoline might do the trick, as
might a tabloid news story reporting that the House of
Representatives is controlled by aliens.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its severity, the millennium bug is certainly bad news
for people like myself whose feelings about computers range from
vague mistrust to outright terror. Anyone who writes on a computer
has experienced a ``crash'' where days, weeks or even years of work
is suddenly beamed into a parallel universe from where it can never
be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of crashes, airline passengers are unlikely to take
much comfort from the millennium bug, particularly if they were
nervous to begin with. What fun it would be to be flying at 35,000
feet over the Rocky Mountains at midnight, Jan. 31, 1999, and have
the onboard computer suddenly reprogram itself so that it is no
longer flying the airplane but is, instead, colorizing the movie
``Casablanca'' or ordering one of Candace Turner's survival domes
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be interesting to go to the supermarket for a
half-gallon of milk and a loaf of bread and have the check-out
scanner tell you that you owe $35,000
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is also possible, I suppose, that the millennium
bug will cause all the world's automatic teller machines to
suddenly shoot out a stream of $20 bills and all the slot machines
in Las Vegas to hit ``jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   So you might want to plan on being in a big casino when the
clock strikes midnight Jan. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I just wouldn't advise taking an airplane to get there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Write More Better &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Avoid alliteration. Always.
</P>
<P>
   2. Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.
</P>
<P>
   3. Employ the vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   4. Eschew ampersands &AMP; abbreviations, etc.
</P>
<P>
   5. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remember to never split an infinitive.
</P>
<P>
   7. Contractions aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
</P>
<P>
   9. One should never generalize.
</P>
<P>
   10. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, `I hate
quotations. Tell me what you know.`
</P>
<P>
   11. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
</P>
<P>
   12. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary;
it's highly superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   13. Be more or less specific.
</P>
<P>
   14. Understatement is always best.
</P>
<P>
   15. One-word sentences? Eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   16. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.
</P>
<P>
   17. The passive voice is to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   18. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.
</P>
<P>
   19. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   20. Who needs rhetorical questions?
</P>
<P>
   21. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.
</P>
<P>
   22. Don't never use a double negation.
</P>
<P>
   23. capitalize every sentence and remember always end it with
point
</P>
<P>
   24. Do not put statements in the negative form.
</P>
<P>
   25. Verbs have to agree with their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   26. Proofread carefully to see if you words out.
</P>
<P>
   27. If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great
deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.
</P>
<P>
   28. A writer must not shift your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   29. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction. (Remember,
too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.)
</P>
<P>
   30. Don't overuse exclamation marks!!!
</P>
<P>
   31. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.
</P>
<P>
   32. Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   33. If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking
verb is.
</P>
<P>
   34. Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   35. Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.
</P>
<P>
   36. Everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with
singular nouns in their writing.
</P>
<P>
   37. Always pick on the correct idiom.
</P>
<P>
   38. The adverb always follows the verb.
</P>
<P>
   39. Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; They're
old hat; seek viable alternatives.
</P>

JURY BEGINS WEIGHING BRAWLEY CASE EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. -- After seven months of courtroom testimony
and tirades, the jury in the Tawana Brawley defamation trial
finally started deliberations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the plaintiff, Steven Pagones, it has been a longer wait
still _ 10 years, in fact, since he filed his lawsuit against the
Rev. Al Sharpton and two other civil-rights activists, who had
publicly accused Pagones and five other white men of abducting and
raping Brawley, a 15-year-old black girl.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the accusations set off a storm of racial tensions
not only in this sleepy town, 80 miles north of New York City, but
across the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones was exonerated of all charges in 1988 by a grand jury,
which also concluded that Brawley had probably concocted the entire
tale. However, Sharpton and his two co-defendants _ Alton H. Maddox
and C. Vernon Mason _ kept up their campaign against Pagones, who
responded by suing them for defamation of character.
</P>
<P>
   He is asking $400 million in damages, though it is unlikely the
three could raise even a tiny fraction of that sum.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began last December, has been interrupted
repeatedly by loud and lengthy outbursts from all sides of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the case, Sharpton _ who, over the years, has
fashioned an increasingly respectable political career for himself
_ has tried to sidestep the question of whether a rape took place
or whether Pagones did it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his lawyer, Michael Hardy, has argued that Sharpton was
simply acting as Brawley's advocate and believed what she said.
Since the law holds that Pagones must prove the defendants acted
with malice and ``reckless disregard for the truth,'' Sharpton, by
this argument, cannot be said to have defamed Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maddox and Mason have taken a different tack _
continuing to maintain that Pagones raped Brawley and used his
position as a Dutchess County assistant district attorney to cover
up the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, has meanwhile argued that all
the defendants knew they were lying and that they have not produced
a single shred of evidence against his client.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing statement Tuesday, Stanton went further and
called the three defendants ``evil,'' likening their ``big lies''
to those of Hitler's propaganda minister, Josef Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton lashed out against Stanton for this comparison after
Wednesday's session, saying, ``We never asked for Mr. Pagones to be
put in an oven. We only asked him to be put in a courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also defended his own actions of a decade ago more
outspokenly than usual these days. ``I believe that what we did,
history dictated that we do,'' he told reporters. ``What we did,
history will vindicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was packed Wednesday, mainly with supporters of
Sharpton and Maddox, who have been coming up here regularly, from
Brooklyn and New Jersey, since the trial began.
</P>
<P>
   It took all morning for Justice S. Barrett Hickman to read the
jury his legal instructions _ the precise wording of which he had
hammered out, over four days' of negotiations last week, with the
four lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant instruction was that the jurors may
infer from Brawley's absence as a witness that she would not have
supported the contention that she was abducted and raped.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the jury out of the room, the defense lawyers raised
a few final legal objections. Finally, at 2:50 pm, Hickman ordered
the six jurors _ four white, two black _ to begin deliberating.
</P>
<P>
   By state law, the jury does not need to reach a unanimous
verdict. Agreement by five of the six jurors is sufficient.

 &HT;      SPECTER BACK TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 8 -- U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter settled into
familiar territory Wednesday, back in his Senate office after
nearly a six-week recuperation from heart surgery, cracking jokes
about his restless approach to lawmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor told me to take it easy. I asked him how to spell it,''
Specter, R-Pa., quipped. He said the doctor couldn't spell ``easy''
-- so he won't be taking it easy, at least not as easy as doctors
would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors have given me the green light to proceed with
caution,'' he said, slightly more serious, in a 45-minute briefing
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Specter returned to the Senate floor Tuesday night, receiving a
round of applause from his colleagues, and had his first full day
at work Wednesday. He checked into Thomas Jefferson Hospital in
Philadelphia May 30 with chest pains, which led to a double bypass
surgery. Within a week he was back in the hospital with aspiration
pneumonia, a complication that Specter said was ``not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel very lucky to have weathered the storm,'' he said,
admitting to being heavily sedated during the first few days after
the surgery and unable to recall much of what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He was released June 15, and has spent the past three weeks
recuperating at his home in Philadelphia. Three times a day Specter
took 500-yard walks, followed by hand and leg exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not been allowed to play his favorite pastime,
squash, and will not be allowed to play until probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, 68, said he conferred with his doctors on a plan to
ease his way back into his duties as a senator. He'll spend most of
his day in his private hideaway, just off the Senate floor, so that
he will have an easy walk to Senate votes, as opposed to the quick
trots most senators must make from their office building to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He will not attend many Senate hearings, which usually number
about four a day. This timetable will also keep Specter off the
campaign trail in his bid to win a fourth six-year term to the
senate.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and his aides do not expect health to be an issue in the
campaign against state Sen. Bill Lloyd, D-Somerset, and Specter
said he would be ``full tilt before Labor Day'' -- leaving him
plenty of time to campaign against the vastly underfunded Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Turning philosophical, Specter admitted that his doctors would
prefer him to slow down his schedule but that it was ``very
difficult'' for him ``to maintain a slower pace,'' something that
was ``not doable'' until after the election -- probably never. ``I
don't anticipate any slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart surgery comes fives year after Specter had surgery for
a benign brain tumor. ``I've been able to take both of them in
stride,'' said Specter, who is thinner but would not say how much
weight he lost after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he has not given any thought to retiring. In the
short run, he said, ``If at any time I'm not up to it, I'll go home
and go to bed.''

ISRAEL DOWNPLAYS PALESTINE'S UN ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government went out of its way Wednesday
to downplay the nearly unanimous vote in the United Nations Tuesday
giving Palestinians a voice in the world body for the first time.
Even Israeli newspapers treated the action lightly.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts throughout the Middle East said that the 124-4 vote
upgrading the Palestine Liberation Organization's status at the
United Nations was a startling example of the increased isolation
of the United States and Israel in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Key US allies such as Britain, Germany, and France voted against
the United States and Israel Tuesday, apparently frustrated by the
Clinton administration's reluctance to push Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu into the next phase of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The UN vote also highlights the dividing line between domestic
Israeli politics and its international relations.
</P>
<P>
   David Makovsky, the veteran diplomatic correspondent for
Israel's leading daily newspaper, Haaretz, said, ``Israel's
isolation is very real internationally. But domestically for the
Likud it is almost a vindication of their core belief that the
whole world is against us. The fact is Israel gets much more worked
up about what the US says than what the UN does.'' If US Secretary
of State Madeline Albright ``sneezes, the place worries. But the
UN? Oh well, we expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The looming question a lot of people want to avoid is, could
it have an effect on the Americans' thinking, the allegations in
the Arab world and the greater world of a double standard?'' asked
Makovsky. ``America can't go it alone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Alpher, Jerusalem representative for the American Jewish
Committee, said that while the UN vote is in itself only a ``blip
on the screen,'' the growing isolation of Israel over its policies
toward peace is a more profound matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's international profile is suffering,'' he said. ``It's
economy is suffering. Both of these had improved dramatically since
Oslo ... Now they are backtracking. The damage thus far is not
extensive, but the direction concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN measure, which granted Palestinians the right to
introduce resolutions and participate in debates in the General
Assembly, also reflected Palestinian momentum toward international
recognition of the Palestinian Authority's right to declare itself
an independent state _ a possibility that could eventualy erupt in
bloodshed and permanently wreck the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, David Bar-Illan,
dismissed the idea that the UN vote would have any impact on the
domestic politics that surround the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a shelf life of two days at best. It means
nothing,'' Bar-Illan said. ``It's not the only time we've been left
out in a UN vote with only the US and Micronesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan added that the resolution, as adopted, was a diluted
version of the original Palestinian proposal which sought to grant
the PLO full representation in the United Nations. He said that
Netanyahu had successfully lobbied against that draft in recent
months with European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While a broad political spectrum of Israelis believe that the
United Nations is reflexively anti-Israel, Netanyahu's rightist
Likud party in particular is convinced of this alleged
partisanship. Bar-Illan, citing the controversial 1975 UN vote that
equated Zionism with racism, said, ``You can't take the UN
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu government thus far has resisted US pressure to
accept a further 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank _ a
proposal that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has accepted.
Netanyahu's fragile coalition has frayed during the debate on
whether to accept this idea or the 9 percent alternative that Ariel
Sharon, the legendary hawk and current infrastructure minister,
insists is critical to ensure Israel's security over water
resources, settlements, and military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by delays, Arafat has vowed to declare the creation
of a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999. May 4 marks the end of the
five-year transitional period stipulated in the Oslo accords, which
began when Israel and the PLO signed the agreement in Cairo on May
4, 1994. Under the agreement, final status talks were to have begun
in May 1996 and were to be concluded no later than May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has blasted Arafat's statements as a violation of the
peace accords, which deny either party the right unilaterally to
alter issues to be negotiated during final status. But Netanyahu
has been criticized internationally for doing precisely that when
he recently announced plans to expand Jerusalem's municipal
boundaries.

DAUGHTER OF HATE CRIME VICTIM URGES BEEFED-UP FEDERAL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The daughter of a disabled Texas man who was
dragged to death last month allegedly by white supremacists issued
a tearful plea Wednesday for Congress to beef up the federal law
against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism of the initiative, Renee Mullins, the oldest
daughter of James Byrd Jr., wept as she argued before a hearing of
the Senate Judiciary Committee that lawmakers could help prevent
other atrocities like her father's slaying by passing the Hate
Crimes Prevention Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, co-sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and
backed by President Clinton, would strengthen the current law and
broaden the statute to cover crimes motivated by hatred for women,
people with disabilities, and homosexuals. The law now is aimed at
hate crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing this bill into law would give some mercy for my family
and for the families of future victims of such horrible crimes,''
said the 27-year-old Mullins. ``Mercy is like a glove that fits the
hand, and passing this bill surely will fit right into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including a coalition of federal judges, described the
proposal as an unwarranted, wasteful, and possibly unconstitutional
federal intervention into the jurisdictions of state and local law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also is expected to rankle Republican congressional
leaders who oppose expanding laws to protect homosexual rights. The
House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for July 22, but
the bill's prospects for passage this year are far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Judiciary
Committee, backed the bill's goal of curbing crimes motivated by
hatred for particular groups of citizens. But he raised concerns
about the measure's potential impact on the overburdened federal
courts and indicated he may favor a scaled-back proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for anybody to be treated hatefully in our
country today,'' Hatch said. ``The committee's going to move on a
hate crimes bill.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,750 hate crimes occurred in the United States in
1996, yet only a handful were prosecuted under the federal law,
according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Byrd's case, county prosecutors obtained capital murder
indictments this week against three suspects charged with beating
the 49-year-old musician, chaining him by his ankles to the back of
a pickup truck and draggging him nearly three miles to his death on
a country road in Jasper, Texas. Police said the alleged ringleader
uttered racially laced vulgarities throughout the attack.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas prosecutors had failed to vigorously pursue the case,
as has happened in other racially motivated slayings, federal
authorities may have been unable to bring hate-crime charges
against Byrd's alleged killers because of restrictions in the
current law, according to supporters of Kennedy's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Current law requires prosecutors to prove the victim was
participating in a federally protected activity, such as voting or
serving on a jury. ``The gaps in the current law mean that
prosecutors are fighting these despicable crimes with one hand tied
behind their backs,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., testifying for the
Clinton administration, agreed. Holder also supported expanding the
law to cover attacks on women, people with disabilities, and
homosexuals that are based on hatred for those groups. ``It makes
no sense that violent, hateful people can be prosecuted for attacks
on African-Americans based on race but not for assaults on gays
based on sexual orientation,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal judges expressed no official position on
the plan, their representative, US District Judge Richard J. Arcara
of Buffalo, N.Y., described the measure as ``the latest proposal in
a trend that seeks _ unwisely in our view _ to expand the criminal
jurisdiction of the federal courts into matters previously
prosecuted exclusively in the state courts.''

STOLEN OLD MASTERS SURFACE IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four long-lost Old Master paintings that were stolen 30 years
ago are to be presented to the president of Romania at a ceremony
in Washington later this month. President Emil Constantinescu is to
return the paintings to a medieval castle in the Transylvanian
region of Romania from which they disappeared in a brazen theft in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian and Netherlandish paintings were recovered by the
U.S. Customs Service in the house of a Romanian immigrant in
Florida. The immigrant, Mike Oprisi, who gave a dramatic account of
having escaped from Romania when it was under Communist rule, said
he had had no knowledge that the paintings were stolen and had
bought them from a Gypsy in Vienna for $1,200 before coming to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   When stolen art is turned over to law enforcement authorities,
suspicion sometimes falls upon the individual returning it. But
Patrick Jones, a spokesman with the Customs Service, which now has
possession of the paintings, said that although the man's story was
unusual, everything that could be checked _ including a bill of
sale and customs declaration when the paintings entered the United
States _ had been checked and that Customs was not making any
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual who gave up the paintings was very cooperative,
but of course we could not find anyone to confirm his whole
story,'' Jones said. ``On the other hand, no one ever escaped a
Soviet bloc country in front of a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States will hand the four paintings over to
Constantinescu in Washington when he visits the headquarters of the
World Bank on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Constantinescu will first meet President Clinton and
then accept the artworks,'' said Cristian Matei, the cultural
counselor at the Romanian Embassy in Washington, who has been busy
organizing the visit. ``We're very pleased that these two events
could be combined.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, among a group of eight that was stolen from the
Bruhenthal castle-museum in Sibiu, Romania, include works that art
experts believe to be by Titian or an artist in the Venetian school
of Titian; Dieric Bouts, the 15th-century Netherlands master, or
perhaps his son; Franz van Mieris the Elder, a 17th-century Dutch
artist; and Rosalba Carriera, an 18th-century Venetian master, or
another artist in the Venetian school.
</P>
<P>
   American art experts who have studied the paintings in recent
weeks estimated they are worth somewhere between $300,000 and more
than $1 million. One expert, who died last December shortly after
making an appraisal, put the value of the purported Bouts painting,
``Man With a Skull,'' to be worth $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The story began on May 27, 1968, when officials of the
Bruhenthal discovered that eight ``very valuable paintings by Old
Masters,'' according to their report, had been stolen from the
museum overnight. A year later, the Romanian government issued a
circular about the theft, describing the eight paintings in detail,
but there was no response.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, the young Oprisi decided ``to seek a new life
in the West,'' as he expressed it in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   With only the clothes on his back and about $80 in his pocket,
he said, he slipped out of Romania, swam across the Danube, made
his way across Yugoslavia to Austria and settled in Vienna, where
he claimed political asylum and worked as a tool and die maker.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, he said, he met a Gypsy woman who offered to sell him
four Old Master paintings. He borrowed money from an aunt living in
Ohio and bought the four artworks for $1,200, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Oprisi emigrated to the United States and
settled in Florida, becoming an American citizen in 1976. In 1996,
he said, he noticed on the back of the painting referred to as
``Man With a Skull'' the seal of the royal Hohenzollern family, to
which the King of Romania had belonged.
</P>
<P>
   He showed it to an old friend, Frank Cesar, a Hungarian-born art
appraiser and restoration expert who lived in Chazy, N.Y., near
Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar said he thought the painting was by Dieric Bouts or
perhaps one of the master's sons and was worth $1.2 million.
Seeking further evaluation, Cesar sent a photograph of the painting
to Jack Kilgore, a Manhattan dealer in Dutch and Flemish Old Master
paintings. A short while later, Cesar died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kilgore sent the photograph of ``Man With a Skull''
to the Netherlands Research Institute for Art History in The Hague.
The institute quickly identified it as one of the stolen paintings.
The Dutch institute then notified Interpol, the international
police agency, which in turn alerted the Customs Service. They
located Oprisi in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Rossi, the senior Customs agent on the case, recalled
that he was astounded when Oprisi volunteered that he had not one
but four Old Master works and that he would surrender them all to
Customs if it could be established that they were stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was quickly established by John Baratte, a former
museum director and art scholar retained by Customs for the job.
``This was an easy one,'' Baratte said. ``I was only trying to
match the actual paintings with the fax sent by Interpol, and they
were the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Oprisi then signed a statement in which he abandoned ownership,
and Customs notified the Romanian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out there was even a suspicion that the paintings
might be stolen,'' said Oprisi, ``I decided to give them away with
no expectation of winning a medal or congratulations or anything. I
could fight them by saying the statute of limitations had run, but
I didn't want to. I said, `Take them, and if the government of
Romania wants to repay the $1,200 I spent, I'll accept it, but if
they don't want to pay, they can have the paintings free.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oprisi vehemently denies any knowledge of the four paintings
that are still missing, including Van Dyck's ``Death of Cleopatra''
and ``Portrait of a Man'' by Hans Holbein the Elder.  &QL;

CHAOS REIGNS AT HONG KONG'S NEW AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Three days after its much-trumpeted opening, Hong
Kong's $20 billion airport is lurching from crisis to crisis. Just
as the airport seems to be reducing the chaos in the passenger
terminal, computer glitches have all but paralyzed its air-cargo
operations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hong Kong International Airport's main cargo
handler said it would extend until Saturday an embargo on all
exports and imports carried on passenger jets. Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Ltd. first imposed an embargo on Tuesday, after it began
to lose track of shipments, causing containers to pile up next to
its giant terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The company handles 82 percent of the more than 4,000 tons of
air cargo that flows through Hong Kong every day. And the embargo,
which applies to all shipments except medical supplies, newspapers,
food and livestock, promises to ripple through this city's
trade-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can probably suffer through a couple of weeks of this,''
said Ian Perkin, an economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce. ``But exporters are going to be hit, and they're facing
tough times already.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said the airport's messy opening was inflicting serious
damage on Hong Kong's image. After relentlessly promoting the
airport as a symbol of its Swiss-watch efficiency, Hong Kong has
had to endure horror stories about passengers waiting two hours to
get off planes, lost luggage, dirty restrooms, blank flight
information boards and crates of seafood rotting on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger terminal settled into a semblance of normalcy
Wednesday, though some weary travelers said they had waited an hour
for bags or had been sent to the wrong baggage carousels by faulty
overhead screens. Still, compared with the air-cargo terminal
across the runway, it was poetry in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolute chaos,'' said Ross Allen, the operations
director of DHL Worldwide Express in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Containers were strewn across the tarmac, as freight handlers
tried in vain to match containers with planes. Allen said he spent
the day plotting how to route DHL's Asian cargo around Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are teething problems with any large project,'' he said,
``but we're very surprised by the level of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's other lavish new airport, Kuala Lumpur International in
Malaysia, has also suffered a trouble-prone opening. As in Hong
Kong, the airport uses modern technology to control functions like
gate assignments and baggage handling. But last week, software
glitches forced passenger delays.
</P>
<P>
   Kuala Lumpur's cargo operation has also bogged down badly _ with
seafood, vegetables and other perishable goods left sitting for
days. According to The Sun, a daily newspaper in Kuala Lumpur,
garbage trucks are transporting rotten cargo to a nearby dump
several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals built a $1 billion complex, called
Super Terminal 1, to sort and store cargo. But after a software
glitch erased the company's inventory list, it was forced to
transport most of the cargo 19 miles west to its old terminal at
Kai Tak Airport, which was closed on Sunday after 73 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after it lifts the embargo, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
said it would continue to process most imported cargo at Kai Tak.
Only food, medical supplies, newspapers and other perishables will
be handled at the Super Terminal. In the meantime, it said, it will
try to fix its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These temporary arrangements are designed to provide the best
level of service we can to customers,'' the company said Wednesday.
Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, did not return telephone calls seeking further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the airport's travails have prompted a flurry
of finger-pointing. In interviews with several local papers on
Tuesday, Charter said his company had to meet an unrealistic
timetable to have its terminal up and running by opening day.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Hong Kong Airport Authority, Christopher
Donnolley, said: ``We've had an agreement with them for some time
now. The agreement was to have 75 percent of capacity on the day
the airport opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials have also come under pressure. The city's
two top civil servants, Anson Chan and Sir Donald Tsang, visited
the airport on Tuesday to assess the problems. ``It's hard getting
a turkey to fly,'' said the headline on an editorial in The Hong
Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Among passengers, though, a more tolerant attitude prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sogo, a businessman arriving from Tokyo, said he waited
more than an hour for his baggage. ``It's only the first week,'' he
said. ``It will be fine in six months.''

 COMMENTARY: WAITING FOR THE D.A.  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's an outrage either way.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a foul-up in the office of Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles Hynes, a man who may be wanted in South Carolina, or who
may be totally innocent, was dumped for the better part of a month
in the limbo of Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Johnson, a city employee and part-time musician, was
arrested in Brooklyn on June 13 for carrying an open beer can in
public. The 41-year-old father of two was not released from jail
until last Monday. Should he have gone to Rikers at all? Should he
still be in custody? Thanks to the D.A.'s office, we have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was on his way to his mother's apartment in Coney Island
when two police officers spotted the can of beer, which he was
carrying in a brown paper bag. They arrested him. A computer check
turned up a fugitive warrant from Florence County, S.C. It said
Johnson was wanted for illegal possession of a controlled
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he had only been in South Carolina once, when he
took a bus that passed through the state on its way to Birmingham,
Ala. He said he never got off the bus, was not arrested and could
not be the man that the authorities in Florence were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Now this would seem to be a pretty easy case. Clouseau could
have solved it in a minute. Johnson was in custody in Brooklyn and
his fingerprints and mug shot had been taken. All investigators had
to do was compare his prints to those of the man being sought. In
this age of computers and fax machines, that should have taken
approximately no time at all.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, it still hadn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of carrying an open beer can was almost immediately
adjourned in contemplation of dismissal, but because of the
outstanding warrant Johnson was ordered held without bail. He was
taken to Rikers and left there.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Aid lawyers representing Johnson pleaded for a comparison
of fingerprints. Nothing doing.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Moletteri, supervising attorney for the Legal Aid Society
in Brooklyn, said her office was told that the D.A. was waiting for
a ``governor's warrant'' to be sent up from South Carolina. A
governor's warrant is issued when a suspect refuses to waive
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually comes with fingerprints,'' said Ms. Moletteri,
``which is what you want.'' If the prints match, the suspect can be
extradited. If not, you know you have the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   No governor's warrant was sent. Weeks went by. Johnson remained
at Rikers. Last week, at the urging of Legal Aid and over the
objections of the D.A.'s office, a judge finally agreed to release
Johnson on $1,000 bail. He left Rikers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday I called Hynes' office to ask why a fingerprint
comparison had not been made. An aide said, ``We still don't have
the prints on him from South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked why it was taking so long. The aide said, ``That's
something I can't answer for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I called the sheriff's office in Florence County. It turns out
that Hynes' office did not ask for a copy of the fingerprints until
Tuesday _ the day I began inquiring about the story and one day
after Johnson was released. How long would he have stayed at Rikers
if the judge had sided with the D.A. last week and refused to grant
bail? Forever?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a spokesman for Hynes acknowledged the foul-up. ``What
happened is attributable to a filing error,'' he said. ``It's a
human mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a separate file ``on the extradition aspect of the
case'' should have been opened when Johnson was arraigned on the
beer charge. That didn't happen. He said a copy of Johnson's prints
will now be faxed to South Carolina, where, presumably, a
comparison will be made.
</P>
<P>
   No one explained why the requests by Legal Aid to have the
prints matched weeks ago were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been so easy. Fax the prints and make the
comparison. Case closed. Instead, because of the bumbling by the
D.A.'s investigators, the South Carolina warrant is still
outstanding and Johnson doesn't yet know what will happen to him.
If this is how they handle the easy cases, what in the world would
they do with a real mystery?

THE NEXT BOOK IS THE HARDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often for a writer, it's the book after the last one that seems
impossible to start because the very notion of what that next book
should be seems beyond the grasp. The author rolls the idea up the
hill of imagination, only to have it roll back down just before it
reaches the top. Daily, like Sisyphus.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bit different from writers' block _ the inability of a
writer simply to write _ and it strikes even, or maybe
particularly, the most successful authors. Excepting perhaps genre
writers, like mystery or thriller authors, who in some ways tell
nearly the same tale time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Authors who are commercially and critically successful get
distracted by celebrity and publicity, by magazine offers, by
people simply wanting to talk to them about the writing life. But
mostly, it's the pressure of people saying, ``Let's see you do it
again,'' and the writer wondering if it CAN be done again.
</P>
<P>
   Rosellen Brown, a literary novelist and poet, said: ``So-called
success trammels you in a way you didn't think of. The stakes get
higher with each book. There are more readers you are afraid to
disappoint.'' Ms. Brown's last novel, her fourth, ``Before and
After,'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) was published in 1992 to
critical acclaim and made the best-seller lists. Six years later,
she has nearly completed a new novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second book is much harder than the first because if you
are doing serious fiction, with every book, you keep closing doors
you don't want to walk through again,'' she said. ``You closed off
certain possibilities.'' And so it goes, book after book, using up
one's experiences story by story. ``I had some good ideas for this
book,'' Ms. Brown said. ``But I said to myself, `I did that
already.'''
</P>
<P>
   There surely is such a thing as pure writer's block when
fecundity not only fails but the author's ability actually to sit
and write seems gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case in modern American fiction was that of
Henry Roth. His first novel, ``Call It Sleep,'' was published to
mixed reviews in 1934. He was immediately contracted for a second
by the mythic editor Maxwell Perkins, only to develop a case of
writer's block that lasted more than 40 years, until 1979, when he
was finally able to put to paper the first words of his four-volume
autobiographical novel, ``Mercy of a Rude Stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the '60s, that first novel, ``Call It Sleep,'' a
portrait of Jewish immigrant life on the Lower East Side, was
rediscovered and hailed as a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have speculated that the cause of Roth's profound
literary malady was Jewish self-hatred, low self-esteem beaten into
him by his violent father, and the apparent likelihood that the
writer had incestuous relationships with his sister and a cousin.
All the stuff of great novels, if the writer can just get it down
on the pages. Which could be particularly difficult for a writer of
autobiographical novels.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it again, or simply starting up a second time, can at
times appear to be nearly impossible for a young writer who has had
a great critical success with a first book. In 1996, Junot Diaz,
then 27, bewitched the publishing world with his first book,
``Drown,'' a hard-to-forget collection of 10 short stories that
eight publishing houses wanted but that Riverhead got after giving
him a six-figure advance for the collection and a second book, to
be a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz declined to be interviewed. He needed to write rather than
talk, he said through his agent, Nicole Aragi. But in an article
about him in the July-August issue of Poets and Writers, a literary
magazine, he said that his instant success had turned him from
``someone who wrote'' into ``a writer,'' and that the acclaim he
received had so unsettled him that he did little writing in 1997,
not a ``worthy word.``
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was writer's block, self-doubt or simply the
distraction of celebrity, or a combination of all, his distress was
clear. He was quoted in the article as saying that it made no sense
that ``anyone should pay any attention to someone who has published
a short-story collection _ one.'' He went on to say, ``It
infuriates me, you know?'' and to refer to himself as ``passe'' and
``two-bit.'' The feeling one gets of his anguish is palpable. Ms.
Aragi said that, happily, he was now starting to write.
</P>
<P>
   Even enormous success can have a downside for a writer. Finding
the idea for the second book can be a slippery slope indeed. John
Berendt, author of ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''
(Random House), has done hardly any writing in the four years that
his book has been a nonfiction best seller. He researched an idea
about Venice, and now thinks it might work better as a magazine
piece than as a book, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he has spent the four years mostly promoting his book;
recently he was in a warehouse signing 2,000 copies. Clearly,
Berendt is not entirely over his ``Midnight'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say: `Do you feel the pressure? How can you top the
first book?''' he said. ``I don't have to, and I wouldn't try.''
</P>
<P>
   His problem is not the writing, but ``to find something as
seductive and as enticing as the last story,'' he said. ``The
characters in that book set a high standard. I had a lot of luck
stumbling into that setting.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``I have a few stories on the prowl, have been
considering two of them for a book.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his bravado, he does feel the pressure of his
readers lurking behind him. ``A lot of them might be looking for
the same thing, expecting another `Midnight,' and then be
disappointed,'' he said. ``I might be disappointed also, but if I
did another `Midnight,' I'd feel trapped. I need something very
different that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing is not a problem, as soon as the story presents
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has a luxury that fiction writers don't, and that is
the adrenaline of the chase. ``I love getting into that.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Berendt may not worry about the writing part of
producing his next work, but one hopes the pursuit of the story is
full of joy, since it took the author seven years to write
``Midnight.''

UNH RECEIVES LARGEST-EVER SINGLE GIFT, $10 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The University of New Hampshire has received
the biggest gift in its 105-year history -- and the largest ever
received by any state university in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million gift from 94-year-old Leslie S. Hubbard of
Walpole, a 1927 graduate of UNH who made his fortune breeding
poultry, will be used to expand the school's marine sciences
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marine program here has been traditionally very strong,''
said UNH president Joan Leitzel. ``This lets us move in some new
areas and add faculty at the senior level and put an endowment
under the program which speaks to its future -- and for that we are
extremely grateful to Leslie Hubbard.''
</P>
<P>
   The next largest gift the university has ever received was $6.2
million in fiscal year 1993-94. The recent gift may pale in
comparison to the largest gifts donated to UNH's Ivy League
neighbors. Dartmouth College in Hanover, for example, received a
$25 million gift from one donor in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But $10 million is big money for a public university in a state
not known for its munificence in funding public education.
University officials predicted the gift will help transform the
university's marine program into one of the leading undergraduate
marine science programs in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubbard award should allow us to assume a leadership role
in the Northeast for undergraduate education in marine science,''
said Ann Bucklin, the director of the UNH Sea Grant program and a
professor of zoology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bucklin said the $10 million windfall will ``basically double
our capacity in marine education, research and outreach.'' It may
also allow the university to move into pathbreaking areas of
research. For example, Roy Torbert, dean of the College of
Engineering and Physical Sciences, said the school has plans for a
program in hydrography, the mapping of the ocean, that he believes
will be the only instructional program in that field in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Leitzel said the school is looking increasingly toward the
private sector for funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so we can let the state off of its obligation,''
Leitzel said. ``I think a research university must move these days
to more dependance on fundraising. UNH is a little later than some
of the other public instuitutions...in challenging graduates and
friends to assist in the funding of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Hubbard was unavailable for comment. But Hubbard family
attorney and spokesman Charles DeGrandpre said Hubbard and his
family are ``devoted to making New Hampshire better and being very
concerned about those who are left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hubbard family, which founded the Hubbard Farms poultry
breeding operation, made $70 million in 1974 when it sold its
poultry operation and became a division of Merck &AMP; Co., the
pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   DeGrandpre said the Hubbard family has given a total of $20
million-$25 million to UNH. The family is known for giving money to
charity, and the UNH gifts, he said, were in keeping with that
family's philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many members of the family have told me that they don't think
they're taxed enough -- that the New Hampshire system (of taxation)
is not a good system,'' said DeGrandpre. ``It's an extraodinary
perspective.''

Congress to outlaw flag descretation nears a showdown in the
Senate, witnesses ranging from former Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda
to former Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider to a disabled Green
Beret veteran testified Tuesday on the emotional issue at a hearing
of the Senate Judiciary Committee. With the popular amendment

town of New Concord, Ohio _ were scheduled to connect via amateur
radio with the shuttle Discovery for 10-minute conversations

COMMENTARY: THE EIGHT YESES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To ingratiate himself with the Communist leadership
in China, Bill Clinton became the first U.S. president to publicly
embrace what Beijing calls ``the three noes'' _ no support for two
Chinas, no independence for Taiwan, no membership of Taiwan in any
international organization of sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Our former policy was brilliantly ambiguous: we acknowledged
both sides' agreement that there was only one China, and called for
a peaceful settlement _ which carried an implicit promise to help
Taiwan if Beijing launched an invasion. The newly expressed Clinton
policy dismays Taiwan because ``the three noes'' explicitly deny
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clinton forked over The Eight Yeses.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes to the purification of Tiananmen Square. By his
ceremonial presence, Clinton helped Jiang scrub away the memory
without reversing the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   2. Yes to China's insistence on exclusivity in the presidential
itinerary. At a time when financially shaky Japan and South Korea
were desperate for reassurance, China demanded that the Clinton
pilgrimage not be diluted by side trips to U.S. allies. Clinton
meekly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   3. Yes to giving China a veto over the American president's
visiting party. Three Radio Free Asia journalists were denied visas
and in effect bumped off the press plane. When the U.S. press
failed to show solidarity, Clinton caved, setting a demeaning
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   4. Yes to China's pretense of being an ``emerging'' country that
deserves special treatment in entering the World Trade
Organization. By publicly asserting on Shanghai radio that ``China
is still an emerging economy,'' Clinton paved the way for a
concession that would push the WTO into giving China's powerful
economy a competitive edge on subsidized exports.
</P>
<P>
   5. Yes to China's harsh treatment of dissidents. Clinton acceded
to China's denial of access to dissidents and made no personal
protest at the roundup of protesters. He hailed the ``freeing'' of
Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan _ as if their forced exile were not a
victory for repression.
</P>
<P>
   6. Yes to Jiang's need for superpower support of his new cult of
personality. ``He has a good imagination ... vision ...
extraordinary intellect,'' gushed our president, which can be
dismissed as the sort of hyperbole once lavished on Mikhail
Gorbachev, but then Clinton blundered by giving America's political
endorsement to an autocratic, Communist regime: ``China has the
right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Yes to China's decision to delay joining the Missile
Technology Control Regime. Jiang wanted more time to sell missiles
to countries developing nuclear weapons, and was willing only to
``study'' Clinton's plea; this was peddled to the traveling press
corps as progress.
</P>
<P>
   8. Yes to the ``strategic partnership'' desired by the Chinese
leadership. This naively accepted formulation depresses our Asian
allies, which fear China's growing military and economic power, and
panics India, which responds to what sounds like Chinese-American
hegemony by going nuclear. China may be a lopsided trade partner of
the United States, but to pretend that our geopolitical rival is a
``strategic partner'' is to eviscerate the meaning of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In return for accepting the three noes and offering the eight
yeses, Clinton was given the opportunity to tell the Chinese people
that we consider the ``loss of life'' at Tiananmen to be wrong, but
it's not for us to impose our views, etc.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, as Richard Nixon shared with Charles de Gaulle his idea
of an opening to China, the French president told him: ``Better to
deal with the Chinese now, when they need you, than later, when
you're forced to because of their strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the former president recalled that de Gaulle advice,
and added to me: ``Today it's to our interest to make China strong.
When they do become strong enough that they no longer need us, they
will have other reasons, ties and so forth, which will enable us to
cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what justified Nixon's opening, Carter's normalization,
and even Clinton's campaign-style visit. Then he added this
chilling caveat: ``In the long haul, looking way down the line _
this is deep background _ 15 years from now, we may have created a
Frankenstein.''

BROWN QUITS THE NEW YORKER FOR MIRAMAX JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's highest-profile magazine no longer has America's
highest-profile editor. In a move no less shocking for having been
speculated about for several months, Tina Brown resigned as editor
of The New Yorker Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is leaving the magazine after six years to start a joint
venture with Miramax Films. The New York-based firm will publish a
new monthly magazine, as well as produce films, generate television
programming, and publish books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partnership with Miramax is a unique creative and
business opportunity _ to own what we create and to expand our
vision into other media,'' Brown said in a statement issued by
Miramax, an autonomous division of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 44, will serve as chairman. The firm's president will be
Ron Galotti, who resigned Wednesday as publisher of Vogue. Vogue,
like The New Yorker, is part of Conde Nast Publications. Other
magazines Conde Nast publishes include Glamour, GQ, and Vanity
Fair, where Brown and Galotti previously worked together.
</P>
<P>
   No successor has been named at either The New Yorker or Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina Brown is the best editor in the world, with taste and
talent that is second to none,'' said Harvey Weinstein, cochairman
of Miramax, in a prepared statement. ``I couldn't be more thrilled
to be forming a business that will allow her to take that genius
and apply it to film, television, and books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it took this long,'' said Esquire film critic
David Thomson of Brown's move into new media. ``The possibility of
her involvement in films has long been there. Especially when she
was at Vanity Fair, there were overtures made,'' said Thomson, who
wrote for Brown when she was editor of Vanity Fair. ``Her father
was a film producer, and she's never made a secret of her interest
in the business. She certainly has no enemies in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   As editor of Vanity Fair from 1984 to 1992, the English-born
Brown established her reputation on this side of the Atlantic for
big-ticket, high-gloss editing. She made the magazine an emblem of
'80s excess _ and the antithesis of the sedate, reflective style of
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective clash of magazine cultures made for front-page
news when Brown was named editor of The New Yorker in 1992. While
largely retaining the magazine's intellectual cachet, Brown
enlivened The New Yorker's graphics, made it consistently topical,
and jettisoned the magazine's long-held reputation for propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she added to The New Yorker was getting people to read it
and talk about it in a way they had not in a long, long time,''
said Arthur Cooper, editor-in-chief of GQ.

   Brown's success came at a price. The New Yorker increased its
circulation from 450,000 to 800,000 but has never been profitable
under Brown. Last year, it lost an estimated $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Brown's departure began to circulate last spring.
Fueling the speculation had been reported unhappiness at The New
Yorker, which had been a separate business entity, over its being
consolidated into Conde Nast operations. In May, David Carey was
named president of the magazine without Brown's being consulted.
Her contract was reportedly up for renewal this month, although a
senior Conde Nast editor said Wednesday, ``I'd take the contract
issue with a grain of salt. Contracts aren't regarded all that
seriously around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will stay at The New Yorker through the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about her successor began as soon as news of her
resignation began to spread through the media world. Among many
names bruited about have been those of Graydon Carter, who
succeeded her at Vanity Fair, GQ's Cooper, Conde Nast editorial
director James Truman, House &AMP; Garden editor Dominique Browning,
New Yorker fiction editor Bill Buford, New Yorker staff writer
David Remnick, and New York Times Magazine editor Adam Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's resignation is this month's second major magazine
shake-up. It follows the departure last week of US News &AMP; World
Report editor James Fallows, who was fired by that publication's
editorial director, Harold Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is married to Tina Brown.

RABIES CASES IN MASSACHUSETTS BEGINNING TO CLIMB AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabies is back.
</P>
<P>
   Though nowhere near as common as it was during a major outbreak
earlier this decade, after two years of decline the number of new
cases in Massachusetts has almost doubled in each of the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   State officials Wednesday attributed the increase to the rapid
growth of the raccoon population after its decimation during the
1993 epidemic, and said July and August are peak months for new
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a second wave,'' said Dr. Michael McGuill,
the chief veterinarian for the state Department of Public Health.
``So many raccoons got killed by this strain that the population
took some time to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   From January through June 1998, health officials found 214
animals testing positive for rabies, up from 114 during the same
period in 1997. There were altogether 282 positive tests in 1997;
115 in 1996; 401 in 1995; 735 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest worry is that pets . . . serve as a bridge between
wild animals and humans,'' McGuill said.
</P>
<P>
   While widespread vaccination of dogs has kept the incidence of
the disease among them very low, in the last two years the increase
in new cases of infected cats has outpaced the growth of the diease
in total animals, 33 percent to 25 percent. The number of infected
cats has grown to 60 from 45. ``We're fortunate that we've
diagnosed cats and people have had treatment,'' McGuill said.
</P>
<P>
   Pets that fight with wild rabid animals can bring the disease
into homes. To prevent this, McGuill advised pet owners to get
their dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated as required by law. If a
pet appears to have been attacked by a rabid animal, McGuill
recommends wearing gloves to prevent contact with saliva, washing
the wound with soap and water, and taking the animal to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to a rabid animal can have severe consequences. One
infected kitten in New Hampshire, McGuill said, led to
post-exposure treatment of 665 people in 1994 at an estimated cost
of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A person bitten by a wild animal should wash the wound with soap
and water and call a physician immediately. At the height of the
epidemic in 1995, almost 2,700 people across the country underwent
vaccination after exposure at a cost to patients and insurers of up
to $6.5 million, according to a report by the US Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   The disease traveled into Massachusetts along the Atlantic
Seaboard in 1992. But the current wave has spread almost uniformly
throughout the state. Of the 351 towns and cities in the
commonwealth, 308 have reported cases.
</P>
<P>
   The only ones that haven't, McGuill said, are those on Cape Cod,
Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard where a 5-year-program to vaccinate
raccoons in the wild has succeeded in keeping the area rabies-free.

AFTER A YEAR OF REJECTION, `LOLITA' IS TO OPEN IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Originally budgeted as LOLITA-FILM-REVIEW)  (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``Lolita'' is finally reaching the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of controversy, in which every major
studio rejected the director Adrian Lyne's adaptation of the
Vladimir Nabokov novel, the new film version will be released in
the United States by Samuel Goldwyn Co. The movie's release will
take place almost simultaneously with its television premiere on
Showtime. on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that `Lolita' will now be available to a broad
audience in the United States,'' said Lyne, the director of ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal,'' who had charged Hollywood
with moral cowardice in refusing to release the film about an older
man's obsession with a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita,'' adapted by Stephen Schiff, stars Jeremy Irons as
Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged college professor who falls in love
with a young girl, Lolita, played by Dominique Swain. Also in the
cast are Melanie Griffith as Lolita's mother and Humbert's
landlady, and Frank Langella, as Clare Quilty, who also pursues the
young Lolita.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution executives at several studios have said that the
relatively high cost of the drama, about $58 million, coupled with
its lack of star power and potentially offensive sex-with-a-child
subject matter, made the 2-hour, 17-minute movie very risky.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lipsky, Goldwyn's marketing and distribution chief, said
the film's official release would be in New York and Los Angeles on
Sept. 25, and then in about two dozen large cities over the next
few weeks. But the film will also have an earlier one-week run in
Los Angeles, starting on July 22, to enable it to qualify for
possible Academy Awards. The film, made by Pathe, the French
production company, has already opened in Europe to mixed reviews
and a modest box office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, a film in theatrical release cannot qualify for Oscars if
it has already been shown on television. In 1994, the film ``The
Last Seduction'' was blocked from any Oscar nominations because it
was theatrically released three months after it was shown on Home
Box Office. The Goldwyn tactic is meant to circumvent the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn, whose company has released such movies as ``The Madness
of King George'' and ``Big Night,'' said that the marketing and
distribution of ``Lolita'' would be coordinated with Showtime, one
of the rare times that a movie company and a cable network join
forces. By all accounts, the companies will share the costs of
promotion and advertising, which might run as high as $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adventure for all of us,'' observed Goldwyn, who said
he doubted that the film's release would be picketed or stir much
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe there's that much controversy,'' he said.
``It's a good picture, but who knows what'll happen. I've made some
pictures where I wish I had been picketed.''

BERLIN AIRLIFT: SMUGGLING AND FREE ENTERPRISE RECALLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Half a century after the Berlin airlift, heroic images
endure: courageous West Berliners under Soviet siege, saved from
starvation by valiant American and British pilots flying food and
fuel to the beleaguered Cold War outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Schulze, though, has a slightly different version: to
valor and pluck, add bribery, corruption and bootlegging.
</P>
<P>
   Now 70, Schulze was one of the hundreds of thousands of
Berliners under Soviet occupation when the Berlin airlift started
in response to Moscow's blockade of the Western sectors of the city
in June 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Since he lived in East Berlin, he was in theory severed from the
Western beneficence that over the ensuing months bore 2.3 million
tons of food, fuel and medicine to the western part of the city.
American and British pilots flew a staggering 278,000 missions in
what has been depicted as one of history's greatest logistical
feats.
</P>
<P>
   That was the big picture. On the ground, though, Schulze said, a
little deviousness went a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our side,'' he explained, ``we had things the West
Berliners wanted, like gasoline and fresh potatoes. And they had
things we wanted.'' Among these was the new currency that the
victorious Western powers had just introduced in their zones of
occupation. Its arrival on the fiscal scene of postwar Germany
inspired the Soviets to blockade West Berlin _ offering a foretaste
of the clash of economic systems underpinning the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the blockade might have been more porous than
history has suggested is gaining ground in Germany and the United
States. In a recently published study called ``No Struggle for
Berlin?'' (Bouvier Verlag), journalist Volker Koop goes so far as
to state: ``It is not true that for 11 months, 2.5 million
Berliners were cut off from the outside world. That is a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Gisela Bilski, who was 13 when the airlift started,
``if it hadn't been for us East Berliners, people in the West would
have starved or frozen to death.'' And she should know: she says
smuggling fruit, coal and butter to the West cost her two days'
detention and interrogation by Soviet authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The young Lothar Schulze had a distinct advantage: his father
owned a gas station in East Berlin, and his mother worked in West
Berlin, so he was well placed to add a footnote of enterprise to
the great rescue from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the Berlin Wall did not exist _ it was built in
1961 _ and getting around the city was easier than it later came to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The guards enforcing the separation, Schulze said, were not so
professional that they could not be persuaded to look the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   How? ``By bribing them, of course,'' he said with an uproarious
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Westerners would come over to get gas from our filling
station and pay us with the new marks, which was supposed to be
forbidden, like most things were,'' he said. ``But we knew one
another. We weren't strangers because in the end we were all
Berliners. So we did business. We gave them potatoes and gas. And
they traded things from the American airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the rules of the market out gunned communist
ideology as much in 1948 as they did in 1989, when the wall came
crumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is seen here as belittling the airlift, which not
only insured West Berlin's survival as a Western bulwark 110 miles
inside East Germany, but also stamped a heroic view of America.

RACE PANEL TACKLES SCHOOL DIVERSITY DURING DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a session that was long on talk but short on
solutions, President Clinton on Wednesday joined in another
discussion on race _ this one focusing heavily on school diversity.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an initiative on race that he launched last year, the
president participated in a panel discussion that will be aired on
public television and moderated by ``The News Hour's'' Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   The participants immediately plunged into a debate on whether
certain ethnic or minority groups should gain admission into
schools to the exclusion of others.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Chao, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation,
recalled the story of an Asian-American student in San Francisco
who she said could not gain entry into a certain school even though
he had high test scores because of a quota on Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different standards in that school system for
different students of different colors,'' she said. ``If you are
white you have one standard. If you are Asian American you have the
toughest standard to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, defended schools and universities that seek
varied student bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our society has a vested interest in having people
from diverse backgrounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also suggested that ``test scores and all these
other so-called objective measurements are somewhat ambiguous and
they are not perfect measures of people's capacity to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he may have even benefited from such
policies when he applied to Georgetown University, which he said
sought students from every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know maybe I got in because there weren't too many people
from Arkansas who applied, for all I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the president conceded there is not a ``perfect
solution'' to the issue of how to ensure racial balance in schools
without hurting the opportunities of some qualified students.
</P>
<P>
   The televised discussion follows a forum on race and sports that
was sponsored by the cable sports networkl ESPN and held in Houston
with the president in April.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest session, Clinton also sought to mollify critics
who claimed the race initiative has not included some critics of
affirmative action as well as spokesmen from minorities other than
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One panelist, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News
Service, said he turned down jobs he suspected were offered to him
because he was Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the job offers came to him ``when I was middle
class Mexican American perfectly capable of dealing with the
competition for jobs, and the jobs came to me because I was their
brown man.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel also included a Native American, Sherman Alexie, a
Seattle-based writer, who argued that, to get ahead, Indians must
recognize that education is as important as many of their tribal
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, who wrote a new film called ``Smoke Signals,'' noted
that race creeps up in most conversations although it is usually in
code language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well nobody says that's a black person, let's talk about being
black. What they will do is come up to me and tell me they're
Cherokee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reference may have been an allusion to the fact that earlier
in the discussion Clinton mentioned that his grandmother was
one-quarter Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour discussion will be nationally televised beginning
Thursday night.

JAPAN'S PREMIER VOWS TAX CUTS NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Wednesday promised
long-term tax cuts beginning next year, but gave no details about
how much the move might fatten pocketbooks or lift the sagging
Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other countries have put enormous pressure
on Japan to make permanent tax cuts to stimulate the economy and
reduce the risk of a global downturn. Hashimoto's promise seemed
aimed at winning support from Washington and from Japanese voters,
who go to the polls on Sunday to choose members of the upper house
of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerning tax-system reform, starting next year we would like
to implement tax cuts that will be supported by the public,''
Hashimoto said Wednesday while campaigning in the central city of
Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
   His remark seemed to be an attempt to end days of confusion
brought about by his public waffling.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday he suggested he would consider introducing permanent
income tax cuts. Two days later he seemed to backtrack, saying that
overall tax reform might not bring about a broad reduction in
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto has been reluctant to lower the minimum level of
taxable income, currently at nearly $24,000. Such a step would
bring in more tax revenues but it would be politically risky
because it would hurt the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's remark, which seemed more forceful, still left many
people wondering whether the size of the cuts would be enough to
prompt consumers to spend more money. The yen, which had fallen
against the dollar throughout the day, weakened slightly, to 139.60
yen, from 138.85 yen, just as Hashimoto was making his comments.
</P>
<P>
   In April Hashimoto said the government would tackle reform of
the entire tax system, which many economists say drains a great
deal of incentive from employees and businesses to make more money.
Economists say they expect to see top rates slide to 50 percent,
from 65 percent, on individuals and to 40 percent, from 46 percent,
on corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge that Hashimoto faces, however, is that any tax
cuts would have to be financed somehow by a government that has
just declared fiscal austerity to be its medium-term goal. Last
fall Hashimoto pushed through a policy of fiscal austerity, and
though he has since stepped back a bit, that principle seems to
have kept the government from spending its way too freely out of
the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the government made $14 billion in income tax
rebates, and it plans to make a similar rebate beginning in late
summer. It has also said that next year, it will cut income taxes
by another $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists have not been entirely pleased with
those cuts, however, because they are one-time reductions that will
not necessarily encourage people to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax reduction through tax rebates is nothing but giving liquor
to an alcoholic,'' said Teizo Taya, an economist at Daiwa Institute
of Research. ``That is not going to change the motives of people.''

MOVE TOWARD EURO SPARKING BOOM IN SMALLER COUNTRIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ When Jose Antonio Santamaria and his family moved into
their new condominium in February, they got satellite television
along with access to enclosed gardens and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   But they also got a euro-break. Largely because Spain has been
accepted into the group of European nations that will adopt the
euro as a single currency in January, interest rates here have
plunged almost as low as those in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For Santamaria, that translates into monthly payments that are
about $140 lower than he had calculated when construction started
three years ago. ``It is much cheaper than we had expected,'' he
said. ``And with the swimming pool and enclosed garden, the quality
of life is better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Santamaria, Spain has not had it this good in years. As
much of Europe adopts the euro as a single currency, poorer
countries like Spain, Portugal and Ireland are growing much faster
than bigger and wealthier ones like France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, interest rates in Spain and Portugal have plunged to
less than 6 percent from 11 percent, largely because interest rates
across the ``euro zone'' are converging down to the levels in
Germany. Ireland, with a well-educated work force and relatively
flexible work rules, has become an important manufacturing base for
American companies exporting to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The effect within these fast-growing countries has been
profound. While Germany and France invest heavily outside their
borders, the smaller and poorer countries have become magnets for
foreign money. While job creation continues to be stagnant in much
of continental Europe, it is speeding up rapidly in places like
Spain. And while consumers in Germany anxiously refrain from
spending, demand is surging in the poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is going to be the same five years from now _ not
us, not France, not Germany,'' said Rodrigo Rato, Spain's Economics
Minister. ``We are all moving toward a new era of more
competitiveness and more openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, one of the poorest countries in Western Europe in 1990,
is rapidly catching up with the rest of Europe in terms of per
capita income. Its economy is growing by more than 8 percent this
year _ compared with about 3 percent for the European Union as a
whole. Indeed, with real estate prices soaring and labor shortages
cropping up in some areas, the biggest worry among economists is
that Ireland is headed toward an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Spain and Portugal are growing at about 4 percent this year _
faster than almost anywhere else on continental Europe. Their stock
markets have been among the best performers in Europe as investors
bet that interest rates will remain low and stable for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a gift, essentially, a gift from abroad,'' said Miguel
Sebastian, chief economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, part of the current boom is simply catch-up as
countries bounce back from past problems, in particular Spain's
severe recession in the mid-1990's. Though Spain has generated
about 400,000 new jobs since the start of 1997, its official
unemployment rate is still 19 percent _ one of the highest in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are living through now is the rapid correction of past
imbalances,'' said Ignacio Gomez-Montejo, Merrill Lynch's chief
equity analyst in Madrid. ``We are being rewarded for correcting
our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of new affluence are visible here. On the outskirts of
Madrid, the Las Rosas condominium development is building 10,000
apartments with an average price of about $120,000. Beckoning young
families with signs that boast ``We are building your dream
house,'' the condominiums are selling quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the center-right government of President Jose Maria
Aznar has pushed through several reforms aimed at bolstering
employment and investment. It has promoted fierce competition in
banking and privatized about $25 billion worth of state-owned
companies. And soon after taking power in 1996, the Aznar
government drastically cut the tax on capital gains, reducing the
top rate to about 20 percent from more than 60 percent. Now, the
government is pushing through a much broader tax reform that would
reduce income tax rates by closing loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   The government, under Aznar and his predecessor, Felipe
Gonzalez, has also made it easier for companies to hire workers on
temporary contract. Though full-time jobs are still relatively
scarce, temporary jobs have soared. But perhaps the biggest change
in Spain is one of outlook: a new willingness of domestic companies
to look abroad for opportunities. Since joining the European Union
in 1986, the country has steadily increased its volume of trade
with the rest of Europe. As recently as 1990, Spanish exports and
imports added up to about 40 percent of the country's gross
domestic product. Today, foreign trade in both directions adds up
to about 70 percent, the lion's share with other European
countries.

 UNDATED: European countries. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new confidence is apparent in Elche, a city on Spain's
southern coast that is the heart of its shoe industry. Bolstered by
low interest rates and cheap money, nearly 50 companies are
building factories and office buildings at the city's newest
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial costs used to account for about 5 percent of a
company's expenses,'' said Jose Pertusa Romero, a partner in Gesem,
a consulting firm in Elche. ``But in the last year, interest rates
have declined, and those costs have been cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   And though shoes are still the mainstay of the local economy,
the business itself has changed. Instead of competing strictly on
price, traditional shoemakers are reinventing themselves as
designers and marketers of brand names. And they are exporting
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a revolution, a real shock for the local industry,''
said Felipe Gonzalez, export manager for Panama Jack Group
Internacional S.A., which produces hiking boots and leather casual
shoes and began developing its own brand nearly nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Peran, the founder of Pikolinos S.A., made a particularly
striking odyssey. A small, wiry craftsman who started his company
from scratch in the mid-1970s, Peran spent years stamping out cheap
plastic shoes. But five years ago, he began designing and marketing
his own line of high-fashion shoes for the export market.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has worked. Pikolinos has more than tripled its
sales volume since 1992, to 1.1 million pairs of shoes from about
300,000, and the profit for each pair has increased significantly.
About 80 percent of the companies sales are to other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Peran recently moved the company into a gleaming glass-covered
building at the industrial park. Shoe designers work out their
ideas by creating three-dimensional models on computers, and
robotic cutting machines transfer those ideas into precise strips
of leather that are then sewn into prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still a shoemaker, but this is the way we create about 80
percent of our designs,'' Peran said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest differences between countries like Spain and
Portugal and Europe's wealthier but slower-growing nations is the
pace of job creation. Even though Germany's economy is expanding at
one of its fastest rates in years, nearly 3 percent, the number of
new jobs has increased only marginally. Over the last several
years, the number of jobs in Germany has remained almost flat while
the number of unemployed job seekers has steadily increased. Though
German job growth has finally picked up in the last few months,
unemployment is expected to stay above 10 percent throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, economic growth is bolstering job gains in Spain,
Portugal and Ireland. Though Spain's unemployment rate remains
high, economists and government agencies calculate that about
400,000 new jobs have been added since the start of 1997, nearly 3
percent, and many others have probably been absorbed in the
underground economy.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has had even greater success. Its unemployment rate has
declined to about 6.3 percent from 7.3 percent in 1996 _ about half
the level in Germany and France. And Ireland, with employment of
1.3 million, has added 50,000 jobs since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Though the evidence is mixed, many economists say the penchant
toward hiring people in ``periphery'' countries stems partly from
lower wages but perhaps more from greater flexibility, even though
labor laws are often just as strict.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, economists say the quality of workers is at least as
important as the cost of wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the new jobs are coming from knowledge-intensive
industries, not labor-intensive industries,'' said Terry Baker, an
economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
Fifty percent of people entering the work force have college
educations, and their educations have often been tailored toward
technical areas. Ireland's biggest growth areas have been in
computer and software companies, from Microsoft to Dell Computer to
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish labor is a good value,'' said Peter Jarrett, an
economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris, who has studied Ireland closely. ``The
quality of the educational system is as good as anywhere, and they
have really geared it to the needs of the labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain has worked to loosen its work rules. Although full-time
permanent workers have some of the strongest job-protection laws of
any nation, new laws allow companies to hire workers on temporary
contracts _ often for years at a time. About one-third of all
workers in Spain work on temporary contracts, one of the highest
levels in the world and most of the new jobs are being created in
the temporary labor market.
</P>
<P>
   But as Europe's previously poor countries become richer, they
may well become more like their wealthier neighbors. Even though
Ireland has long boasted a devotion to ``Anglo-Saxon'' principles
of light regulation, the country has followed Germany's tradition
in reaching broad wage agreements in negotiations between unions,
manufacturers and industry. In the most recent one the government
pledged last year to reduce income tax rates while unions agreed to
modest wage increases of about 3 percent a year through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much on the old German or Scandinavian model, but it
seems to have worked very well,'' Baker said,
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, the Aznar government has become a staunch defender of
social programs even as it tries to support business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is how you keep social cohesion and at the
same time stay ahead of the competition,'' said Rato, Spain's
Economics Minister. ``I don't think Europe is contemplating the
American model on social issues. We do look to the American model
on questions of competition and promoting capital markets. But on
social issues, European society does not envy the Americans.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: THE `ATOMIC AUDIT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September 1951, the late Sen. Brien McMahon, D-Conn., laid
out the argument for investing heavily in nuclear weapons. ``The
cost of military firepower based on atomic bombs is hundreds of
times cheaper, dollar for dollar, than conventional explosives,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half-century later, scholars at the Brookings
Institution have released the first thorough assessment of the cost
of nuclear weapons. ``Atomic Audit'' (Brookings Press) estimates
that $5.5 trillion in 1996 dollars has been spent by Washington on
building, delivering and defending against The Bomb _ and the meter
is still ticking at the rate of $35 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much money is $5.5 trillion? It's more than has been
spent on Medicare and veterans' benefits combined, though $2.3
trillion less than the total outlays on Social Security since 1940.
Or, if you prefer the fanciful, $5.5 trillion stacked tightly in
bricks made of $1 bills would be enough to build a wall 8.7 feet
high around the equator.
</P>
<P>
   In the icy logic of economics, the benefits may still have
exceeded the cost. But the very idea that nukes were initially
embraced on such simplistic financial grounds is chilling testament
to the sloppiness of military economics.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, then the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee
on Atomic Energy, was right that a one-megaton nuclear weapon cost
less than conventional bombs containing 2 billion pounds of TNT.
But in giving short shrift to the expense of delivering the nukes,
he missed the forest for the merest of saplings.
</P>
<P>
   The Brookings study, directed by Stephen Schwartz, estimates
that building the weapons did indeed cost just $409 billion in
today's dollars, 2 percent of defense spending from 1940 through
1996. But the delivery systems _ aircraft, missiles and related
equipment _ added $3.2 trillion. Targeting nuclear weapons and
systems to control their use absorbed $831 billion. Defenses
against nuclear attack have swallowed $937 billion. The (largely
future) cost of managing nuclear waste and dismantling obsolete
weapons is projected at some $400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a plan to substitute bargain technology for
conventional forces took on a life of its own. First with the
panicky military buildup during the Korean War. Then with the
``missile gap'' that became an issue in the 1960 presidential
election and morphed into a race with the Soviet Union for superior
delivery systems. Still later, the Reagan administration explicitly
used military spending as a strategy for bankrupting the Evil
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon could calculate how many bombs would be needed to
destroy Soviet rocket forces or to turn Moscow into a parking lot.
But as long as the goal was something other than military victory,
nuclear sufficiency was a subjective concept. ``The closest to one
man who would know what the minimum deterrent is would be
Khrushchev,'' said Gen. Thomas Powers in 1960, ``and frankly I
don't think he knows from one week to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, though, everyone seemed to have an opinion.
President Johnson's Bureau of the Budget, preoccupied with
financing the Great Society in 1964, concluded that a force of more
than 450 Minuteman missiles was a waste of money. Across the
Potomac, the military bureaucracy reckoned the right number was
10,000. Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara settled for an even
1,000 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of underwater-launched missiles, the Navy
thought a few dozen Polaris subs would deter the Soviet Union. But
the Air Force thought otherwise, and Congress conveniently decided
that a ``triad'' of sea- and land-based missiles along with manned
bombers was needed to keep the Russians in their trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the nuclear establishment point out that, quibbling
aside, the American arsenal succeeded in deterring a catastrophic
war. But in Schwartz's opinion, this is an inadequate
rationalization.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he says, conventional forces backed by a small
nuclear force would have cost far less and might have been equally
effective. For another, the failure to contain either the size of
the arsenal or the uncertainties associated with technological
change made conflict more likely. The chances of accidental war,
for example, were presumably greater with tens of thousands of
delivery systems (rather than, say, hundreds). The adoption of
hair-trigger response protocols in reaction to the huge numbers of
offensive missiles surely increased risks. And the invention of
compact warheads that could fit six to a missile made the
verification of negotiated arms limits almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   However one reads the nuclear record, it is hard to deny that
the policy evolved with little regard for other ways the cash could
have been spent. Indeed, the scale was so vast that it inspires a
variant on Sen. Everett Dirksen's hoary quip. A trillion here, a
trillion there _ and yes, it did add up to real money.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOCHI, Japan _ It is more of a compliment than it might sound
when people say that Daijiro Hashimoto is the best politician in
his family. His brother, after all, is Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Daijiro, the governor of Kochi Prefecture here on the
forest-covered southern Japanese island of Shikoku, who is widely
hailed as an example of the kind of dynamic leadership that Japan
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Shikoku is one of the poorest and most backward parts of Japan,
but Hashimoto has shaken up the prefecture and made it a testing
ground for the nation. More to the point for a politician, opinion
polls show Daijiro drawing public approval ratings of more than 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ryutaro, though, has slumped below 30 percent, and he could even
be forced to resign if his Liberal Democratic Party loses ground in
elections for the upper house of Parliament on Sunday. Polls show
the party struggling, in part because Ryutaro seems to be
emblematic of the old-style politicians who have led Japan into its
present economic mess and cannot lead it out.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the two brothers underscores the weaknesses of
Japan's political system. While Daijiro is widely praised by
Japanese commentators and his own constituents, under the rigid
seniority system in the Liberal Democratic Party, he and others
like him stand almost no chance of ever playing a major role in
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is pessimistic about the prospects of fundamental
change in Japan in the coming years, in large part because he
thinks the public does not want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are, Japan won't really change very much,''
Daijiro, a compact man with a touch of gray in his neatly coiffed
hair, mused in a long interview the other day. ``Even if an
opposition party took over, it'd be hard to take steps toward
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need very dramatic changes in our system,'' he added,
sitting forward in his chair and speaking in rapid-fire Japanese.
``If public sentiment does not change in Japan, then Japan will be
in a very dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Daijiro discourages any contrasts between his popularity and
that of his brother, and the two remain close. Indeed, Ryutaro was
also regarded as a talented maverick until he became prime minister
in 1996 and seemed to become overwhelmed by the forces of
stagnation around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of a prime minister in Japan is very limited, even
compared with that of a British prime minister,'' Daijiro noted.
``So my big brother may be feeling tight restrictions right now on
his ability to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Daijiro and Ryutaro share similar good looks, charm and quick
wit, as well as the legacy of their father, who was a Cabinet
minister and longtime member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ryutaro, 60, inherited his father's seat in Parliament and has
spent his entire career as a politician, while Daijiro, 51, went
into journalism and became nationally famous as the lead television
reporter covering the dying Emperor Hirohito in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of years later, friends persuaded Hashimoto to run
for governor here in Kochi. He had no connection to Kochi and no
power base here, but he ran as an independent against a deputy
governor backed by the governing Liberal Democratic Party. In the
end Hashimoto won in a landslide, and at age 44 he became the
youngest governor in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Governors in Japan normally do not do much, even less than prime
ministers, but Hashimoto made remote Kochi a whirlwind of activity.
</P>
<P>
   He started a technical college and an optical fiber data
network, hoping to nurture a miniature version of Silicon Valley.
He began dismissing any government employee caught drinking and
driving. He emphasized openness in government and publicly
disclosed official entertainment expenses, and he offended
hard-line nationalists by criticizing the national anthem, which
has strong militarist connotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great stimulus to this prefecture,'' said Eiichiro
Mizobuchi, the managing director of the Kochi Chamber of Commerce.
``He stresses that we must change our way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiroyuki Morishita, a prefectural assemblyman, says that ``he
was a big culture shock for Kochi Prefecture'' and notes that some
people complained about spending money on starting a technical
college at a time of tight budgets. But Morishita says these
measures are changing Kochi and adds, ``He's been a key governor
for all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   A good measure of Hashimoto's popularity _ he won re-election in
1995 with 85 percent of the vote _ is a matter less of policy than
of his style. In contrast to the bland bureaucrats who preceded
him, Hashimoto is outspoken and charming, with a natural political
feel for cultivating his image.
</P>
<P>
   And he is popular among women in part because in a nation of
absentee husbands, he comes across as particularly devoted to his
wife, Takako, who was a widow with two children when he married
her.
</P>
<P>
   The gossip magazines are full of stories about the ``women
problems'' of Prime Minister Hashimoto, questions have been raised
in Parliament about a supposed affair with a Chinese woman who by
some accounts was a spy. In contrast, the magazines report that
Daijiro faithfully shares a bath with his wife in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is very different from his predecessors, and people
feel that Kochi is now changing,'' said Hitoshi Toyama, a political
columnist for the Kochi Shimbun, a local daily. ``There's a feeling
here that people in Tokyo used to know nothing about Kochi but that
now the governor is putting Kochi on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all his popularity in Kochi and even around the
country, Daijiro has almost no chance of becoming a leader on the
national stage. It is not just that he is an independent rather
than a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, but also that
national politics operates by a rigid seniority system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that was why Hashimoto decided not to go into national
politics like his brother, and it is a disincentive to many other
mavericks in Japan: even the most qualified Liberal Democrat can
dream of a Cabinet position only after serving 10 or 15 years in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When Hashimoto first ran for office, he calculated that since he
was in his mid-40s he was too old to go into national politics, and
now that he is in his 50s the same logic applies with even greater
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan had a presidential system,'' he mused, ``then I might
think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the puzzles of Japanese politics is who actually does
wield power, for there is general agreement that the prime minister
is weak and that individual members of Parliament have much less
influence than any member of the U.S. Congress. Certainly the
answer is not the governors, for local leaders like Hashimoto have
far less autonomy than do the governors of American states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the answers to that riddle is that the bureaucracy holds
a good deal of power that in other countries is controlled by
politicians, and Hashimoto seethes with frustration that 90 percent
of the funds for Kochi are controlled by bureaucrats in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Transportation Ministry is building an expensive
railroad in Kochi, even though Hashimoto says that Kochi does not
need it and that the railroad will be sure to lose money once it is
built.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto would like to use the money for other purposes, but
the Transportation Ministry will not allow him to do so. It will
not even let him use some of the money for roads, because roads
belong to the turf of a different bureaucracy, the Construction
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto is passionate about the need for fundamental change,
but he is skeptical that it is coming any time soon. The underlying
problem, he says, is that ordinary Japanese are content with life
as it is, and they want to preserve the regulations that protect
them even if they also stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dramatic change might come about in only two ways,'' he
argues. ``The first is if the Japanese economy were to get very
bad. I don't want to see that, and it would be a problem for the
whole world. But then Japanese might realize that they are facing a
dead end and thus accept the need to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other way is that if an entirely new political party were
to arise as a major force with a new agenda, then maybe there could
be dramatic change. But otherwise I think it's hard to see major
changes in the next 5 or 10 years.''

REIT PAYS $867M FOR REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, LEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.J.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Properties Inc. announced Wednesday it had
completed the purchase of $867 million worth of real estate
properties and leases _ including The Prudential Center complex, a
venerable signature of Boston's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate investment trust has doubled its holdings since
going public in June 1997, positioning itself to reap the benefits
of a booming economy, low interest rates, and rising office and
occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion REIT _ whose chairman is New York publishing
magnate Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of The New York Daily News and
U.S. News &AMP; World Report _ purchased the 2.2 million-square-feet
office tower and retail complex for $546 million in securities,
cash and debt from Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which has
agressively sought to unload many of its real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   For $37 million in cash, Boston Properties also purchased the
longterm lease to the University Place office building in
Cambridge; and for $284 million in cash, securities, and debt
assumption, bought eight buildings in Princeton, New Jersey's
Carnegie Center and an office tower in East Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Prudential deal, Boston Properties also acquired
a 50 percent controlling partnership interest in the development of
an additional 1.75 million square feet of property adjacent to
Prudential Center. The city has already granted preliminary
approvals for use of the parcels as residential and office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston obviously is a major market for us and we see the
Prudential as one of the most significant pieces of real estate in
the northeast and certainly in Boston,'' said William J. Wedge,
senior vice president for Boston Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisitions will strengthen Boston
Properties's position as one of the largest 10 REITS in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rents in place (at the Prudential Center) are
significantly below market, and market rents continue to rise so
there is tremendous cash flow and development opportunity,'' said
Christopher C. George, an analyst in New York with Bear, Stearns.
``It was a great acquisition for the company and it improves the
longterm growth potential for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   One immediate result of the new ownership, said George, is that
some office and retail rents in the Prudential complex are likely
to rise over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Boston Properties has been assembling a portfolio
that includes more than 100 commercial and office properties in
urban centers such as New York, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and
Richmond. The firm recently signed a letter of intent to acquire
another trophy property: San Francisco's enormous Embarcadero
Center office and retail complex, dubbed the Rockefeller Center of
the West.

DEFENSIVE STANDOUT SCORES TWO GOALS FOR FRANCE, PUTTING HOST TEAM
IN CUP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ After a tedious first half, something
awakened in the French World Cup team Wednesday night, something
exciting and desperate, and the team that could not score goals
suddenly got two from the unlikeliest of places.
</P>
<P>
   After producing no goals in his first 37 appearances with
France's soccer team, the exquisite defender Lilian Thuram
delivered a pair Wednesday night, providing a 2-1 victory over
Croatia and propelling France into the World Cup final for the
first time before 80,000 delirious fans at Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes into the second half, after he made a rare mistake
that led to Croatia's goal, Thuram stole a pass to tie the game and
energized a lethargic team that had not scored during regulation in
two previous matches. He scored again in the 69th minute after
another alert disruption and sent his team into Sunday's
championship game against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Stunningly, the semifinal match changed from a dull,
interminable first half to a wild, gripping conclusion. France was
fatigued and frantic to avoid a third consecutive overtime game.
But five minutes into extra time, it was still not out of trouble.
Not until goalkeeper Fabien Barthez punched away a shot from Goran
Vlaovic did tiny Croatia finally succumb in its first trip to the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   France played shorthanded for the final 20 minutes, after its
previous savior, Laurent Blanc, received a red card for a stiff-arm
to the face of a Croat defender. He is ineligible for Sunday's
final, which could be crippling. It was Blanc who scored the goal
in sudden-death overtime to France past Paraguay in the second
round, and it was Blanc's penalty kick that made the difference in
the quarterfinals against Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Blanc's absence will be considered in a more sober,
reflective moment. Wednesday night was a night for exuberant
release as France finally made it to the World Cup final after
failing in the semifinals in 1958, 1982 and 1986. A previously
indifferent nation has become fanatical about its ascendant soccer
team. In Paris, the Champs Elysee was jammed with exultant fans
Wednesday night from the Louvre to the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   Both French President Jacque Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin attended Wednesday night's match and applauded
appreciatively at the accomplishments of Thuram, the splendid
defender turned scorer and rescuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream to have the World Cup in France with us in the
final,'' Jospin said. ``The second dream is to win on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuram was placed on the shoulders of reserve goalie Bernard
Lama and paraded about after the game. Forwards usually receive
these adulatory rides on their teammates' shoulders, but France
hasn't had a forward score since its second game of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram's normal duty is as a central defender for Parma in Serie
A, the Italian premier league, where he was voted defender of the
year this season and foreign player of the year in 1997. But France
has Blanc and Marcel Desailly at central defender, so the
26-year-old Thuram, who was born in Guadeloupe and came to France
at age 9, reluctantly agreed to play right back in the World Cup.
He is part of a virtually impenetrable defensive wall that has
surrendered only two goals in six matches. And Wednesday night he
assertively filled the vacuum in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent reward for all the effort he has put in,''
Aime Jacquet, the French coach, said of Thuram. ``Especially the
mental discipline he has been able to instill into this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet started three defensive midfielders Wednesday night and
only one forward as France's tepid offense consisted of setting up
playmaker Zinedine Zidane 30 yards from the goal. The scoreless
first half was the kind of game that people who dislike soccer use
as prime evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But, 25 seconds into the second half, the game exploded into a
captivating fight to the finish. France attempted an offsides trap,
seeking to catch Croatia's Davor Suker beyond the last defender and
thus ineligible to receive a pass. But Thuram failed to scramble
upfield, keeping Suker onsides, and Suker deftly trapped a pass
from teammate Aljosa Asanovic and pushed a left-footed shot past
Barthez for a 1-0 Croatia lead.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Thuram redeemed himself. He stole the ball from
Zvonimir Boban, the Croat captain, and played give-and-go with
teammate Youri Djorkaeff to tie the match at 1-1. He had never
scored for France before, but on this play Thuram's instincts
seemed as natural as Ronaldo's had in the previous semifinal for
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``France was lacking strength, but as so often happens, when you
score and the opponent scores right after, it gives them the
strength to come back and do better,'' said Miroslav Blazevic, the
Croatian coach.
</P>
<P>
   In the 69th minute, Thuram stole the ball off the foot of
Croatia's Robert Jarni and hooked a shot inside the far post from
20 yards out, giving France a 2-1 lead that it would not
relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when I'm near the goal, I black out,'' Thuram said,
explaining his previous futility. ``I'm not a hero. I just scored
two goals. It's 11 players on the team who made France make the
finals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard, tough game that turned potentially disastrous for
France in the 74th minute when Blanc shoved Croatia's Slaven Bilic
in the face and was given a red card. Blanc claimed that Bilic had
been goading him all night, but this was an awful time to lose
one's cool and one's eligibility for the final. But at least the
French will have the advantage of playing Brazil at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 22 players here who are poets, who play with their
feet and their hearts,'' Djorkaeff said.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, one who can put the ball into the goal. &QL;

Brazil handles tension like true champions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ At some point, perhaps the world will realize that it might
be more than mere Brazilian mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Like the parquet floor at old Boston Garden, the Brazilian
mystique makes for a nice excuse, but it might be something else
that actually has made this marvelous team four-time world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   It might be practice, persistence and an unflappable nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest players in the world can crack during a penalty
shootout,'' said Brazilian captain Dunga. ``You have to be prepared
for anything in this game, including the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Brazilians were prepared. The Dutch seemingly
were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players before (the shootout) that it was time for
all or nothing,'' Brazil coach Mario Zagallo said. ``The stakes
were high. But just as in 1994, we had to make the penalties bring
us the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   For 120 minutes before Tuesday night's World Cup semifinal went
into nerve-bending shootout penalty kicks, the Netherlands was
playing Brazil to a dead draw.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Brazilians finally would be outdone.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had the momentum of the game swaying their way, having
scored a dramatic game-tying goal in the 87th minute. The Dutch had
the offense in gear and Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel making
spectacular save after spectacular save.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the Dutch didn't have the Samba Swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game went into shootout penalty kicks it was as if all
the confidence that the Netherlands exhibited during the game
suddenly vanished and the Brazilian swagger stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   While Taffarel continued to star in goal for Brazil, the
Brazilian shooters confidently smashed penalty kicks past helpless
Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink was unsure about which
players to send up to the penalty shootout. Hiddink conferred with
coaches and players, switched shootout lineups and finally sent
five players out.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before the first shot, the Dutch looked nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Philip Cocu smacked a shot to the left of Taffarel that
Taffarel confidently blocked away. And moments later, Ronald de
Boer hit a meek, soft shot to Taffarel's right that he easily
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference between these teams became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of exercise you have to stay lucid and keep your
concentration,'' Dunga said. ``It is not easy, but we've had that
(shootout) experience. We've lived in the pressure. I think it
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Brazilians won the World Cup in a penalty
shootout over Italy. In that game, like on Tuesday, the Italians
had one shot blocked by Taffarel and another one meekly sailed high
on a poor shot _ by Italy's Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called the Brazilians lucky for squeaking out of the
near-miss situations in consecutive World Cups. But perhaps it's
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Dutch) didn't hit their shots real strong, but it also
was good plays by Taffarel,'' Dunga said. ``Of course, you have to
have good luck. But you have to make the shots.''

 &HT;    Clinton roadshow may be smart path
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Today, Atlanta and fire-ravaged Florida. Fresh back
from his China tour, President Clinton has lost little time getting
back out on the road and away from his troubles, to the chagrin of
his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Along with frequent domestic jaunts, Clinton plans a lot more
foreign travel this year: Ireland and Russia, and later in the
fall, Malaysia and possibly India and Pakistan, if they simmer
down.
</P>
<P>
   A ``roadshow,'' conservative columnist Rowland Evans called it
on television the other day, complaining that Clinton has
``trivialized'' the presidency by staying out of Washington so
much, avoiding Cabinet meetings and national security sessions for
the pursuit of the perpetual campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Staged events like this morning's kickoff for an anti-drug ad
campaign at the World Congress Center probably are more trivial
than Cabinet meetings, at least most of them. But in the post-Cold
War, post-Big Government world of image, consensus and personal
politics, the more trivial pursuit may also be the wiser form of
governance. Especially, it goes without saying, if we're speaking
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen, had a similar knack. She sapped the
dissenting energies of her lords by trooping about 16th century
England, perpetually drawing on their hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   A modern president travels with a broader agenda. On this day
trip, which will put Clinton back in Washington sometime after
midnight, he'll pack in two fund-raisers and a tour of the Florida
burn zone on top of the drug message.
</P>
<P>
   But an Elizabethan motive lurks behind the short-term
objectives. By hitting the road so often, Clinton is not, strictly
speaking, fleeing the Monica Lewinsky scandal. That would imply his
pursuers have the better of him, which is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Clinton has used Air Force One to demonstrate the
considerable power of a president to change the subject. And he has
exhausted his anchormen, his pundits and prosecutors, much as
Elizabeth wore out her lords.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been away, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation has droned along in one-step forward, three-steps
back fashion. It seems less and less a threat to this particular
president, and more and more a menace, in the uncomfortable
precedents it would set, for presidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been taking a pounding from his colleagues on the
federal bench, particularly in last week's dismissal of the case
against Webster Hubbell, his wife and lawyer. A stung punditry has
largely abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's tumble from favor really pales beside the
misfortunes of the media that provide the morning footage of the
cheery prosecutor finishing his coffee in his carport.
</P>
<P>
   Since the media seized on the Lewinsky story as a Gen-X
Watergate back in February, they have been subjected to a string of
bad press about themselves, culminating in CNN's retraction of its
nerve gas story last week. The stories of columnists who made up
stuff and networks that went off half-cocked have nothing directly
to do with the handling of the Lewinsky story, but they give more
kick to Steven Brill's excoriation of the Washington media's
alleged complicity with Starr than it would have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much the context can change, if you stay out on the
road long enough.

 &HT;    Blue Cross to endow foundation
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia has agreed to
create a multimillion-dollar nonprofit foundation to settle a
lawsuit by consumer groups, who challenged the insurer's 1996
conversion to a for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, filed Wednesday in Fulton County Superior
Court, Blue Cross would endow a health care foundation with stock
and warrants _ a total amounting to 20 percent of the shares of
Cerulean, Blue Cross's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the dollar value of that endowment can't be
determined. But based on valuations of the company at the time of
its conversion, made by Blue Cross and later by the plaintiffs, the
endowment stock could be worth $40 million to $120 million, or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by the court, after a fairness hearing
August 20. When the settlement gets final approval, the endowment
also would receive $1 million in cash. Blue Cross, in the
agreement, denied all allegations of wrongdoing and liability made
in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Harman, a Blue Cross vice president, said that while the
company believes the suit had no legal merit, ``the settlement is a
business decision made in order to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lynn Thogersen of Let's Get Together, a plaintiff
organization that's an advocate for people with disabilities,
called the deal ``a victory for the people of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Thogersen said she hoped the foundation would make grants
available for projects ``to look at needed changes in the health
care system, such as monitoring managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Grants also could establish medical clinics in underserved areas
of the state, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the foundation will be to improve the delivery of
health care services to medically underserved Georgians,'' Harman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal culminates three years of controversy over the Blue
Cross transaction, which was approved by Insurance Commissioner
John Oxendine in December 1995. Legislation allowing the conversion
passed the Georgia General Assembly earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Blue's conversion was criticized by consumer groups
nationwide, who noted that Blue Cross plans have gained years of
tax breaks as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, legislative and regulatory actions have caused
billions to be set aside or designated for charity. For example,
all assets of Blue Cross of California, about $3.2 billion, have
been transferred to two health care foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Bell of Consumers Union in California, who tracks Blue
Cross conversions, said the Georgia for-profit transaction was the
only one nationally that had not awarded funds to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the settlement ``is better than it was, but it could
have been more money, and could have been done three years ago.
Georgia legislators and regulators could have taken action, and 100
percent of the company could have been preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, eight consumer groups, had argued that the
General Assembly law to allow the conversion was unconstitutional.
They argued that an entity considered a public asset must create a
public trust or foundation if it seeks to switch to a for-profit
company.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement agreement, the foundation, to be
called Healthcare Georgia, will have as its goal ``the advancement
of health care for all Georgians.''
</P>
<P>
   It will have a nine-member board, which would approve grants for
nonprofit health care purposes. Three of the directors will be
named by the plaintiffs, three by Cerulean, one by the Carter
Center and the other two by separate foundations in Atlanta and
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment will include 9.5 percent of the stock ownership of
the company, plus warrants that entitle the foundation to acquire
another 10.5 percent of Blue Cross over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross valued itself at about $200 million at the time of
conversion, but experts for the plaintiffs said it was worth $400
million to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' law firm, Carr, Tabb &AMP; Pope, will receive a fee
of no more than 10 percent of the value of the endowment. The final
sum will be determined by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also could clear the path for an acquisition of
Blue Cross. Speculation of such a deal has centered on
California-based WellPoint Health Networks, a huge, highly
profitable insurer with Blue Cross roots.
</P>
<P>
   Its managed care business in California is operated as Blue
Cross of California. WellPoint's health plans in Georgia are
offered under the UniCare label, and cover about 100,000 in a
preferred provider organization in the state. WellPoint has 6.7
million managed care members overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the California charitable foundations involved
WellPoint, which was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of
California's managed care business. In 1996, WellPoint and Blue
Cross of California merged into a stockholder-owned company. As a
result, the foundations were created.
</P>
<P>
   Harman of Blue Cross declined to comment on possible discussions
with another company.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the settlement of the consumer groups' suit was a
vital hurdle that needed to be cleared before a merger agreement
could be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   If an acquisition occurs, Consumers Union's Bell says, ``It
would provide a windfall to the private investors in the
conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight consumer groups, besides Let's Get Together, are:
Statewide Independent Living Council of Georgia; Living
Independence for Everyone; AIDS Survival Project; Disability
Connections; The Middle Georgia Center for Independent Living;
Physicians for a National Health Program; Campaign for a Prosperous
Georgia; and Friends and Survivors Standing Together.

 &HT;    Equifax buys customer loyalty consulting company
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Equifax will announce today an acquisition that will
broaden its base and sophistication in helping retailers, banks and
other businesses target and retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   Decisioneering Group, the company Equifax has bought for an
undisclosed price, specializes in helping businesses ''engineer
loyalty among customers,'' said Thomas J. Blischok.
</P>
<P>
   Blischok, formerly managing partner of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's
retail consulting practice, is chairman and chief executive officer
of Phoenix-based Decisioneering Group. The firm has a number of
competitors, but has a ``two- to three-year head start'' on others
in the field, Blischok said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is help people understand their
customers, products and channels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Chapman, president and chief executive officer of
Equifax, said the acquisition of the privately held Decisioneering
Group is in line with Equifax's transition. The Atlanta-based
company best known as a keeper of consumer credit reports has been
adding analytical services to the data it sells, rather than to
just sell the raw information.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said the deal will not lead to a merger of the databases
Equifax maintains with those of Decisioneering Group. Data from
Equifax might be used by Decisioneering Group, but the privacy
rights of individuals will be protected, Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   Decisioneering Group, with 25 employees, will be part of what
Equifax calls its knowledge engineering unit and will have Equifax
in its name, Chapman added.

 &HT;    Energy trading deal in Illinois goes sour on Southern Co.
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The city-operated utility of Springfield, Ill., has
defaulted on a $10 million contract to sell electricity to Southern
Co., the Atlanta-based utility holding company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   City Water Light &AMP; Power, which has entered the wholesale energy
trading business, broke contracts with Southern and a number of
other leading investor-owned utilities when the energy trading
company it was buying power from defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said it is assessing its options, but that the default
would not have a significant impact on profits. David Mould, a
spokesman for Southern, said the company diversifies its trading
transactions to hedge against such risks. Overall financial results
for the period Springfield defaulted are expected to be positive,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mould also said recent volatility in wholesale electricity
prices ``will have no impact'' on second-quarter financial results
Southern reports July 20.
</P>
<P>
   City Water Light &AMP; Power's supplier, Federal Energy Sales Inc.
of Cleveland, found itself unable to purchase enough electricity to
meet its obligations during the week of June 23. Record
temperatures increased demand for electricity and made energy
prices volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Towner, president of Federal Energy, said prices
skyrocketed from $30 per megawatt hour to $5,000 in two days, and
that his company was unable to supply electricity to the
Springfield utility.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield then reportedly broke contracts to sell power to
Southern, LG&AMP;E Energy Trading Corp. of Louisville, El Paso Energy
Corp. of Texas and PECO Energy Co. of Philadelphia. El Paso Energy
has filed suit in Harris County, Texas, against the Springfield
utility, seeking at least $7.4 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   City Water Light &AMP; Power officials did not return calls seeking
comment. The Wall Street Journal said a spokesman confirmed the
broken contracts, but denied liability in the El Paso case.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has been involved in wholesale electricity sales for
years. The company started a separate trading subsidiary in 1996
that last year became a joint venture with Vastar Resources, a
Houston-based natural gas company, for sales of both electricity
and natural gas. It was that unit, which operates trading floors in
Atlanta and Houston, that had contracted to purchase electricity
from Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Southern reported that energy trading contributed almost $2
billion of the company's $12.6 billion in revenues last year. It
did not separately report profits from the trading business, known
as Southern Company Energy Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing unit Tuesday announced an agreement to sell
electricity produced by four upstate New York power plants operated
by New York-based Sithe Energies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Southern subsidiary announced a five-year
agreement with Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy Partners to
jointly market coal storage and transportation services. The two
companies will jointly market coal transloading, blending and
storage services at Kinder Morgan's coal terminals near St. Louis
and in western Kentucky. Financial terms were not disclosed.

DROUGHT AND FIRES RAVAGING REGIONAL ECONOMIES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While hurricanes and tornadoes sweep through with swaths
of utter devastation, the wildfires that have struck Florida since
May labor erratically _ one acre here and a few more there.
</P>
<P>
   But with the passage of time, the fires and the drought that
sparked them have wiped out crops and cattle herds and sent up
choking clouds of smoke that have emptied beaches and hotels,
disrupting the economic pulse of whole communities.
</P>
<P>
   With lightning starting 50 new fires on Wednesday, the onslaught
is far from over. As firefighters spend their seventh week taming
the worst fires in memory in Florida, state officials have only
begun to tally the financial damage and assess long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   As uncertain as the damage is, the one certainty is that Florida
is not alone in being hurt. Severe drought has been ruining crops
since March from Texas eastward through Arkansas, Mississippi and
Georgia. At the same time the Midwest, middle Appalachia and New
England have been awash in rain, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it has spent more
than $520 million in grants, loans and other assistance so far this
year on states affected by fires, drought, winter storms, flooding
and tornadoes. For agriculture, drought has been a worse problem
than flooding, said Albert Peterlin, chief meteorologist with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding is localized,'' Peterlin said. ``Water is a
thousand small threats. Drought is a big, terrible one.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit hard in states like Texas, where farmers say they have
lost track of the days with temperatures over 100 and some are even
hoping for a hurricane. State officials estimate the loss to crops
this year at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers said losses from drought in previous years have
made them barely able to hold on to their businesses now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to laugh or cry,'' said Lynn Bartlett, 32, who grows
cotton and peanuts on a 500-acre farm his grandfather started in
the 1930s along the northeastern border with Oklahoma. ``The
dry-land cotton needs rain exactly right now, or it's close to
being over.''
</P>
<P>
   In northern Florida, two inches or less of rain fell in May and
June compared with 10 to 12 inches normally. Although only about
$175 million of the state's annual $6.2 billion farm revenue has
been lost so far to the record-breaking heat and drought, the
weather has all but destroyed crops like corn and hay and has
inflicted major losses to about 12,000 growers in the Panhandle and
north-central region, Florida Department of Agriculture officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock hungry from dry pastures are subsisting on hay, which
is not expected to last through the winter when it is normally
needed. As a result demand is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're desperately short of hay,'' said Terence McElroy, a
spokesman for the agriculture department, which is seeking hay
suppliers outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst losses in Florida have come from wildfires that
have burned about 485,000 acres, more than half of those commercial
timberland. About $300 million in timber has been lost, along with
at least $2.6 million from the destruction or damage to about 324
homes. The price tag for firefighting efforts is now $104 million,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 260,000 of the state's 14 million acres in timber
land have burned, but affected landowners are now turning to
salvage efforts. The pine trees used for paper and building
materials take 15 to 25 years to reach maturity, said Jeff Doran,
executive vice president of the Florida Forestry Association, which
represents the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go back and plant the trees all over again,'' said
Jim Kauffman, land manager of the Jefferson Smurfit Corp. in
Fernandina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The fires that began burning out of control on Memorial Day have
caused no deaths and only a few dozen injuries, mostly to
firefighters, because they were concentrated in forest lands.
Compared with the tornadoes in Central Florida in February that
killed more than 40 people, or Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which
killed at least 32 people in Florida and the Bahamas and caused $30
billion in damages and still ranks as the nation's most expensive
disaster, the fires have seemed relatively benign.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for the fires to reach that same scale as the
flames moved toward towns and coastal communities last week
prompted evacuations that displaced more than 100,000 people,
closed major highways and led to cancellation of Fourth of July
events.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in most of the state remains unaffected by fires,
drought and summer heat, state officials said, but smoke has cast
an acrid pall over beaches, keeping visitors away from coastal
cities like Daytona Beach and Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally have a 90 to 95 percent occupancy this time of
year,'' said John Connors, president of the Ormond Beach Chamber of
Commerce. ``There was one hotel I talked to that had only 13 of its
150 rooms occupied.''.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of small businesses, from restaurants to fireworks
stores, suffered from mandatory evacuations that emptied out whole
communities, including all of Flagler County last week, or from
state health warnings that kept residents indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In Ormond Beach, where the city's 35,000 residents were under
evacuation orders for four days, Paul LaRusso, manager of the
Bicycle Company, said business is still down 30 percent. Many of
his customers are avid bicycle racers, who because of the smoke,
left the area to train in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally get 50 to 60 people a day through here,'' he said.
``One day I counted seven people in nine hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when dislocated communities are returning to a
semblance of normalcy, city officials say it is hardly business as
usual. Judy Sloane, an Ormond Beach city engineer, said routine
maintenance is not being performed because the smoke makes work
outside difficult. The city has also imposed strict limitations on
water use, asking residents to water lawns or gardens only two days
a week, to conserve water for firefighters. &QL;

BIRMINGHAM SAYS BONUSES WOULD CREATE TEACHING ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Responding to criticism that his proposal to lure new
teachers with $20,000 signing bonuses was ``stealing money from the
taxpayers,'' Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham refined his idea
Wednesday to include high qualifications, ones that he said would
create an ``elite'' teaching corps.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, Birmingham said, would make Massachusetts the nation's
top contender in the looming competition to replace 40 percent of
the country's teaching force during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of attracting better teachers drew favor,
Birmingham's proposal also drew fire from legislators and interest
groups as well as from Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, who said it would
be misusing the state's newly-realized surplus _ money that would
be better spent, they said, on tax cuts than good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And some remained skeptical that the same kind of bonuses
baseball teams use to entice big-name players would score better
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to have, free agents next?'' asked Rep.
Harold M. Lane, the Holden Democrat who co-chairs the Legislature's
Education Committee, and a former high school principal. ``I think
the rejuvenation of the profession is long overdue, but I'm not
terribly enthusiastic about this kind of approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham said he would limit the bonuses to the best
students, in the same way that top law schools or medical schools
screen out their candidates, using grade point averages or test
scores, and possibly having colleges nominate their best students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be elitist, and unapologetically so,'' the
Senate president said. ``This is not just a check to people who
would already go into teaching. The purpose of this initiative is
to attract a population that has not traditionally gone into
teaching. That's one reason why we are aggressive in terms of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the criticism, Birmingham's proposal sparked a
conversation _ or at least lots of talk _ about how to improve the
state's teaching force. In a political year, it triggered a race
among candidates, all rushing to insist that they have the best
plan to attract the best and brightest to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci pitched scholarships to top-flight high school
students. Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Scott
Harshbarger offered $5,000 bonuses to teachers who promise to work
in the worst schools. And consultants to Sen. John Kerry, testing
the waters for a presidential race, insisted he had been first to
address the problem with a plan to attract talent from other
professions into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham's plan was by far the most dramatic initiative to get
better teachers, a need that has seemed more acute in the weeks
since the state announced that 59 percent of prospective teachers
could not pass a test of literacy and basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of that came the state's announcement this week of
a $1 billion surplus. Birmingham Tuesday suggested using $100
million to create _ subject to legislative approval _ a trust fund
that would pay $20,000 signing bonuses to 250 teachers. Over the
years, the money would come from interest on the fund, which he
suggested the state invest in treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses would rival what employers offer Ivy League business
school graduates, and dwarf much smaller bonuses offered in a small
number of other school systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said Wednesday he would limit the awards to only the
most top performing candidates. While existing plans to, say, pay
off college loans to teachers, go to students in the top quarter of
their class, Birmingham said he wanted it to be even more
exclusive, though he did not specify a cut-off.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that money is not the only way to improve
teachers, but also said it was a key ingredient, to make the
profession seem more attractive. The state is competing not only
with other states, but with other professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect there are many top-notch college students who flirt
with the idea of teaching, then they see the entry-level salaries
that are dwarfed by other offers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham's counterpart in the House, Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, would be a key to getting the plan approved. Finneran
refused to comment on it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But other key policy makers criticized it as the wrong use of
the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should take this unexpected surplus and turn
it into a feeding frenzy,'' said Cellucci. ``I don't like taking
$100 million that is scheduled to go back to the taxpayers and
applying it to some other use. If you're trying to steal money from
the taxpayers, I am not going to look favorably on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the signing bonuses are such a good idea, Cellucci said, they
should be paid for in the regular budget, and subject to the
Legislature's approval each year.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor also said he preferred his plan, which would
pay scholarships to high school students on the honor roll or in
the top quarter of their classes to attend the University of
Massachusetts or a state college, in exchange for a promise to
teach for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they agreed that higher salaries are part of the
equation to better teachers, especially in the early years, when
new teachers often have student loans to pay off. Starting teachers
make an average of $26,000 the first year, compared with $35,000 in
other professions, according to the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But critics questioned whether Birmingham's plan would sustain a
good teaching force after the first year, when those elite teachers
would crash back to the starting salary level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that one-time inducement be enough?'' asked Michael
Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. But
Widmer, like Cellucci, also questioned whether the money should
come from the surplus, and stressed that the first priority should
be a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Yet James St. George, director of the Tax Equity Alliance for
Massachusetts, said the public was starting to value issues like
education more than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I believe people are coming to see when it comes to
education in particular, you can't get something for nothing,'' he
said. ``If teaching is not a valued profession, you won't get the
good people at it.''

$3.2 BILLION SETTLEMENT IN SILICONE-IMPLANTS DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.C., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers for women claiming injury from
silicone breast implants agreed Wednesday to a $3.2 billion
settlement, a long-awaited step toward ending one of the most
heated disputes in American corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which would end a nearly 10-year legal battle,
would allow women seeking damages because of implants to receive
money as early as next year. For Dow Corning, a joint venture of
Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., it would enable the company to
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which Dow Corning entered for
protection from as many as 19,000 implant-damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, however, leaves unresolved the dispute between
the two sides over the harm from silicone implants. While localized
complications from leaking implants are well documented, Dow
Corning, supported by a growing body of research, has denied
throughout the battle that implants cause systemic illness such as
autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many of the details remain to be worked out over the
next two months, this settlement is a breakthrough in an incredibly
complex case,'' said Gary Anderson, president of Dow Corning. ``At
a certain time in a controversy, both sides need to agree to
disagree and look together to find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, part of Dow Corning's bankruptcy restructuring
plan, must be approved by two-thirds of the 170,000 women who filed
claims against the company and by Dow Corning's creditors. Lawyers
for the women were hopeful Wednesday that their clients would
approve the agreement, enabling some to secure money for injuries
sustained two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors appeared to bring both sides to the table. A
panel of doctors was expected to issue a report later this year
that would have evaluated the scientific evidence of whether
silicone implants caused systemic illnesses, the spark of a long
debate between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the negotiations, neither
side wanted to wait on the results of the report and endure its
inevitable embarrassment. If that wasn't cause enough for Dow
Corning, based in Midland, Mich., the company had virtually no hope
of emerging from bankruptcy unless it settled its legal woes,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bankruptcy judge Arthur Spector in Bay City, Mich., who
is overseeing Dow Corning's case, Wednesday reappointed Duke
University law professor Francis McGovern to mediate the rest of
the deal. Both sides were quick to point out that many of the
details had yet to be worked out. One source close to the deal said
Wednesday that negotiations would continue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For many women who are plaintiffs in the case, Wednesday's
settlement was almost too good to be true. ``I need more details,
but I'm hopeful it is a beginning,'' said Peggy Pardo, an implant
recipient living in Addison, Ill., a Chicago suburb. ``Dow Corning
will get on with business and these women will have to get on with
their lives, but a lot of them have been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a consumer health issue divided corporations and
their customers so bitterly. Between 650,000 and 1 million women
received silicone breast implants during the 1970s and 1980s. The
legal disputes started soon after, as more women complained that
leaks from the implants had damaged their health. Heeding an outcry
from the public, the Food and Drug Administration asked that the
implants be removed from the market in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Riddled by lawsuits, the breast-implant manufacturers agreed in
September 1993 to settle the entire litigation, a pay-out that
would have totaled $4 billion. The deal eventually fell apart,
although several manufacturers settled with their claimants two
years later. Plagued by lawsuits over its silicone breast implants,
Dow Corning filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995, igniting a
nasty three-year struggle with plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Dow Corning's settlement offers were not only
deemed too low but often offensive to many of the women plaintiffs.
In December 1996, the company offered to set aside $2 billion for
up to 30 years to meet all potential claims of women who believed
they were injured by the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was one hitch: Before any money was to be paid out,
there would be a ``science'' trial in which a single jury would
decide whether there was adequate proof that silicone leaking from
the implants could cause the damage described in the lawsuits. Dow
proposed that if it won that trial, no more than $600 million
should be set aside for implant claims.

FUTURENET NAMES INTERIM PRESIDENT

<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ Three weeks after its president resigned,
multilevel marketing firm FutureNet Inc. said it has named a new
top executive.
</P>
<P>
   The news Wednesday appeared to give FutureNet shares a slight
boost. The issue rose 3.12 cents from its 52-week low Tuesday, to
close at 53.12 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Menning, who joined FutureNet as a consultant just before
the departure of then-President Chris Lobato, will serve as acting
president of the company. Menning said he will work with newly
appointed Senior Vice President Charles Perkins to reposition the
company in the multilevel marketing sector.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission accused
FutureNet of operating a Ponzi scheme that depended on initiation
fees paid by the company's independent dealers to survive. To
settle the suit, Chairman Alan Setlin established a $1 million fund
to refund membership fees to disgruntled dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not blind to some of the policies advocated by previous
management,'' Menning said. ``That's not the modern world of
network marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Menning said that among other changes, he will work to increase
FutureNet's role in Internet services. Currently dealers for the
company sell WebTV, a device that allows users to access the
Internet through a television. Menning said the company is
considering becoming an Internet service provider that would also
offer Web design services.
</P>
<P>
   Menning likened the challenge he faces in repositioning
FutureNet to those faced by Amway and Herbalife, two multilevel
marketing firms that overcame bad publicity arising from their own
run-ins with government regulators.

<P>
   DEMRE, Turkey _ The slogan of this pretty town on Turkey's
magnificent Mediterranean coast might be: ``Catering to Cults and
Religions for More Than 2,000 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Demre has been a center for pagans, early Christians and modern
Eastern Orthodox denominations. Today it attracts throngs of
camera-toting pilgrims from one of the most powerful cults of all
time, the one that worships consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of ancient miracles, grave robbers, dervishes and
disappearing bones give this place an aura of romance and mystery.
Combined with political and religious debates that have
not-so-subtle modern implications, they make Demre a textbook in
mass psychology.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-Christian times, Hellenic tribes who lived in the
surrounding mountains built a temple here where they prayed and
made sacrifices to Artemis and Apollo. The temple was destroyed in
an earthquake in the second century A.D., a cataclysm that local
Christians took as Jehovah's retribution on those who refused to
embrace monotheism.
</P>
<P>
   Christians built a church on the site of the ruined temple, and
in the fourth century a local holy man named Nicholas became its
bishop. He was renowned for good deeds, among them throwing a purse
full of gold coins in the window of a home where three impoverished
sisters lived. The sisters had decided that two of them would sell
the third into slavery so the first two could afford dowries, and
when Nicholas overheard their desperate plan through an open
window, he resolved to help them anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas is also said to have carried a sack full of gifts for
children through the streets of Demre, then known as Myra, on the
December night before the birth of Jesus was celebrated. For this
he became the prototype of Santa Claus, although he is not known
ever to have worn a red suit, descended a chimney or laid eyes on a
reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   After Nicholas died in 323, his priests buried him in an
elaborate marble sarcophagus that they periodically filled with
fragrant oil. The oil dripped through cavities in the sarcophagus,
and priests did a lucrative business selling vials of it to
pilgrims who believed the oil had miraculous powers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 years after Nicholas died, his skeleton was stolen by
Italian merchants. A guide at the site, asked by a recent visitor
if the theft was motivated by a desire to take the mystic powers to
the seat of the Roman church, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he said. ``They saw how much money could be
made with the bones and decided to take them home to try the same
scam there.''
</P>
<P>
   With no bones to serve as a drawing card, Nicholas' church fell
into disrepair and was ultimately lost to history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century Czar Nicholas I of Russia, determined to
resurrect the memory of his namesake, commissioned an expedition
that succeeded in locating and excavating what remained of it,
including mosaic floors, several fading frescoes and the holy
sarcophagus, in which giggling children now stand dozens of times a
day so their parents can take snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   After the Greeks living here left this region in a population
exchange with the Turks that followed the fall of the Ottoman
Empire in the aftermath of World War I, no Christians remained to
take care of the resurrected church. Demre sank back into its
former status as a remote though picturesque village known mainly
for its annual camel-fighting tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s local businessmen guessed that the legend of Santa
Claus might be Demre's ticket back to prosperity. Since then the
Turkish government has claimed Nicholas _ and by extension Santa _
as its own, issuing a stamp in his honor and sponsoring conferences
here to honor his memory. In 1981 a statue of him, looking
remarkably like the popular image of Santa minus the potbelly, was
built in front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the chairman of the Saint Nicholas Foundation in
nearby Antalya, Muammer Karabulut, went so far as to claim that
Nicholas was ``an Anatolian dervish.'' This seemed odd since
dervishes are usually associated with Islam, a religion that did
not come into existence until several centuries after Nicholas
died.
</P>
<P>
   Today Karabulut and others are looking for ways to attract
tourists to Demre in 2000, when ``faith tourism'' is expected to
bring throngs of visitors to early Christian sites in this part of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This enrages some Greeks and others who consider it cynical for
Turkish Muslims to profit from the legacy of a Christian bishop
who, according to a book sold at souvenir stands here, was so pure
that he ``used to pray day and night, and stayed away from
gatherings of women.''

LITTLE PROGRESS SEEN IN STRIKE TALKS BETWEEN GM AND UAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators worked steadily Wednesday to resolve
a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here, but
more signs emerged that any deal would address local disputes and
might not produce big improvements in GM's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. has used the strike as an occasion to warn
that it may close car factories and eliminate car models while
focusing more on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks _ a shift in direction that Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have already made and that Wall Street analysts would like to
see GM duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American
car operations, said in a message to employees this week that GM
was working on a ``detailed rationalization plan'' for its
factories and models.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the
UAW, told several reporters Wednesday that little attention had
been given to any such move. ``We haven't had really focused
discussions on that whole subject,'' he said Wednesday afternoon
during a lull in top-level negotiations at a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker strongly hinted that factory closings could lead to
more strikes. ``If as a result of this strike they decide to close
facilities, that obviously would not improve the relationship and
it would go a long way to continuing confrontations,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations,
arrived in Flinton Wednesday afternoon for further discussions with
Shoemaker but declined to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   GM's problem is that as the strike has dragged on, expectations
have risen on Wall Street that a settlement will break the pattern
of inconclusive deals in a dozen other local strikes over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better come up with something this time that is more
than `we invest $50 million and agree to give them 100 jobs,''' the
typical settlement in other local strikes, said Maryann Keller, an
analyst at Furman Selz in New York. ``If it's something along those
lines, it won't be enough'' to satisfy institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker also warned GM on Wednesday not to sell Delphi
Automotive Systems, the automaker's parts division. GM and the UAW
reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up
to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public
offering, he said, but a sale of the entire division would not be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably set the stage for a hell of a battle,''
Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   GM estimates that the strikes here have already cost it $1.18
billion through June 30, with further losses likely in the coming
days. The strikes at two parts factories have forced GM to close 26
of its 29 North American assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   GM and UAW bargainers have been conducting long meetings for the
last week, with each day's sessions lasting a little later into the
evening as both sides struggle to reach a deal by Thursday or
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A deal by that point would allow time for the 9,200 striking
workers to vote on ratification over the weekend and reopen the
struck auto parts factories Monday, the day when GM workers would
normally return from the company's regularly scheduled two-week
summer shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the parts factories do reopen then, it could take
another two weeks for enough parts to be produced to allow the
reopening of the 26 GM assembly plants.

DAYS PASS NORMALLY IN ULSTER, BUT NIGHTS ARE VIOLENT

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ In the daylight hours life follows
its usual rhythms in Northern Ireland. In a spell of surprisingly
sunny weather, people go to work, shop or sip $3 cups of Viennese
cappuccino at cafes like Roscoff on Fountain Street. Shops and
department stores have plenty of customers. Buses crowd the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But at nightfall the towns of this predominantly Protestant
British province, especially Belfast, become urban war zones.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants vent their anger over a parade by the Protestant
Orange Order that was blocked on Sunday by the police and the
British Army from marching through a Roman Catholic area along
Garvaghy Road, Drumcree, in Portadown, west of here.
</P>
<P>
   For four nights gangs of Protestants have thrown blazing
gasoline bombs at police officers, who respond by firing plastic
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, mostly young men, hijack and burn cars, block
roads with burning barricades and have caused cancellations and
interruptions of buses and trains.
</P>
<P>
   Official police summaries from Tuesday night and early this
morning were terse and grim:
</P>
<P>
   ``0100 hours. A car was driven through the outer gates of Holy
Cross Girls' Primary School at Ardoyne Road, driven against the
front-door shutters and set alight. Scorch damage and structural
damage was caused to the doorway. A number of windows were broken
and petrol poured into a broken window though not ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ``2159 hours. A mob attacked a hostel in Castlereagh Street with
stones, breaking up to 14 windows. The occupants were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``2350 hours. A police patrol was attacked with four petrol
bombs in the Ballycraigy estate, Antrim. Minutes later they foiled
a hijacking and arrested one male. Approximately 20 minutes later
two blast bombs were thrown at police in the estate. There were no
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders and security officials said they expected at
least several more nights of violence, raising fears that the
turmoil will damage or destroy the peace settlement, approved in
the spring, that is supposed to end sectarian killing between
Catholics and Protestants in the province.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night the vicious mood of many in the province was
reflected at a meeting in Portadown. A prominent moderate Catholic,
Seamus Mallon, a member of the British Parliament and Deputy First
Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, went to Garvaghy
Road to discuss solutions with Catholics opposed to the march.
About 100 of the 6,000 Catholic residents of the area shouted
insults at him, saying he was selling out his own kind and forcing
him to enter his car and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-win situation,'' John Taylor said Wednesday. Taylor
is a member of the British Parliament and deputy leader of the
Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble, who is the First Minister
of the new Assembly that is to work out the peace agreement
approved in referendums in May in the Irish republic and in the
North.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let the parade go down the Garvaghy Road,'' Taylor
added, ``there will be violence. If you try to reroute, it there
will be violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Trimble, an Orangeman who is now committed to cooperating
with Catholics in the Assembly: ``We cannot afford this situation
to continue indefinitely. The longer the present situation
continues, the greater the dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Slight progress had been made toward a compromise, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Prime Minister Tony Blair said in London he would
meet on Thursday with leaders of the Protestant Orange Order, whose
parade was blocked, to try to work out something. Britain announced
that it would send 800 additional troops here by the end of the
week. They will join the 17,000 troops in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, including Blair, have been urging people to stay
calm, saying there has been some progress toward ending the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for four nights pleas for calm have been ignored. The police
reported Wednesday that there had been 350 gasoline bomb incidents
in five days and 437 attacks on security forces, injuring 44. There
have been 92 arrests. In addition, 156 vehicles have been hijacked,
about half burned. About 135 private homes have been attacked, as
have 92 commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But television stations repeatedly showed a fight between a
Protestant and a Catholic, in which one man swung a long piece of
wood at the other, who ducked. The two rolled in the street before
the police separated them. For the viewer it was impossible to tell
which one was the Catholic and which the Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said in London on Tuesday, in a statement repeated
Wednesday on television: ``I think it's important in a situation
like this, when we've come so far in Northern Ireland, we've got
over the hurdle of the referendum. We've got over the hurdle of an
Assembly. We now have the possibility of a tremendous future in
Northern Ireland. So if we can talk and work with people, too, then
I hope the good will exists to change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People watch the mayhem and the politicians on television, but
in interviews in downtown Belfast in recent days, many indicated
that there was at least as much interest in less violent events
like the World Cup soccer matches in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis Deepens,'' said a sign in front of newsstand that was
advertising The Belfast Telegraph. But at sidewalk tables of the
Roscoff cafe, people enjoyed the hazy sunlight and ate
cheddar-and-scallion soup.
</P>
<P>
   David McCabe, 40, a Protestant graphics designer, said of the
violence and politics: ``There's an entertainment value. The only
effect is the nuisance of roadblocks. The wanton damage is
something we're used to. The whole thing's politically driven.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend John Lunn, 25, a Protestant computer programmer,
said, ``I think the government created the problem, got themselves
into a stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the government decision to try to mollify
Protestants by allowing them to march through a different Catholic
area in Belfast next Monday, he added: ``They have to parade in
silence, no traditional music, before 8:30 in the morning. It's not
a parade at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner on Chapel Lane, a Catholic busker, Mike Doyle,
strummed his six-string guitar and sang his own songs and those of
Simon and Garfunkel, his instrument case open at his feet for
donations. ``I'm losing about 40 percent of my income,'' Doyle
said. ``People go home earlier. It's just that they're wary.''
</P>
<P>
   A uniformed security guard at the Castlecourt shopping complex
said there were no plans to resume checking bags of arriving
customers for guns or bombs, as was the case until the peace effort
began making progress three years ago. ``I don't think it really
bothers anyone,'' he said of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At the Northern Ireland government tourist office on North
Street, a woman at the information counter said there had been no
noticeable drop in tourism this week. A few people a day telephone
to ask whether it is safe to visit the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them the whole of Northern Ireland is not in
uprising,'' the woman said. ``Life is continuing in Northern
Ireland.''

WITNESS TO CHICAGO BEATING IS MISSING, FEARED DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER AND HEATHER RATCLIFFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.) A 13-year-old Chicago boy who lay in a coma
for days might never recall the day police said three White teens
pummeled him for being Black.
</P>
<P>
   So prosecutors must rely on eyewitnesses to tell his tale.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, one key witness is dead. And the other, a Scottsdale
teen, is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeSantis, 19, vanished from the Valley in April.
Authorities, who have focused a nationwide manhunt in Arizona, fear
he might be dead because the defendants he is to testify against
reportedly have ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just would like to see Mr. DeSantis alive and well and in
court,'' said Bob Benjamin, spokesman for the Cook County State's
Attorney's Office in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say DeSantis saw three Chicago teens attack
13-year-old Lenard (cq) Clark in March 1997. Police said the young
Black teen was savagely beaten after wandering into a predominantly
White neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The racially charged case sparked national outrage, drawing the
attention of Black leaders and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is recovering from the attack but has no memory of it,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness in the case was fatally shot in May, in what
police call a gang-related shooting. Chicago Police Department
spokesman Patrick Camden said police believe the cases are
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it left prosecutors in the beating case with one
eyewitness, DeSantis, and little time. The case is set to go to
trial July 20.
</P>
<P>
   The teens, Frank Caruso, Victor Jasas and Michael Kwidzinski,
are charged with several counts including attempted murder,
aggravated battery and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago officials have said Caru so's father is tied to an
organized crime crew, which Chicago media also have linked to
Richard DeSantis's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' located DeSantis' father Wednesday at a
north Scottsdale post office box and asked him to explain his side
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a side,'' Richard DeSantis Sr. told a reporter,
declining to say whether he knew his son's location.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   A relative, who lives in Scottsdale and asked to remain
anonymous, told ``The Republic'' he fears the younger DeSantis
might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The relative said family members suspect Richard DeSantis Sr.
might be helping his son evade authorities. If that is the case,
the relative said, he should turn his son over to authorities as
part of a witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   The DeSantis family moved to Scottsdale several years ago to get
away from the old Chicago neighborhood, the relative said. Local
records indicate Richard DeSantis started a cleaning business,
Amerimex All Kleen Systems, in 1997, but the relative said it is
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The DeSantis family, including the younger DeSantis, lived with
relatives in a sprawling north Scottsdale home until just before
last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   They then moved to another home after a family feud over money,
said the relative. Before his disappearance, young Richard DeSantis
traveled between Scottsdale, where he worked occasionally at a
local video store, and Chicago, said relatives and a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the family abruptly moved out of that home, and
Richard DeSantis' mother and sister returned to Chicago, the
relative said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeSantis Sr. stayed behind and is living in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Cook County authorites sent a letter to Maricopa County Attorney
Richard Romley in April asking for help locating DeSantis. A
Maricopa County judge issued a warrant April 29 for his arrest,
declaring him a federal fugitive for flight from testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chicago prosecutors said they will continue to
prepare for the trial and will not rule out the possibility that
their key witness might be dead, said Benjamin, of the state's
Attorneys Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to consider anything as being possible,'' he said.

FRANCE'S HERO REMEMBERS HEARING AS A BOY, ``GO BACK TO YOUR OWN
COUNTRY'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ There were moments after Lilian Thuram
arrived in mainland France at the age of nine from the Caribbean
island of Guadeloupe that he did not always feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He can remember children yelling at him, ``Go back to your own
country, rotten black.'' He can remember responding: ``But I am
French.''
</P>
<P>
   Guadeloupe, like its neighboring island Martinique, is a French
overseas ''departement,'' legally as much a part of France as Paris
or its suburbs, and Wednesday night in one of those suburbs Thuram
sent his fellow citizens streaming joyously into the streets by
scoring both French goals in the 2-1 victory over Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   If a striker had scored two goals in a World Cup semifinal, it
would have been considered exceptional. For Thuram, a right
fullback, to score twice was simply improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I don't even score in practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram, a 26-year-old who plays for Parma in the Italian first
division, is one of the world's finest defenders. He was voted the
best foreign player in Italy after the 1996-1997 season _ no small
accomplishment _ and the 1997 French player of the year by the
nation's leading soccer magazine. But in 37 previous appearances
for France, he had never scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
   For an outside fullback to score is not unusual in this era,
because they often play the role that wings once played, sprinting
deep into the opposing half when opportunities arise. But Thuram is
the least offensive-minded of France's two outside fullbacks.
Bixente Lizarazu, who plays on the left side, is more at ease as an
attacking player, in part because Thuram does not even play outside
fullback for his club. For years, he has been a central defender,
but because France has great strength at his favorite position,
Thuram acceded to coach Aime Jacquet's request that he move outside
for the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilian's two goals were a great reward for us and especially
for him; he is having a great World Cup,'' Jacquet said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony Wednesday night was that Thuram was
uncharacteristically out of position on the Croatian goal scored by
Davor Suker in the opening minute of the second half. If he had
been in line with his fellow fullbacks, Suker probably would have
been ruled offside, but Thuram had drifted further back when Aljosa
Asanovic's chip floated over the French defense. Suker pounced, but
less than a minute later, Thuram made his teammates forget about
that miscommunication by scoring himself with a right-footed shot
in front of the Croatian goal.
</P>
<P>
   His one-on-one defensive skills helped create that opportunity,
because he started the sequence that led to the goal by stripping
the ball from Croatian captain Zvonimir Boban. In the 70th minute,
Thuram would score with his left foot from longer range after
winning a scramble for the ball with Croatian Robert Jarni. When
the game ended, Thuram had tears in his eyes as teammate Bernard
Lama, a reserve goalkeeper, hoisted him high in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I get in front of the goal, I see red and
panic,'' he said. ''Tonight, I didn't have time to think. But until
it's proved otherwise, soccer is a game with 11 players on a team.
The most important thing is not that I scored two goals. It's that
we made it to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuram made it to mainland France one year after his mother, who
left Thuram and his four siblings behind in Guadeloupe so she could
make enough money as a cleaning lady in Paris to support them. His
first dream was to be a priest, not a soccer player, but his
talents took him in a different direction, and at age 17, he joined
the club in Monaco, which competes in the French league. From a
very modest background, Thuram remembers thinking at first that the
luxury cars he saw parked in Monte Carlo's streets were part of
some sort of exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine that individuals could own such things,''
he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram can now afford fancy transportation of his own, but
though he earns his good living in Italy, he is playing for his own
country this summer. Wednesday night, his fellow Francais looked
and sounded very grateful as they celebrated on the Champs-Elysees.

FRUSTRATED BY KOSOVO STALEMATE, THE WEST CRITICIZES ALL SIDES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ The United States, Russia and European countries
monitoring fighting between ethnic Albanian and Serbian forces in
Kosovo turned their attention to the rebels Wednesday, condemning
outside support for the fighters and urging all countries to
prevent exiles from financing arms for the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   While the diplomats of the six countries, known as the contact
group, acknowledge that the primary responsibility for the
bloodshed in Kosovo lies with Serbia, their statement Wednesday was
almost as critical of the insurgents. The diplomats also said for
the first time that negotiations should include ethnic Albanian
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that chances of a peaceful settlement had deteriorated
over the last month, the diplomats, meeting near Bonn, called on
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to live up to commitments
he made in Moscow on June 16 to stop the Serbian attacks and resume
talks with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian political leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province in Serbia; Montenegro and Serbia are the
two remaining republics in the Yugoslav federation, with Serbia by
far the dominant partner.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rebels, Rugova has called for independence for the
province, a goal the contact group countries _ the United States,
Russia, Germany, Italy, Britain and France _ do not endorse. Some
ethnic Albanian fighters have complained recently that Rugova, who
advocates a peaceful approach, does not speak for them.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats said they had agreed to suggest elements of a
political settlement in an effort to speed negotiations, but they
did not elaborate. They have said that any settlement would have to
restore the autonomy that Kosovo had before Milosevic revoked it in
1989, when he was president of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the province's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, and the diplomats in Bonn also expressed concern
Wednesday that the conflict could draw in Albania and Macedonia, a
former Yugoslav republic that also has a sizable Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Wednesday in Brussels that military
contingency plans could be put into effect within hours if the
allies were called upon to act in Kosovo, and the contact group
states threatened again Wednesday to consider military steps if the
two sides ignored demands to stop the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The six countries also said they would seek a United Nations
Security Council resolution calling on both sides to stop fighting,
requiring Milosevic to keep his promises to resume a dialogue and
requiring both the Serbian authorities and the rebels to ensure the
safety of international observers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from Bonn Wednesday reflected the frustration that
the American special emissary to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke,
said he and other diplomats had experienced last weekend with
disunity between the Albanian political leadership in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, and the fighters of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   As the statement put it: ``It is clear that the Kosovo Albanian
team for all these talks must be fully representative of their
community in order to speak authoritatively. Although the primary
responsibility for the situation in Kosovo rests with Belgrade, the
contact group acknowledges that armed Kosovo Albanian groups also
have a responsibility to avoid violence and all armed activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gelbard, the Clinton administration's principal
troubleshooter in the area, said in Bonn Wednesday that the Kosovo
Liberation Army controlled more than 30 percent of the province.
But if the militias did not agree to seek a peaceful settlement, he
added, ``we will try to interrupt their ability to sustain
themselves through the full chain of supply.''

FLAG AMENDMENT FLIES PROUDLY IN SENATE HEARING
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one sense, a hearing before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Wednesday to consider a proposed constitutional
amendment to allow Congress to ban flag-burning was just so much
rhetorical icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the measure two weeks ago and hardly
needed the inspiration provided by witnesses like the longtime
baseball manager Tommy Lasorda, who denounced the Supreme Court for
treating the flag as ``just another piece of cloth'' when it ruled
in 1989 that burning an American flag in political protest was a
form of constitutionally protected expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of speech is when you talk,'' Lasorda growled
dismissively of the nuances of the court's First Amendment
doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sense, this after-the-fact hearing, organized by
the amendment's supporters to get a few last words on record in
preparation for a vote by the full Senate this fall, was a preview
of things to come. After several false starts, and with little
public notice this time, supporters of a flag-protection amendment
appear closer to victory than at any other time since the effort
began to overturn the court's 1989 decision in Texas vs. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal, differing slightly from the version
offered in 1989, 1990 and 1995, passed the House of Representatives
a year ago by a 310-114 vote, with nearly half the Democratic
members voting in favor. It has 61 sponsors in the Senate, 6 short
of the two-thirds needed for passage, but with time remaining for
supporters to turn on the election-year pressure. The last time a
flag amendment came to a vote, three years ago, it fell three votes
short.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would amend the Constitution by ``authorizing
Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.'' Earlier versions gave similar authority to the
states as well as to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Once an amendment clears both houses of Congress, it goes
directly to the states, where final adoption requires approval by
three-quarters of the legislatures; there is no role for the
president in the process. Over the last three years, 49 state
legislatures, all except Vermont's, have adopted resolutions urging
Congress to approve the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Those state resolutions, spurred by a coalition of veterans'
groups, carry no formal weight but add to the political climate.
There have also been other recent developments calling renewed
attention to what earlier appeared a quiescent issue. On June 25,
the Wisconsin Supreme Court, ruling in the case of a 17-year-old
self-described anarchist who had stolen an American flag from a
country club and defecated on it, unanimously held Wisconsin's
flag-desecration law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin court, writing with obvious reluctance, said it
was bound by U.S. Supreme Court precedent but noted pointedly that
Congress had the power to begin the amendment process ``to protect
our nation's symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is thus firmly in our court here in Congress,'' said
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee and
presided over Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who strongly favors the amendment, appeared particularly
moved by Lasorda's account of a flag-burning incident during a game
at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles in 1976. Lasorda, then the
Dodgers' third-base coach and now their general manager, said that
two men suddenly ran onto the field and tried to burn a flag they
had soaked with lighter fluid. One of the players, Rick Monday of
the Chicago Cubs, rescued the flag, Lasorda said, and the fans in
the stadium stood and sang ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda described Monday's intervention as ``one of the most
heroic acts ever to take place on the field during a major league
baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch commended Lasorda for ``as powerful a statement as I have
heard'' on the issue. Other witnesses who spoke in support of the
amendment were John Schneider, a star of the 1980s television
series ``The Dukes of Hazzard''; Gary Wetzel, a Medal of Honor
winner from Wisconsin; Sean Stephenson, a 19-year-old student at
DePaul University, and Richard Parker, a Harvard Law School
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who recently recorded a song written by Hatch called
``I Love Old Glory,'' testified that the ``shock tore at my heart''
when he first learned of the Supreme Court's decision on
flag-burning, ``and it is still tearing at my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said that the court's 5-4 decision had been a mistake and
that the ``legal elite'' were mistaken in continuing to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court and the Constitution are not the same thing,'' he
said, adding, ``The flag represents not the freedom to burn it, but
an ideal and aspiration for national community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's Republican majority allowed the
amendment's opponents to present two witnesses. Along with two
Democratic senators, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Richard
Durbin of Illinois, they said that amending the Bill of Rights for
the first time in the country's history would be a drastic and
unnecessary step. Feingold said adopting the amendment would
``align the United States with totalitarian governments like China,
Cuba and Iran,'' where flag desecration is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   One witness opposed to the amendment, Marvin Virgil Stenhammar,
a disabled Army Special Forces veteran from Asheville, N.C., said
the proposal would ``place a higher value on an inanimate object, a
symbol, than the rights of the people living under it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for
Justice, a public interest law firm here with a libertarian
orientation, asked the senators to oppose the amendment in order to
make the ``powerful symbolic statement'' that the country has
nothing to fear from ``such pathetic displays of contempt for our
system'' as flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That principle,'' Bolick said, ``seems to have worked awfully
well for all of these years.''

REPORT CONCLUDES CHINA UNLIKELY TO HAVE RECOVERED COMMUNICATIONS
SATELLITE DATA  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Pentagon review has concluded that sensitive
encoded circuit boards that disappeared after a failed launching of
an American communications satellite in China two years ago most
likely were destroyed in the fiery crash.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Defense Department officials said they suspected that
the Chinese authorities had stolen the devices from the wreckage of
a $200 million satellite that was obliterated when the Chinese
rocket carrying it exploded shortly after launching.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a review by the National Security Agency, the military's
supersecret codemakers and codebreakers, found no evidence of
wrongdoing by Chinese authorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly unlikely that the devices survived the crash
because of the crash impact and high temperatures produced by
burning rocket propellents,'' said the review, which noted that the
devices were housed very close to the rocket's fuel tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the off chance that the Chinese recovered the microprocessor
chips, which tell an orbiting satellite which way to point in order
to receive and transmit signals, they would not have learned much,
the review concluded: ``It is highly unlikely that these items
could have been recovered in sufficient detail'' to enable the
Chinese to reproduce them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House had ordered the review after House Republicans,
notably Rep. Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, voiced fears at a hearing
last month that the loss of the encoded circuit boards might have
harmed national security.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case of the missing circuit boards became part of a
congressional inquiry into whether sensitive American satellite
technology was given to China that ultimately may enhance Beijing's
military.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the House hearing last month, the White House released a
statement from the National Security Agency that said the loss of
the devices would have ``minimal'' impact on American security
because the technology was 20 years old.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before the accident, the government had scheduled a routine
upgrading of algorithms, or the set of instructions, guiding
American satellite encoding equipment, the statement said. Thus,
encoded devices for one satellite could not gain access to or
control other satellites.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weldon on Wednesday expressed skepticism over the
administration's explanation. ``The whole thing is very
suspicious,'' said Weldon, who is a member of the House select
committee looking into accusations involving China. ``Why didn't
they have these answers a month ago?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department provided a copy of the one-page review
Wednesday after Franklin Miller, a senior Pentagon official,
testified before a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on the
export of sensitive technology to China. Miller had expected
questions on the missing circuit boards, but senators asked none.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the issue after the hearing, Miller said, ``The
government's position is that the devices almost certainly did not
survive.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the Clinton administration officials had never asked
China for an accounting of the missing technology because an
American team of industry and military observers concluded the day
after the accident that the devices were likely lost in the crash.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1996, at the launching of a Loral Space &AMP;
Communications satellite in southern China, the Chinese rocket
exploded 22 seconds after liftoff, showering debris and burning
fuel on a nearby Chinese village. By U.S. accounts, as many as 200
civilians were killed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For five hours, U.S. officials said, Chinese authorities barred
American monitors at the launching center from visiting the crash
site, purportedly for their own safety.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to an industry official, an American inspection team,
made up of representatives from the Pentagon, Loral and Intelsat,
the communications consortium that had planned to use the
satellite, finally was able to comb the crash site for pieces of
the satellite.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team recovered pieces comprising about one-third of the
satellite, but many parts were mangled or melted beyond
recognition, the industry official said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Loral satellite contained about 100 circuit boards that
resembled trays, which were inserted into large metal rectangular
boxes called command processor units.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 computer chips were built into the circuit boards,
but the industry official said only two chips _ each on a separate
circuit board _ were actually encoded.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American team found parts of 12 trays, and about three of
them were battered but mostly intact. Loral sent these parts back
to its laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., for analysis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials said Chinese officials would
have no way of knowing which of the chips were encoded because they
all look alike. Loral employees could tell them apart by comparing
company records with code numbers on the circuit boards. None of
the recovered chips were encoded, the officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. inspection team concluded the Chinese had not taken
anything because they were too busy dealing with the emergency, and
had made no apparent effort to retrieve the circuit boards.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were trying to search the field for something, they'd
have collected every recognizable piece and sent it to a lab,''
said the industry official.  &QL;

LOTT'S LIABILITY PLAN WOULD AID BIG EMPLOYER IN HIS HOME STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill., W.Va.)  (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the final push for a bill setting a nationwide
product liability standard began this week, Senate Republican
Majority Leader Trent Lott urged his colleagues not to burden the
measure with amendments. But Wednesday, a new hand-written
amendment sponsored by Lott suddenly appeared in the bill, one that
would significantly benefit a major company in his home state of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has angered Democrats by blocking their efforts to add a
variety of amendments to the bill, which is designed to set the
first-ever nationwide limits on court awards for injuries caused by
faulty products as diverse as toaster-ovens and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lott told his fellow senators they should restrain
themselves from tinkering with the measure.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, the new version of the measure had the
amendment offered by Lott, scrawled with a pen in the margins, and
it seemed aimed at helping Baxter Healthcare Corp., one of
Mississippi's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sought by the business community for nearly two
decades, contains two sections. The main section would limit
litigation against retailers and wholesalers unless they altered a
product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill limits punitive damages, that is the large
amounts awarded by juries to punish especially irresponsible
corporate behavior. The limits on punitive damages would apply only
to companies with fewer than 25 employees or with annual revenues
of less than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lott amendment is part of the second section that deals
with biomaterials. Sponsors of this section have argued that unless
there is some kind of immunity for companies that provide raw
materials used in medical devices, the supply will dry up.
</P>
<P>
   The original bill provided protection against lawsuits for
materials and components used only in implants. Lott's amendment
would extend that protection to materials and components used in
``containers and their related products to be used to collect
fluids or tissue from the body or to infuse or to otherwise
introduce fluids or tissue into the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter's subsidiary in Cleveland, Miss., is one of the world's
largest manufacturers of products that precisely fit that
definition: medical kits used in intravenous injections as well as
special catheters used in kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter International Inc., the
parent company which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said that her
organization sought the change only to assure its raw material
suppliers that they would be immune from lawsuits. She said that
Baxter, a global medical products and services corporation which
did $6.1 billion in sales in 1997, did not believe that the
amendment would affect it directly. Rather, she said, Baxter would
only benefit by being able to have a reliable supply of raw
materials from suppliers no longer afraid of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a
Washington-based consumer group which has lobbied against the bill,
said that the measure explicitly provides immunity not only for the
raw material suppliers but also for ``component parts'' which
Baxter itself manufactures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Baxter lost a lawsuit in Illinois state court
in which it was ordered to pay $18 million to the family of a woman
who suffered severe brain damage because of a faulty intravenous
unit. Baxter supplied the faulty tube used in the intravenous unit
which allowed air to enter the woman's bloodstream which could fit
the definition of a ``component part'' in the bill making the
company immune from a similar lawsuit in the future. Baxter is
appealing the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lott's latest move to sneak into the bill a special
amendment for a major Mississippi corporation, adds to the pile of
special interests contained in this bill,'' Ms. Claybrook said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said, ``Protecting small
business from lawsuit abuse is what this bill is all about.'' He
said ``this provision allows the continued supply of raw materials
to those who manufacture critical health care devices by providing
some protection from out-of-control trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure was scheduled to be voted Thursday afternoon, but it
has become embroiled in all manner of extraneous politics. Sen.
John D. Rockefeller IV, W-Va., who has been its staunchest
supporter, Wednesday suggested the vote be postponed, an
acknowledgment that it would probably fail to win the 60 votes
needed to cut off a a filibuster or extended debate by its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The current version of the bill is the product of a fragile
compromise between Senate Republicans, the White House and
Rockefeller who commands a crucial handful of Democratic votes.

 By JANNY SCOTT AND GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tina Brown, the Oxford-educated and Fleet
Street-trained magazine editor who for better or worse pulled The
New Yorker into the late 20th century, announced Wednesday that she
will resign as editor to start a company affiliated with Miramax
Films that will publish a new monthly magazine, publish books and
produce films and television programming.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's announcement came after months of rumors of growing
tension between her and Conde Nast Publications, which owns The New
Yorker, over the company's attempts to make the magazine less
unprofitable. Although it won nearly two dozen major awards during
Ms. Brown's six-year tenure and newsstand sales rose 145 percent,
it lost $11 million last year and Fortune magazine reported this
week that it had lost $175 million in its years of ownership by
Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Harvey Weinstein, a co-chairman of
Miramax, said he approached Ms. Brown about the new venture just
one month ago after reading newspaper reports that her contract
with Conde Nast was expiring. Ms. Brown then introduced Weinstein
to Ronald Galotti, who is the publisher of Vogue magazine who had
worked with Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair. Galotti will leave Vogue,
which is also owned by Conde Nast, to be Ms. Brown's partner in the
new venture.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Andrea Kaplan, said a successor would
be named for both positions shortly.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for show business, Ms. Brown transformed The New
Yorker from a venerated but antiquated museum piece into a kind of
news magazine of the power elite. Her resignation, effective Aug.
1, offers S.I. Newhouse Jr., who owns Conde Nast, the chance once
again to reshape the identity of The New Yorker, which more than
most magazines has reflected the particular intelligence and
idiosyncracies of its top editors, from Harold Ross and William
Shawn to Ms. Brown. But it remains unclear whether it will ever be
possible to make The New Yorker both a home for the kind of
high-quality literary journalism and humor that made it famous and
a ``profit center'' for Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has had only four editors in its nearly 75-year
history. Members of the staff said they were stunned and upset by
the news, which Ms. Brown delivered shortly after 10 a.m. to a
small group of writers and editors she had summoned to a meeting
that she had billed as a discussion of upcoming issues.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Brown, she and Galotti will now embark upon the
seemingly risky adventure of trying to create the kind of so-called
synergy that has become a buzzword in media and entertainment
circles _ in this case, inventing a magazine from scratch to dig up
the kind of stories that might then be turned into movies and
television specials that Miramax, which is owned by Disney, would
have the capacity to help package, circulate and promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be the guinea pig of synergy,'' said Peter Kaplan,
editor of The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old daughter of George Hambley Brown, the British
movie producer who produced the first Agatha Christie mystery
films, and Bettina Iris Mary Brown, Laurence Olivier's press agent
who later became a gossip columnist for a magazine for expatriates
in Spain, Ms. Brown made her name in the early 1980s when she
rejuvenated the stodgy British society monthly, the Tatler, making
it slick and trendy and quadrupling its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   She went from there to editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair in 1984,
where again she nearly quadrupled its circulation in just five
years, putting celebrities on the cover, hiring photographers like
Richard Avedon and doubling or tripling what writers were paid.
Over the past six years, she has introduced many of the same
principles to The New Yorker, raising its circulation from 659,000
in late 1992 to 808,000 in the last half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Ms. Brown revolutionized the image and the soul
of the magazine. She turned its focus from New York City to the
country's three power centers _ New York City, Washington and Los
Angeles. She made it topical in ways it had seemed to pride itself
on never being. Its covers became glitzy and willfully provocative;
its voice became more than occasionally glib. People talked about
it constantly, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Ms. Brown introduced a new stable of widely
admired writers to The New Yorker, including David Remnick, Louis
Menand, Anthony Lane and Henry Louis Gates. The magazine's coverage
of the war in Rwanda, by Philip Gourevitch, was highly praised. At
the same time, she enlisted Roseanne Barr as a guest editor of a
special issue on women, ran a profile of a dominatrix by Paul
Theroux, and invited Dick Morris to a cozy breakfast with reporters
and advertisers alike two weeks after a sex scandal forced him to
resign as an advisor to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went too far sometimes,'' said Michael Kinsley, editor of
the online magazine Slate, who formerly edited The New Republic and
who credited Ms. Brown Wednesday with making The New Yorker what he
called the most exciting magazine in America. ``But if you're
afraid of going too far, you don't go far enough. She takes risks.
Sometimes they're embarrassments but they're a price worth
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few months, rumors spread that Ms. Brown and
Conde Nast were increasingly unhappy with each other. Ms. Brown was
said to be displeased by a decision to draw The New Yorker under
the corporate umbrella of Conde Nast and to sell its advertising
pages in packages with pages for other Conde Nast publications. She
had also objected unsuccessfully to a plan by Conde Nast to move
The New Yorker out of its home on West 43rd Street into a new Conde
Nast edifice in Times Square, along with all of the other Conde
Nast magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Brown was widely said to be dissatisfied with
the president of The New Yorker, Tom Florio. But when he was
suddenly replaced at the start of Memorial Day weekend, Ms. Brown
was not consulted on his successor. She was given just one day's
advance notice that the job would be filled by David Carey of Conde
Nast House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Ms. Brown and Weinstein, who is 46,
said they first discussed the subject of so-called new media
ventures on the Miramax plane flying back from a conference
co-sponsored by The New Yorker and Disney last fall. But Weinstein
said he did not formally approach Ms. Brown about the undertaking
announced Wednesday until a month ago.

EUROPEANS PROPOSE LIMITS ON BRITISH AIRWAYS-AMERICAN PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two years after American Airlines and British Airways
PLC announced an alliance that would dominate air traffic across
the Atlantic, European regulators proposed preliminary conditions
Wednesday that appeared to clear the the way for its approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the European Commission, which represents 15
countries, angered UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, Lufthansa and
Scandinavian Air System by proposing retroactive restrictions on
their alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's moves sharpened simmering tensions between the
European Commission and the Clinton administration as well as
between the commission and its own member states concerning
international aviation competition at a time when an increasing
number of the world's airlines have entered into cross-border
alliances that have received exemptions from U.S. antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships are seen as the only way for international
airlines to provide global service because of regulations that
limit the rights of carriers to operate outside their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's proposed conditions would require American, a
unit of the AMR Corp., and British Airways to give up rights to 267
weekly landings and takeoffs at London's two principal airports,
Heathrow and Gatwick, without receiving any compensation. They
would also require United, Lufthansa and SAS to give up 108 of
these so-called slots at airports in Frankfurt and Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commission would also force the carriers to
reduce their flights for six months on certain routes that they now
dominate in order to give competitors a chance to establish
themselves. That proposal is directly at odds with the approach
taken by American regulators, who have already approved three
international alliances since 1993, including the
United-Lufthansa-SAS link.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at American and British Airways raised objections to
the commission proposals but said they were generally encouraged
because they were now convinced that their partnership, which has
been suspended in regulatory limbo since June 1996, would finally
move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very positive news,'' said Robert Ayling, the British
Airways chief executive. ``I am now more hopeful than I was before
that we will get a deal on acceptable terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at United reacted more harshly, accusing the
commission of using international airlines as pawns in a turf
battle with its member states. United filed a complaint with the
U.S. Transportation Department on Wednesday contending that the
commission's recommendations violated bilateral aviation treaties
between the United States and various European countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the commission is proposing to do is inject itself into a
bilateral process between sovereign nations,'' said Cyril Murphy,
United's vice president for international and regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The commission stressed that its recommendations were
preliminary. It will make a final decision following a month of
public comment on the proposals. After that, the antitrust
authorities in each European country will make the final
determinations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though it is not clear whether these competition officials are
obliged to accept the commission's recommendations, it appears
likely that they will. Karel van Miert, who announced Wednesday's
proposals and is head of the commission's competition directorate,
said that he was cooperating very closely with British regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Beckett, Britain's Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, said Wednesday that she expected to approve the
American-British Airways alliance in the fall, but she also said
she would require the airlines to give up landing rights at
London's two airports.
</P>
<P>
   Several other hurdles remain. The alliance must also receive
approval from the U.S. Transportation Department, which has said it
will not give its blessing until a new, liberalized aviation treaty
is signed between the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and London now have one of the most restrictive
aviation treaties in the world. Only two American carriers _ United
and American _ are allowed to fly into Heathrow, which is the
busiest airport in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For years, British officials have stubbornly refused to
negotiate a more liberal, so-called open skies agreement. The
American-British Airways alliance has apparently given Washington
the leverage it needed to bring London to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But as eager as other American carriers like Delta Air Lines,
Continental Airlines, U S Airways, and Trans World Airlines are to
get into Heathrow, they are also worried about being able to
compete with the American-British Airways alliance. Together, the
two airlines would control 58 percent of the flights between the
United States and London and 42 percent of the slots at Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   In May, an advisory opinion presented to the Transportation
Department by the Justice Department's antitrust division
recommended that American and British Airways be forced to give up
336 weekly slots. Even then, the Justice Department study
concluded, there were still serious concerns that the alliance
would do more harm than good to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines, including Delta, Continental and the Virgin
Group P.L.C.'s Virgin Atlantic, criticized the commission's
proposals as being too weak. ``The proposed remedy will do little
to stop A.A. and B.A. from dominating trans-Atlantic service to
Heathrow,'' Scott Yohe, Delta's senior vice president for
government affairs, said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines said they would lobby Washington strongly to
extract more concessions from American and British Airways. But
analysts said it was unlikely that the Transportation Department
would scuttle the alliance, because of its eagerness to reach an
open-skies accord with London.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has already reached open-skies agreements with 12
countries in Europe. The agreements upset van Miert because they
allow American carriers to fly freely to individual European
countries but do not allow European carriers to compete with each
other across the Atlantic. But European Union member states like
Britain and Germany have declined to give the commission the
authority to negotiate a Europe-wide aviation pact with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert said Wednesday that later this year the commission
would release proposed conditions on three other airline alliances
between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; Delta,
Swissair A.G., Sabena S.A., and Austrian Airlines, and Air France
and Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy of United said that the commission was deliberately
violating Washington's open-skies treaties in order to force
European governments to give it the negotiating authority it seeks.

INDONESIANS VISIT U.S. SEEKING HELP WITH DEBT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Indonesia economy worsens, government
officials embarked Wednesday on a campaign aimed at persuading
international lenders to repackage up to $9 billion of debt.
</P>
<P>
   An International Monetary Fund official said he was confident
that the fund would release about $1 billion in aid to the country
next week, but it is uncertain whether other lenders and investors
will display the same faith in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is in worse condition than it was in April,'' said
Finance Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, after meeting with bankers
in New York on Wednesday. ``Our main concern now is to stabilize
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar said Indonesia planned to keep interest rates high to
combat inflation and would allow the country's weakest banks to
fail as resources were concentrated on a handful of strong banks.
He said Indonesia would also continue to liberalize its social
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia has been portrayed as an outcast country because of
our legal system and human rights issues,'' Ginandjar said. ``We
are embarking on a new era that we hope will cause the Western
people and the Western media to look more favorably on us.''
</P>
<P>
   These are dire times for Indonesia. The damage wrought by the
collapse of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has been so severe
that a senior World Bank official said Tuesday that Indonesia faced
an economic crisis unparalleled in the post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia expects its economy to contract about 13 percent this
year _ the first time the economy has shrunk since 1963.
Automobile, electronics and construction output slid in the first
half of the year, all of Indonesia's airlines are bankrupt and
roughly 80 percent of flights to the country have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In starker, more human terms, the World Bank forecasts that 50
million of Indonesia's 200 million people could fall below the
poverty line by the end of the year. Government officials
acknowledged a widespread concern about people dying from
starvation. A severe drought is causing added pain in various parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the World Bank said riots had disrupted food
distribution networks, Ginandjar said the government had a
``distribution system that is independent'' of routes disrupted by
riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not the supply but the buying power,''
Ginandjar said, adding that the country had a program akin to food
stamps that it would use to support those unable to purchase food.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar was at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York to lobby
international lenders to reschedule a portion of about $64 billion
to $66 billion in debt owed by Indonesian corporations. The
lobbying effort will continue to Washington, and on to Frankfurt,
Paris, Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore, in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government also has $54 billion to $55 billion in
debt, but that is not a subject of the current negotiations.
Ginandjar said there were ``no problems'' with the government debt
but that Indonesia remained open to various ways of restructuring
the debt by renegotiating the interest rate or other terms.
</P>
<P>
   While Indonesian ministers and advisers were upbeat about
repackaging the private-sector debt, they face a tough challenge
convincing lenders and investors that the country can overcome its
economic challenges. Investors have cooled to a similar debt
repackaging recently undertaken by South Korea, where the economy,
while troubled, is considered to have stronger prospects than
Indonesia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wishes that things were better, but people are
realistic,'' said Mark Walker, a lawyer with the New York firm of
Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton, who is advising the Indonesian
government. ``I sense that people understand why this program and
why this proposal make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar said Indonesia ``has a fair chance'' of getting the
battered rupiah, which has been trading recently in a range of
14,000 to 14,500 to the dollar, down to about 10,000 to the dollar
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He also was optimistic that free elections would be held by
December 1999 and offered praise for the new government of
President B.J. Habibie, who has been struggling to assert his
authority despite calls for an early election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ginandjar is considered an ambitious man with his own
designs on the Indonesian presidency, he said Habibie had ``done
quite a bit in eight weeks,'' citing Habibie's acceptance of labor
unions and the freeing of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar said elections should not be held any sooner than the
end of next year. ``To be fair to the new parties, we need to give
them time to organize,'' he said.

<P>
   DEMRE, Turkey _ The slogan of this pretty town on Turkey's
magnificent Mediterranean coast might be: ``Catering to Cults and
Religions for More Than 2,000 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Demre has been a center for pagans, early Christians and modern
Eastern Orthodox denominations. Today it attracts throngs of
camera-toting pilgrims from one of the most powerful cults of all
time, the one that worships consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of ancient miracles, grave robbers, dervishes and
disappearing bones give this place an aura of romance and mystery.
Combined with political and religious debates that have
not-so-subtle modern implications, they make Demre a textbook in
mass psychology.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-Christian times, Hellenic tribes who lived in the
surrounding mountains built a temple here where they prayed and
made sacrifices to Artemis and Apollo. The temple was destroyed in
an earthquake in the second century A.D., a cataclysm that local
Christians took as Jehovah's retribution on those who refused to
embrace monotheism.
</P>
<P>
   Christians built a church on the site of the ruined temple, and
in the fourth century a local holy man named Nicholas became its
bishop. He was renowned for good deeds, among them throwing a purse
full of gold coins in the window of a home where three impoverished
sisters lived. The sisters had decided that two of them would sell
the third into slavery so the first two could afford dowries, and
when Nicholas overheard their desperate plan through an open
window, he resolved to help them anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas is also said to have carried a sack full of gifts for
children through the streets of Demre, then known as Myra, on the
December night before the birth of Jesus was celebrated. For this
he became the prototype of Santa Claus, although he is not known
ever to have worn a red suit, descended a chimney or laid eyes on a
reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   After Nicholas died in 323, his priests buried him in an
elaborate marble sarcophagus that they periodically filled with
fragrant oil. The oil dripped through cavities in the sarcophagus,
and priests did a lucrative business selling vials of it to
pilgrims who believed the oil had miraculous powers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 years after Nicholas died, his skeleton was stolen by
Italian merchants. A guide at the site, asked by a recent visitor
if the theft was motivated by a desire to take the mystic powers to
the seat of the Roman church, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he said. ``They saw how much money could be
made with the bones and decided to take them home to try the same
scam there.''
</P>
<P>
   With no bones to serve as a drawing card, Nicholas' church fell
into disrepair and was ultimately lost to history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century Czar Nicholas I of Russia, determined to
resurrect the memory of his namesake, commissioned an expedition
that succeeded in locating and excavating what remained of it,
including mosaic floors, several fading frescoes and the holy
sarcophagus, in which giggling children now stand dozens of times a
day so their parents can take snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   After the Greeks living here left this region in a population
exchange with the Turks that followed the fall of the Ottoman
Empire in the aftermath of World War I, no Christians remained to
take care of the resurrected church. Demre sank back into its
former status as a remote though picturesque village known mainly
for its annual camel-fighting tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s local businessmen guessed that the legend of Santa
Claus might be Demre's ticket back to prosperity. Since then the
Turkish government has claimed Nicholas _ and by extension Santa _
as its own, issuing a stamp in his honor and sponsoring conferences
here to honor his memory. In 1981 a statue of him, looking
remarkably like the popular image of Santa minus the potbelly, was
built in front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the chairman of the Saint Nicholas Foundation in
nearby Antalya, Muammer Karabulut, went so far as to claim that
Nicholas was ``an Anatolian dervish.'' This seemed odd since
dervishes are usually associated with Islam, a religion that did
not come into existence until several centuries after Nicholas
died.
</P>
<P>
   Today Karabulut and others are looking for ways to attract
tourists to Demre in 2000, when ``faith tourism'' is expected to
bring throngs of visitors to early Christian sites in this part of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This enrages some Greeks and others who consider it cynical for
Turkish Muslims to profit from the legacy of a Christian bishop
who, according to a book sold at souvenir stands here, was so pure
that he ``used to pray day and night, and stayed away from
gatherings of women.''

   HARLINGEN, Texas _ As the Rio Grande Valley grappled with a
killing spree that left five people dead, the body of a rookie U.S.
Border Patrol agent was escorted home to San Antonio Wednesday by a
motorcade of fellow law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   With emergency lights flashing and American flags flapping, a
procession of six patrol vehicles closed ranks around a hearse
carrying the body of Ricardo Salinas for the 220-mile journey to
San Antonio, where he is to be buried Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a funeral home here, 15 uniformed Border Patrol agents
snapped to attention as six others loaded a blue-steel coffin into
the hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's body was dressed the same dress uniform the young man
wore when he graduated from the Border Patrol academy in January.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, 24, and fellow agent Susan Rodriguez, 28, were killed
in a hail of automatic weapon fire Tuesday as they helped sheriff's
deputies track a suspect in a double murder near San Benito, south
of here.
</P>
<P>
   The fallen agents had responded to a call for help from the
Cameron County Sheriff's Department, said John Brinning, head of
the patrol's Harlingen station.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we accepted our badge, we agreed to not just protect our
borders, but back up other law enforcement agencies,'' Brinning
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may have thought this was a mundane job. This may
cause some people to choose a new vocation,'' said Brinning, who
estimated 50 percent of his officers have been on the job less than
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Border Patrol's 74 years, 81 agents have been killed in
the line of duty. Rodriguez was the first women agent slain in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors were on hand at the patrol headquarters here
Wednesday, and many agents wore strips of black tape over their
badges in memory of the fallen officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real hard time for all of us; we've got to deal with
this in our own way,'' supervisor Douglas Spelman told agents at a
muster before sunrise. ``We must go on. They'd insist we go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Rodriguez, who was a training officer, had requested
that if they died in the line of duty that they be buried in their
dress uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reed, regional director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which oversees the Border Patrol, said the
attack had prompted the agency to re-evaluate safety procedures at
the national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to look at this from a training point of view. We
have to be vigilant about this. We cannot become complacent,'' Reed
said in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications the agents had violated safety
regulations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both agents died with their guns in their holsters, but
officials said they stood no chance when Ernest Moore, 25, walked
out of a cornfield and fired as many as 100 rounds from an
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Other deputies and agents returned fire, hitting Moore as many
as a dozen times. Moore, who was the son of a Harlingen police
officer and brother of a San Benito officer, later died of his
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio has said Moore first killed
Margarita Flores, 52, and her daughter, Dalia Morin, 31, at their
home in Rio Hondo around 5 a.m. Tuesday. The sheriff said Moore was
in a jealous rage and hunting for his ex-girlfriend, who was
staying there but who hid during the shooting and was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Also wounded was Flores's son, Dan Morin, 22, who remained in
critical condition Wednesday at a hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   Moore fled the scene and was pursued by the police to a rural
area of San Benito. The Border Patrol agents responded to calls for
assistance from the officers who had chased Moore.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Moore ambushed Susan Rodriguez and Salinas,
the sheriff and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was shot in the head and died instantly. Rodriguez was
hit in the neck and was airlifted to a local hospital where she
died.
</P>
<P>
   The two were working an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift and could have
headed home instead of responding to the call for assistance,
officials said. Instead, they joined in the hunt for Moore and were
shot at 7:19 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officers described a chaotic situation in which Moore was
mortally wounded and in which officers _ who thought at least two
other gunmen were with him _ tried to keep their heads down while
attempting to reach the two Border Patrol agents, Moore and Cameron
County Deputy Sheriff Raul Rodriguez, 32, who was critically
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had no other suspects in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be held Friday in San Antonio for Salinas. A
funeral mass for Rodriguez will be here at Queen of Peace Catholic
Church, and burial will be in her native Tennessee.

BRITAIN'S NEW MILITARY LOOK: LEANER AND MORE FLEXIBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Wednesday that it was reshaping its armed
forces to cut costs and meet the increasing need for speedy and
flexible deployment to trouble spots abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The plans, which will trim $1.1 billion from the current $36
billion defense budget over the next three years, are designed for
a world in which U.N. and NATO peacekeeping challenges are
replacing cold-war confrontations as the model military engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Britain will reduce its number of reserve troops and cut
materiel like tanks, warplanes and open-ocean submarines. It will
strengthen its rapid reaction forces with two new super-carriers,
attack helicopters, amphibious machinery and Harrier jump jets. The
military will buy four long-range transport planes and four
roll-on, roll-off container ships to move personnel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The moves take into account the disappearance of the threat of
Soviet invasion as Europe's principal concern and the emergence of
crises like the Persian Gulf war and the unrest in Bosnia, where
Britain has been the United States' closest and most militarily
dependable ally.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Segal, director of studies at the International Institute
of Strategic Studies in London, said that Wednesday's announcement
``will insure, at least for a generation, that Britain will rank
second only to the United States in deployable modern military
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the reforms to the House of Commons Wednesday
afternoon, Defense Secretary George Robertson said the army, navy
and air force would be developing ways to join together hastily to
act as peacekeepers and front-line troops. ``In the post-Cold War
world we must be prepared to go to the crisis, rather than have the
crisis come to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beaver of Jane's Defense Weekly said the strategic review
was the most important in Britain in 30 years and answered demands
that had become more insistent. ``It means if there is a problem in
Kosovo which brews up next week,'' he said, ``it won't take a month
to organize the dispatch of forces there, and the armed forces will
have the capability to put people in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan also maintains Britain's nuclear deterrent, a
commitment that held no surprise but served as a reminder of how
far the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair has moved from its
traditions. During its years out of power in the 1970s and 1980s,
leaders of its left wing campaigned for nuclear disarmament by
Britain and called for the country's Trident submarines to be
brought ashore. Wednesday, Robertson said the Tridents with their
ballistic missiles would remain on patrol, though the overall
number of operationally available nuclear warheads would be reduced
from 300 to 200.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was portrayed as having effectively resisted demands
for greater cuts by Treasury Minister Gordon Brown, who is eager to
direct more spending at the Labor government's priorities of health
and education. But the opposition Conservatives complained that the
cuts were too severe. ``These cuts are a huge blow to our forces,
which have an increasingly demanding job to do in an increasingly
dangerous world,'' said John Maples, the Tory spokesman on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The army is to be restructured to improve its ability to train
for, mount and sustain distant operations, with two deployable
divisions _ one in Britain and the other in Germany, where Britain
has 22,000 troops stationed. Robertson also reaffirmed Britain's
commitment to buy 232 Eurofighters, the standardized European-built
combat plane. &QL;

ALLEN DEAL MAY MAKE INVESTOR DREAMWORKS' TOP SHAREHOLDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ High-tech investor Paul Allen disclosed he has
boosted his investment in DreamWorks SKG in a deal that could make
him the biggest shareholder in the fledgling studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks has been a good investment to date,'' said Susan
Pierson, a spokeswoman for Allen's Vulcan Ventures who declined
Wednesday to offer specifics of the deal. ``This demonstrates his
faith in the company, the partners and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, founded by Hollywood moguls Steven Spielberg,
Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen in 1994, has achieved modest
returns so far from its movies, TV shows and music. Its best
results have come from co-financing ``Deep Impact'' with Paramount
and prospects look solid for its upcoming movies: ``Small
Soldiers,'' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Antz'' and ``Prince of
Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., is a major
vote of confidence for DreamWorks, according to analyst Kevin
Skislock of L.H. Friend, Weinress, Presson &AMP; Frankson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity for a long-term investment,''
he said. ``There's no question in my mind that DreamWorks will make
it and become one of the most successful studios early in the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Skislock cited Spielberg's track record (``Jaws,'' ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark,'' ``E.T.,'' ``Jurassic Park,'' ``Schindler's List'')
and Katzenberg's (``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin,'' ``The Lion
King'') as the key reasons why DreamWorks will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Steven has a phenomenal record in live-action
and Jeffrey is the main reason why Disney's formula for animation
worked so well,'' Skislock said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson confirmed that Allen has increased his stake above the
original 18 percent, purchased in 1995 for $500 million, but gave
no details. However, South Korean conglomerate Cheil Jedang Corp.
has been widely reported as being willing to sell part of its 11
percent ownership, obtained in 1995 for $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, owner of the Portland Trailblazers basketball team and
backer of a variety of high-tech ventures, has been active in
DreamWorks and had said previously he wanted to boost his stake.
``If they'd sell me more, I'd buy it in an instant,'' he told
Business Week recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the
deal, reported Wednesday that the deal calls for Allen to buy more
than half of Cheil's stake for $160 million, giving him a stake of
24 percent. The three founders continue to hold 22 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, Hollywood's first new studio in 65 years, is
estimated to have spent about half of the $2.7 billion it raised in
debt and equity. It currently employs about 1,600 people and
recently opened an animation studio in suburban Glendale, modeled
after an Italian village. But its plans to build a studio campus in
Marina del Rey are several years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, in a move to take away thunder from Disney-Pixar's
computer-animated ``A Bug's Life,'' recently moved up the opening
date of ``Antz'' five months to Oct. 2. ``A Bug's Life'' arrives
seven weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed that DreamWorks has that much confidence
and it shows that we're entering a new golden age of animation with
Disney and DreamWorks going toe-to-toe,'' Skislock said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tina Brown, the Oxford-educated and Fleet
Street-trained magazine editor who for better or worse pulled The
New Yorker into the late 20th century, announced Wednesday that she
will resign as editor to start a company affiliated with Miramax
Films that will publish a new monthly magazine, publish books and
produce films and television programming.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's announcement came after months of rumors of growing
tension between her and Conde Nast Publications, which owns The New
Yorker, over the company's attempts to make the magazine less
unprofitable. Although it won nearly two dozen major awards during
Ms. Brown's six-year tenure and newsstand sales rose 145 percent,
it lost $11 million last year and Fortune magazine reported this
week that it had lost $175 million in its years of ownership by
Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Harvey Weinstein, a co-chairman of
Miramax, said he approached Ms. Brown about the new venture just
one month ago after reading newspaper reports that her contract
with Conde Nast was expiring. Ms. Brown then introduced Weinstein
to Ronald Galotti, who is the publisher of Vogue magazine who had
worked with Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair. Galotti will leave Vogue,
which is also owned by Conde Nast, to be Ms. Brown's partner in the
new venture.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Andrea Kaplan, said a successor would
be named for both positions shortly.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for show business, Ms. Brown transformed The New
Yorker from a venerated but antiquated museum piece into a kind of
news magazine of the power elite. Her resignation, effective Aug.
1, offers S.I. Newhouse Jr., who owns Conde Nast, the chance once
again to reshape the identity of The New Yorker, which more than
most magazines has reflected the particular intelligence and
idiosyncracies of its top editors, from Harold Ross and William
Shawn to Ms. Brown. But it remains unclear whether it will ever be
possible to make The New Yorker both a home for the kind of
high-quality literary journalism and humor that made it famous and
a ``profit center'' for Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has had only four editors in its nearly 75-year
history. Members of the staff said they were stunned and upset by
the news, which Ms. Brown delivered shortly after 10 a.m. to a
small group of writers and editors she had summoned to a meeting
that she had billed as a discussion of upcoming issues.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Brown, she and Galotti will now embark upon the
seemingly risky adventure of trying to create the kind of so-called
synergy that has become a buzzword in media and entertainment
circles _ in this case, inventing a magazine from scratch to dig up
the kind of stories that might then be turned into movies and
television specials that Miramax, which is owned by Disney, would
have the capacity to help package, circulate and promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be the guinea pig of synergy,'' said Peter Kaplan,
editor of The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old daughter of George Hambley Brown, the British
movie producer who produced the first Agatha Christie mystery
films, and Bettina Iris Mary Brown, Laurence Olivier's press agent
who later became a gossip columnist for a magazine for expatriates
in Spain, Ms. Brown made her name in the early 1980s when she
rejuvenated the stodgy British society monthly, the Tatler, making
it slick and trendy and quadrupling its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   She went from there to editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair in 1984,
where again she nearly quadrupled its circulation in just five
years, putting celebrities on the cover, hiring photographers like
Richard Avedon and doubling or tripling what writers were paid.
Over the past six years, she has introduced many of the same
principles to The New Yorker, raising its circulation from 659,000
in late 1992 to 808,000 in the last half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Ms. Brown revolutionized the image and the soul
of the magazine. She turned its focus from New York City to the
country's three power centers _ New York City, Washington and Los
Angeles. She made it topical in ways it had seemed to pride itself
on never being. Its covers became glitzy and willfully provocative;
its voice became more than occasionally glib. People talked about
it constantly, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Ms. Brown introduced a new stable of widely
admired writers to The New Yorker, including David Remnick, Louis
Menand, Anthony Lane and Henry Louis Gates. The magazine's coverage
of the war in Rwanda, by Philip Gourevitch, was highly praised. At
the same time, she enlisted Roseanne Barr as a guest editor of a
special issue on women, ran a profile of a dominatrix by Paul
Theroux, and invited Dick Morris to a cozy breakfast with reporters
and advertisers alike two weeks after a sex scandal forced him to
resign as an advisor to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went too far sometimes,'' said Michael Kinsley, editor of
the online magazine Slate, who formerly edited The New Republic and
who credited Ms. Brown Wednesday with making The New Yorker what he
called the most exciting magazine in America. ``But if you're
afraid of going too far, you don't go far enough. She takes risks.
Sometimes they're embarrassments but they're a price worth
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few months, rumors spread that Ms. Brown and
Conde Nast were increasingly unhappy with each other. Ms. Brown was
said to be displeased by a decision to draw The New Yorker under
the corporate umbrella of Conde Nast and to sell its advertising
pages in packages with pages for other Conde Nast publications. She
had also objected unsuccessfully to a plan by Conde Nast to move
The New Yorker out of its home on West 43rd Street into a new Conde
Nast edifice in Times Square, along with all of the other Conde
Nast magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Brown was widely said to be dissatisfied with
the president of The New Yorker, Tom Florio. But when he was
suddenly replaced at the start of Memorial Day weekend, Ms. Brown
was not consulted on his successor. She was given just one day's
advance notice that the job would be filled by David Carey of Conde
Nast House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Ms. Brown and Weinstein, who is 46,
said they first discussed the subject of so-called new media
ventures on the Miramax plane flying back from a conference
co-sponsored by The New Yorker and Disney last fall. But Weinstein
said he did not formally approach Ms. Brown about the undertaking
announced Wednesday until a month ago.

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she then brought in Galotti, 48, who was
publisher of Vanity Fair during the last two years of Ms. Brown's
tenure there. He had left abruptly for a job at Esquire in 1993
amid rumors that Newhouse had forced him out. Galotti, who is said
to have been the model for the bombastic, sex-machine character
called Big in Candace Bushnell's column and now television series
``Sex and the City,'' had also been founding publisher of Conde
Nast Traveller when Ms. Brown's husband, Harry Evans, launched it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weinstein, he and Ms. Brown reached an agreement on
the deal at 5 p.m. Tuesday. He said he and Galotti came to terms at
2:30 a.m. Wednesday. Ms. Brown, who had eaten lunch with Newhouse
on Monday without ever discussing her possible plans, said
Wednesday that she had informed Newhouse of her resignation at 9
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Brown and Galotti said that what attracted them most
about the offer, and what made it worth quitting their jobs for,
was the prospect of owning the company they would create. ``It is
the quintessential enticement that Harvey put before us,'' Galotti
said. Without that, they suggested, they would not have chosen to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Neither they nor Weinstein offered many details of the proposed
company, which is to be based in New York. Ms. Brown will be
chairman and Galotti will be president. Weinstein said the company
would be separate from Miramax but would operate like a division,
feeding projects to Miramax. The magazine, which Ms. Brown would
describe only with adjectives like ``upscale, contemporary,
sophisticated,'' is to make its debut in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Conde Nast announced that Richard Beckman,
publisher of GQ, would replace Galotti at Vogue. Andrea Kaplan, a
vice president for corporate communications at Conde Nast, said
Newhouse would make no statement on Ms. Brown's departure but that
her successor would be named shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Within Conde Nast itself, one conceivable candidate might be
Graydon Carter, Ms. Brown's successor at the highly profitable
Vanity Fair. But staff members said Wednesday that Carter said he
was not Ms. Brown's replacement. Another rumored possibility might
be Kurt Andersen, who edited New York magazine and currently writes
a column called ``The Culture Industry'' for The New Yorker. He
said Wednesday night that he had not been approached.
</P>
<P>
   Other names being bandied about on the grapevine Wednesday
ranged from Remnick to Kinsley. ``Well, no one's called me,''
Kinsley said cheerfully, when asked if he was in the running. It
seemed at least conceivable, too, that Newhouse might have been
caught by surprise and not yet have a successor or a vision for the
magazine's future in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the staff of The New Yorker insisted Wednesday
that Newhouse had tried hard to convince Ms. Brown to sign a
five-year contract; they speculated that she had finally grown fed
up with dealing with Conde Nast. Admirers of Ms. Brown described
her departure as a terrible loss to the magazine; even those with
more complicated feelings about Ms. Brown were said to have never
wanted her to leave, for fear of getting something worse. &QL;

U.S. AWAITS NIGERIAN'S AUTOPSY RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NIGERIA.) 
(bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States said Wednesday that it would
await the results of the autopsy of the body of Nigeria's most
prominent political prisoner, Moshood K.O. Abiola, before it
considers resuming its high-level diplomatic efforts to bring
democracy to the country.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden death of Abiola, who was imprisoned in 1994 after
apparently winning the democratic presidential election the year
before, threw U.S. policy toward Nigeria into confusion and
generated debates among critics of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   It also overshadowed what State Department officials described
as an otherwise successful mission to Nigeria this week by a
delegation of senior U.S. diplomats who pressed the Nigerian junta
for democratic reforms and for the release of political prisoners,
especially Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that continued and high-level contacts can take
place, but I think we all need to wait and see how this autopsy
comes out,'' said Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, who was
meeting with Abiola in a government guest house in Abuja, the
Nigerian capital, when he fell ill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, in a telephone interview from London, where he
stopped en route home to Washington, said Wednesday that he found
Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, to be receptive to
U.S. demands for movement toward democratic civilian rule there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were receptive, particularly the head of state,''
Pickering said, referring to the general. ``He committed himself to
professionalize the military and get it back to its professional
role in Nigeria _ clear and direct code words for getting the
military out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect they are going to release political prisoners,'' said
Pickering, a former ambassador to Nigeria. ``It was very clear to
me that they were prepared to release Abiola.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week the Nigerian government told Kofi Annan, secretary
general of the United Nations, that all political prisoners,
including Abiola, would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said that he had been impressed by the willingness of
Nigerian officials to conduct an autopsy with outside doctors
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Nigerian government doctor in attendance who said
that everybody must insist on an autopsy,'' he said. ``I think this
autopsy will be done in a way that clearly protects the integrity
of the scientific process.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said that while the timing of the death was
extraordinary _ the U.S. diplomat traveled with Abiola to a nearby
hospital and watched as doctors tried to revive him _ the
60-year-old multimillionare businessman was known to be in poor
health after four years' of often brutal imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some record of hypertension,'' Pickering said. ``Both
of his legs were swollen and he showed them to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden death of Abiola prompted calls Wednesday from human
rights organizations, African scholars and others with an interest
in Nigeria for a reappraisal of U.S. policy toward the Nigerian
junta.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Carrington, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Nigeria
from 1993 until last fall, said in an interview that he believed
the Clinton administration ``has been generally tiptoeing around
too much'' and should have been tougher in threatening to impose
economic sanctions against the country's military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while serving in Nigeria, he was repeatedly
rebuffed by the State Department when he recommended that the
United States consider freezing the assets of corrupt leaders of
the Nigerian army, who are believed to have stashed millions of
dollars in U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   He said the State Department's reluctance to offend the junta
had less to do with oil _ Nigeria is fifth-largest supplier of
petroleum to the United States _ than with an institutional mindset
in the State Department that ``we should try to get along with the
established leadership in Nigeria and everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the default position for the State Department,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington, a lawyer who is now on a fellowship at Harvard
University, said that during his four years in Nigeria he had been
frustrated by the reluctance of the State Department to throw its
full support behind Abiola during his imprisonment, in part because
of long-standing rumors that Abiola was corrupt and somehow
involved in the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   The department's attitude towards Abiola, he said, was
shortsighted because it failed to recognize how his years in prison
had changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Abiola is that he underwent an epiphany once
he went into prison,'' he said. ``Nobody expected that he would
last more than a few months in prison. But he had opportunities to
come out and he turned them down. I think he grew substantially as
a real leader of the democratic movement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who is President
Clinton's special envoy to Africa, said he was ``stunned and
saddened'' by the news of Abiola's death, and that the United
States needed to demand the presence of independent medical experts
at the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he died arouses real suspicion,'' Jackson said.
``There are questions about whether his death was induced or
whether he was simply allowed to rot in prison. These questions are
unavoidable and should be addressed directly and frankly by the
Nigerian government. They subjected him to circumstances that were
increasingly inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   While condemning the Nigerian junta for its treatment of Abiola
and other dissidents, Jackson said the United States would now have
to step up its campaign to bring democracy to Nigeria, or risk the
violent fragmentation of a nation of 110 million people that is
torn by tribal and regional rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we cannot take a hands-off policy and a wait-and-see
policy,'' he said. ``The sheer size of Nigeria is such that we
should not move too slowly right now. If the tension exploded
there, it could be even more devastating than Rwanda. This is a
very, very delicate moment for Nigeria, perhaps the most tense
moment since its independence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton, who pointedly did not stop in Nigeria
during a recent African tour, should now seriously consider a visit
to Nigeria to encourage democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the president should visit Nigeria for the same
reasons he visited China _ visit not because it is democratic or
observes human rights, but because it doesn't,'' he said. &QL;

DEATH OF SEX OFFENDER TIED TO MEGAN'S LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif) (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Last Tuesday, in the two blocks around the
scruffy rooming house where Michael Allen Patton lived alone, the
police spread the word door to door in stark fliers: Patton was a
paroled sex offender with a 22-year history of assaults on women
and young girls, a neighbor who had served 13 years in state prison
for the worst sort of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Patton, a 42-year-old sign painter, was found
hanging by a rope tied to a redwood tree on the edge of this placid
town in the heart of Sonoma County's wine country, his discarded
bicycle nearby. Back in his room, across the street from a YMCA,
down the block from a middle school and close to a youth services
organization, investigators found a two-paragraph suicide note on
pocket notebook paper addressed to his sister, describing where his
body could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Patton was one of 1,600 people classified as high-risk, violent
sexual offenders statewide, with his record subject to public
dissemination under the provisions of California's year-old version
of Megan's law. He was one of 6 such offenders singled out by the
Santa Rosa Police Department last week in its first effort at
public notification. And while Patton's note made no mention of the
law or the disclosure, supporters and opponents of the law agreed
that the chain of events spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the inevitable consequence,'' said Elizabeth
Schroeder, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California and an authority on sex offender
notification laws. Ms. Schroeder said she believed that the case
was the first in the state in which a suicide followed public
notice. ``It was going to happen eventually,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials here expressed regret at Patton's death, but
they said that there was no indication of any vigilantism against
him and that they planned no change in their notification
procedures for the most serious offenders, those convicted of at
least two violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, local law agencies have wide flexibility in
handling notice about such people, while a total of 64,000
offenders' names are listed on a CD-ROM that is available for
public inspection in every county sheriff's office and some police
departments, but not otherwise widely distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed it, but there isn't anything we could've done
to prevent this as far as I can see,'' said Sgt. Ernesto Olivares,
supervisor of the Santa Rosa Police Department's sex crime and
family violence unit, which oversees the mandatory registration of
all 242 convicted sex offenders and public notice about the
high-risk ones in this city of 130,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we could've changed or can change,''
Olivares said. ``The intent of the law is to keep people informed
and aware of a potential threat in their neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   He said officers had only handed out the one-page fliers _ with
a color picture of the mustachioed, bespectacled Patton, who was 5
feet 5 inches tall and weighed 220 pounds _ to adults in person,
and did not leave them in mailboxes or under doors where children
might find them. Each flier was accompanied by a one-page cover
letter explaining the provisions of the law and warning of its
penalties for vigilantism, Olivares said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Patton's neighbors, Mike Lucas, a retired man on
disability who lives across the street with his wife, Patti, said
Patton could be seen walking in the neighborhood, unkempt _ ``like
a low-life,'' as Mrs. Lucas put it. The Lucases said that the
police flier had made them nervous but that they were glad to have
received it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that this pain caused him to take his life,'' Lucas
said. ``But I still want to know if there are violent people in my
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As states throughout the country rushed to pass sex-offender
notification laws after the murder of Megan Kanka by a convicted
offender in Hamilton Township, N.J., in 1994, civil liberties
groups warned that such efforts could drive convicted offenders
even further underground and make it impossible for them to find
jobs or put down roots in an effort to overcome their past.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakeland, Fla., man shot himself to death last year after the
Polk County Sheriff's Department ran an advertisement in The
Ledger, a Lakeland newspaper that is owned by The New York Times
Co., identifying him under Florida's notification law as a sexual
predator who had had oral sex with a 4-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we have to have a notion that punishment is
over,'' said Ms. Shroeder of the Civil Liberties Union. ``What
these public notification laws do is they essentially place a big
scarlet letter on someone's chest, that for the rest of this
person's life he will be publicly branded. The whole notion of
rehabilitation in this country has been lost, particularly for sex
offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials and legislators maintain that the
high recidivism rate among sex offenders justifies efforts to keep
their neighbors informed. And while disclosures of such offenders'
whereabouts have often prompted harassment and protests by
neighbors since the California law took effect 18 months ago, a
spokesman for State Attorney General Dan Lungren says his office
has yet to record a confirmed case of vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Attorney General Lungren has always maintained that Megan's
law provides a tremendous tool to the law-abiding public, to know
if there are convicted sexual criminals living among them in their
community,'' said the spokesman, Rob Stutzman. ``That public good
outweighs potential negatives that may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the law has been in force since last year, some cities
like Santa Rosa, 50 miles north of San Francisco, are just getting
up to speed on notifications, in part because of an effort to weed
out inaccuracies and outdated information on the state registry of
sex offenders. Before releasing the names of the six high-risk
offenders here, Olivares said, investigators visited each of the
men and explained what was happening. He said Patton had had no
particular reaction one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, The Press Democrat, which is also owned by
the Times Co., published Patton's name along with those of the five
other high-risk offenders, in an article about the police
notifications last week. The paper's managing editor, Robert
Swofford, said it had first adopted the policy last summer, when
the county sheriff's department issued its own notifications about
high-risk offenders living in unincorporated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we had to make the call, are we going to name
these people or not, and we made the decision that it's out
there,'' Swofford said, adding that the paper had tried to
interview all six men last week but that only two had agreed, and
Patton was not among them. ``When this one came around, we followed
the same practice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the paper quoted Pattie Davenport, who worked with
Patton at an unidentified sign company in nearby Petaluma, as
saying: ``They knocked the rug out from under him for something he
did 16 years ago. It wasn't fair. He was trying to live right.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said Patton's criminal record included
convictions dating to 1976 on charges of false imprisonment,
assault with intent to commit rape, rape by force or fear, oral
copulation with a child under 14 and unlawful sexual intercourse
with a child under 18. He was released from the California Men's
Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1995 after serving a 13-year sentence
for a 1982 conviction. His parole was to have expired next week.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown, executive director of the Sonoma County Family
YMCA, which is diagonally across the street from Mr. Patton's
rooming house, said that all of its programs for children took
place indoors or on gated playgrounds under close supervision, and
that it had not changed its practices in any way because of
Patton's presence in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had time to digest it,'' Brown said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Patton's death left more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a lot of assumptions about what he was
thinking,'' Olivares said. ``But only Mr. Patton knows, and he took
that with him.'' &QL;

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

   IRAN-BACKLASH _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's conservatives are fighting
back. A year after the election of the moderate but not powerful
President Mohammed Khatami, concerned fundamentalists have arrested
and impeached key supporters. The political climate seems to swing
daily between reform and backlash. The clash between Iran's two
cultures is as clear as the difference between two of its
provacative publications _ one preserving the past, the other
looking forward. At Shalamche magazine's storefront office, the
walls are covered in burlap, one corner is ringed with sandbags and
artilery shells are used for decoration. The young staff won't meet
with foreign journalists, but their magazine outlines their view
that Islamic values are under attack. Though the Iran-Iraq war is
over, Shalamche has a new target across town: The Jamaeh daily.
Jameah has become a symbol of Iran in transition. The daily, one of
more than 300 new publications since Khatami's election, pokes fun
at political leaders and prints long interviews with dissidents.
Its office is also staffed with young idealists, but it's in a
California-style villa. The wall in Jameah carries a
tongue-in-cheek staff petition asking editors why the swimming pool
is empty. But, Jamaeh has bigger problems than an empty pool.
Attacked in court by three conservative groups, the paper has been
ordered to close. We are moving from traditionalism to modernism,''
says the paper's editor Mashallah hamsolivin. Don't let this
newborn baby, the election, die now.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-IRAN _ TEHRAN, Iran _ These are nervous times in Tehran.
I could sense the difference from my last trip in December, when
reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing their
fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami. Now, reformers are channel surfing between World Cup
soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one
called and asked that I not tell anyone I was with them. These
days, hanging out with foreign journalists can be controversial,
especially if the evening in question included cassettes of Western
dance music. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign
finances, tobacco legislation and other bones of contention,
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a
fairly major initiative: that the research budget of the National
Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the top 10 research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.
The University of Texas, Eastern Carolina University and other
universitities around the country are also thrilled at the prospect
of easier access to what is already the largest pool of research
money in the world, by a factor of 10. Why is this idea suddenly so
popular? There are several theories, including the fact that
politicians sense that meaningful medical breakthroughs lie just
ahead and the aging of the politically powerful Baby Boomers, who
are now reaching the stage in life where their own health has
replaced earlier concerns. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1250)

<P>
   NEWBURY PARK, Calif. _ Semtech Corp. shares lost 28 percent of
their value Wednesday after the chip maker warned quarterly profits
will fall well below Wall Street's forecasts because of slack
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell 4 1/16 (one-sixteenth) to $10 3/8 (three-eights)
for its lowest close in more than 15 months. It has lost nearly
two-thirds of its value since Feb. 13, when it closed at $29 3/4
(three-fourths).
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arun Veerappan at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens cut his
rating to ``long-term attractive'' from ``buy'' but C.B. Lee of
Sutro &AMP; Co. issued a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Semtech, of Newbury Park in Ventura County northwest of Los
Angeles, announced late Tuesday that profit for its second quarter
ending Aug. 2 would fall 40 to 50 percent from first quarter
earnings of $4.7 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, due to slow
sales to personal-computer makers and to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Newbury Park-based company forecasted quarterly sales will
fall 15 percent from $29.5 million in the first quarter and plans
to take a $2.5 million pretax charge to reduce capacity and write
off assets.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with weak Asian demand have hurt most chip makers,
including leaders Intel and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Semtech makes analog and mixed-signal chips used in the

YANKEES' MURAL IS PAINTED IN DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees produced a handful of full-color snapshots for
history as they matched a 20th-century record by winning 61 of
their first 81 games. There was David Wells bounding off the mound
while watching the final out of his perfect game, Bernie Williams
launching an eighth-inning home run against Baltimore two days
later to cap a wild comeback, and the frightening fight that
erupted subsequently, the result of an ugly beanball incident.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the '98 Yankees, who will open the second half
of their season Thursday night in Tampa Bay, can be found in the
shadows of their mural, in moments often meaningless to victories
and defeats, moments that nonetheless have essential meaning and
illuminate the character of the team.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, in the final game of their three-game interleague
series, the Yankees and the Mets were tied at 1-1 in the bottom of
the ninth inning. The Mets had runners at first and third and one
out and the pinch-hitter Luis Lopez at the plate, and the Yankees
were playing their infielders and outfielders far in, in an effort
to cut off the potential tying run. Lopez drove a high fly to
right-center; off the bat, it was apparent it would be deep enough
for the runner at third, Carlos Baerga, to tag up and score, too
deep for Paul O'Neill, the right fielder, to throw out Baerga at
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders in this situation routinely ignore the ball and
begin jogging back to the dugout, an accepted practice. O'Neill
charged back, tracking the fly. ``You don't want to take anything
for granted,'' he said later. ``You never know what might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill caught the ball, whirled and fired back toward the
infield _ and it happened that the runner at first, Brian McRae,
hadn't bothered to tag up. Suddenly the relay went to first and the
umpires were saying it was a double play and that Baerga's run
didn't count and there would be a 10th inning. You never know what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the umpires conferred and ruled correctly that
Baerga's run counted and the Mets had won. But O'Neill, at the end
of a brutal two-week schedule of tough opponents and travel, having
gone nearly two months without a day off, had thrown the game into
temporary chaos with his determination. O'Neill's attitude,
teammate David Cone said, is pervasive throughout the Yankees'
clubhouse: Don't concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of us in here,'' said the reliever Mike Stanton,
``have played on winning teams at one time or another, and we know
what it takes. This is a team of a lot of good professionals, but
it's also a team with guys who love to play. O'Neill going back for
that ball, that's called playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players will have days of diminished concentration, and
in this way they are no different than bakers or farmers or
warehouse workers. Some nights they overlook details; they might
not be fully focused on an at-bat or a pitch. But the Yankees are
rabid in their attention to detail, in their concentration, and
they have developed the best sort of peer pressure: all of them
must keep up with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's competition not just with the opponent, but in this
clubhouse, too,'' Stanton said. ``Nobody wants to make the last
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, the defector from Cuba who ascended to the
major leagues last month, is extremely well-liked and respected in
the clubhouse, where he blends in easily. On the mound, he is a
dictator, going so far as to tell Jorge Posada, his catcher, what
fingers to use to signal pitches _ a trivial matter to most, but
not to El Duque. ``He knows exactly what he wants to do,'' Posada
said, ``and he's going to do it his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has disagreed about pitch selection with Posada
numerous times, vehemently shaking his head at the signs, stepping
off the rubber, stepping back on, shaking his head some more.
Posada sometimes slams his glove down into the dirt, out of
frustration _ and Hernandez will explain to him later, Hey, I'll
pitch the way I want to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a crucial situation against Baltimore last Saturday,
Hernandez stepped behind the mound, ripped a few blades of grass
from the ground and lofted them into the air; he wanted to know
which way the wind was blowing. Details. You never know what might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball-sized bruises dot Chuck Knoblauch's left side, from his
shoulder to his thigh. These are the places he has been hit by
pitches, 11 times this year, most in the American League. He crowds
home plate and won't step back, merely bowing when a fastball nears
his head. Even in a relatively poor offensive season for him,
Knoblauch is averaging 4.22 pitches per at-bat, second most in the
American League, according to STATS Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, the Yankees were putting the finishing touches on a
three-game sweep of Kansas City. Jeff Montgomery hit Scott Brosius
with a pitch leading off the ninth inning. When Homer Bush bounced
a grounder to second baseman Jose Offerman, a possible double-play
ball, Brosius torpedoed into second base to break up the double
play, obliterating shortstop Felix Martinez as Martinez tried
throwing to first. The Yankees led by 10-1 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The catchers, Posada and Joe Girardi, block balls in the dirt
even when there are not runners on base, to keep the play
instinctual, and practice the play daily. ``I've never seen that on
any team I've ever played on,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players mentioned outfielder Chad Curtis as possibly the
most intense Yankee, his signature play being his full somersault
as he throws home. ``He just goes into battle when the game
starts,'' Brosius said. Curtis has company. Cone is bright and
well-read and gregarious, and is utterly possessed when he pitches,
his face turning tomato red. Girardi will step out from behind home
plate sometimes to remind Cone of a flaw in his pitching mechanics,
and Cone will snap, ``I know,'' adding words and phrases Girardi
does not care to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Girardi said, ``he's so intense you're not sure
if your words are penetrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Yankees came back from a three-run deficit in
the ninth inning, two outs and nobody on base, to beat
Philadelphia. Down to their final out, their at-bats were precise
in their purpose, Brosius noted. The Yankees are running away with
the division, they were playing a game that likely will have no
bearing on the standings, and they concentrated like it was
October. Derek Jeter lined a double, O'Neill patiently waited
through a walk, Martinez pounced on a mistake, for a game-tying
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have a lot of guys who play the game the right way,''
Brosius said. ``Play hard, never assume anything. I don't think
there will be a letdown, because everybody on this team has a goal,
and we're not going to let up until we reach that goal.'' &QL;

TEXAS EDUCATION BOARD SET TO DUMP $43 MILLION IN DISNEY STOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Denouncing some Disney movies as ``garbage,''
the State Board of Education is expected to vote Thursday and
Friday to dump the 406,000 shares that Texas public schools own in
Walt Disney Co. stock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite financial analysts' predictions that earnings per share
will continue to grow 18 percent annually over the next three to
five years, board Chairman Jack Christie, a Houston Republican,
said he think it's time to sell. And he thinks the votes are there
to require fund managers to sell off the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be a good investment in the future because of the
ownership of some of the films they have,'' he said, ``and ... I
think as the public sees that type of garbage, (the stock) will
lose some of its luster.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited ``Pulp Fiction,'' an Oscar-winning black
comedy that featured murder for hire, explicit drug use and
sadomasochism. The film was produced by Miramax Films, a Disney
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching that, I cannot be any part of investing children's
money into that type of promotion,'' Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to sell the stock, worth about $43 million earlier this
week, is seen by some as a win for social conservatives, who have
been waging a battle for more than a year to force the state to
sell Disney stock in protest of violent and sexually explicit
movies and records produced by Disney subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Any vote Thursday would be preliminary only, since the issue is
being raised first in committee. If approved there, it will come
before the entire 15-member board Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney stock represents a small portion of the $17.65
billion in the Permanent School Fund, but the Teacher Retirement
System and Texas Employee Retirement System own nearly 4 million
shares of Disney stock, worth an estimated $289 million. Action by
the Education Board would have no impact on any other state
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Christie said that a board vote to sell Disney holdings should
not hold any political repercussions for Gov. George W. Bush. Bush
was a paid director of Silver Screen Management Inc. for about 10
years. Silver Screen raised more than $1 billion to finance Disney
movies, including 21 R-rated movies, 32 PG and PG-13 flicks and 9
G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Wednesday that the governor
continues to believe that investment decisions should be based on
sound investment principles and not on political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative American Family Association tried
unsuccessfully a year ago to get the state board to sell off Disney
holdings, citing violent and sexually explicit lyrics in some of
the songs produced by Disney subsidiaries. The group also has
boycotted Disney, though the boycotts seem to have had little if
any financial impact on the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Freedom Network, meanwhile, denounced Wednesday any
move to succumb to American Family Association pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of a special interest group trying
to make a political point at the expense of taxpayers,'' said Rick
Levy, a spokesman for the group, which was organized to fight the
influence of religious or social conservatives. ``It has nothing to
do with what's best for the schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   The Permanent School Fund, the constitutionally created vehicle
for investment of public school money, has been investing in Disney
stock since July 1996. In the past two years, according to a Texas
Education Agency report, earnings and dividends have grown at
annualized rates of 12 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Christie said a vote to sell off holdings should not be viewed
as a boycott of the company that built its reputation on family
entertainment, adding that he will continue to take his children to
Disney World in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that when films desensitize life by people
blowing away people and explicitness and just senseless killing of
individuals, it's got to somehow encourage school-age children to
blow away each other,'' he said. ``And in good conscience, we can't
do that, and I hope that Disney realizes this also.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christie, who had resisted earlier attempts to force school
portfolio managers to sell off Disney holdings, said he changed his
mind two or three months ago after the conservative AFA provided
him a film clip with scenes from various R-rated films produced by
Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the movie clips Christie viewed were scenes from
``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking film excerpts I could not finish watching,''
Christie said. ``Let's just say the mildest of the film clips I saw
was `Pulp Fiction.' And it got worse from there. I didn't even
catch the titles of the others because there's no way on earth I
could sit through these films.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney representatives did not return a call from the Houston
Chronicle, but a spokesman told The Associated Press he knew of no
other state investment fund considering divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   John Dreyer, Disney spokesman, added that Miramax is ``a
highbrow film label'' that has returned great value to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board member Randy Stevenson, a Republican and part of the
social conservative faction, said Texas should take the leadership
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while a decision to divest the Permanent School
Fund of Disney stock ``may not have a direct financial impact upon
the Disney corporation itself, it is my hope that a strong, clear
message will be sent to Disney ... that we are concerned about the
way they are handling the public trust that this nation has in
their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and schools across this nation entrust their
children's eyes, ears and minds to Disney and perhaps such trust is
no longer deserved,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said there is more to investing than financial
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``By investing in a company, we are indirectly supporting their
impact upon society,'' he said. ``I do not believe that we should
prostitute ourselves by investing only for monetary gain. We should
invest for the overall good of the schoolchildren of this state and
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said he would have preferred to handle the decision to
sell the stock ``without much fanfare,'' but social conservatives
on the board insisted that it be brought to a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we could have worked out of these stocks very
easily without fanfare,'' he said. ``I'm hoping that even with the
fanfare it doesn't set a precedent, it doesn't set a trend (toward)
social investing or that we are screening NBC or ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to turn into that.''

 &HT;    Braves develop Wohlers Worry
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bobby Cox's pen put down a steady rhythm as he tapped
it against the glass top, counting the days on the Atlanta Braves
schedule that covers his desk. Suddenly, the tapping stopped, just
when the reality began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right. It's been three weeks?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and Friday marks Week No. 4, since Mark Wohlers demoted
himself and made a bigger problem of the bullpen than the Braves
manager has faced in years, or at least since Juan Berenguer lived
here. The Braves resume the season's second half tonight with the
first of four games with the Florida Marlins and for all the things
that made the first half so exceptional _ at 59-29 the best start
ever, the 110-win pace _ Cox and his club are well familiar with
the qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   It's the bullpen. It needs some work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming Wohlers comes back, I like our bullpen because he
settles everybody down,'' said Tom Glavine. ``Even with that, I
think you can tweak it to improve it, probably by adding a veteran
lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Wohlers doesn't come back, you've got to do something.
And I don't know how long you wait to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hadn't thought it would take this long. Said Cox,
``We told (Wohlers) 19 days, because then you don't lose your
pension time.'' But Wohlers just signed off this week for a longer
assignment. With the major league trading deadline approaching on
July 31, management has just over three weeks to assess their needs
along with Wohlers' future. Down in the clubhouse, the players wait
for the other shoe to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, everyone in the bullpen would like to know if there
is Plan B,'' said Kerry Ligtenberg. ``We're apparently not going to
get that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he was dealt from Cincinnati to Los Angeles last weekend,
some on the Braves staff were certain closer Jeff Shaw would be
coming to Atlanta. Reds GM Jim Bowden had the Dodgers' offer on his
desk for a week while continuing to leverage other clubs before
closing the deal, indicating the current demand for a quality
closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would like to avoid that, if Wolhers can be salvaged
for the second half. Braves GM John Schuerholz, who said he has
been ``sort of non-plussed'' by Wohlers' early performances in
Richmond, has already run 11 relievers through the bullpen and
discarded four, not counting Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret to anyone that our closer's role is not being
filled by Mark Wohlers,'' Schuerholz said. ``We've got a bullpen
full of younger, inexperienced pitchers. We've got to look at that
area if we're keeping an eye on the total strength of the club. And
we have and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no accounting for it but since Wohlers' last appearance
June 12, the bullpen has rebounded well, accumulating a 2.83 ERA in
41 1/3 innings with the veteran closer gone. But while it has rung
up 42 strikeouts in that period, the team has also blown two of
five save opportunities at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging as a new entity is right-hander Rudy Seanez, whose 12
strikeouts and 1.29 ERA are bullpen bests in Wohlers' absense.
Called up May 30 when the team designated (and subsequently lost)
Brian Edmondson, Seanez made just two appearances in his first 20
days with the Braves before settling into steady work in late June,
a situation ``that would have made me go nuts,'' if he did not have
previous major league experience in Cleveland and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves don't need another right-hander. They need
another left-hander in addition to John Rocker, preferably a
seasoned player Cox can use for late-inning match-ups. These
pitchers are in the shortest supply in the majors but here are two
candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Orosco, 41, Baltimore (1-1, 3.38): At $800,000, he's
affordable and even at his age, he is still a handful for
left-handed hitters. Lefties are hitting .233 against him. The
Orioles are evaluating who can be dispensed with as their wild card
hopes fade, which can make Orosco available.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Christiansen, 28, Pittsburgh (1-1, 1.69): Fully recovered
from 1996 shoulder surgery, he has arrived as a reliever with 40
strikeouts in 37 1/3 innings. Left-handers have nine hits against
him in 51 at-bats (.176) and he has allowed just five of 26
inherited runners to score. The emergence of Ricardo Rincon also
makes him expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring another closer, if necessary, is more ticklish and
will cost the club a prime prospect, as Denny Neagle did when the
Braves shipped Jason Schmidt to Piitsburgh for him. It could cost
the Braves a Kevin McGlinchy or Bruce Chen to acquire a quality
closer like Tampa Bay's Roberto Hernandez or Baltimore's Randy
Myers. If the Braves are feeling lucky, Cleveland's Jose Mesa just
lost the closer job to Mike Johnson and is waiting to be dealt or
released.
</P>
<P>
   But all debate returns to Wohlers. Closers are born, not made,
and it took him seven years just to make the Braves' opening day
roster. Maddux has watched Wohlers struggle with the role for going
on two seasons now and what has transpired on the mound is just as
difficult as what has transpired off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're set up to fail,'' Greg Maddux said of the closer's job.
``You're pitching late in the game with a lead. If he gets them
out, well, he's supposed to. He's got no room for error. Any time
he gives up a run, it usually results in a loss or a blown save.
That's something that's hard to deal with. I know I wouldn't want
it.''

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight, Friday and Saturday at 7:05 p.m., Sunday at 4:35
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS and 750-AM will broadcast all four games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight -- RHP John Smoltz (5-2,
3.84; 5-2 3.43 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Livan Hernandez (7-4,
4.20; 0-0, 2.16 lifetime vs. Braves). Friday -- LHP Denny Neagle
(9-6, 3.41; 4-4, 2.89 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Jesus Sanchez
(3-6, 4.67; 0-1, 6.75 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday -- RHP Greg
Maddux (12-2, 1.54; 7-1, 2.07 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Ryan
Dempster (1-3, 6.43; 0-0, 3.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday -- LHP
Tom Glavine (12-2, 2.63; 5-7, 3.57 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP
Brian Meadows (6-6, 4.39; first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: The Braves lead the all-time series 37-28 but
have lost 16 of the last 28 games between the two clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Marlins lost two of three games in Atlanta on
June 16-18. The Braves out-hit Florida 23-18 in that series,
out-scored them 15-5 but could not pull off the sweep, as the
Marlins beat Glavine 3-2 in the third game.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins leaders: Avg. -- Edgar Renteria (.302); HR _ Cliff Floyd
(14); RBIs _ Floyd (57); SB _ Renteria (28). W _ Livan Hernandez
(7); ERA _ Matt Mantei (2.31). Strikeouts _ Hernandez (93). Saves _
Antonio Alfonseca (5).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Marlins have played some of their best baseball in
the last two weeks with five victories in their last seven games
and a 15-11 record dating back to June 8. They have won seven of
their last 11 home games and have gone 9-10 against the Eastern
Division. . . . Florida pitchers have yielded a 4.98 ERA and given
up 381 walks, or 4.4 per game, the most in the majors. That rate
last year was 2.5. Of the 21 pitchers who appeared for the Marlins
during their championship season, just four are currently on the
active roster (Livan Hernandez, Antonio Alfonseca, Felix Heredia
and Kirt Ojala). Rookies already have accounted for 64 Florida
starts this year. . . . Despite 12 errors, SS Edgar Renteria has
improved his play since winning the series, hitting a team-high
.302 with a team-high 33 multi-hit games. His 28 stolen bases are
third in the NL, but he has been caught a league-high 13 times. . .
. Tonight is a rematch of Game 3 of October's NLCS, when Hernandez
beat John Smoltz, 5-2. This season, Hernandez has given up 146 hits
(second in the league) and 17 home runs, tied for fourth in the NL.
But the Marlins get their money's worth from him. He has worked
past the seventh inning nine times in his 18 starts, and with some
staggering pitch-counts. He has thrown more than 130 pitches five
times already, including a 152-pitch complete game against Tampa
Bay on June 25 (a 5-1 victory)
</P>
<P>
   On the DL: INF Kevin Millar (broken left hamate), RHP Alex
Fernandez (rotator cuff surgery), EHP Eric Ludwig (broken right
arm) and RHP Rafael Medina (sore right shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: 3B Todd Zeile is hitting .301 with runners in scoring
position. Renteria has reached base in 44 of his last 48 games.
Todd Dunwoody is hitting .368 in his last 38 at-bats.

 &HT;    Braves' midseason report card
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How the Braves rank after a half-season .
</P>
<P>
   INFIELD: With three All-Stars, this may be the best infield the
Braves have put on the field. 3B Chipper Jones and 1B Andres
Galarraga comprise the strongest corners in the league, and SS Walt
Weiss is having a career year. 2B platoon of Keith Lockhart and
Tony Graffanino has hit a combined .234 since May 1. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   OUTFIELD: The defense, with four outfield errors, has been
superb, but offense has been inconsistent. CF Andruw Jones has hit
.291 since an awful April. RF Michael Tucker followed a .323 May
with a .256 June. Ryan Klesko, who has improved defensively, may
post career numbers. And Gerald Williams has been better than
advertised. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   STARTING ROTATION: Even by Braves standards, the first half
(49-20, 3.06 ERA) was something special. And that's with John
Smoltz working part-time. Greg Maddux is the Cy Young front-runner,
and Tom Glavine is right behind him. The league hit .246 against
them and struck out 460 times, once every 4.8 at-bats. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   BULLPEN: It is a major vulnerability on a team that has few. The
struggles of Mark Wohlers have disrupted what was a thin relief
staff. While nine blown saves is tolerable (the 1995 championship
Braves blew 14 saves), the bullpen has allowed a whopping 271 base
runners in 198 2/3 innings. They'll need some help before they're
through.Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   BENCH: Braves' pinch-hitters batted .260 in the first half. The
additions of Gerald Williams and Ozzie Guillen provide depth for a
roster that appeared a little thin when spring camp broke. But the
bench doesn't have a weapon like Mike Devereaux proved to be in
1995, and Curtis Pride, the No. 1 left-handed bat in reserve, was
5-for-29 (.172). Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   MANAGER: Bobby Cox lost two of his favorite players (Mark Lemke,
Jeff Blauser), has watched his closer self-destruct and seen one of
his Cy Young guys' work-load cut in half. His DL includes an
appendectomy and a couple of torn shoulders. His roster includes
nine players who weren't here a year ago. For all that, his team is
on a pace to win 120 games. Grade: A

 &HT;    Nicklaus'major streak ends `on my own terms'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Jack Nicklaus always has cringed at the thought of
being a ceremonial golfer. If he can't be competitive, he would
rather be elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to shoot a pair of 80s and wave to the crowd,''
Nicklaus once said.
</P>
<P>
   With his hip and groin hurting and his pride still intact,
Nicklaus, 58, officially pulled out of next week's British Open at
Royal Birkdale, ending at 154 his streak of professional majors for
which he had been eligible. Nicklaus also said he would not play in
the PGA Championship next month.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the incredible streak was the 1957 U.S. Open.
The end becomes the U.S. Open two weeks ago at the Olympic Club,
where Nicklaus, playing on a special exemption, made the cut and
tied for 43rd. In April, in an astounding performance, he tied for
sixth at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to end the streak by having it said that Jack
Nicklaus could no longer play the game,'' the winner of 18
professional majors and two U.S. Amateurs said in a statement
released Wednesday through his North Palm Beach, Fla., office.
``Instead, I wanted to step back with the feeling that the
competitive spirit and ability still thrived within me. I wanted to
end the streak on my own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus also said, ``After 42 years of playing major
championship golf, I feel that my ability to compete at the highest
level is marginal at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally regarded as the best ever to play the game, Nicklaus
won six Masters, four U.S. Opens, three British Opens and five
PGAs. He made the cut in 130 of the 154 pro majors, including 10 of
his last 12, and was a runner-up 19 times.

MATCH MADE IN HOLLYWOOD AS RAZZLE MEETS DAZZLE

  (With BROWN-RESIGN, BROWN-NEWHOUSE.)

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Has Tina Brown finally gone Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   After years as the top editor of Vanity Fair and then The New
Yorker, during which both magazines paid extraordinary attention to
Hollywood moguls and stars, Ms. Brown has, in some ways, turned the
corner and become part of the world that she helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   In her new job, announced Wednesday by Harvey and Bob Weinstein,
co-chairmen of the Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax Films unit, Ms. Brown
will help form a media venture that will include a monthly magazine
designed to create material for Miramax films and television shows.
Ms. Brown will be joined by Ronald Galotti, vice president of
Advance Publications' Conde Nast unit and the publisher of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She creates the most interesting magazines, finds the hottest
journalists and has her hand on the cultural Zeitgeist,'' Harvey
Weinstein said. He said that the movie material would be produced
by Miramax and that the television shows would most likely appear
on ABC, which Disney owns.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said details of the new venture remained vague and
that Ms. Brown and Galotti would spend about a year creating it.
Which writers will be hired _ will Ms. Brown raid her stable of
writers at The New Yorker? _ and how they will be paid if articles
turn into films or television programs have not been determined.
Ms. Brown's and Galotti's financial arrangements with Miramax were
undisclosed, though they will profit from a film, television show
or book that emerges out of a magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that that they would would serve, for example, as
executive producers on any film that emerges out of a magazine and
that they would earn producing fees. ``What this is about is
creating a pipeline for ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown has in recent years developed a friendship with
Michael Eisner, the chairman of Disney, among other moguls. The New
Yorker held a conference in October, celebrating a magazine issue
about the future, at the Disney Institute in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a fantastic friendship with Michael _ and that
certainly was a plus,'' said Weinstein, who noted that two years
ago he began discussing with Eisner the notion of Miramax starting
a magazine that would feed into films, television and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last two years, Tina would kid me about the
magazine,'' Weinstein said. It was only when he learned in the last
month that Ms. Brown's contract was up at The New Yorker that he
began having serious discussions with her about working as a
partner in the new venture, Weinstein said. He added that Ms. Brown
had been pursued by multimedia companies but declined to identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Brown, whose father was a film producer, has been
fascinated with Hollywood since she took over Vanity Fair in 1984,
the movie community has been even more fascinated with her. Unlike
any other magazine or newspaper editor, Ms. Brown has gone out of
her way to establish friendships with some of the most formidable
people in Hollywood: she is friendly with top executives like
Eisner, Barry Diller and Michael Ovitz, as well as the director
Steven Spielberg and Bert Fields, a top Hollywood lawyer. She has
even been fictionalized in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' in which the
actress Kristen Scott Thomas plays an English editor of a sleek
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Why Hollywood is so fascinated with Ms. Brown _ why she's
somehow perceived as a star _ has been attributed to several
factors. She is British and Oxford-educated in a town where a
surprising number of big players have never gone to college and are
dazzled and even intimidated by such credentials. She is powerful
in a town that respects power as much as money. And Ms. Brown
herself has, of course, contributed to her own Hollywood aura.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking over Vanity Fair, Ms. Brown became the first
magazine editor to make Hollywood executives as celebrated as
stars. She ran often-flattering articles about their lives and
their feuds and published glossy photos of them. ``Tina allowed
herself to be educated by these guys, and they all thought, in
their own bizarre way, that they controlled her,'' said one movie
industry author, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But the
reality is she controlled them. She had them in the palm of her
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's power over Hollywood became evident in 1989 when, as
editor of Vanity Fair, she held a fund-raising event at the 20th
Century Fox lot for the Phoenix House, which operates drug
treatment centers nationwide. More than 700 people showed up,
including virtually every mogul and star in town.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Graham, a longtime colleague of Ms. Brown who has
worked for her as West Coast editor of Vanity Fair and now The New
Yorker, acknowledged that ``Tina has a certain magic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a Hollywood girl, and she was never going to be,''
Ms. Graham said. ``She's a distinctly English woman, a very smart
and successful Oxford graduate. She has many friends in Los
Angeles, she loves coming here, but what she's really about is
editing magazines and letting writers be extremely creative.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Brown has no plans to leave New York. She
and her husband, Harold Evans, the editorial director of Mortimer
Zuckerman's publications, recently moved to a new apartment in
Manhattan. The couple have two children, a son, George, and a
daughter, Isabel.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that, like so many of his counterparts in
Hollywood and New York, he was dazzled by Ms. Brown. ``I've moved
from being a fan to a friend,'' he said. &QL;

JURY FINDS NBC NEGLIGENT IN `DATELINE' REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury in Maine on Wednesday found that ``Dateline NBC,'' the
television network's prime-time news program, was negligent in
misrepresenting a 1995 series about the trucking industry and
ordered the network to pay $525,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case in Bangor did not center on whether the
two-part report was true. Instead, it focused on whether the NBC
journalists had misrepresented the focus of the story and how the
sources would be portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Classic Carriers, based in
Waterville, Me., and one of its drivers accused NBC correspondent
Fred Francis and freelance producer Alan Handel of misleading them
about the theme of a segment on the trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company's owners, Raymond and Kelly Veilleux, and the
driver, Peter Kennedy, said Francis and Handel conveyed that they
were working on a positive story. The two-part series instead
focused on safety violations by Kennedy and other truckers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC argued that it had promised only to report accurately as a
film crew joined Kennedy for a cross-country drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the program Kennedy referred to his driving log as a ``joke
book'' and admitted falsifying entries so he could drive for
periods longer than the law allows. At one point Kennedy drove from
Chicago to Boston without sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argued that the program failed to reflect his views that
he could drive for long periods without impairing his driving
ability.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for four and a half hours on Tuesday and five
hours Wednesday, the jury said the network and the show had
committed negligence and misrepresentation and had inflicted
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Veilleux was awarded $300,000, Kennedy $175,000 and Ms. Veilleux
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press has no special protection under the laws of the
United States,'' the plaintiffs' lawyer, Bill Robitzek, told the
jury. ``They are not immune. They're not exempt. If they do
something wrong, they can be brought here and held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., stood by the report
Wednesday and tried to distance itself from the other media outlets
that have had public setbacks recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC News believes our story was presented accurately and
regrets that the jury came to a different conclusion,'' the network
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's ruling, NBC joined the string of high-profile
media outlets that have dealt with professional lapses in the last
two months. Since May, The New Republic magazine, The Boston Globe
(which is owned by The New York Times Co.), The Cincinnati Enquirer
and Cable News Network have either renounced major reports or
discovered fabrications by staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there will be those that try to lump this with
other stories about media missteps,'' Kassie Canter, an NBC
spokeswoman, said. ``This is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Canter said NBC was weighing whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision was the second time in six years that
``Dateline NBC'' found trouble with trucks. In 1992, as part of a
segment on truck safety, the show broadcast footage of a General
Motors truck bursting into flame supposedly as a result of a
collision. It turned out that the program's producers had rigged
the truck to explode more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, ``Dateline NBC'' has been a big
success for the network, expanding to four hours a week last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, who runs NBC's entertainment division, said
recently: ``There is no show more important to us than `Dateline.'
I look on `Dateline' as a hit show in the same way I look on `E.R.'
as a hit show.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jury's ruling raised concern in news media circles, where it
sparked fears that any person who was the subject of a critical
article or program could successfully sue for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often is the case that a source agrees to tell a story
perceiving somehow that the story will be a positive for them,''
said George Freeman, assistant general counsel of The New York
Times Co. ``But that's a far cry from a contract actually existing
where the deal is that you actually have to write a positive story,
which no self-respecting journalist would agree to.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons can't wait much longer for Nathan Davis to develop
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Nathan Davis has had more than a year to get in
shape, and he's getting closer.
</P>
<P>
   But in the NFL, close sometimes isn't good enough, and the
Atlanta Falcons might reach a point soon where they can wait no
longer for the big defensive tackle to get his act together.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons selected Davis in the second round of the 1997 draft
with the 32nd overall pick and brought him to Suwanee thinking he
might play as a rookie. But Davis, who constantly battles weight
problems on his 6-foot-5, 300-pound frame, played in only two games
and was on the inactive list for 14.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Atlanta could afford to let Davis work on the
practice squad, because it made sense financially and the team
didn't need him. With starters Travis Hall and Dan Owens and
reserve Shane Dronett, Atlanta had one of the top defensive-tackle
rotations in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But Owens went to Detroit as a free agent, Dronett is expected
to start at right tackle, and the Falcons need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the pads go on (in training camp, beginning July 23),
it's tough to judge the guys up front,'' said Rich Brooks,
assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. ``We need some guys
to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate is still a big question. He's in better shape ... but
it's too early to tell much.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis didn't show much last year, arriving in Suwanee with
swelling in his pelvis after tearing a tendon as a senior at
Indiana. He never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was depressed a lot; I wasn't feeling good about
myself,'' he said. ``I went from being able to do whatever I
wanted, to sometimes not being able to get off the couch. That does
a lot to you mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just slept all the time and watched TV, re-runs of Jerry
Springer and cartoons like Fat Albert and Shazaam.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis' weight jumped to 330, 45 pounds more than his
playing weight at Indiana. ``Last year, Nathan had no chance,''
said defensive line coach Bill Kollar, who would like Davis at 295.
</P>
<P>
   Davis weighs 312 pounds and is in better shape, thanks to four
workouts a week in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone through the workouts, and he's been standing up at
the end of most of them,'' strength and conditioning coach Al
Miller said. ``That is winning the battle, though, not the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons need Davis, or somebody, if they hope to replicate
the success of last year's defensive front. Owens had 69 tackles
and eight sacks, Hall 107 tackles and 10.5 sacks and Dronett 40
tackles and four sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, seven-year veteran journeyman Esera Tuaolo (6-2, 296),
seventh-round draft choice Henry Slay (6-1, 290) of West Virginia
and free agent Mark Campbell (6-1, 293) are competing for two
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, Davis won't have the salary cap working to his
benefit, and it will be cheaper for the Falcons to cut him than
keep him.
</P>
<P>
   His salary cap figure in 1997 was $508,700, but if he had been
waived and then claimed by another team, his entire $660,000
signing bonus would have counted against last year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   If he makes the team this summer, his cap number will be
$580,000; if he gets cut and claimed by another team, it will be
$440,000, or the remainder of his pro-rated signing bonus. If he
cleared waivers, the Falcons would have no cap charge.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he'll have to earn his spot.

 &HT;    Free-agent pickup Louchieygunning for tackle spot
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the Atlanta Falcons begin training camp two
weeks from today, the right-tackle position will draw the most
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Louchiey (pronounced LOU-chee), the Falcons' first
offseason free-agent acquisition, is working as No. 1 at the
position during the current mini-camp. Seventh-round draft choice
Ephraim Salaam is the backup. They're trying to replace Matt
Willig, who signed with Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey, now working under offensive line coach Art Shell, is
taking nothing for granted. Although he's 6-foot-8, 305 pounds,
he's not talking that way. Despite being drafted in the third round
by the Bills in 1994, Louchiey, a former South Carolina standout,
never got established in Buffalo, starting 13 games in four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to play, and contribute in whatever way
possible,'' said Louchiey, who grew up in Greenville, S.C. ``At
this point in my life, in my career, it's in my best interests to
adjust to whatever coach I have. I have to work on all parts of my
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for pearls
</P>
<P>
   One of the undrafted college free agents in Suwanee is former
North Carolina receiver Octavus Barnes. The 6-2, 200-pounder set an
ACC record for freshmen with 609 yards in 1994, and he set a UNC
record with 970 yards on 53 catches as a sophomore. Barnes tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in UNC's final game that year, and his
last two years were solid but not spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got a bad draw, (not getting drafted) because of
my knee,'' he said. ``Before that, I was one of the best receivers
in the country. I think I came back too soon, playing six months
after surgery. I'll show I can play, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has suffered another setback. When the team was off last
week, he went oyster hunting in North Carolina, and cut his feet on
sharp shells in an oyster bed. He was running gingerly Wednesday.
``I'm never going oyster hunting again,'' he said, ``and after
that, I'm never eating oysters.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute drill
</P>
<P>
   There were no notable injuries Wednesday, but defensive end
Chuck Smith is still fighting a strained back, and quarterback
Chris Chandler has a sore knee. ... Falcons general manager Harold
Richardson played the foil Wednesday on AM-790, when sports talk
co-hosts Nick Cellini and Chris Dimino ribbed him about the Falcons
signing 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg. Cellini said it
``borders on the bizarre, borders on being a practical joke.''
Dimino asked Richardson if there was any truth to the rumor former
Falcon linebacker, Tommy Nobis, who retired in '76, was working
out. Richardson responded, ``He's out on the field, but I'm not
sure what that means.'' The GM said 17 years of NFL experience
gives DeBerg a big mental edge, but the preseason will show if he
still has what it takes physically. When Dimino asked if actors
Warren Beatty, who played a QB in ``Heaven Can Wait,'' or Mac
Davis, who played a QB in, ``North Dallas Forty,'' would be taking
snaps, Richardson said, ``We're open to that.'' ... Receiver Todd
Kinchen and reserve linemen Scott Adams and Adam Schreiber were
among the most impressive veterans in Tuesday's conditioning test _
while running the 40-yard dash 10 times, their times remained
consistently fast. Among rookies, linebacker Keith Brooking,
receiver Tim Dwight and cornerback Elijah Williams were tops. ...
Practice today will be at 10 a.m., and the team golf tournament
will be at Chateau Elan at 1:30. The early favorites: Chandler
among players and Dan Reeves and Bill Kollar among coaches.

 &HT;    Falcons sign German, last of this year's draft picks
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Former University of Miami receiver Jammi German
signed a three-year contract with the Falcons on Wednesday, making
Atlanta the first team in the league to sign all of its 1998 draft
class.
</P>
<P>
   German, a third-round draft choice, signed for $1,001,250, with
a signing bonus of $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   He was All-Big East in 1994 and 1995 but missed the next two
years, the first with injury and 1997 for giving false information
to the NCAA when it investigated Miami.
</P>
<P>
   German, who made all-conference as a return man the first time,
caught 33 passes for 391 yards that year. In 1995, he caught 41
passes for 730 yards (17.8 average) and three touchdowns. The
scouting report says German has inconsistent hands but runs good
routes, has better-than-average speed, is athletic and will fight
for the ball. He also is considered a good downfield blocker.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons remained at the NFL's limit of 80 under contract
after six-year veteran reserve guard/center Matt Elliott, 29,
failed his physical and was waived.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who signed with the Falcons on March 16 after playing
three years in Carolina, has an arthritic knee with bone-on-bone
contact in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   German was ecstatic Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been my motivation all along. Now I can help my mom
(Clare Douglas) get a house; she's still in an apartment,'' said
German, one of seven siblings. ``My brothers can have their own
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on German's deal hit a snag last week after
first-round draft choice Keith Brooking signed a six-year, $7.925
million contract, leaving just $292,000 for German in the rookie
salary pool allotted by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That number, which is the combination of German's first-year
salary and the pro-rated portion of his signing bonus, is a bit
below market value for a player drafted in the middle of the third
round.
</P>
<P>
   So German's agent, Alan Wade, asked for a bigger signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward,'' German said. ``As far as me not
playing the last two years, just being up here the last month (for
condititioning, passing camp and the current mini-camp), I'm
getting in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm back to where I was, and probably beyond that.''

 &HT;    Selig becomes commish today
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Braves player representative Tom Glavine said the
athletes won't stand in the way. Players association director Don
Fehr said it will be business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   When Major League Baseball changes the title of commissioner
from ``interim'' to ``permanent'' for Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud
Selig today, most baseball people think the impact on the game will
be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Selig has served as acting commissioner since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bud has done some good things for baseball,'' Glavine
said. ``Is it ideal for an owner to be a commissioner? No. But I
think Bud loves the game, and I would rather have someone like that
at the top who wants to do the job instead of someone forced in
there to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only major change involves Selig moving out of his office at
County Stadium and turning over the club to his daughter, Wendy.
Selig will commute from Milwaukee to the major-league office in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think him being named commissioner will change the way
we have conducted business the last couple of years,'' Fehr said.
``We now have an office to deal with on a daily basis. That's why
we don't treat this as an item of significant change.''
</P>
<P>
   The union will continue to deal with former Toronto Blue Jays
executive Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer.
Beeston, who acts as a liaison between management and the union,
has developed a workable relationship with Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the relationship now, while I won't say is healthy and
close, is certainly respectful and positive,'' Beeston said.
``Sometimes, people see Don as an omnipotent dictator. But he has
always been responsive to me. I wouldn't use the word 'delight' to
work with, but we certainly can be professional and work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig will continue to do what he does best, which is to bring
the owners to a consensus. The owners, with few exceptions, are
strongly in support of Selig. They were not going to take ``no''
for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes today are clearly higher than they've ever been,''
Selig said. ``You're better off trying to develop an understanding
in people, so when you get to a meeting, they understand the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Former commissioner Peter Ueberroth said Selig has done a good
job of navigating baseball through tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be recognized one day by the Hall of Fame for his
efforts,'' Ueberroth said.
</P>
<P>
   And Selig thinks he can get along with Fehr, a must-situation
for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human events tore us apart at times, but we've gotten along
for the most part,'' Selig said. ``We've reduced the acrimony.''

U.S. RULING WILL LIMIT MAJOR TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR CORPORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to rulings in two cases handed down by U.S. Tax Court
last month, corporations may be about to lose some major tax
deductions.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with almost everything involving taxes, the
issues are complex. But they boil down to this: expenses that each
company considered part of doing business, and therefore
deductible, were ruled to be capital expenditures. That made them
nondeductible.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internal Revenue Service is aggressive in applying the
rulings to other businesses, as several tax specialists expect,
corporate tax bills could swell and corporate profits could shrink.
</P>
<P>
   The losers in tax court were FMR Corp., the Boston parent of the
giant Fidelity mutual fund concern, and PNC Bank Corp., the
Pittsburgh-based bank with $75 billion in assets. FMR and PNC are
each considering whether to appeal the rulings issued by Judge
Robert Ruwe in Washington. Such appeals would go to the U.S. Court
of Appeals in each company's area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both cases are resounding defeats for the taxpayer,'' said
Robert Willens, managing director in tax and accounting at Lehman
Brothers. ``This could be one of the most important things we've
seen in the last few decades. The possibility of disallowing a
whole host of expenses is staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue may be on the IRS radar screen, but at some companies
it has not yet registered. A spokesman for Liberty Financial Cos.,
which is one of the biggest publicly traded fund companies, said
this week that he was unfamiliar with the FMR case and could not
comment on the potential impact for his business.
</P>
<P>
   In the PNC case, the tax court ruled the expenses associated
with making home loans at two small banks that PNC had acquired
were nondeductible. Banks generally deduct these mortgage
origination fees from their tax bills, but the tax court ruled that
because these fees created ``a separate and distinct asset,'' they
should be capitalized or added to the bank's balance sheet in the
form of an asset.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity case was a bit different. It involved expenses
associated with starting new mutual funds in tax years 1985 through
1987. These costs included such things as research, legal and
regulatory fees and the preparation of offering documents.
</P>
<P>
   Neither case involved a significant amount of money. At issue
for Fidelity was approximately $750,000 in start-up costs for the
three years. At PNC Bank, the subsidiary's loan origination costs
were about $150,000. Because PNC's loans had a measurable life, it
could amortize the costs.
</P>
<P>
   This has the effect of extending the tax bite over the life of
the loans, reducing the impact a bit. But Fidelity could not
specify the life of its new funds. That means it will be forced to
eat the startup costs in the year they are incurred.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Fidelity and PNC say they fought the issue on
principle, not because of the money at stake. ``The potential,
far-reaching implications of this issue is why we challenged the
IRS on the matter,'' said Jessica Johnson, a Fidelity spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rulings loom large over corporate America because
the expenses involved in Fidelity's case and PNC's case are not
arcane business costs. They are typical of the costs incurred by
companies to maintain their businesses and to expand their scope
and increase profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baran, senior tax counsel of the American Bankers
Association in Washington, prepared a court brief in support of
PNC. ``It is unclear to what extent this would effect a bank's
earnings,'' he said in a recent interview. ``But when you can no
longer take a current deduction for making loans, it will have some
type of financial impact on a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the two recent rulings on financial services, the
IRS had begun to disallow deductions in some other industries. For
example, airlines are complaining that they are being told to
capitalize the cost of repairing planes instead of deducting them,
as has been accepted practice. Other areas of dispute involve
certain costs by cellular phone companies to attract new customers
and by other manufacturers to get their products on a retailer's
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   What does it add up to? An effort by the IRS to make companies
capitalize costs that they have historically deducted. The result,
said Irving Salem, a partner at the law firm of Latham &AMP; Watkins in
New York, would be a ``hemorrhage of fashionable, new
capitalization issues with no foreseeable end in sight.'' Salem
knows what he is talking about. In the mid-1960s, he was the
technical assistant to the chief counsel of the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   In distinguishing between expenses that are deductible and those
that must be capitalized, the IRS is relying on a 1992 Supreme
Court decision known as ``Indopco'' in which the court required the
capitalization of the costs of a friendly merger between National
Starch and Chemical Corp., which later changed its name to Indopco
Inc., and Unilever. Because the combination changed the corporate
structure of the entities and promised long-term benefits, the
court ruled that the costs should be capitalized, not expensed.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Supreme Court did not define exactly which costs
must be capitalized, some tax practitioners say the IRS is using
Indopco as an excuse to review many areas. Because it takes so long
for issues to wend through the courts, the six-year-old ruling is
only being played out in a broad way now.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 162 of the tax code, ``ordinary and necessary
business expenses'' are deductible from a company's income tax
bill. What does ordinary mean? Don't think typical or normal, says
the IRS. Citing ``Indopco,'' the IRS says ordinary business
expenses are those not considered capital expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   This fuzzy definition of what is ``ordinary'' leaves room for
interpretation by companies and the IRS. ``It's a `know it when you
see it' kind of concept,'' Salem said.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, companies have felt safe deducting
expenses that they incurred year-in, year-out.
</P>
<P>
   The PNC case changes all that, because loan origination costs
are routine. Adrian Fenton, director of taxes at PNC Bank, said,
``The much broader issue for corporate America is how far will the
IRS go?''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the IRS says that neither the FMR nor the PNC case
is a step in a new direction. A spokesman said that it was not
planning a blanket effort to capitalize every cost in the mutual
fund industry. But he added that if other mutual funds have similar
costs to Fidelity's in creating new funds, they will be examined by
field agents.
</P>
<P>
   Salem countered that the FMR case moves well beyond old law
because the judge ruled that FMR's costs of expanding its business
_ bringing out new funds _ should be capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were expanding your business, it was an expense,'' said
Salem of past procedures. ``There was recognition of that in the
government's brief in Indopco. Everybody thought that expansion was
golden, but this court didn't buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the IRS find expenses to capitalize beyond those at banks
and mutual funds? You bet. After all, corporations large and small
in all industries incur costs that will produce significant
long-term benefits. The IRS official said that to the extent those
costs were identified by its agents and were found to be related to
significant long-term benefits and/or a separate and distinct
asset, it would take the position that they should be capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indopco ruling, the IRS has begun requiring that the
airline industry capitalize aircraft and engine maintenance costs.
Over the last two years, the airlines have tried to resolve the
issue in talks with the IRS and the Treasury Department. So far
they have been unsuccessful. Southwest Airlines asked the tax court
this spring to rule on the issue. The case has not yet been heard.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what should be capitalized is so large and so
fuzzy that it is almost impossible to assess what is at stake for
corporate America. Some rough estimates can be made for the mutual
fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Analytical Services, 3,300 entirely new
funds have been established over the last five years, at what an
industry consultant estimated was startup costs of $20,000 to
$100,000 each. Taking the midrange, $50,000, the costs that may now
be neither deductible nor amortizable could reach $165 million. Not
backbreaking to a multibillion-dollar industry, but not peanuts
either. Assuming a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, that means a
$58 million increase in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A greater concern to Willens is how the IRS will treat the
expenses of expanding a business. ``The FMR case gives the IRS
carte blanche to go after a whole world of startup costs,'' he
said. This would apply to any company opening new outlets. Think
Starbucks, think McDonald's, think Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   And requiring that cellular phone companies capitalize the
expenses of getting customers on their books has implications for
other industries as well. Why couldn't the IRS ask the same of
Internet providers such as America Online? &QL;

FOR FRANCE, IT'S THE INCREDIBLE DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There hasn't been a night like this here since the
Liberation. Thousands of cheering, singing, dancing people in front
of the ancient Hotel de Ville. Strangers hugging strangers. Flares
burning, firecrackers popping. The bleu-blanc-rouge tricolor
flapping from car windows, draped around shoulders, painted on
faces, sprayed onto hair. Spontaneous celebrations from Pigalle to
the Pantheon. Horns honking until three in the morning along the
Champs Elysees, the Boul' Mich, the quais along the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   After 68 years, Les Bleus _ France's beloved but ill-starred
soccer team _ will be playing for the World Cup title against
champion Brazil come Sunday. Incroyable, n'est-ce pas?
</P>
<P>
   ``La France en finale,'' teenager Sebastien Duchange exulted
after the host country had come from behind to beat Croatia, 2-1,
at the Stade de France just north of town, finishing the match with
only 10 men on the field. ``C'est top.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, as the sporting daily L'Equipe had proclaimed Wednesday
morning, ``le reve du siecle'' _ the dream of the century. France
has been playing in this quadrennial festival of feet since 1930
and never reached the final. But ever since Laurent ``Lolo'' Blanc
defeated Paraguay with his ``La Delivrance'' goal in overtime a
week ago Sunday, Les Bleus have been touched by stardust.
</P>
<P>
   They play 120 scoreless minutes against Italy and win on penalty
kicks when an Italian shot clangs off the crossbar. They're
resigned to losing to the Germans in the semifinals, as they always
do _ but the Germans lose to the Croats. ``The Germans always
win,'' businessman Irvin Rosenberg was saying. ``Always, always.
But this time, they don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the pessimism that has always enshrouded the national
team lifted. Suddenly, a country that has always taken its soccer
with insouciance developed an amour fou, a mad love, for Les Bleus.
``I never thought I would see people with their faces painted blue,
white, and red in the stadiums,'' said captain Didier Deschamps.
</P>
<P>
   Every brasserie and bistro on either side of the Seine had a
television tuned to last night's match. Le Lutece, on the Boulevard
Saint Michel, was packed from door to door with a bouncer shaking
his head on the sidewalk. And the square in front of the Hotel de
Ville was jammed with thousands of people craning their necks to
watch the match on a huge color screen. Urchins hung from
streetlamps, teenagers wore blue team jerseys with Zinedine
Zidane's name and number 10 on the back, adults sported oversized
tricolored fool's caps with jingling bells.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone chanted ``Allez les Bleus'' _ and gasped when Croatia,
which wasn't even a country the last time France played in the Cup
in 1986, scored a shocking goal less than a minute into the second
half. Then Lilian Thuram drew France even and a roar exploded
simultaneously from sidewalk cafes, from open apartment windows,
from moving cars, from the bridges connecting the Left and Right
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blue hour,'' that enchanted Parisian time between sunset
and darkness, came and went. An enormous full moon appeared over
the Seine and streetlights came on. Thuram scored again and now the
city held its breath and crossed its fingers, especially after
Blanc was ejected for whacking a Croat in the face and Les Bleus
had to play a man short for the rest of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barthez, Barthez,'' the crowd at the Hotel de Ville kept
chanting, whenever the black-garbed French keeper with the shaved
head and goatee plucked another ball out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   Le reve du siecle was minutes away now. Whenever Spanish referee
Jose Manuel Garcia Aranda looked at his watch and decided to let
play go on, there were impatient groans and derisive whistles. And
then it was done _ and the City of Light rocked with a thunderclap
of joy and relief and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The boulevards were immediately jammed with people running
between and around and climbing atop cars. Thousands of flags
appeared from nowhere. Hundreds of celebrants gathered on the Ile
de La Cite, at the Arc de Triomphe, in the Latin Quarter, at the
Opera, at every intersection in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Montparnasse, where the streets outside the train station
were still throbbing after midnight, Irvin Rosenberg and his wife
came down from their apartment and joined the party. ``It is
impossible to sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dream had shaken everyone awake. Les Bleus en finale?
Absolument. Down by Notre Dame cathedral, an elderly beggar
approached a foreigner. ``Vive la France,'' he declared.

MILITARY RULER APPEALS FOR CALM FOLLOWING DEATH OF OPPOSITION
LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's military ruler appealed for restraint
on Wednesday after the sudden death of the detained opposition
leader, Moshood K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   But the country appeared poised on a knife-edge as American and
other Western doctors prepared to travel here to perform an autopsy
on Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Lagos were quiet Wednesday night, eerily deserted
as people stayed home out of fear. However, debris and smashed
glass littering several streets testified to the sporadic rioting
here and in other cities that has left at least 19 people dead
since Abiola died and underscored the explosive resonance of his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation in a medal-bedecked military uniform, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, the country's recently installed leader,
promised a fair autopsy for Abiola and said that his release from
prison had been due to be decided on Wednesday. ``Alas,`' he said,
``God willed otherwise and today we mourn his loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar spoke of the ``restoration of democracy'' in Africa's
most populous nation as an ``imperative,'' but avoided spelling out
any plans as to how this should be achieved. He also dissolved a
military-appointed government _ a gesture that appears unlikely to
have any immediate impact _ as the core of power lies with the
inner circle of military men gathered in the provisional ruling
council.
</P>
<P>
   Although the general's speech was full of compassion for Abiola,
he placed the opposition leader's death on the same level as that a
month ago of the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, describing both as a
``national tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who appeared to be poised to win the 1993 presidential
election before the military annulled it, and was imprisoned on
charges of treason in 1994, died Tuesday after falling ill during a
meeting with U.S. and Nigerian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian authorities have attributed his death to ``cardiac
arrest,'' but members of Abiola's family have suggested he may have
been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said on Wednesday that two American
military physicians will be sent to Nigeria to help perform an
autopsy. The chief coroner of the Canadian province of Ontario, Dr.
James Young, will also be present, along with a British expert. At
the specific request of the Abiola family, Dr. John Pless, a
pathologist at the University of Indiana, is being sent by
Physicians for Human Rights, a Boston-based group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear when the autopsy would be
performed. The burial of Abiola, who converted to Islam many years
ago, would normally have taken place at once, but a delay of
perhaps as much as two or three more days now seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday
that the United States had no evidence that Abiola had ``died of
anything other than natural causes.'' But he added that, given the
suspicions of the family, it was ``a good idea to have a
post-mortem conducted in a way that is as independently, reliably,
conducted as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts are swirling here, prompted by the extraordinary timing
of Abiola's death, and it seems certain that until the results of
the autopsy are known the situation will remain highly volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, with the door now half opened to a democratic
transition and the eventual course of this shift still vague, a
quick return to the calm called for on Wednesday by Abubakar may be
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You who killed Abiola will pay for what you have done,'' mobs
shouted as they moved through the streets here early on Wednesday,
before being disbanded by police units that fired shots in the air.
By the afternoon, this city of eight million people was largely
calm.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities said at least 10 people had been killed in
Lagos, and some of the violence appeared shaded by old ethnic
rivalries, with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas
from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Hausas and Fulanis constitute a majority in the military
government and the armed forces while a significant part of
Abiola's following came from members of the Yoruba tribe in the
southwestern part of Nigeria. &QL;

YAHOO! INTERNET STOCK SPLITS AND SOARS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo Inc. reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday that were
sharply higher than analysts' expectation. The results and the
announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split sent Yahoo's already
stratospheric stock price surging even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo runs the most popular sites on the World Wide Web, and
unlike most Internet companies it has begun to earn a small
operating profit. In the last month, its share price has increased
by more than 70 percent, giving the tiny company a market value of
nearly $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have seen similar run-ups. Amazon.Com,
for example, the money-losing online bookstore, now has a market
value that is $5.3 billion more than that of Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Borders Group, the two largest bookstore chains, combined.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, shares of Yahoo, which is based in Santa Clara,
Calif., closed at $186.1875, down $4.8125, on the Nasdaq stock
market. Yahoo released its earnings after the market's regular
session; in after-hours trading, its shares rose as high as $202.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a one-time charge, Yahoo earned $8.1 million, or 15
cents a share, in the second quarter. Analysts had expected Yahoo
to earn 9 cents a share. With the $44.1 million charge, related to
its acquisition of Viaweb Inc., which runs web sites for small
businesses, Yahoo lost $36 million in the second quarter. Revenue
increased to $41.2 million, from $30.2 million in the first quarter
and $14.1 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Yahoo continued to show that it was among the
strongest Internet companies, with its advertising income rising
faster than its costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancAmerica Robertson
Stephens, said that despite the good news, Yahoo's shares could
well fall 10 percent to 20 percent in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This news perfectly supported the bullish case on Yahoo,''
Benjamin said. ``But there was nothing that a rational person would
see in this release that should make the stock go up.'' He said
that using the most bullish assumptions, he could not justify a
price of more than $150 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the activity in Yahoo's stock has come from small
investors, analysts said, as larger institutional investors have
been afraid to commit to the stock at these prices. The stock
split, effective Aug. 3, is likely to encourage retail investors by
making it easier to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   (In recent weeks, several other Internet companies, including
Lycos and Excite, announced stock splits, prompting their shares to
jump.)
</P>
<P>
   Another force pushing up the price of the stock, analysts said,
is the admission of defeat by investors who bet that Yahoo's stock
would fall by selling its shares short.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to
buy them later at a lower price. If the stock price then goes up,
as Yahoo's has, the short seller has to live with the prospect of
increasing pain or buy back the stock at a loss. This buying back
often drives prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be seen as an endorsement of its high valuation,
Yahoo also said Wednesday that it had sold $250 million worth of
stock to the Softbank Corp. of Japan at about $183 a share. The
deal increases the stake of Softbank, already Yahoo's largest
shareholder, from 29 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it wanted the extra cash as a reserve to use
for potential acquisitions or other expansions, but it said none
were planed yet. If the company does not spend the money, analysts
said, the interest alone will increase its earnings by about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it did not plan major expenditures on television ads
or other marketing efforts to counter the increased exposure that
two of its competitors will receive as part of recent linkups with
big media companies. General Electric's NBC unit has agreed to take
a controlling interest in Snap, and the Walt Disney Co. took a 43
percent stake in the Infoseek Corp. Both deals involve substantial
network TV promotion for the search services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that the media companies will spend a lot of
money and stir up the market,'' said Jeffrey Mallet, Yahoo's chief
operating officer. ``That will drive new users to the web, and if
we do our job right we will get our share of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Yahoo's shares is forcing many traditional investors
to rethink their long-held views about how to look at stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the old ways of valuing companies make sense
anymore,'' said Peter Tanous, the president of Lynx Investment
Advisory, a money management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he said, the Internet has all the hallmarks of
past investment fads. ``Forty years ago there was a frenzy about
the miraculous effect of chlorophyll, then all the chlorophyll
companies went bust,'' he said. ``Then there was the same thing
about bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tanous conceded that there may be something to all the
boasts that the Internet will really change the world. ``I've got
this lingering fear that the Internet stocks are for real. I just
don't know what to do about it,'' he said.

CELLUCCI DEFENDS 11-MONTH STEWARDSHIP OF STATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Has Acting Governor Paul Cellucci finally left the Rose
Garden?
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly frustrated by weeks of bad publicity, Cellucci
Wednesday stoutly defended his 11 months in office, contending that
he has kept the state's economy humming and insisted on high
educational standards.
</P>
<P>
   The animated defense of his administration marked a departure
from a more constrained style, in which Cellucci has tended to
ignore criticism and sidestep controversy while stressing consensus
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his failure to win passage of key initiatives from
the state Legislature, Cellucci insisted that he has done well,
even though most of his agenda remains stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said last July that the principal task in front of me was to
keep the economy of Massachusetts in high gear, and I don't think
anyone can argue, a year later, that the economy of Massachusetts
is not in high gear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed annoyed by campaign criticism from the other
gubernatorial candidates. On many issues, Republican rival Joseph
D. Malone hits Cellucci from the right and the three Democratic
hopefuls attack from the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a political year, I have a bunch of back-seat drivers,
these four candidates for governor, who if I go right, they say,
`He should have gone left,''' Cellucci said. ``I think we ought to
focus on results.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of his leadership, Cellucci said, was that the state
Board of Education last week reversed an earlier decision and voted
to insist on a higher passing standard for prospective teachers on
the state's new certification test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote last week to put those high standards back in place
sent a clear message to every city, every town, and every school
district in this state that we are going to hold the line on
standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he decided to push for higher test standards only after
first accepting the Board of Education's decision to lower the
passing grade, causing some observers to charge that he bungled the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several political and economic analysts Wednesday cautioned
that, despite Cellucci's claims of success, a governor's ability to
affect his state's economy is quite limited and that the
Massachusetts economy actually has not performed particularly well
compared to other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the budget management and the business climate today
in Massachusetts is better than it was a decade ago, but one should
have some humility about the effect any political figure or
officeholder can have on the state of the economy,'' said Robert
Woodbury, director of the McCormack Institute at the University of
Massachusetts-Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The major variable determining the health of any state economy,
Woodbury said, ``is the state of the national economy and even the
global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, however, insisted that Massachusetts is outperforming
the national economy and that his efforts had helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought the economy of this state back,'' he said. ``We've
gone from 3 percent above the national unemployment rate back in
1991. We're almost a full point below the national unemployment
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based
economic think tank, economist Jared Bernstein said the
Massachusetts recovery has not been extraordinary compared to that
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't that much to crow about in Massachusetts
over the longer run,'' Bernstein said. ``Job growth is flat, family
income at least through 1996 has fallen, and wage growth has been
negative for the typical worker through 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Bernstein said his research showed that
Massachusetts had about 3.1 million jobs in 1997, the same overall
level as 1989, which means the state hasn't experienced real job
growth during that period.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 through 1996, median income for a family of four
actually declined (in real dollar terms), from $65,542 to $62,385.
Meanwhile, the median hourly wage fell from $13.12 in 1989 to
$12.64 in 1997 (again, in real dollar terms), the economist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy certainly doesn't look like the 1980s, when wages
and income and jobs were growing at a decent clip in
Massachusetts,'' Bernstein said.

ADVERTISING: U.S. STARTS PAID AD CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Md., Colo., Conn., Calif., Ariz.)  (bl) 
 By COURTNEY KANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House's drug policy agency will introduce its first
paid national advertising Thursday as part of its fight against
drug use among adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will join Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director
of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in Atlanta to
introduce the campaign, the largest government-financed social
marketing effort to date. It will have an initial budget of $195
million, appropriated by Congress, and will involve television,
radio, print, billboards and interactive media.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to spend taxpayer money to finance the aggressive
anti-drug campaign is a marked change from the government's
longtime policy of watching from the sidelines as advertising and
media professionals coordinated unpaid anti-drug messages as public
service advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we will be able to buy the time slots in
the best media vehicles,'' said Thomas Hedrick, vice chairman of
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in New York, ``just like
Nike or McDonald's or Pepsi does on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, a nonprofit coalition of advertising and media
professionals, has supervised the anti-drug pro bono campaign since
1987. Though the media have donated the equivalent of more than
$2.5 billion worth of commercial time and ad space for anti-drug
advertising, Hedrick said, the organization has found it
increasingly difficult to reach specific audiences with specific
ads because the pro bono campaigns depend on the availability of
time and space.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a strong economy, exposure in desirable places
like popular prime-time TV series is difficult to obtain, and many
public service spots are relegated to late-night time slots when
few if any of the intended viewers are watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to pay for the precise placement we need to get
the right message to the right audience,'' Hedrick said, ``with
enough frequency to change attitudes and, over time, drug
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The national paid campaign comes after a six-month test in 12
cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Denver, Hartford, San Diego
and Tucson, Ariz. Each year for the next four years, Congress will
be asked to appropriate an additional $195 million to continue the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will begin appearing Thursday, will be a mix of
work already produced for the partnership and new spots.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, the media that will be selling the paid
time and space will be asked for such bonus or in-kind
contributions as public service advertising or programs or articles
addressing drug issues. For example, a TV network that receives ad
dollars for anti-drug commercials may agree to run an episode of a
sitcom in which a character confronts the problem of drug abuse or
may produce a segment on drug policy for a news magazine show.
</P>
<P>
   In the test markets, Hedrick said, the media matched the paid
ads with bonus contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The television part of the paid campaign is scheduled to appear
Thursday night on the four main broadcast networks _ ABC, CBS, Fox
and NBC _ and on CNN. The goal is for anti-drug spots to run about
9:15 Eastern time, on the five networks in a TV tactic known as a
roadblock. The Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age said that other
cable networks like ESPN2, ESPN News, MTV and VH1 had also
committed to run spots at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for ABC to run an anti-heroin commercial recently
created for the partnership by Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners in New
York. The spot updates the famous ``This is your brain on drugs''
commercial by showing a woman wrecking a kitchen with a frying pan
to simulate the effect that heroin can have on a life.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is scheduled to run a spot aimed at parents that features
actor Carroll O'Connor, whose son died after years of drug abuse.
On Fox, teen-age viewers are the intended audience for a commercial
with the rap star Chuck D. The spot planned for NBC is aimed at
young parents, and the spot on CNN, to run during ``Larry King
Live,'' is also aimed at parents, addressing the need to discuss
drugs with their children.
</P>
<P>
   The print part of the campaign is set to begin Thursday in
big-city newspapers. One hard-hitting ad, titled ``Disconnect,'' is
meant to illustrate a generation gap about drugs. A photograph of a
woman is accompanied by these words: ``My kid doesn't smoke pot.
He's either at school, soccer practice, piano lessons or at a
friend's house.'' Underneath is a photograph of a boy, who says,
``I usually get stoned at school, after soccer practice, before
piano lessons or at my friend's house.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads for the paid campaign are being donated by agencies
through the partnership, which is serving as an unpaid consultant
and will receive no Federal money. Media planning and buying are
being handled by Bates USA in New York, part of Cordiant
Communications Group PLC, and Zenith Media Services in New York,
which is owned by Cordiant and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Americans consider anti-drug advertising a necessary
component of the federal war on drugs, some perceive the ambitious
crusade as money ill spent.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center in New York,
a drug policy research organization that is part of the Open
Society Institute sponsored by financier George Soros, said: ``For
the past 10 years, our nation's kids have been bombarded with
anti-drug messages, and it is these same kids who are experimenting
with more drugs. While these ads are well intended, this money
could be better spent on programs that are proven effective in
reducing drug use, such as after-school programs and treatment on
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedrick, needless to say, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how it is a big waste of money,'' he said.
``We have seen in independent research a strong and consistent
correlation between exposure of anti-drug messages and improving
anti-drug attitudes and behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no more cost-effective way'' to deter drug
use, he added, ``than by investing 1 percent of the federal
anti-drug budget in this public-private partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hedrick said, ``the proof will be in the pudding.'' The
partnership is awaiting the results of research from the 12 test
markets, which are expected sometime in the fall, he said. There
will also be research to evaluate the effectiveness of the national
paid campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations are also offering their assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The American Advertising Federation in Washington _ which
represents agencies, media and marketers _ will serve as a
clearinghouse for matching public service advertising in 100 local
markets where the paid campaign will appear.
</P>
<P>
   And the Advertising Council in New York _ the nonprofit
organization that coordinates public service campaigns for the
agency and media industries _ will serve as a clearinghouse for
matching public service advertising nationally.

MEXICAN REBEL CHIEF'S 5-MONTH SILENCE RAISES DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVENTIC, Mexico _ The Zapatista Indian rebels who were standing
watch at the gated entrance to this village the other day were
terse when asked about the leaders of their guerrilla army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top commanders are not here,'' one rebel said gruffly
through an orange bandana. ``We don't know where they are. Our
orders are not to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentinels outside this rebel stronghold in the Chiapas
mountains were fielding a question that was familiar, because
virtually everyone is asking it these days. Where is Subcommander
Marcos, the chief strategist and spokesman of the Zapatista
National Liberation Army?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos has been a prolific author of long-winded communiques,
essays and political fables composed in colorful ironic prose that
he issues by electronic mail from his hideouts, believed to be in
the jungles of Chiapas. But since late February he has been silent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months the government sent troops to crush
offices of ``mayors'' that the Zapatistas had set up in four towns
in opposition to officials from the government's party. At least
six rebels have been killed in the attacks, and dozens have been
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marcos said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say his real name is Rafael Sebastian
Guillen Vicente. But the public is not entirely sure of his
identity, because he has not been seen without his ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7 Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the leader of the Roman
Catholic diocese that includes most of the Indian villages in
Chiapas, resigned as the central mediator in peace talks between
the government and the Zapatistas, protesting the government
crackdown. Ruiz was the only person in the negotiations, which are
stalled, whom the wary Zapatistas seemed to trust.
</P>
<P>
   Still Marcos said nothing when the bishop stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   A group of federal lawmakers who also mediate went to Chiapas in
mid-June to try to make contact with Marcos. They did not find him.
</P>
<P>
   The leader's last appearance was on a videotape that he sent
Feb. 28 to a delegation of European human rights observers. The
group had asked to meet him. But he said on the tape that the
Mexican army had occupied many Zapatista villages and that it was
too dangerous for him to come out of hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of response from Marcos and the top Indian leaders has
left the appearance of disarray in the guerrilla army. On June 10
in the town of El Bosque firefights erupted when Zapatista militia
members shot back at government forces. That was the first time
that the Zapatistas had broken a cease-fire in Chiapas in more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The poorly armed militia members seem to have fired in a moment
of panic to defend themselves against an assault by hundreds of
government troops. But the top commanders never clarified whether
the shooting meant that they had abandoned the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos' absence has led to rumors. Some say he is languishing in
the jungle with malaria. Last week officials in neighboring
Guatemala denied a swirl of reports that the army there had
captured him.
</P>
<P>
   There was even playful speculation that one of several men in
brown-and-olive Zapatista uniforms and black ski masks who appeared
in the crowd when Mexico played at the World Cup soccer matches in
France might be the real Marcos. &QL;

DECLARING RAPE A WAR CRIME IS STALLED BY SEMANTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A dispute between women's groups and the Vatican over a
legal term has broadened into a battle of religion and gender
politics that could jeopardize agreement on whether rape will be
declared a war crime by an international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   There is wide consensus at a U.N. conference that rape is a war
crime that should be prosecuted by an international tribunal.
Women's groups have fought to have a treaty include ``enforced
pregnancy'' as a war crime, for the act of impregnating women and
forcing them to bear children as tools of ethnic reprisal, as in
the case of forcing Croatian women to have Serbian babies.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican agrees that such rapes are war crimes, but is
troubled by the term ``enforced pregnancy,'' fearing it could be
broadly interpreted as an invitation to challenge anti-abortion
laws in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   And that dispute has polarized many of the 159 delegations that
have only days left to negotiate rules for a permanent tribunal to
prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has become one of the most glaring and painful
examples of just how contentious and intractable the process of
negotiating a treaty on war crimes is.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of enforced pregnancy is marginal next to the more
fundamental questions about the court's jurisdiction and authority.
But it is one of many seemingly secondary issues that could thwart
a consensus. ``Everybody is consumed by whether the big five issues
can be resolved,'' said one member of a Western delegation who
asked not to be named. ``But we are forgetting that items 6 through
30 could just as easily throw a wrench into a successful
negotiation of the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   There is universal support at the conference for the principle
that individuals who commit genocide or other atrocities should be
held accountable. But as they negotiate the details, delegates
remain deeply divided over some of the most fundamental issues of
the court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Countries as closely allied as Canada and the United States are
battling over how powerful and independent an international
prosecutor should be. The United States, which fears that American
peacekeeping troops could be dragged before international judges on
frivolous charges, wants to limit the prosecutor's power to
initiate cases.
</P>
<P>
   Canada and some 50 other countries known as the ``like-minded
group'' insist that unless the prosecutor has broad authority to
bring charges independently, the court will be toothless. Many
third-world countries worry that their sovereignty could be
undermined by an independent prosecutor _ or one who is called in
on a case by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, one of the articles that seemed most assured of being
included in the treaty _ making rape and other acts of violence
against women war crimes on the same footing as torture _ is now
under heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates worry that the battle over the wording of
``enforced pregnancy'' could deadlock the negotiations and sharply
limit the kinds of crimes against women that the prosecutor could
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``By including this term, you create a mandate for a prosecutor
to investigate this particular crime,'' said Katherine Hall
Martinez, a member of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice in the
International Criminal Court, a nongovernmental organization
lobbying the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only seven working days left,'' she said, and rape
and the entire list of crimes against women that appeared in the
draft treaty were deleted from a discussion paper submitted to the
delegations on Tuesday and were described as being ``under
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The deletion was meant to jump-start negotiations on the court's
jurisdiction. The draft treaty, which was crafted at a preparatory
meeting, included ``enforced pregnancy'' along with ``rape, sexual
slavery, enforced prostitution, enforced sterilization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Enforced pregnancy is a slightly confusing term crafted by
rights organizations to describe the act of repeatedly raping women
with the intention of making them pregnant with the seed of their
enemy. Such crimes occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as
Rwanda. But the ad hoc tribunals investigating charges of
atrocities in the Balkans and Rwanda have not included enforced
pregnancy among the crimes. Even charges of rape in Bosnia were
formally filed in only one case _ under the insistence of women's
groups and human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, as well as many Islamic countries and American
anti-abortion rights lobby groups, agrees that such kinds of rape
are war crimes, but complain that enforced pregnancy is too general
a term, and that it could be used to challenge countries that have
anti-abortion laws on their books.
</P>
<P>
   No Vatican representative was willing to comment on the debate
Wednesday. One member of the Holy See's delegation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``We are deeply sensitive to this
issue. We have nuns and brothers who go to these war-torn areas to
heal the victims and end up becoming victims themselves. But we
have a juridical problem with the term.'' He added, ``States which
have legislation protecting right to life could end up being
charged with enforced pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups insist that the issue is entirely separate from
the dispute over abortion rights. But it is a measure of how deep
the ideological rift is that each side suspects the other of hidden
motives. ``We are basically reliving the attack on the women's
platform at Beijing,'' said Rhonda Copelon, director of the legal
secretariat of the International Women's Caucus, referring to the
1995 United Nations conference on women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Copelon and other representatives of nongovernmental
organizations said they detected signs at the conference of
backsliding on a variety of gender issues. Members of the Women's
Caucus said their efforts to have a meeting with the Holy See
delegation were rebuffed. Ms. Copelon said that omitting mention of
enforced pregnancy from the list of war crimes against women was
unacceptable. ``It denies a very grave crime for purely political
reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand is one of several countries that strongly supported
the inclusion of enforced pregnancy as a war crime, and are now
working behind the scenes to seek a compromise to keep it _ and the
entire article _ in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is one we are very concerned about _ with very good
reason if you look at what has happened in Bosnia,'' said Donald
Mackay, a New Zealand delegate to the conference who is Under
Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Noting that the issue had been caught
up in some ``theological aspects,'' Mackay said, ``We have been
engaged in a lot of discussions to find ways to define the term in
a way that will preserve the concept, and not give way on the
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided even members of the same delegation. One
lawyer who is a delegate from a Latin American country said her
government had yielded to pressure from the Catholic Church to
oppose the enforced pregnancy article. ``Personally, I strongly
disagree,'' she said. ``But I cannot speak for myself on this
issue. I have to uphold my government's position.'' &QL;

Texas EDUCATION BOARD MAY DUMP DISNEY STOCK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS SANCHEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The State Board of Education will vote to shed the
Permanent School Fund's 406,000 shares of Walt Disney Co. stock in
response to a growing national protest against the media giant, the
board chairman predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By divesting itself of Disney stock, valued at $43 million at
market close Wednesday, the state board would become the first
governmental entity in the country to divest stock as a result of
the year-old Disney boycott, said David Miller, an official with
American Family Association, one of many religious and conservative
groups pressing for a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months I've been wanting to divest,'' Board Chairman Jack
Christie said. ``Not as a boycott of Disney, but just as a strong
message: We're not interested in promoting the horrendous films put
out by Miramax,'' a Disney subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, a Republican, has often opposed a minority faction of
social conservatives on the board. By teaming with the
conservatives, Christie is expected to swing Democrats with him to
win the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Disney spokesman John Dreyer told The Associated Press he knows
of no other state investment fund considering divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have returned great value to our shareholders. We continue
to return great value to our shareholders,'' he said. ``I would
hope that the board would be consistent in its entire portfolio for
its criteria for owning stock.''
</P>
<P>
   State board member Will Davis of Austin agreed, saying it is not
a bad idea to make investment decisions based on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do so based on financial merit,'' he said.
``That's the only test.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the chairman of the Committee on School Finance, which
is scheduled to take up the Disney divestiture issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the finance committee recommends divestiture, the full board
will take a final vote on the issue later in the day. If the motion
to divest is rejected, the full board does not have to take it up.
.MDNM/ One of the primary responsibilities of the 15-member board
is to oversee the investments of the $17 billion Permanent School
Fund, which is projected to earn more than $1.3 billion during the
current two-year budget cycle. The money helps fund public
education.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Bradley, a social conservative, said that if
Christie supports divestiture, the move to sell Disney stock is
virtually assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's disappointing is that it took Chairman Christie almost
eight months to get this on the agenda for an up or down vote,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie said that he had hoped to divest ``quietly'' by having
money managers sell the stock, which is allowable, instead of
raising the issue at a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Randy Stevenson of Tyler said, ``While divestiture
... may not have a direct financial impact upon the Disney
Corporation itself, it is my hope that a strong, clear message will
be sent to Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago, the Southern Baptist Convention voted
overwhelmingly to boycott Disney, accusing the company of
``promoting immoral ideologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of conservative and religious groups have
followed suit. The Texas Board of Education began to consider
divestiture in response to a plea from the American Family
Association, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that we do not feel that it's morally
responsible for the state to be investing education dollars into
this kind of product,'' Miller said. He predicted that if a Texas
governmental entity sells Disney stock, other states will take
notice.
</P>
<P>
   His group has produced a video that shows scenes from various
movies made by Miramax. Among Miramax movies are ``Sling Blade,
Pulp Fiction'' and ``Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said that after viewing the video, he was in favor of
selling the Disney stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard in good conscience to invest the children of Texas'
education money in the type of violence and immorality that is
being created by Disney,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie has tried previously to get the board to sell a
politically unpopular stock. In May 1996, the board rejected his
recommendation to dump $9 million in tobacco investments for
``social, business and moral reasons.'' In that case, board members
urged fund managers to keep the stock if it continued to produce
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Texas Legislature placed a ``gangsta rap'' rider
in the appropriations bill barring state pension funds from being
invested in companies that produce pornographic or extremely
violent lyrics. A state district judge struck down the rider.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Texas Freedom Network, which monitors the
conservative movement, said the move against Disney will hurt
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of a special interest group trying
to make a political point at the expense of taxpayers,'' said Rick
Levy, a Freedom Network board member.
</P>
<P>
   Since state officials bought Disney stock in July 1996 at $60.85
a share, earnings have grown 12 percent and dividends have grown 21
percent annually, Texas Education Agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   TEA staff analysts believe that this growth will continue for
three to five years at a rate of 15 percent to 17 percent annually,
officials said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   But board member Robert H. Offutt of San Antonio isn't
convinced. His personal views of Disney aside, Offutt said, he
believes that the national boycott is beginning to affect the value
of Disney stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has underperformed the market since the beginning of
the year,'' he said. ``The social issues that others have raised
will affect the bottom line.''

GUNMAN ACTED ALONE IN SOUTH TEXAS KILLINGS, OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ A San Benito construction worker was alone
when he went on a deadly rampage early Tuesday that claimed five
lives, including his own, law enforcement authorities said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said it was doubtful any other
suspects will be identified other than Ernest Lane Moore, 25, who
died Tuesday evening in a Harlingen hospital. Authorities initially
suspected two others were with Moore at the time of the first
killings, but interviews with eyewitnesses Wednesday confirmed that
Moore acted alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're feeling more confident there was one
individual, the suspect who was shot, Ernest Moore,'' Lucio said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blood bank officials in Harlingen said record numbers
of donors have lined up to replace the large amount of blood
products consumed during attempts to save those injured during the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Moore, armed with an assault weapon, went
looking for his former girlfriend, Julie Cox, early Tuesday in the
small community of Rio Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   Moore shot and seriously wounded Dan Morin, a 22-year-old who
had been dating Cox, and killed Morin's mother, Margarita Flores,
53, and older sister, Delia Morin, 31.
</P>
<P>
   After family members wrested the gun from Moore, he fled to his
home outside San Benito and got another assault weapon and shot and
killed two Border Patrol agents and wounded a sheriff's deputy.
Moore was fatally shot in the exchange, but officers continued to
search the area for several hours in case there were others.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Morin, Delia Morin, a brother and Julie Cox all worked at a
San Benito family restaurant named a la Texas, according to a
statement issued Wednesday by owner Christine Stubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all deeply saddened at the loss of Delia Morin, who was
an exemplary employee and pleasant co-worker,'' the statement
reads. It said the four workers ``always strive to do their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement concluded by saying Stubbs was not informed about
her employees' personal relationships and could not comment on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Morin remained in critical condition Wednesday, and family
members say he was shot four times in the abdomen by Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A joint funeral will be held Friday in San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   Two Border Patrol agents, Ricardo Salinas, 24, and Susan
Rodriguez, 28, were gunned down near Moore's home as they prepared
to begin a search for him in a cornfield. Cameron County sheriff's
Deputy Raul Rodriguez was with the agents and shot in the chest.
Hospital officials said he was improving and upgraded his condition
to stable.
</P>
<P>
   Services were scheduled for Moore on Thursday at a San Benito
cemetery, and on Friday in Harlingen for Border Patrol agent
Rodriguez. Services for Salinas, a San Antonio native, will be held
in that city Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Delaunay, a hospital service coordinator for the Red
Cross, said scores of blood donors lined up outside Harlingen
offices to give blood to replace more than 75 units used Tuesday on
the shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just coming in and talking about what went on
yesterday, and they want to do their part and give blood,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 49 units of blood were donated and more than 60 on
Wednesday, greatly exceeding the five or 10 units normally given
each day, Delaunay said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those waiting to donate were Margaret Mertens, a member of
the Sisters of Divine Providence, who works at a refugee shelter in
San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided we could give blood, this is one way we can help the
families, and the hospital, which they say is short on blood,'' she
said.

4 ANTI-GOVERNMENT MILITANTS CONVICTED OF MORE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A federal jury in Montana on Wednesday convicted four
top leaders of the Freemen anti-government movement of a huge
banking conspiracy but declared itself hopelessly deadlocked on
many other charges against the four and eight others.
</P>
<P>
   Those convicted were LeRoy Schweitzer, Daniel Petersen, Dale
Jacobi and Russell Landers. The four and two other Freemen, Rodney
Skurdal and Richard Clark, were convicted of other charges by the
same jury last Thursday, including threatening to kidnap and kill a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of deliberation, the jury failed to reach a
verdict on charges against half of the 12 Freemen whom the
government brought to trial in late May, two years after they
surrendered at their remote Montana compound.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors failed to convict Ralph Clark, uncle of Richard
Clark and the owner of the ranch; Casey Veldhuizen, a ranch hand;
William Stanton and his wife, Agnes, neighboring ranchers, and John
McGuire, a Freemen from California. The jury also failed to reach a
verdict on charges against Cherlyn Petersen, who was found not
guilty of two firearms charges last week.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the jury reached verdicts on about half of the 126
charges against the 12 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour declared a mistrial on
the unresolved counts and gave prosecutors 10 days to decide
whether they would seek to retry the defendants. Coughenour said
McGuire and the two women were free to go. The other three men the
jury did not convict are to stay in jail to face state charges.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Sherry Scheel Matteucci said she did not know what
the government would decide about a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the jury also convicted Schweitzer and Landers of one
additional count of bank fraud, Schweitzer of filing a false
federal tax claim and Petersen and Jacobi of five additional counts
of mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The jury failed to reach any verdict on armed robbery charges
stemming from two thefts of cameras from network television crews
at gunpoint. Noting that films of the confrontations were shown in
the courtroom, one trial monitor Wednesday read the jury's failure
to convict as an anti-press message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Princess Di factor,'' said Ken Toole, program
director for the Montana Human Rights Network, a group that
monitors hate groups. ``If it had been the local mercantile guy
delivering food, it might have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the verdicts fueled longstanding complaints that the
federal government had been slow to act against the Freemen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time federal agents moved against the Freemen's compound,
in March 1996, the Freemen had tried to pass 3,432 bogus checks,
with a total face value of $15.5 billion. &QL;

 &HT;    Clinton comes to town
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- President Clinton will arrive in Atlanta at 9:05 this
morning for a 4 1/2-hour stay during which he will launch a media
campaign against teen drug use and attend a Democratic fund-raising
effort for Senate candidate Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit on Air Force One isn't expected to affect
local air traffic, but it could generate some tie-ups for morning
commuters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming and going during quiet times of the day. It should
be pretty straightforward, in and out,'' said Paul Meyer,
operations manager at Hartsfield International Airport, where the
president's plane will arrive and depart.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential motorcade is expected to move north along I-85
and the Downtown Connector to the Georgia World Congress Center for
a 10:10 a.m. appearance at the anti-drug event. Authorities will
use a ``rolling roadblock,'' which in essence closes the freeway in
front of and behind the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier statements issued by public relations
officials associated with the anti-drug campaign, the World
Congress Center program will not be open to the public. Instead,
about 700 invited guests will be permitted to attend, according to
White House official John Salomon.
</P>
<P>
   The political fund-raising effort the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee is holding for Coles will begin with a reception
at 11:30 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, followed by a $500-a-plate
luncheon. Both events are restricted to political contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to give details of the president's routes due
to security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Sgt. Phasteus Brooks of the Atlanta police Special
Operations unit said on-street parking won't be allowed along the
International Boulevard corridor from Marietta Street to Piedmont
from 9 a.m. to noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorists should avoid that area around those times and people
should expect some traffic backup along the interstate,'' Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave on Air Force One at 1:35 for
Daytona Beach, Fla., where he will meet with firefighters, relief
workers and residents of areas hit by recent wildfires in central
Florida.

 &HT;    Peachtree masters winner's competitive desire reborn at age 50
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For Dick Buerkle, winning the masters division of
this year's Peachtree Road Race shared one similarity with running
in the 1976 Olympics: no prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Buerkle stunned the Peachtree field by finishing first in the
over-40 division with a time of 32:50. At 50, he's a decade older
than the youngest, and usually fastest, runners in that category.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of them didn't show up this July 4 because the Atlanta
Track Club, which organizes the race, didn't offer a purse,
electing instead to put its resources into hosting the elite
runners. For them, the Peachtree served as the $100,000 World
Championship of Road Racing. Most years, the masters prize money is
about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've used the bucks,'' said Buerkle (pronounced
``burk-lee''), who teaches Spanish and coaches runners at Dunwoody
High School. He has three children in college and is working as a
temporary worker this summer to make extra money. ``If there was a
race in Macon that day that paid money, I would have gone there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta is his adopted hometown, and he loves the Peachtree,
so he ran, even though he knew no money was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accident of history, we didn't have a purse this year, but
we're delighted that we could honor one of our own,'' race director
Julia Emmons said. ``His time was remarkable in any venue. We would
all like to hit our 50s in the style he is accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peachtree victory is the latest incarnation of Buerkle's
running career. Originally from Rochester, N.Y., he competed in the
5,000 meters in the 1976 Olympics, finishing ninth in his
qualifying heat. When he set the indoor record for the mile
(3:59.09) two years later, his picture appeared on the cover of
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   He qualified for the Olympic team in 1980 but did not compete in
Moscow because of the U.S. boycott. Running at the highest level of
his sport, against the Russians at the height of the Cold War,
placed Buerkle under pressure that brings agony to his voice when
he recalls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' he said. ``I wanted it to be over. It wasn't
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Atlanta in 1979 to take a job with Coca-Cola, and
finished in the top 10 in the Peachtree that year, his best finish
in the open field. Unlike that year, when he could see winner Craig
Virgin ahead of him, he had no idea how he was doing amid this
year's crush of 55,000 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I just ran as fast as I could, and everyone who
looked older I would try to pass and beat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The slowest masters winning time before Buerkle's was 30:26, and
he acknowledged that he has to trim a couple minutes to contend in
most masters races. But he termed the Peachtree ``not bad'' for the
training he put in, most of it on cobblestone streets in Spain
during a recent trip there with his students.
</P>
<P>
   The sport occupies a different place in his life now because of
his work. Before teaching, he had a series of jobs, including sales
and sports writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He's also
battled attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember hearing him express disinterest in masters
competition at age 40,'' said his Olympic teammate Don Kardong, now
president of the Road Runners Club of America. ``He was just busy
with other stuff, I guess. I kind of assumed that he was out of the
competitive end of the sport for good. ... Now, he's running so
fast at age 50, it makes me disappointed that he didn't start his
masters career when he turned 40. He's obviously maintained a high
level of talent and ability to run fast with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Buerkle didn't have the time to train or the inclination to
compete. He gained 25 pounds, which he lost two years ago ``after I
got sick of being fat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to run to maintain fitness,'' said Buerkle,
who during the school year commutes by foot and MARTA, ``but I
never thought about competing again. ... When I'm coaching 65 to 70
hours a week, that's not conducive to anything but going home and
going to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peachtree victory has made him reconsider. He may seek out
masters races, perhaps in Mexico, that offer prize money. But he
wants to avoid the high pressure and obsession demanded of the top
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fear of getting lost in it _ putting my eggs in one
basket and getting hurt,'' he said. ``There are other things that
keep me from focusing on it too much _ coaching and teaching will
always be it for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be in shape, and I miss this feeling,'' he added.
``I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the workouts and being
in shape. It's kind of like missing getting hit in the head with a
hammer, but I miss the effort of being in the race.''

 &HT;    Frank talk about race
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Fixing the race problem in the United States requires
blunt talk, and that honest discourse must start at the top,
President Clinton was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem with the race dialogue is I feel you were
reluctant to deal with the question of affirmative action,''
Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page said to Clinton during a
discussion on race videotaped Wednesday by the PBS program ``The
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight panelists, most of them prominent media members, discussed
the complexities of race relations in an America that is no longer
just black and white. And they mostly agreed that racism has to be
redefined to keep up with changing conditions and subtle nuances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dialogue on Race with President Clinton'' will air
nationally on some PBS stations today. In the Atlanta area, WGTV
will broadcast the program Tuesday at 7 p.m. WPBA does not plan to
air it until at least September.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong discussion with Clinton comes as race relations
pushed to the forefront of the nation's consciousness from several
different quarters:
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the oldest daughter of a Texas black man who was
chained to a truck and dragged to his death last month urged a
Senate committee to strengthen the federal law against hate crimes.
``The men who murdered my father had a choice,'' Renee Mullins, 27,
said Wednesday of the three white men accused in the case. ``And
they chose violence. Therefore, the laws of the land should punish
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille O. Cosby, wife of comedian Bill Cosby, blamed racism for
their son's murder last year. ``I believe America taught our son's
killer to hate African Americans,'' Mrs. Cosby wrote in a column
published Wednesday in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed in Wednesday's discussion when Page
told the president: ``Racism is institutional. We are talking about
history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's race advisory board suggested that the president
abandon the notion of creating a colorblind society. Stereotypes
remain, board Chairman John Hope Franklin told Clinton, because
Americans persist in believing that it's best to ignore race. ``If
one ignores or eliminates consideration of race,'' Franklin wrote,
``there is no way to deal with the manifestations of racial bias or
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP opens its 89th annual convention in Atlanta on
Saturday. The oldest civil rights organization in the nation will
hear from Vice President Al Gore, retired Gen. Colin Powell and
Jesse Jackson, among others, during the six-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957, will install
his son, Martin Luther King III, as president July 25 in the
opening event of the group's July 26-29 national convention in
Landover, Md.

 &HT;    Speeds top 220 mph in AMS tests
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- One thing is certain now about the upcoming Atlanta
500 Classic, Aug. 27-29. Someone will go faster than 200 mph, and
might even get up to 230 on Atlanta Motor Speedway's 1.54-mile
quad-oval.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League drivers conducted tests at AMS under the
lights for the first time Monday and Tuesday, and Tuesday night,
Tony Stewart turned a lap of 228.505 mph, the fastest by a
new-formula IRL car.
</P>
<P>
   The previous fastest lap of 228.012, also by Stewart, was run at
the True Value 500 last month at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart set an unofficial track record of 226.406 Monday night
at Atlanta in the Glidden-Menards Special Dallara/
Aurora/Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 30-lap run tonight, and I had a good 227 lap at the
end of that,'' Stewart said. ``I passed high and low all night in
turns 1, 3 and 4. I tell you that the people who don't come and
watch this race are going to miss a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Racing teammates Mark Dismore and Scott Sharp were
second- and third-fastest, respectively, with laps of 221.494 and
221.079. Rookie Robby Unser, son of three-time Indianapolis 500
champion Bobby Unser, was fourth-fastest at 218.079 in the
Children's Beverage Group-Team Cheever Dallara/Aurora/Goodyear.

   Panoz in Playboy
</P>
<P>
   Team Panoz isn't racing this weekend, but the name still makes
the news: Danny Panoz is in Playboy magazine. Well, his car is,
anyway. The August issue features a half-page photo and article on
page 33 about the Panoz Roadster, built right up the road in
Braselton. It was the younger Panoz's interest in cars that led to
Team Panoz, the Panoz GTR and the purchase of Road Atlanta by dad,
Don Panoz. The article quotes Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones as
saying the Panoz is ``the great American roadster.'' Lusk fifth in
Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Lusk of Bainbridge finished fifth Sunday in the 250 class
of the Mazda Truck Motocross Nationals Red Bud Track 'n' Trail at
Buchanan, Wis. Jeff Emig of Riverside, Calif., won the event. Lusk,
with one victory on the 12-event series, is fifth in the point
standings with 189. Doug Henry of Oxford, Conn., leads the points
race with two victories and 243 points. The event will be broadcast
on ESPN2 at 1 p.m. July 18 and noon July 19.

 &HT;    Bond backs Cosby's assertion American-bred hate killed her son
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The racism that Camille O. Cosby claims saturates
American history and led to the murder of her son has not
diminished, a prominent civil rights leader said Wednesday, and the
only way to halt its spread is with strong, swift punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, which convenes here this week for
its national convention, agreed with Cosby's nationally published
column that stated America taught her son's white murderer to hate
him because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby's son, Ennis, died Jan. 16, 1997 after a young white man
shot him in the head as he changed a tire by the roadside in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A jury on Tuesday convicted Mikail Markhasev, a Ukrainian, of
Cosby's murder. On Wednesday in USA Today, a column by the wife of
actor Bill Cosby appeared in which she wrote, ``I believe America
taught our son's killer to hate African-Americans. ... He said to
his friends, `I shot a nigger. It's all over the news.' ...
Markhasev did not learn to hate black people in his native country,
the Ukraine, where the black population was near zero.''
</P>
<P>
   She continues in the column saying America has honored slave
owners by featuring their faces on its currency, accepts images of
God and holy people as white and permitted scientific experiments
on African-Americans that harmed and killed them, such as a study
at the University of Texas in the late 1950s in which necessary
nutrients were withheld from the formula of black infants.
</P>
<P>
   Bond concurred with Cosby's assessment of the country and said,
``... she is absolutely correct. ... The genius of America is that
it allowed white people to be white.'' In their native countries
people defined themselves by their nationality such as Russian,
German or Irish, not by skin color, he said. ``When they came here
they became white people, and they became white people because
there were people here who were black.
</P>
<P>
   ``They adopted a superior status, either written into law in
past decades or assumed by them in the modern era. ... It was
absorbed by them ... in modern times and by the larger culture _
the media, movies, television which not in their entirety but with
an alarming frequency preached the inferiority of black people and
the superiority of white people.''
</P>
<P>
   The column spawned conversation on talk radio and popular black
radio stations. It was also the topic of CNN's TalkBack Live.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP convention leaders will not address race relations in
America as a separate issue during next week's convention because
of Cosby's column, Bond said, because the civil rights organization
has always focused on that issue throughout its history and is
intrinsic to the reason for its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Bond stressed that he did not want to create the impression that
all white people stand on one side of the racial divide and black
people stand on another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have have always been brave and courageous whites, and
for that matter, Asians and Native Americans, Hispanics, nonblack
people who have joined with us in the struggle for justice,'' he
said. ``That was true in the past and it's true today.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution must consist of more than discontinuing lessons of
hate, Bond said. ``We have to not only stop teaching people this,
we have to punish vigorously and quickly those people whose private
prejudices are acted out in public. Not only does this mean
murderers, but also the people who say, `Oh the apartment was
rented just five minutes ago,' or `I wanted to give you the job but
it was filled by somebody else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Brokaw, spokesman for Cosby, said Wednesday Cosby will not
be giving any interviews at all on her column, explaining that
``She wants the piece to stand on its own.''

CRAVEN BACK IN WINSTON CUP `LOOP' FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A race car reverberating in the background provided the perfect
mood music to the comeback of Ricky Craven this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world,'' Craven said into the phone, ``we'll win
a race here real soon and things will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven was speaking during a break from a test session at
Greenville-Pickens (S.C.) Speedway, where he was reacquainting
himself with the nuances of turning left. Sidelined by the effects
of post-concussion syndrome and an inner ear weakness since March
9, Craven is scheduled to return to the NASCAR Winston Cup wars for
the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, the 1995 Cup rookie of the year, says he has passed
every medical test of his balance devised by his battery of
doctors. His recent ninth-place finish in a NASCAR Busch Grand
National race on the challenging road course in Watkins Glen, N.Y.,
has fortified his self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Craven says he is glad to be back in the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Ricky. You've still got the job.
</P>
<P>
   But just how long can you keep it?
</P>
<P>
   That same nasty question has stopped haunting Todd Bodine, who
yesterday was released by ISM Racing after a half-season of
disappointing results. Meanwhile, Cup regulars Mike Skinner and Ted
Musgrave and their respective teams have been swatting out rumors
of their impending dismissals as the season swings into its second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that also was the tenor of Craven's teleconference
Tuesday. As rival team owner Bill Davis recently noted, Winston Cup
racing is a cutthroat business. Multimillion dollar sponsors demand
immediate results, or a new driver's resume. The pressure
associated with maintaining a high-profile Cup ride has already
claimed former series regulars Hut Stricklin, David Green and Wally
Dallenbach Jr.
</P>
<P>
   For Craven, that means his ensuing performances in the No. 50
Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo fielded by Hendrick Motorsports
will surely be measured against those rung up by replacements Randy
LaJoie and Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, the two-time and reigning NASCAR Busch Grand National
Series champion, logged one top five and three top 10s during his
nine-race run in Craven's car.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach, released this season by Sabates Racing, posted two
top-10 finishes in three recent starts. Craven saw the next
question coming before it was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been told that my job is on the line,'' said
Craven, who is winless in 34 Cup starts for Team Hendrick. ``Toward
the end of the recovery, I had heard some things. There's always
going to be some controversy. It's not comfortable. But my greatest
concern was getting myself back to 100 percent. I do have the
confidence that when I am 100 percent, I can compete at this level
and be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports is home, of course, to reigning Cup
champion and current points leader Jeff Gordon and teammate/former
champion Terry Labonte. They have combined to win 38 races and
three championships for Hendrick Motorsports since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's mostly chemistry,'' said Craven, who has missed
12 points-paying starts since finishing 34th in the Primestar 500
at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``What Jeff and Ray and the 24 team has
is phenomenal and very difficult to duplicate. (Crew chief) Andy
Graves and Terry and the 5 team are attempting to do that, and it
looks like they're making progress. But this is a better team now
than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   That being so, Craven said the only pressure he feels is
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't satisfy Hendrick Motorsports, then I certainly
won't satisfy myself,'' Craven said. ``Because I'm wanting the same
thing they're wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   To win a race here real soon. And to keep the job. &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona International Speedway continues as home away from
home for a diverse group affected by the fires that have ravaged
East Central Florida. John Story, director of public relations at
DIS, said approximately 300 firefighters, 100 evacuees and 70
National Guardsmen were living at the track as of Tuesday. ``We've
been providing as many as 2000 meals a day since last Thursday,''
said Story, who was among the inner circle of NASCAR officials who
opted to postpone the Pepsi 400 night race from July 4 until Oct.
17.
</P>
<P>
   Recuperating Cup rookie Steve Park got a little closer to the
heat of the Florida fires than the average motorist. ``I rode my
motorcycle to Florida and was there a few days. I couldn't believe
the devastation,'' said Park, who plans to return to the No. 1
Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis
next month. Meanwhile, the rescheduling of the Pepsi 400 will allow
Park to attempt to qualify for a race he otherwise would have
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Any talk of expanding the Winston Cup schedule automatically is
linked to the toll it takes on team personnel. NASCAR president
Bill France Jr. recently acknowledged that the Cup schedule is
likely to max-out at 36 or 37 races down the road. Add in the seven
test dates NASCAR currently allows each team, and the 52-week
calendar shrinks in a hurry. To combat driver burnout, France has
suggested the novel idea of two-driver teams. Each could feature
specialists on different types of courses who would alternate
behind the wheel and earn points for the team, instead of as
individuals. ``I'm not saying it's unrealistic to have two
drivers,'' France said. ``You have two tire-changers, two truck
drivers, why not two drivers? It would be more of a team-type
championship. That would let (the main driver) have a weekend off.
You wouldn't have to race every race. That would take a little heat
off the driver.'' Now all France has to do is sell the concept to
some of the most self-centered athletes on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing star Mark Martin, who shares the Cup series victory
lead with Jeff Gordon at four, is driving in pain. Martin has a
herniated disk that makes it painful to climb into and out of the
No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. ``I'm fine once I'm sitting in the
car,'' said Martin, who plans to delay surgery until season's end.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the Brickyard 400, Texas-owned Tyler Jet
Motorsports has scheduled a three-day test for Darrell Waltrip in
the No. 17 Chevy at Indianapolis Motor Speedway from July 19-21.
Former Fort Worth resident Kent Johnson, the team's general
manager, said a sponsor has been lined up for the race. But the
sponsor has put an embargo on any announcement until the week of
the race. &QL; 
IRL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 10,000 curious fans saw Pep Boys Indy Racing League
points leader Tony Stewart set an unofficial speed record for a
1.5-mile track during open testing at Atlanta Motor Speedway on
Tuesday night. Stewart turned a hot lap of 228.505 mph in his Team
Menard G Force/Aurora while testing for the inaugural Atlanta 500
Classic Weekend. Stewart had lapped at 226.406 mph Monday night.
Stewart set the official speed record for new formula IRL cars at
228.012 mph (lap 86) during the True Value 500K at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth last month. ``A lot of people were saying
that we were going to hit 230, but we didn't quite do it,'' Stewart
said. ``I don't think everyone showed everything they had, so it'll
be a little more competitive during qualifying.'' Kelley Racing
teammates Mark Dismore (221.494 mph) and Scott Sharp (221.079 mph)
were second- and third-fastest Tuesday in their Dallara/Auroras.
The race, scheduled Aug. 29, will be the first Indy-style event at
AMS since 1983 and first night race in the track's history. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Guthrie made his debut for Cobb Racing during the open test
at AMS. Guthrie, the 1997 IRL rookie of the year, has been
sidelined since a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May.
Guthrie's top lap was 217.865 mph in the G Force/Aurora owned by
former 24 Hours of LeMans winner Price Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach Jr., who has lost his full-time Winston Cup
ride, has been signed to a one-race deal to drive for
Pennzoil/Panther Racing in the Lone Star 500K at TMS on Sept. 20.
Team manager John Barnes said Dallenbach is scheduled to test
Goodyear tires at TMS on Aug. 4-5. Dallenbach, the Sports Car Club
of America Trans-Am champion in 1985-86, competed in four

Lights,'' said Rahal, driver of the Miller Lite Reynard/Ford. ``No
one from the Indy Racing League has contacted me about the ride,
though. For all the talk about `people not getting opportunities,'
I bet I'll get 99 percent of my letters and calls from guys in
Europe, South America and other international racing. Americans are
as good as anyone else, but it comes down to desire and if a guy
really wants it. For our team, it doesn't have to be an American.
We want someone who is capable of running up front.'' &QL;

   Almost 10 years to the day after a crash at Eldora Speedway
ended his Sprint Car career, Brad Doty plans to make one more lap
around the famed dirt track in Rossburg, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the annual Kings Royal, Doty was paralyzed from the
waist down in a wreck on the backstretch of the high-banked
half-mile on July 25, 1988. Doty is scheduled to pace the field for
the 40-lap, $50,000 to-win Pennzoil World of Outlaws main event on
July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Doty plans to drive a restored version of the No. 18 Coors Light
Gambler he campaigned during the 1987 Outlaws season. He won four
races and finished second to Steve Kinser in series points in the
car. Restored by Larry Woods, the car is equipped with
hand-operated controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the darkest days of my racing life was at Eldora
Speedway,'' Doty said recently. ``But one of my brightest days in
racing could quite possibly be at Eldora, when I get to make this
lap again.''
</P>

CRAVEN BACK IN WINSTON CUP `LOOP' FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A race car reverberating in the background provided the perfect
mood music to the comeback of Ricky Craven this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world,'' Craven said into the phone, ``we'll win
a race here real soon and things will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven was speaking during a break from a test session at
Greenville-Pickens (S.C.) Speedway, where he was reacquainting
himself with the nuances of turning left. Sidelined by the effects
of post-concussion syndrome and an inner ear weakness since March
9, Craven is scheduled to return to the NASCAR Winston Cup wars for
the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, the 1995 Cup rookie of the year, says he has passed
every medical test of his balance devised by his battery of
doctors. His recent ninth-place finish in a NASCAR Busch Grand
National race on the challenging road course in Watkins Glen, N.Y.,
has fortified his self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Craven says he is glad to be back in the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Ricky. You've still got the job.
</P>
<P>
   But just how long can you keep it?
</P>
<P>
   That same nasty question has stopped haunting Todd Bodine, who
yesterday was released by ISM Racing after a half-season of
disappointing results. Meanwhile, Cup regulars Mike Skinner and Ted
Musgrave and their respective teams have been swatting out rumors
of their impending dismissals as the season swings into its second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that also was the tenor of Craven's teleconference
Tuesday. As rival team owner Bill Davis recently noted, Winston Cup
racing is a cutthroat business. Multimillion dollar sponsors demand
immediate results, or a new driver's resume. The pressure
associated with maintaining a high-profile Cup ride has already
claimed former series regulars Hut Stricklin, David Green and Wally
Dallenbach Jr.
</P>
<P>
   For Craven, that means his ensuing performances in the No. 50
Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo fielded by Hendrick Motorsports
will surely be measured against those rung up by replacements Randy
LaJoie and Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, the two-time and reigning NASCAR Busch Grand National
Series champion, logged one top five and three top 10s during his
nine-race run in Craven's car.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach, released this season by Sabates Racing, posted two
top-10 finishes in three recent starts. Craven saw the next
question coming before it was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been told that my job is on the line,'' said
Craven, who is winless in 34 Cup starts for Team Hendrick. ``Toward
the end of the recovery, I had heard some things. There's always
going to be some controversy. It's not comfortable. But my greatest
concern was getting myself back to 100 percent. I do have the
confidence that when I am 100 percent, I can compete at this level
and be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports is home, of course, to reigning Cup
champion and current points leader Jeff Gordon and teammate/former
champion Terry Labonte. They have combined to win 38 races and
three championships for Hendrick Motorsports since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's mostly chemistry,'' said Craven, who has missed
12 points-paying starts since finishing 34th in the Primestar 500
at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``What Jeff and Ray and the 24 team has
is phenomenal and very difficult to duplicate. (Crew chief) Andy
Graves and Terry and the 5 team are attempting to do that, and it
looks like they're making progress. But this is a better team now
than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   That being so, Craven said the only pressure he feels is
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't satisfy Hendrick Motorsports, then I certainly
won't satisfy myself,'' Craven said. ``Because I'm wanting the same
thing they're wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   To win a race here real soon. And to keep the job. &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona International Speedway continues as home away from
home for a diverse group affected by the fires that have ravaged
East Central Florida. John Story, director of public relations at
DIS, said approximately 300 firefighters, 100 evacuees and 70
National Guardsmen were living at the track as of Tuesday. ``We've
been providing as many as 2000 meals a day since last Thursday,''
said Story, who was among the inner circle of NASCAR officials who
opted to postpone the Pepsi 400 night race from July 4 until Oct.
17.
</P>
<P>
   Recuperating Cup rookie Steve Park got a little closer to the
heat of the Florida fires than the average motorist. ``I rode my
motorcycle to Florida and was there a few days. I couldn't believe
the devastation,'' said Park, who plans to return to the No. 1
Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis
next month. Meanwhile, the rescheduling of the Pepsi 400 will allow
Park to attempt to qualify for a race he otherwise would have
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Any talk of expanding the Winston Cup schedule automatically is
linked to the toll it takes on team personnel. NASCAR president
Bill France Jr. recently acknowledged that the Cup schedule is
likely to max-out at 36 or 37 races down the road. Add in the seven
test dates NASCAR currently allows each team, and the 52-week
calendar shrinks in a hurry. To combat driver burnout, France has
suggested the novel idea of two-driver teams. Each could feature
specialists on different types of courses who would alternate
behind the wheel and earn points for the team, instead of as
individuals. ``I'm not saying it's unrealistic to have two
drivers,'' France said. ``You have two tire-changers, two truck
drivers, why not two drivers? It would be more of a team-type
championship. That would let (the main driver) have a weekend off.
You wouldn't have to race every race. That would take a little heat
off the driver.'' Now all France has to do is sell the concept to
some of the most self-centered athletes on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing star Mark Martin, who shares the Cup series victory
lead with Jeff Gordon at four, is driving in pain. Martin has a
herniated disk that makes it painful to climb into and out of the
No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. ``I'm fine once I'm sitting in the
car,'' said Martin, who plans to delay surgery until season's end.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the Brickyard 400, Texas-owned Tyler Jet
Motorsports has scheduled a three-day test for Darrell Waltrip in
the No. 17 Chevy at Indianapolis Motor Speedway from July 19-21.
Former Fort Worth resident Kent Johnson, the team's general
manager, said a sponsor has been lined up for the race. But the
sponsor has put an embargo on any announcement until the week of
the race. &QL;

   A crowd of 10,000 curious fans saw Pep Boys Indy Racing League
points leader Tony Stewart set an unofficial speed record for a
1.5-mile track during open testing at Atlanta Motor Speedway on
Tuesday night. Stewart turned a hot lap of 228.505 mph in his Team
Menard G Force/Aurora while testing for the inaugural Atlanta 500
Classic Weekend. Stewart had lapped at 226.406 mph Monday night.
Stewart set the official speed record for new formula IRL cars at
228.012 mph (lap 86) during the True Value 500K at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth last month. ``A lot of people were saying
that we were going to hit 230, but we didn't quite do it,'' Stewart
said. ``I don't think everyone showed everything they had, so it'll
be a little more competitive during qualifying.'' Kelley Racing
teammates Mark Dismore (221.494 mph) and Scott Sharp (221.079 mph)
were second- and third-fastest Tuesday in their Dallara/Auroras.
The race, scheduled Aug. 29, will be the first Indy-style event at
AMS since 1983 and first night race in the track's history. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Guthrie made his debut for Cobb Racing during the open test
at AMS. Guthrie, the 1997 IRL rookie of the year, has been
sidelined since a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May.
Guthrie's top lap was 217.865 mph in the G Force/Aurora owned by
former 24 Hours of LeMans winner Price Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach Jr., who has lost his full-time Winston Cup
ride, has been signed to a one-race deal to drive for
Pennzoil/Panther Racing in the Lone Star 500K at TMS on Sept. 20.
Team manager John Barnes said Dallenbach is scheduled to test
Goodyear tires at TMS on Aug. 4-5. Dallenbach, the Sports Car Club
of America Trans-Am champion in 1985-86, competed in four
Championship Auto Racing Teams events before moving to stock cars.
``Here's a guy that has a tremendous amount of talent and is a
great teammate,'' Barnes said of Dallenbach, who will be paired
with lead driver Scott Goodyear. &QL;

   TAMPA, Fla. _ Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams underwent a
magnetic resonance imaging examination Wednesday on his balky right
knee and, although the results were not announced, General Manager
Brian Cashman suspected good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be all right, because I'm sure they would have called
me if he wasn't,'' said Cashman, as he watched the Tampa Yankees
play at Legends Field. Williams, hitting .353 with 10 home runs and
44 runs batted in when he injured the knee June 10 on a slide
against Montreal, aggravated it on a throw from center field in a
Florida League game on Monday against Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he felt a sharp pain on the throw and promptly
iced the knee. He left the game in the fifth inning after going 1
for 2 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning I felt fine,'' he said, ``and it doesn't hurt
at all right now.'' &QL;

AT THIS HELSINKI HOME, BEWARE THE COMPUTER (AND THE DOG)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Pity the burglar who breaks into Risto
Linturi's new state-of-the-art computerized home. Scandinavia's
high-tech guru, Linturi has designed a house that takes care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after sensors signal his mobile phone that an intruder
is present, Linturi can track the burglar via voice-synthesized
messages and do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   With voice messages to the house's central computer, he can turn
lights on, increase or cut off air circulation, lock doors
automatically, and switch on music or the television at high volume
_ all while the system dials the police, reporting the exact time
of the break-in and the burglar's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Finns, Linturi is very comfortable with cutting-edge
technology. Finns are the world's most intense users of mobile
phones, with three out of four carrying one. Two out of four
navigate the Internet daily.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, Linturi, 38, has worked on a ``virtual
reality'' Yellow Pages guide to Finland's capital as technology
manager of the Helsinki Telephone Corporation. With pieces of it
already in place, it will allow residents and visitors to navigate
the streets of Helsinki in a virtual-reality taxi, enter its
theaters in real time, watch its movies for a fee, and listen to
public concerts free.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done with computers operated from homes that are
equipped with a mouse and interactive audiovisual devices and will
be fully operative in 18 months. So it seemed logical for Linturi,
soon after he acquired a prime piece of property on the Baltic Sea
three years ago, to dream up the ultimate computerized home.
</P>
<P>
   When finished some time in September, what Linturi calls ``the
future remote work-home in Finn Bay'' will have cost $3 million to
$4 million. The three-bedroom, four-story house and conference room
is atop a hill with an idyllic view of the serene Helsinki bay and
the city. It has a mooring station for one or two small sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   The house is designed for ultimate comfort and what Linturi
calls passive technology. ``The big emphasis is on economy, safety

TILLMAN DURDIN, 91, REPORTER IN WARTIME CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (bl) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tillman Durdin, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New
York Times who was one of the first to write about the Japanese
atrocities in China that became known as the Rape of Nanking, died
Tuesday at the Green Hospital in San Diego. He was 91 and lived in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1937, the year Japan invaded China, Durdin found himself
in Nanking, then the Chinese capital, when it was occupied by the
Japanese Imperial Army.
</P>
<P>
   There he became an eyewitness to the beginning of months of
atrocities inflicted on the Chinese by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of watching in horror, Durdin and several
other correspondents left the city, now known as Nanjing, for
nearby Shanghai in order to send dispatches to their newspapers
without hindrance from the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Mr. Durdin boarded a ship bound for Shanghai, he saw
200 Chinese men being executed by the Jpanese army,'' said Iris
Chang, a historian who wrote the best-selling book ``The Rape of
Nanking'' (Basic Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only wrote the pages of history under pressure, but
tried to save Chinese lives in Nanking. He should be remembered as
an examplar of humanity and courage in the darkest of times.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dispatch to The Times shortly after he arrived in Shanghai,
Durdin wrote: ``Just before boarding the ship for Shanghai, the
writer watched the execution of 200 men. The killings took 10
minutes. The men were lined against the wall and shot. Then a
number of Japanese, armed with pistols, trod nonchalantly around
the crumpled bodies, pumping bullets into any that were still
kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   From Shanghai he also wrote: ``The conduct of the Japanese army
as a whole in Nanking was a blot on the reputation of their
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their victory was marred by barbaric cruelties, by the
wholesale execution of prisoners, by the looting of the city,
rapes, killing of civilians and by general vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every able-bodied male was suspected by the Japanese of being
a soldier,'' he wrote. ``Civilians of both sexes and all ages were
also shot by the Japanese,'' and, ``Any person who, through
excitement or fear, ran at the approach of the Japanese soldiers
was in danger of being shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   Small bands of Chinese men ``who had sought refuge in dugouts
were routed out and shot or stabbed at the entrances of the bomb
shelters,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tank guns were sometimes turned on groups of bound soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back in the early 1990s, Durdin described how he felt
when he passed a Chinese soldier who was lying on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``His jaw had been shot away,'' Durdin said. ``There was nothing
I could do for him. I didn't know where to take him or what to do,
so I just stupidly decided to do something. I just put a $5 bill in
his hand, utterly useless to him, of course, but somehow I felt the
impulse to do something. He was just barely alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Durdin, whose full name was Frank Tillman Durdin, was born in
Elkhart, Texas, on March 30, 1907, and never lost his Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   He was remembered Wednesday as an extraordinary journalist by
Seymour Topping, a former foreign editor and managing editor of The
Times who is now the administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   As a correspondent for The International News Service and then
for The Associated Press, Topping said, ``I worked alongside of
Till covering the China civil war from 1946 to 1948, and later
during the French Indochina war'' in 1950 and 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of other young reporters,'' Topping said, ``I
looked at Till as role model, and in that sense he influenced a
whole generation of China correspondents. He wrote more of the raw
stuff of China history than any other correspondent I have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Durdin was introspective and taciturn, a meticulous reporter who
did not complain about the hardships of overseas duty. He and his
wife, Peggy, became sophisticated collectors of Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   Durdin attended Texas Christian University and years later was a
Nieman fellow at Harvard. He was a reporter for newspapers in Texas
and California and then worked as a reporter and editor of
English-language newspapers in China from 1930 to 1937.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the staff of The Times in 1937 and served as a foreign
correspondent in Asia, Africa and Europe until 1961, then spent
three years as a member of the Times' editorial board. From 1964 to
1967 he was a correspondent in Australia and the southwestern
Pacific area, then became the paper's Hong Kong bureau chief, based
there until his retirement in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Peggy Armstrong, whom he
married in 1938 and who has also written for The Times. &QL;

STATUS QUO ON VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the swirl of Mo Vaughn's rejection of the Red Sox' latest
contract offer _ this one for a guaranteed $37 million over four
years and without a counter-offer by Vaughn's representatives _ the
Red Sox made their way to Baltimore Wednesday night for the start
of the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, rehabilitating a strained right hamstring, did make a
brief Fenway appearance earlier in the afternoon but did not board
the bus that took the rest of his team to Logan Airport for its
trip to Baltimore. However, Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said Jimy
Williams expects Vaughn, who has missed the Sox' last eight games,
to be at Camden Yards later Thursday, when the manager will
determine Vaughn's questionable status.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, the Red Sox confirmed in a statement
that they negotiated with Vaughn's representatives during the
All-Star break in Colorado but that there was no agreement despite
making Vaughn ``a substantial offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' offer nonetheless begins to close the gap between
what Vaughn is seeking and what the club believes he is worth. For
one thing, it is believed to be the first time the Red Sox have
offered Vaughn more than a three-year proposal and doubles the term
of the two-year deal dismissed by Vaughn this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn sustained the hamstring injury while legging out an
infield hit in Miami June 26. He is leading Sox regulars in hitting
with a .327 average and in home runs with 21, and he's tied with
Nomar Garciaparra in RBIs with 56. The Red Sox have a record of 6-2
in Vaughn's absence and twice in the last three games achieved
season highs in runs (15) and hits (20).
</P>
<P>
   In previous rounds of contract discussions, Red Sox general Dan
Duquette has invoked the example of Cardinals first baseman Mark
McGwire as a benchmark against which Vaughn's contract should be
calculated. Last fall, McGwire signed a three-year deal with the
Cardinals for $28.5 million, with an option that can boost it to
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, however, has countered that McGwire took a so-called
``hometown discount'' because of special circumstances. McGwire was
bowled over by the reception he received in St. Louis, he was
reunited with manager Tony La Russa, who was his manager in
Oakland, and it allowed him a favorable custody-sharing arrangement
of his son with his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   A better barometer of the market, Vaughn and his agents have
said, are the $10 million deals signed by such sluggers as Sammy
Sosa of the Cubs, Albert Belle of the White Sox, and Gary Sheffield
of the Dodgers, and that market will go even higher when players
such as free agent eligible Mike Piazza, now with the Mets, signs
his next contract.
</P>
<P>
   And a richer contract even closer to home is the one the Red Sox
gave Pedro Martinez last December, a six-year, $75 million deal.
</P>

POISONOUS ACID SPILLED AT FOUR ABORTION CLINICS IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A poisonous, foul-smelling acid that irritates skin,
eyes and nasal passages was left Wednesday morning at four Houston
women's clinics where abortions are provided.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks mirrored five carried out at New Orleans clinics
Monday, and 11 that have occurred in Florida since May.
</P>
<P>
   The four southwest Houston clinics targeted Wednesday were among
nine involved in a Texas Supreme Court ruling Friday that upheld a
$1.2 million damage award against anti-abortion protesters who
staged large demonstrations at the clinics during and after the
1992 Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were called to the first office building just
before 8 a.m., where workers just arriving were met by a nauseous
stench from the rear entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Fire Department Assistant Chief Rick Flanagan said about
a gallon of butyric acid had been poured on the floor near the
building's rear entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The stench _ similar to rotten eggs _ entered the building's air
system and spread throughout the building. As workers began
experiencing difficulty breathing and nausea, the building was
evacuated and remained closed through the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too bad that women who need this service have to
put up with this,'' said Dr. Howard Novick, who operates the AAA
Concerned Women's Center on the fifth floor of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous-materials experts were called from that scene to
another office building, which houses A to Z Women's Health
Services and many other offices.
</P>
<P>
   A woman at that building had slipped and fallen in a pool of
butyric acid, twisting her knee. As in the first case, the stench
from the acid spread quickly through the building and forced
evacuation of all offices there for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The America's Women Clinic was the third victim. The only
free-standing clinic among the four targeted Wednesday, authorities
said it appeared the chemical had been forced through a hole
drilled in the door.
</P>
<P>
   That clinic, like the others, remained closed through the day as
the noxious chemical was cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   At Aaron Women's Medical Center Clinic, officials said it
appeared someone had poured butyric acid on a mat at the front
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Employees noticed the odor of the acid when they arrived
Wednesday morning, but said it was faint. They cleaned up the area
where the stench came from and remained open.
</P>
<P>
   About 1:30 p.m., hazardous-materials teams had to be called to
the site again, when it appeared people walking over the mat at the
front entrance had tracked the chemical through the building, and
it had begun making people sick.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said a total of 11 people were treated for nausea and
eye and throat irritation at the four sites and four of those were
taken to local hospitals, where they were treated and released
later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Life Advocates, a local antiabortion group, denied any
association with those who carried out the attacks, but noted that
the incidents may have spared the lives of unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue National, went a step
further, releasing a statement Wednesday that claimed ``the tactic
of using butyric acid has been used by the abortionists
themselves'' to turn attention to themselves and away from
``children being slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, told The
Associated Press, ``It's an act of lunacy. It does nothing to
further the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Durkin, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood
in Houston and Southeast Texas, called Wednesday's incidents part
of a ``traveling road show.''
</P>
<P>
   No Planned Parenthood offices were attacked Wednesday, but
Durkin said one of the clinics targeted in New Orleans on Monday
was a Planned Parenthood center.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks stretched the fire department's resources to their
limit, prompting it to institute its ``critical resources dispatch
procedure'' for about an hour Wednesday morning. Some
hazardous-material team members who were off Wednesday had to be
called in.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Floyd Wiltz said his agency is investigating the
incidents, along with the Houston police and fire departments, but
he declined to comment on specifics.

BOSTON MUSEUM REJECTS GUATEMALA'S CLAIM TO ANTIQUITIES 
</HEADLINE>

 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts has formally rejected a demand
by the Guatemalan government that the museum return antiquities
that Guatemala and prominent archeologists have said were looted
from Mayan gravesites and illegally exported two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA's rebuff was delivered two weeks ago, nearly seven
months after the museum unveiled a major new exhibition of
antiquities from the Americas, only to have its gala opening
clouded by charges that many of the artifacts were looted.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Enrique Zea Flores, Guatemala's vice minister for
culture, Wednesday deplored the MFA decision, saying he does not
consider the museum ``reputable'' because ``it does not respect the
cultural heritage of our country or our laws against looting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot call them a museum because that is a term of
honor,'' Zea Flores said from Guatemala City. ``Their collectors
buy looted pieces, and then they accept them. A real museum with
ethics would not accept looted goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Zea Flores said Guatemala soon will decide whether to file a
lawsuit to regain possession of the artifacts, which were donated
to the MFA in 1988 by museum benefactor Landon T. Clay.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 26 letter, which the Guatemalan government made
available to the Globe, MFA Director Malcolm Rogers informed Zea
Flores that after a ``thorough examination of applicable law, we
have found no basis for concluding that the Government of Guatemala
has any claim to ownership of the objects.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter provides no details of the MFA's review. Wednesday,
MFA spokeswoman Dawn Griffin declined to elaborate on the museum's
position or comment on Zea Flores's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are pre-Columbian artifacts that are part of a new
permanent exhibition on the Americas, Africa and Oceania that
opened Dec. 4. At the time, The Globe reported that many Mayan
antiquities in the exhibition most likely had been looted from
gravesites in Guatemala, and a 1987 review by Weld Henshaw, the
museum's outside counsel, had discovered they were shipped in the
late '70s and early '80s to the United States in violation of
Guatemalan export law.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the artifacts were illegally exported, the museum
has insisted that their import at the time did not violate US laws.
The MFA has said that in more recent years, its policy has been not
to acquire antiquities if there is evidence they were illegally
removed from their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexico's consul general in Boston, Hector
Vasconcelos, said Wednesday that he asked the MFA whether artifacts
in the exhibition originated in Mexico and how they were acquired.
He said he expects a response from the museum within a week or two.
Late Wednesday, however, Griffin said the museum responded to
Vasconcelos's concerns in an April letter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Vasconcelos emphasized that his government
has not filed any claim with the museum and would not do so unless
evidence surfaces that the objects were looted.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's dispute with the MFA, which dates back a decade, has
served to underscore a rift between many archeologists and museum
professionals. While many institutions have long decried the
desecration of ancient burial sites, others believe that
archeological treasures are better preserved and studied _ and
available to much larger audiences _ in major museums in the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
   In between the clandestine diggers and the curators who showcase
such artifacts is an unregulated international marketplace peopled
by smugglers, dealers, and well-known collectors who buy
undocumented antiquities and subsequently donate them to museums,
getting in return philanthropic credentials and, very often,
substantial tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Guatemala, the West African country of Mali has
also charged that at least two artifacts in the permanent
exhibition, which are on loan from an MFA overseer, William E.
Teel, were looted. Mali, like Guatemala an impoverished country,
has yet to file a formal claim.
</P>
<P>
   Zea Flores, who met with Rogers during a visit to Boston in
January, offered as part of any settlement to allow the MFA to
retain the artifacts for a period of time before returning them to
Guatemala. But after sending two more letters and getting no
response, he said, he wrote again in May, accusing the museum of
treating Guatemala's claim with ``indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Guatemalan official said he was angered, but not
surprised, by the MFA's rebuff. ``I had hoped they would be more
flexible,'' he said. ``Obviously, they were not.''

killing ``a wake-up call for America'' as she urged Congress to
crack down on hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men who murdered my father had a choice that morning, and
they chose violence,'' Renee Mullins, 27, the eldest daughter of
James Byrd Jr., told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on
Wednesday. ``Therefore, the laws of the land should punish them.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 49, was beaten, chained to the back of a pickup and
dragged along a rural road June 7 near Jasper. Three white men, two
with links to racist groups, have been indicted on capital murder
charges and are being held.
</P>
<P>
   John William King, 23; Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31; and Shawn
Allen Berry, 23, could face the death penalty id convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects in Byrd's death were charged under Texas law, but
legislation in Congress would make it easier for federal
prosecutors to take over similar cases. The bill, sponsored by
Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., would also
expand federal jurisdiction to include hate crimes motivated by
gender, sexual orientation or physical disability.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the proposal seeks an unnecessary and
unconstitutional expansion of federal power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would do little to prevent tragedies like the one in
Jasper, Texas,'' William Stunts, a University of Virginia law
professor, told the Senate panel. ``In short, I think this bill
would do no good and may do real harm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mullins argued that hate crimes are so heinous that they
deserve special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today to prevent any other acts of violence of this
nature from occurring in America,'' she said. ``I think there
should be federal jurisdiction over crimes so hateful. It is a pity
to die because of your race, handicap or sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins also urged Americans to pray for the three men accused
of her father's killing, saying that the jailed suspects ``are so
full of fear and hatred that they are cut out from the happiness of
life.'' She struggled to maintain her composure as she delivered an
emotional appeal for racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to talk peace and harmony at my most difficult times, so
that no sparks will ignite more hatred and retribution,'' Mullins
said. ``People should be judged by the content of their character,
and not by the color of their skin. I've learned from living 27
years _ it takes more energy to hate than to love.''
</P>
<P>
   The young woman ended her emotional testimony by thanking the
senators and adding, ``God bless America.'' Her comments hushed the
cavernous hearing room and left lawmakers struggling for an
appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really, really feel badly about what happened. I think
everyone in America does,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the panel's
chairman, said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added: ``You're very special to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could be strong,'' Mullins replied, embarrassed by
her tears. ``But thank you, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who is skeptical about Kennedy's bill, assured Mullins
that Congress will find some way to encourage the prosecution of
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should presume we're going to do something here,''
he said. ``We have too many hate crimes, and something needs to be
done about it.''

SOUTH TEXAS KILLINGS FIT FAMILIAR PATTERN, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
EXPERTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Maybe Ernie Moore was driven by love. Maybe by hatred.
But experts on family violence said Wednesday that the actions of
the young Rio Grande Valley gunman who killed four people before
being fatally wounded by police seem to fit a pattern sadly
familiar to those who study domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power and control _ that's what it's all about,'' said Lena
Lungwitz, co-director of the University of Texas Law School
Domestic Violence Clinic in Austin. ``It's not a person losing
control; it's a person trying to gain control.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details of Moore's final days remained a mystery
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Moore, 24, the son and brother of area
policemen, apparently was enraged by a broken love affair. Armed
with an assault rifle, he invaded the family home of his rival
early Tuesday, demanding that his former sweetheart, who had sought
refuge there, leave with him.
</P>
<P>
   When she refused, Moore critically wounded his rival, Dan Morin,
22, and killed the man's mother and sister. Moore later killed two
U.S. Border Patrol agents and seriously injured a Cameron County
sheriff's deputy in a shootout. Moore sustained mortal wounds in
the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Cox, Moore's former girlfriend, had planned to move into
an apartment with Morin on Friday, according to Morin's family. Cox
was not injured in the shootings. She could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While it was unclear whether Moore had previously abused or
threatened the woman, family violence experts concurred that the
point at which a woman leaves a problematic mate can be fraught
with violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that they view the woman not as a partner,
but as their property, like a dog,'' said Sgt. Sandy Kline, a
seven-year veteran of the Houston Police Department's Family
Violence Unit. ``What they can't possess, they kill. `If I can't
have you, no one can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Often, such violence targets the woman's relatives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely common to threaten everyone, the victim's
parents. I've seen a (pet) held hostage ... . We think of
stranger-on-stranger violence, but the real danger comes from
people they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Nickel, an information technician with the Texas Department
of Public Safety's Austin headquarters, said more than 10 percent
of the 1,328 homicides reported in 1997 were the result of violence
between husbands and wives or otherwise romantically linked men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   DPS statistics showed 51 wives were murdered by their husbands;
21 husbands were murdered by their wives. Additionally, 15 women
involved in common-law unions were murdered, 11 common-law husbands
were murdered and 43 people, most of them women, were killed in
``boyfriend-girlfriend'' altercations.
</P>
<P>
   HPD's Kline said such figures likely represented only a fraction
of such killings. Last year, she said, her unit received an average
2,500 family violence reports each month.
</P>
<P>
   Jealousy, she said, often is a factor in some of the most brutal
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gondlof, who has studied abusive family relationships in
Houston and other Texas cities for the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed that the termination of
troubled relationships often can send men into a destructive
emotional spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaving is a defiance of authority,'' he said. ``It's a
rejection of control. Oddly, in a perverse way, it's seen as an
attack on him. It throws some men into a tremendous depression _
everything is lost. They are shamed and embarrassed. It's sometimes
a factor in murder-suicides. The man kills and then turns on
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gondlof, who is associate research director at the
Pennsylvania-based Mid-Atlantic Addiction Training Institute,
admitted being only passingly familiar with the Rio Grande Valley
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Moore's ambush of Border Patrol agents likely
constituted ``almost a death wish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All was lost,'' Gondlof said, ``and he was ready to sacrifice
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Moore's family have not been available for interviews,
and the quality of the couple's terminated relationship is not
publicly known. But experts said it is possible that Moore did not
betray his propensity for violence prior to the Tuesday morning
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to predict lethality,'' said UT's Lungwitz.
``Somebody may be a jerk, but you'd not anticipate that they'd kill
someone. Abusive people can be charming. You'd never guess in a
million years.''

MILITARY RULER APPEALS FOR CALM FOLLOWING SPORADIC RIOTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for rewriting throughout, adds 400 words at end. No
pickup.)   (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's military ruler tried to calm an angry
nation on Wednesday night, after the sudden death of the opposition
leader, Moshood K.O. Abiola, by agreeing to allow outside experts
to take part in the autopsy and speaking, albeit in vague terms, of
moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the country seems poised on a knife-edge despite the appeals
for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Lagos were quiet on Wednesday night, eerily
deserted as people stayed home out of fear. But debris and smashed
glass littering several streets testified to the sporadic rioting
that has left at least 19 people dead since Abiola, who was under
government detention, died. The riots underscored the explosive
resonance of his name.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the country's recently installed
leader, also dissolved the military-appointed government on
Wednesday _ a gesture that appears unlikely to have any immediate
impact because the core of power lies with the inner circle of
military men gathered in the Provisional Ruling Council.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation wearing a green medal-bedecked military
uniform, Abubakar promised a fair autopsy for Abiola, who
apparently suffered a heart attack, and said his release from
prison was to have been decided formally on Wednesday. ``Alas,''
the general said, ``God willed otherwise, and today we mourn his
loss.'' It was not immediately clear when the autopsy would be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar spoke of the ``restoration of democracy'' in Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation, as an ``imperative,'' but he avoided
spelling out any plans as to how to achieve this or any specific
timetable for elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appears determined to prod the new
government toward democratic change without appearing to push too
hard or too blatantly. The volatility of the situation here is
evident, and there are major American interests at stake, both
directly in the large oil industry, and strategically in placing a
democratic Nigeria at the heart of a stable West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech the general described the death of the opposition
leader as a ``national tragedy,'' the same terms he used for the
death a month ago of the dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence suggests the narrow line Nigeria's new ruler is
trying to tread between his own apparent desire to further a
democratic transition in this pivotal African state and those in
the armed forces who remain loyal to Abacha's oppressive and
generally ruinous policies.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who appeared to be poised to win the 1993 presidential
election before the military annulled it, and was imprisoned on
charges of treason in 1994, died Tuesday after falling ill during a
meeting with U.S. and Nigerian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian authorities have attributed his death to ``cardiac
arrest,'' but members of Abiola's family have suggested he may have
been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said on Wednesday that two American
military physicians will be sent to Nigeria to help perform an
autopsy. The chief coroner of the Canadian province of Ontario, Dr.
James Young, will also be present, along with a British expert. At
the specific request of the Abiola family, Dr. John Pless, a
pathologist at Indiana University is being sent by Physicians for
Human Rights, a Boston-based group.
</P>
<P>
   The burial of Abiola, who converted to Islam many years ago,
would normally have taken place at once, but a delay of perhaps as
much as two or three more days now seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday
that United States had no evidence that Abiola had ``died of
anything other than natural causes.'' But he added that, given the
suspicions of the family, it was ``a good idea to have a
post-mortem conducted in a way that is as independently, reliably,
conducted as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts are inevitably swirling here, prompted by the
extraordinary timing of Abiola's death and it seems certain that
until the results of the autopsy are known the situation will
remain highly volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, with the door now half opened to a democratic
transition and the eventual course of this shift still vague, a
quick return to the calm called for on Wednesday by Abubakar may be
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You who killed Abiola will pay for what you have done,'' mobs
shouted as they moved through the streets here early on Wednesday,
before being disbanded by police units that fired shots in the air.
By the afternoon, this city of eight million people was largely
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities said at least 10 people had been killed in
Lagos, and some of the violence appeared shaded by old ethnic
rivalries, with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas
from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Hausas and Fulanis constitute a majority in the military
government and the armed forces, while a significant part of
Abiola's following came from members of the Yoruba tribe in the
southwestern part of Nigeria, the late opposition leader's home
region.
</P>
<P>
   Violence was also reported in at least two other towns,
including Nigeria's second city, Ibadan, where burning tires
blocked streets for several hours, and in Abiola's hometown of
Abeokuta.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I appeal to you to remain calm despite your understandable
grief,'' Abubakar said. ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by
recourse to lawlessness, threat to life, and wanton destruction of
innocent people's property.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, who led the American delegation here this week, said on
Wednesday he believed that Abubakar was receptive to American
demands that Nigeria move swiftly to democracy. But he added that
the new leader wanted to complete a ``consultative'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the military government should be blamed for Abiola's
death, Rubin said, ``We made very clear that we think he should
never have been in prison, and therefore any consequence of him
being in prison is the responsibility of the government that
wrongfully put him in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar was a prominent member of that government.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, hinted in recent meetings with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and with Pickering that he wants to
turn the page, ending five years in which Nigeria's economy was
pillaged.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Abubakar conspicuously declined to spell out
the political plans that Nigeria's 105 million inhabitants are now
anxiously awaiting. ``I will address you on the general character
of this administration in due course,'' the general said.
</P>
<P>
   Impatience is, however, running high, and it appears that
Abubakar will have to be more specific about his plans for any move
to democracy soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is trying his best for this country, giving us great
natural wealth, but everything has been wasted,'' said John Iboka,
a businessman. ``Now we are hoping for a new start.'' &QL;

`SQUAW PEAK' KEEPS ITS NAME, ARIZONA BOARD DECIDES 
</HEADLINE>
 PEAK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Squaw Peak will remain Squaw Peak, a state board decided
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: A search of historical records showed that it's
never been called by any other name.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Arizona Board of Geographic and Historic
Names was viewed as a rebuke to some Native Americans, who said
they found the name ``squaw'' offensive and wanted to change the
name to Iron Mountain. They said that is the English translation of
the Akimel O'odham word for the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But the board's assistant and historian, Julie Hoff, said her
analysis of ``one hundred years of Indian literature, poetry and
folklore'' had uncovered virtually no evidence that Squaw Peak was
ever referred to as Iron Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us want to make a change but we couldn't here today
because this is not the right name,'' board member Mervyn Mason
told the handful of people who attended a hearing on the proposed
name change.
</P>
<P>
   The petition to rename the peak, which was unanimously rejected
by the board, was filed in July 1997 by a pair of teenage girls who
claim that the word ``squaw'' is offensive to Native American women
because &UR; , in some Indian languages, it denotes female genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Several Board members cited Hoff's presentation in explaining
why they voted to reject the name change. Others cited board
regulations requiring that before a change could be made, the
replacement name had to be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman Tim Norton suggested that the body's mission
leaned more toward preserving names than changing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're required by statute to preserve the historical record of
the state,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, offensiveness is a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say offensive, offensive to whom?'' he asked. ``Where
do you draw the line on political correctness?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mason said he was ready to consider another proposal at
a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics claimed that the board's research was weak since it
didn't include Native American sources. They say that many Native
American elders refer to the peak as Iron Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained board members h &UR; id behind a technicality to
skirt the main issue of whether ``squaw'' was offensive and should
be erased from public view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was like splitting a hair,'' &UR; said Michele Curran, a
historian hired by the American Indian Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Curran said she had been assured that those who favor the name
Iron Mountain would have a chance to present their own research.
She said that never happened. &UR; But Norton said that a number of
local tribes did receive copies of the research report for comment
and that none of them responded.
</P>
<P>
   Native American activists vowed to continue efforts to change
the name. One leader said the next step may be to go over the state
board's head to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go national,'' said Vernon Foster, director of
AIM`s Southwest Region.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said that AIM and others opposed to the word ``squaw''
intended to take the issue to the U.S. Board of Geographic Names.
</P>
<P>
   But another supporter of the name-change wanted the Arizona
board to know that it had not heard the last of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna be back,'' said Delena Waddle, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Waddle co-sponsored the name-change proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back with the same name, Iron Mountain. Just with
more research,'' she said.

JURY FINDS NBC NEGLIGENT IN `DATELINE' REPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to reword 13th graf to clarify. No pickup.)   (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury in Maine on Wednesday found that ``Dateline NBC,'' the
television network's prime-time news program, was negligent in
misrepresenting a 1995 series about the trucking industry and
ordered the network to pay $525,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case in Bangor did not center on whether the
two-part report was true. Instead, it focused on whether the NBC
journalists had misrepresented the focus of the story and how the
sources would be portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Classic Carriers, based in
Waterville, Me., and one of its drivers accused NBC correspondent
Fred Francis and freelance producer Alan Handel of misleading them
about the theme of a segment on the trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company's owners, Raymond and Kelly Veilleux, and the
driver, Peter Kennedy, said Francis and Handel conveyed that they
were working on a positive story. The two-part series instead
focused on safety violations by Kennedy and other truckers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC argued that it had promised only to report accurately as a
film crew joined Kennedy for a cross-country drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the program Kennedy referred to his driving log as a ``joke
book'' and admitted falsifying entries so he could drive for
periods longer than the law allows. At one point Kennedy drove from
Chicago to Boston without sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argued that the program failed to reflect his views that
he could drive for long periods without impairing his driving
ability.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for four and a half hours on Tuesday and five
hours Wednesday, the jury said the network and the show had
committed negligence and misrepresentation and had inflicted
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Veilleux was awarded $300,000, Kennedy $175,000 and Ms. Veilleux
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press has no special protection under the laws of the
United States,'' the plaintiffs' lawyer, Bill Robitzek, told the
jury. ``They are not immune. They're not exempt. If they do
something wrong, they can be brought here and held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., stood by the report
Wednesday and tried to distance itself from the other media outlets
that have had public setbacks recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC News believes our story was presented accurately and
regrets that the jury came to a different conclusion,'' the network
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling came amid a string of events that have forced
prominent news outlets to deal with professional lapses in the last
two months. Since May, The New Republic magazine, The Boston Globe
(which is owned by The New York Times Co.), The Cincinnati Enquirer
and Cable News Network have either renounced major reports or
discovered fabrications by staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there will be those that try to lump this with
other stories about media missteps,'' Kassie Canter, an NBC
spokeswoman, said. ``This is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Canter said NBC was weighing whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision was the second time in six years that
``Dateline NBC'' found trouble with trucks. In 1992, as part of a
segment on truck safety, the show broadcast footage of a General
Motors truck bursting into flame supposedly as a result of a
collision. It turned out that the program's producers had rigged
the truck to explode more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, ``Dateline NBC'' has been a big
success for the network, expanding to four hours a week last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, who runs NBC's entertainment division, said
recently: ``There is no show more important to us than `Dateline.'
I look on `Dateline' as a hit show in the same way I look on `E.R.'
as a hit show.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jury's ruling raised concern in news media circles, where it
sparked fears that any person who was the subject of a critical
article or program could successfully sue for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often is the case that a source agrees to tell a story
perceiving somehow that the story will be a positive for them,''
said George Freeman, assistant general counsel of The New York
Times Co. ``But that's a far cry from a contract actually existing
where the deal is that you actually have to write a positive story,
which no self-respecting journalist would agree to.'' &QL;

NEW VENUE BUT OLD EMPHASIS IN RACE FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sat down Wednesday with eight
authors, educators and journalists for an hourlong discussion of
race and class that ranged across questions of stereotyping and
intermarriage but returned repeatedly to the subject of affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped to play down that topic during the
president's initiative on race. But the participants fell quickly
into the familiar debate, clashing over whether affirmative action
was a necessary redress for discrimination or a system of unfair
preferences that resulted in discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued for encouraging diversity in schools,
neighborhoods and workplaces but acknowledged the difficulties of
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is an independent value to having young people
learn in an environment where they're with people of many different
racial and ethnic backgrounds,'' he said. ``And the question is,
How can you balance that with our devotion to merit?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third and final round-table discussion that the White
House had planned as part of Clinton's initiative on race, which
the president announced in June 1997 as a yearlong effort. It has
now been extended to the end of this year, when Clinton is to issue
a report.
</P>
<P>
   The president taped the discussion Wednesday afternoon for
broadcast Thursday evening on PBS. Moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS,
the program will be broadcast at 10 p.m. in New York and at
different times in other regions. PBS and the White House provided
transcripts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion underscored what administration officials
acknowledge is a lingering problem for the race initiative: a lack
of focus. Some panelists complained that the initiative
concentrated too much on black-white relations, while another
objected that it had not taken on affirmative action forthrightly.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though Clinton has been trying to encourage
conversation about race for more than a year now, the talk
Wednesday ultimately turned to the question of how to get other
people talking about race _ though Lehrer had some difficulty
keeping the focus on that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about talking bluntly about race,'' Lehrer said
in trying gently to redirect one panelist headed in a different
direction. The session ended moments later, with the president
objecting, ``We're just getting warmed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, whites, Hispanic- and Asian-Americans and American
Indians were all represented Wednesday. Given the choice of
writerly panelists and of venue, the White House appeared to be
seeking a more rarefied conversation and audience that at past
events. Last December, Clinton held a town hall meeting with
residents of Akron, Ohio, and in April he appeared with athletes
and sports executives on the cable sports channel ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists Wednesday generally acted as spokesmen for their
racial group, raising issues specific to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A poor Native American faces more hurdles than a poor
anybody,'' said Sherman Alexie, a filmmaker and author. Indian
reservations suffered from ``fourth-world conditions,'' Alexie
said, adding that he did not have running water until he was 7.
``There are no models of any success in any sort of field for
Indians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the president, who noted that his own grandmother was
``one-quarter Cherokee,'' Sherman said other Americans needed to
appreciate that Indians were independent politically, while Indians
needed to appreciate the value of education.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Asian-Americans a ``much maligned minority,'' Heritage
Foundation fellow Elaine Chao described how a Chinese-American boy
with good test scores was excluded from a San Francisco school
because what she called the ``Chinese quota'' was filled. ``That is
a horrible example of preferential treatment and of unfair
treatment based on race,'' Ms. Chao said.
</P>
<P>
   But The Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page said
``desegregation does not come by just good wishes.'' The central
question, Page said, was, ``How much equal opportunity are you
willing to sacrifice in the pursuit of diversity?''
</P>
<P>
   He told Clinton that ``one problem with the race dialogue was
that I think you were reluctant to deal with the question of
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists disagreed over the relationship of race and class.
Roberto Suro, a writer and Washington Post reporter, said: ``I'd
say a young black male who lives in an inner city experiences being
black differently than a middle-aged, middle-class female who lives
in a suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   But Page said, ``In my suburb right now, there are numerous
complaints about black youths being stopped by the cops unfairly,
just as they're stopped by the cops in the inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodriguez, of the Pacific News Service, said he was
sometimes stopped while jogging in San Francisco before dawn. ``The
last time I got stopped was by two black policemen,'' Rodriguez
said, ``and I think to myself, this is a very complicated society
we live in.'' &QL;

URBAN SPRAWL IS HOME ON THE RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. _ All over Montana, in any valley with a decent
road through it, the signs play to an America that is no longer
home on the range, unless it comes with a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilderness at your door _ just minutes from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Own a piece of that renowned Montana serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hunting and fishing paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   The enticements come with pictures of elk grazing in backyard
meadows, fly fishermen at sunset and big-chested mountains. But in
the process of subdividing and selling some of the most gorgeous
scenery on earth, Montanans are losing their heritage _ at least
that is the view of Laura Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Ms. Merrill settled near Hamilton, a
town of about 3,000 people in the Bitterroot Valley and the seat of
Ravalli County in western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   She was determined that she would not let the valley become
another generic suburb built along a strip mall. Now she is an
unlikely crusader against development excess: she makes her living
as a real estate agent in the fastest-growing county in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merrill is a land broker who will not sell subdivisions, a
real estate agent who encourages people to put conservation
restrictions on their land. And she is outspoken about the
consequences of dividing up ranches to sell pieces to fantasy
cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned down lots of listings, and it's cost me a fair
amount of money, I'm sure,'' says Ms. Merrill, an independent
broker in this valley 45 miles south of Missoula. ``I'm interested
in keeping the land intact. Because what I'm afraid we're doing
here is fouling our nest.''
</P>
<P>
   With winter only a snowbound memory, it is high season for
selling real estate in Montana. Ms. Merrill is surrounded by
listings of her fellow agents _ gorgeous pictures of little plots
of paradise with creeks running through them.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like an oxymoron _ the environmental realtor. She
would rather warn of problems down the road than talk about low
down-payments and ``E-Z terms. But Ms. Merrill is not alone. A
handful of other real estate agents in this state have started to
turn down listings that encourage sprawl or involve tearing up
wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that any of them are getting rich, but we've actually got
a few eco-realtors making a living in Montana right now,'' said
John Wilson, executive director of the Montana Land Reliance, which
buys development rights to preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   But at this time of year, when the high mountains hold the sun
until nearly 10 p.m. and the meadows are dense with wildflowers, it
can seem like the entire state is for sale. Places with names like
``Mountain-Vu Estates'' have sprouted in what had been open
country. Since 1974, Montana has lost 3.1 million acres of ranch
and farmland, most of it to urban sprawl, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Subdivisions march up the mountainside from Kalispell to Darby,
and from Missoula to Bozeman. They feature big log homes on lots
that vary from one acre to a thousand. Buyers range from
celebrities _ the talk show host David Letterman was here recently,
looking at ranches _ to urban dwellers who have long dreamed of
life under the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   But once the land is carved up, it is generally not open to
wildlife or to agriculture, Wilson said. Sprawl has become the No.
1 threat to the natural world in Montana, many environmental groups
say.
</P>
<P>
   And no valley has seen more development lately than the
Bitterroot. In the last six years, 596 subdivisions have been
approved here in Ravalli County, which has a population of about
34,000. ``The Best of the Last Best Places,'' is the slogan on
relocation guides for the county.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merrill favors controlling development and trying to keep
farmland intact, positions that she said had not exactly endeared
her to her fellow real estate agents in a state where planning is
anathema. She still sells plenty of property, she added, but it is
land that is intended to stay as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like selling land,'' said Ms. Merrill, a former Forest
Service scientist. ``I like talking to people about property
stewardship, about different trees on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, clients are asking Ms. Merrill about conservation
easements, which are binding legal agreements that limit
development. Landowners receive estate and income tax benefits by
agreeing to place restrictions on their land. They are paid by
private foundations, or federal, state or local governments, for
these rights. More than 600,000 acres in Montana are now in
protective easements, up from barely 1,000 acres 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Bitterroot Valley and every other scenic hollow
in Montana will be worth more to property owners if pell-mell
development is controlled, Ms. Merrill said. But new subdivisions
continue to go up almost every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a real range of people in this job, a lot of different
buyers,'' she said. ``All of them are looking for a less congested
place, a less crazy place, a safe place. We have all that. But I'm
afraid if we don't do something, we're going to lose this valley.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Institutes of Health, the world's
pre-eminent sponsor of biomedical research, should listen more
carefully to patients and ordinary citizens in deciding how to
spend its $13.6 billion annual budget, a blue-ribbon advisory panel
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said, the federal health agency should more
systematically consider data on the prevalence, death rates and
costs of different diseases in setting its research agenda and
priorities. The panel found big disparities in the institutes'
spending per person, depending on the disease. For example, data
collected by the NIH for 1996 show that the institutes spent far
more on AIDS research than on heart disease research, even though
heart disease accounted for many more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Such data, it said, encourage ``the perception of some members
of Congress and the public that NIH spending often follows current
politics and political correctness, or responds to media attention
to certain diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member panel was appointed by the Institute of Medicine,
an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, under instructions from
Congress, which requested the study.
</P>
<P>
   It said that the institutes should be ``more responsive'' to the
public, and that ordinary citizens should have ``more opportunities
to present their views regarding research needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Institutes of Health has helped launch a
revolution in biology over the last half-century,'' by performing
or financing basic research that has led to breakthroughs in the
treatment of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and AIDS, said Dr.
Leon Rosenberg, panel chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenberg, a professor of molecular biology at Princeton
University, added that the NIH, the largest civilian research
agency in the government, ``has fallen short'' in dealing with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 18 institutes has an advisory council to guide its
work, and one-third of the seats are typically reserved for public
representatives. But the panel found that the institutes were
appointing doctors, lawyers and eminent professors, rather than
ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the panel said that the NIH and its director, Dr.
Harold Varmus, should fill these slots with more ``representatives
of patients and their families, and of populations with special
health problems,'' including blacks, Hispanic Americans and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The director's advisory committee now includes biology
professors from Harvard, Princeton and Columbia, a trustee of the
American Medical Association, a senior vice president of Monsanto
Co. and experts on supercomputers and patent law.
</P>
<P>
   Myrl Weinberg, president of the National Health Council, a
coalition of more than 100 groups, including the American Heart
Association and the American Diabetes Association, said it was
``absolutely appropriate'' for members of such advocacy groups to
sit on NIH committees that help decide how federal money is spent.
Ms. Weinberg was a member of the academy panel.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said it was particularly important for the institutes
to define their priorities more clearly because they are likely to
get a huge infusion of money in the next few years. The agency's
budget has doubled since 1991, and leading lawmakers from both
parties want to double it again in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups have hired lobbyists to seek more money for
research on specific diseases, in an effort to duplicate the
success of advocates for people with AIDS and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that each institute should create a full-time
office of public liaison, and that Varmus should establish a
``council of public representatives'' so patients and other
citizens could advise the institutes on research priorities.
</P>
<P>
   If the institutes themselves become more responsive to the
public, that could reduce the need, or the temptation, for Congress
to dictate research priorities in detail, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg insisted that these changes need not erode financial
support for basic scientific research that has no immediate or
obvious practical applications. Such research _ in microbiology,
virology and genetics, for example _ has led eventually to
discoveries of immense value to medicine and agriculture and has
stimulated growth of the biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., has raised questions about the way
the institutes allocate money. ``Federal spending on disease
research should consider how many people are affected and the costs
of major diseases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials have tried to compile such information, but
contend that the numbers should not be used as the main criteria in
setting spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Data collected by the NIH show that in 1996 the agency spent
$851.6 million for research on heart disease, a disorder
responsible for 733,834 deaths. The agency spent $1.4 billion for
research on the virus that causes AIDS, a disease responsible for
32,655 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The figures suggest that the institutes spent more than $43,000
for every AIDS death, but $1,160 for each death from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that direct costs to society from heart
disease totaled $70 billion a year, while costs from AIDS were
$10.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allocating dollars for deaths is an overly simplistic way to
approach biomedical research,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive
director of AIDS Action, an advocacy group. ``We also need to
consider which diseases cause the most suffering, the years of life
lost and the chances of scientific breakthroughs.'' &QL;

$3.2 BILLION SETTLEMENT IN SILICONE-IMPLANTS DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for thorough rewrite and to add 13 grafs to end of original
text)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers for tens of thousands of women
claiming injury from silicone breast implants agreed Wednesday to a
$3.2 billion settlement, a long-awaited step toward ending one of
the most heated disputes in American corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement would end a legal battle of nearly a
decade and allow the plaintiffs to receive money as early as next
year.
</P>
<P>
   It would also enable Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow
Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy, which the company entered in 1995 for protection from
as many 19,000 implant-damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement leaves unresolved, however, the dispute between
the two sides over the extent of harm from silicone implants. While
localized complications from leaking implants are well documented,
Dow Corning, supported by a growing body of research, has denied
throughout the battle that implants cause systemic illness like
autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   One factor apparently pressuring both sides toward agreement, a
participant in the negotiations that led to the settlement said,
was a report expected later this year by a panel of doctors and
other scientists evaluating the scientific evidence; neither side
wanted to wait and risk damage to its case.
</P>
<P>
   And for Dow Corning, resolving its potential liability from
implant suits was necessary to win a federal bankruptcy judge's
approval of its corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many of the details remain to be worked out over the
next two months, this settlement is a breakthrough in an incredibly
complex case,'' said the president of Dow Corning, Gary Anderson.
``At a certain time in a controversy, both sides need to agree to
disagree and look together to find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jacks, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that if he had
needed to go into court ``to debate the science of silicone
implants, I would still be in there, and these women who had
suffered would not have any money.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is part of Dow Corning's restructuring
plan, requires approval by a two-thirds vote of the 170,000 women
who filed claims against the company, which was once the largest
manufacturer of silicone implants, and by Dow Corning's creditors.
Lawyers for the women were hopeful Wednesday that they would
approve the agreement, enabling some to secure money for injuries
sustained two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bankruptcy judge Arthur Spector in Bay City, Mich., who
is overseeing the bankruptcy case of Dow Corning, which is based in
Midland, Mich., Wednesday reappointed a Duke University law
professor, Francis McGovern, to mediate the rest of the agreement.
Both sides were quick to point out that many of the details had yet
to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   For many women who are plantiffs in the case, the agreement was
almost too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need more details, but I'm hopeful it is a beginning,'' said
Peggy Pardo, an implant recipient living in Addison, Ill., a
Chicago suburb. ``Dow Corning will get on with business and these
women will have to get on with their lives, but a lot of them have
been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a consumer health issue divided corporations and
their customers so bitterly. Between 650,000 and 1 million women
received silicone breast implants during the 1970s and 1980s. The
legal disputes started soon after, as more women complained that
leaks from the implants had damaged their health. Heeding an outcry
from the public, the Food and Drug Administration asked that the
implants be removed from the market in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by lawsuits, the breast-implant manufacturers agreed in
September 1993 to settle all litigation with a pay-out that would
have totaled $4 billion. The deal eventually fell apart, although
several manufacturers settled with their claimants two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by suits over its silicone implants, Dow Corning filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, igniting a three-year struggle with
plantiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Dow Cornings' settlement offers were deemed not
only too low but often offensive to many of the plantiffs. In
December 1996, the company offered to set aside $2 billion for up
to 30 years to meet all potential claims of women who believed they
were injured by the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was one hitch: Before any money was to be paid out,
Dow proposed, there would be a ``science'' trial in which a single
jury would decide whether there was proof that silicone leaking
from the implants could cause the damage described in the lawsuits.
Dow proposed that if it won that trial, no more than $600 million
should be set aside for implant claims.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning later offered to pay $3 billion over 16 years, but
plaintiff lawyers dismissed that amount as too little, especially
over that length of time. As a counter offer, the lawyers asked in
March for $3.8 billion paid over two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that the best way to get a deal was for both sides to
see an entire package, the mediator, McGovern, drew up a plan July
1 and told both sides to take it or leave it. He gave both parties
until Wednesday to react.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the deal said the plantiffs' lawyers liked
several points of the settlement. Among them: that $1 billion would
go to women with claims in the first year, and that certain
ailments would be guaranteed special amounts, including some
illnesses that Dow Corning denies are caused by implants. For
example, women with certain autoimmune diseases, such as lupus,
would receive some $250,000, while women with no health problems
would receive $5,000 to have their implants removed, attorneys
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was described by court officials as resembling a
November 1995 settlement over silicone implants reached by Baxter
International, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Minnesota Mining &AMP;
Manufacturing Co. In that deal, an average of $26,000 per woman has
been paid out, according to plaintiff attorneys. Payments in the
Dow Corning settlement are 20 percent larger, according to court
officials, which would make the average disability payment some
$30,000.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were other benefits, as well. The settlement trust will
remain open for 16 years, and women will retain their right to
settle or litigate their claims. Separate litigation will come from
the $3.2 billion trust, plaintiff lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The court held an open invitation for women to become part of
the trust. Some 170,000 signed up, but attorneys said Wednesday
that it was unclear whether Judge Spector would permit more women
to sign up now that a settlement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both sides have reached a tentative agreement, the
battle between the two may continue. With the settlement, Dow
Corning relinquishes any responsibility for the implant litigation.
The company also refuses to admit that silicone implants cause
systemic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Dow Corning, said Wednesday
that the settlement is by no means an admission that implants cause
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that implants do not cause
disease,'' she said. ``However, with 19,000 lawsuits that each take
a million dollars to win, it becomes obvious very quickly that a
settlement is the only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledge that plenty of Dow Corning's
restructuring plan must still be completed. Negotiations begin on
Monday to transform Wednesday's agreement into a more detailed
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the provisions of the term sheet, the parties have
agreed that if there are any further disputes, they will be
resolved by Judge Spector,'' McGovern said Wednesday, adding that
he anticipates a steady completion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many women who have been injured by silicone
implants, any money will come too late. Beth West, from Glide,
Ore., had her implants removed in 1994 but can barely walk or enjoy
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think we are in this for the money, it is absolutely
not the case,'' she said. ``My thought for anything positive coming
out of this is that it never happens to another human.'' &QL;

BRAWLEY DEFAMATION CASE GOES TO JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Nearly eight months after the trial began,
the six jurors in the Tawana Brawley defamation case began
deliberations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Judge Justice S. Barrett Hickman gave the jurors legal
instructions in the morning, the panel deliberated for two hours
and five minutes Wednesday afternoon. They asked to review several
pieces of evidence, including a videotape of the statements that
plaintiff Steven Pagones says defamed him a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, who are not sequestered, went home just after 5 p.m.
and were to resume deliberations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors' requests occasioned the intense, and usually
inconclusive, courthouse discussion that such notes arouse in many
trials. The notes were not read in public but were described by
some of the trial participants.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the requests indicated little more than that the
jurors were taking their task seriously. Others said requests for
such evidence showed sympathies with the three defendants, who had
been Ms. Brawley's advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason
and Alton Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said Pagones raped and kidnapped Ms. Brawley in
1987, when she was 15. A grand jury later discredited her account
and exonerated Pagones, who filed a suit seeking millions of
dollars in damages in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was far quieter than many of the days since the trial
began on Nov. 18. The judge read the complex legal instructions
that defined the elements Pagones must have proved to establish
that he was defamed. The defendants objected to some of the
instructions. The judge held fast on many points but relented on
several others, calling the jurors back to amend his remarks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharpton's lawyer, Michael Hardy, objected to the judge's
instruction that the jurors could hold that the defendants acted in
a conspiracy, which could make each responsible for the other's
statements. The judge left intact his instructions on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman also left intact, despite defense objections, his
instruction that since Ms. Brawley did not testify, the jurors
could infer that her testimony would have hurt the defendants'
assertion that she was assaulted. He ruled, however, that the
jurors could only make that inference against Maddox, who, he has
ruled, had legal control over Ms. Brawley and appeared with her at
a Brooklyn rally as recently as December.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, both sides seemed to be positioning
themselves for the end of the case. No matter what the verdict,
Pagones said, he accomplished his goal of forcing the defendants to
appear in court to back up their claims. He said they had failed.
``With that in mind,'' he said, ``I've won. Now, I want to hold
them accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has developed a political career, said, ``Whatever
the verdict will be, it will not interfere one iota with the future
and intentions of Al Sharpton.'' &QL;

Thuram's goals send France into final
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ France coach Aime Jacquet thought it was going to be one of
those nights when nothing went right.
</P>
<P>
   Five great shots had been fired by suspected French hero
Zinedine Zidane. They all barely missed or were knocked away. Two
shots came perilously close from poster-boy French forward Youri
Djorkaeff. Frustration.
</P>
<P>
   A bounce and a dribble went the wrong way inside of France's
area only seconds into the second half _ lucky rolls, really _ and
Croatia forward Davor Suker had a clear shot and goal for a
stunning 1-0 World Cup semifinal lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not having a wonderful time of it,'' Jacquet said.
``It was extremely tenuous. I thought it might be a night when it
was our time to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But it proved to be the rarest of nights at Stade de France, a
memorable 2-1 World Cup semifinal victory over Croatia on a night
when a young man named Lilian Thuram, an unknown splinter of a
player, blasted out of obscurity and into French fable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought I would score two goals,'' said
Thuram, 26, a native of Guadeloupe who emigrated with his mother 17
years ago. ``I didn't think I would score one. I don't even score
in practice. This is fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Thuram's goals proved to be not only vital to French
hopes, but remarkably impressive individual efforts for a player
who had not scored in 37 previous national team appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was an excellent reward for all the work he's put in,
especially the mental discipline he's been able to give this
team,'' Jacquet said. ``A lot of people haven't known the
importance he is to this team. He's had a great World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, until Wednesday Thuram rarely saw the lights of stardom.
His image wasn't painted on the side of buildings, like Djorkaeff
and Zidane. His jersey number _ 15 _ is difficult to find in the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   He was known as a quiet defender with quick reflexes and sharp
clearing passes.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of Wednesday's game, nearly 80,000 deliriously
happy fans at Stade de France broke into wild roars every time
Thuram touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And by the early-morning hours today in Paris, where an
estimated one million people partied on the streets, they were
toasting Thuram and chanting his name from the Champs Elysees, to
the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower and every street, plaza and
cafe in town.
</P>
<P>
   Paris erupted after the emotional victory, which sends the host
team into Sunday's World Cup final against defending champion
Brazil. Croatia, the surprise of the tournament, will face the
Netherlands on Saturday in the Cup's third-place game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful feat to be playing for the Cup, something
France has dreamed about, but never been able to do,'' Jacquet
said. ``Yes, Brazil is the best team in the world. We will be
playing the masters of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will be there. We will be happy to be there. It will be
a festival of football. We have been dreaming of this for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   It was France, in fact, that gave the world its first World Cup
tournament 68 years ago. The dream finally came alive when things
looked their gloomiest Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go up on them (1-0) and we're in the World Cup final, I
thought,'' Suker said. ``If we had been able to hold on to our lead
for just a few minutes, their fans would have been down, the French
team would have been down. We would have been going.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a span of 22 minutes in the second half, Thuram
consistently bolted upfield from his defensive position, put on a
blurring display of offensive skill and lifted a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram's first goal came only seconds after Suker scored and
gave Croatia the lead.
</P>
<P>
   A collective groan went up at Stade de France in the 46th minute
when, after a scuffle for the ball in front of the French net,
Suker somehow came away with an entry pass and popped the ball past
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that I thought we had them; that we were going
(to the finals) ourselves,'' Croatia coach Miroslav Blazevic said.
``France was failing and lacking strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the small and vocal group of Croatia fans had even
stopped celebrating Suker's goal, Thuram was sprinting upfield and
was fighting for possession deep on the Croatia end.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Thuram used his enormous defensive skills to steal the
ball from Croatia's Zvonimir Boban and got a return pass from
Zidane in front of the net. Thuram hammered a low shot easily past
goalie Drazen Ladic and the score was tied.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 minutes later, after several more length-of-the-field
runs and good chances, Thuram then put on a strong individual
effort as he took the ball at the Croatia net.
</P>
<P>
   He got a pass from Thierry Henry in front of two Croatian
defenders, spun and reared to his left, then fired a bullet from 20
yards on which Ladic had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an excellent goal,'' Thuram said. ``I think it was
200 percent luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It sent this city into an explosion of noise and celebration,
although things got interesting with 16 minutes remaining when
French defender Laurent Blanc was red-carded for pushing Croatia's
Slaven Bilic in the face on a free-kick attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made the end of the game quite interesting,'' Jacquet
said. ``But we showed a lot of heart. We won and we're in the
final. We're at home and we're playing Brazil for the World Cup.
The French people have to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   They were _ well into the night.

CNN TO KEEP ARNETT AS CORRESPONDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top executives of the Cable News Network said Wednesday that
they would allow Peter Arnett to keep his job as a correspondent
despite his participation in the network's repudiated report on the
use of nerve gas on a secret 1970 military mission in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Arnett's reprimand stands,'' said a statement issued by
Tom Johnson, chairman and chief executive of CNN News Group. ``No
further personnel actions are planned.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision met with mixed reaction among the network's
journalists, some of whom had felt Arnett, the correspondent who
lent his credibility to the report, was being given a break that
had not been accorded to April Oliver and Jack Smith, the producers
who had done the reporting. Both were dismissed by CNN last week.
Both also say they stand by their report and argue that the network
caved in under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's defense _ that he was simply doing the bidding of the
producers of the new program ``Newsstand: CNN and Time'' and
reading words written by others _ has proved a particular irritant
to some of the other network correspondents. Christiane Amanpour,
whose reporting from arenas like Bosnia and Iran has given her high
visibility, vehemently denied that when reporting for a
newsmagazine program like ``Impact,'' she narrated reports
developed by others, as Arnett suggested in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, contrary to what Peter Arnett appears to believe,
that a network correspondent should be responsible for what he or
she says on the air,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``I
believe that we have our face, our name, our voices and our
credibility, and therefore we should be responsible for'' such
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in an interview Wednesday, said, ``Journalists must
assure the accuracy of their reports. It is the obligation of all
journalists to be sure we have the story right.'' Arnett, he added,
has been ``severely reprimanded'' for ``his failure to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Johnson said, ``on this, he did exactly what he was
asked to do. He read the script for air and turned the information
over to producers. Including the interview with the mission's
pilot,'' who denied that he had carried tear gas as part of his
armaments.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions to cut or minimize such denials of the report's
central thesis have come under sharp attack. The network retracted
the report and apologized last week after its internal
investigation, headed by the lawyer Floyd Abrams, determined that
the information gathered by the producers in eight months of
reporting did not substantiate the claim that nerve gas was used.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver and Smith both applauded the network's decision to
retain Arnett. ``This is a victory for reporters everywhere,''
Smith said. ``I am delighted that Peter Arnett's job has been
saved, provided it's unconditional and that CNN management did not
force him to take any positions that Peter felt he was forced to
agree to, to save his job.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arnett did not take the decision as a victory. Speaking from
the network's executive offices, Arnett said, ``Overall this is not
a victory for me at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that this story hurt CNN,'' he said. ``It certainly
hurt me. For those who say I should have been fired with the others
_ my reputation has taken a major hit around the world. As for my
colleagues who are fired _ I know all of them. I'm sorry. I respect
their work and I admire them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's byline appeared, along with Ms. Oliver's, on a Time
magazine story about the September 1970 mission in Laos, code-named
Operation Tailwind. The magazine has also retracted the report and
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has appointed Rick Davis executive vice president for
standards and practices, to build in a mechanism to insure the
accuracy of the network's reporting. ``I am giving Rick Davis the
authority to look carefully into every questionable script,'' he
said. ``He will have the power to pull a program before airing no
matter where it's scheduled.

NYC POLICE TO START USING HOLLOW-POINT BULLETS

 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city Police Department is planning to equip its
entire force of almost 40,000 members with hollow-point bullets,
which cause much greater injury to people they strike but are
considered less likely to cut down bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Wednesday that within the
next 60 days the hollow-point bullets would begin replacing the
full-metal-jacket bullets that officers now use. Unlike the old
bullets, the hollow points flatten upon impact and then expand,
helping stop the bullet from passing through its target but causing
a wider wound _ and inflicting more severe internal damage,
forensic experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner first announced his intention to have the
department switch to hollow-point bullets _ which are already used
by federal law enforcement agencies and by dozens of other major
police departments across the country _ in March 1997 after the
Police Department had already spent $500,000 on nine million rounds
of the ammunition. But Safir's announcement came as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani was running for re-election, and after critics expressed
concerns that the new bullets could prove more lethal, the mayor
halted the plan, saying that the issue needed further study.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the
independent agency charged with monitoring the police, presented
its own report recommending the switch to hollow-point bullets,
Safir said he had already made the decision to use them and that he
expected the first shipments to arrive within 60 days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are, in fact, going to switch to hollow-point ammunition as
soon as we receive it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are much safer then fully-jacketed bullets, which will go
through a person or tumble through a person's organs and then
continue on and hit innocent victims,'' Safir said. The
commissioner added that the Police Department had conducted its own
tests and decided that the hollow-point bullets would be an
improvement. ``It is the standard around the world in law
enforcement to use hollow points,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other police officials have pushed for the bullets because they
are more effective in stopping dangerous criminals, and they say
that that aspect further protects bystanders because officers have
to fire fewer shots to incapacitate their targets. The public can
also legally buy these bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But some people worried that the Police Department was making
the decision without sufficient public discussion or hard data.
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union and a frequent critic of the police, said that
while hollow-point bullets would be less likely to ricochet or pass
through objects and strike bystanders, they would cause
significantly more damage to any innocent bystanders who were hit
directly. And he pointed out that since as many as a fifth of
police officers who are shot are hit by police gunfire, the
officers themselves could sustain graver injuries. ``This needs
more discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic experts said that the use of hollow points entailed a
trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It increases the wound's capacity to the victim, but it
reduces a risk that the police are always concerned about: the risk
of the bullet perforating the intended target and injuring a
bystander,'' said Dr. Stephen Hargarten, the director of the
Firearm Injury Center in Milwaukee, Wis. ``On the one hand, it
makes shootings safer in public settings. On the other hand, the
impact on the victim is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, police officers in the Transit Bureau and the
Housing Bureau have used hollow-point bullets since 1990, before
they merged with the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to arm officers with hollow-point bullets comes
five years after the Police Department, after much anguished
debate, agreed to allow its officers to upgrade their weapons by
trading in their old .38-caliber service revolvers for 9-mm
semi-automatic pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Critics feared that the added capacity of the 9-mm pistols _
which hold 16 bullets, compared with the old six-shooters _ and the
ease with which they allow officers to fire multiple rounds would
lead to more accidental shootings. And while there were troubling
incidents early on _ including a shootout outside a Chinese
restaurant in Queens in 1995 in which police officers fired 247
rounds and killed a bystander _ the number of shooting incidents
has decreased each year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its argument in favor of the hollow bullets, the
Police Department pointed to recent statistics involving gunshots
that hit innocent bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics released by the department, 15 innocent
bystanders were struck by police officers using full-metal-jacket
bullets during 1995 and 1996, police said. Eight were hit directly,
five were hit by bullets that had passed through other people and
two were hit by bullets that had passed through objects. In that
same period, officers in the Transit Bureau, who already used the
hollow points, struck six bystanders. Four of them were hit
directly, one was hit by a bullet that ricocheted and another was
hit by a bullet that passed through an object.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, 44 police officers were struck by police
gunfire using the old ammunition: 21 were hit directly, 2 were
struck by bullets that ricocheted and 17 were struck by bullets
that passed though other people. Of the four officers struck by
hollow-point bullets, three were hit directly and one was hit by a
bullet that passed through another person. &QL;

COLUMN: KING RETRIAL IS A LESSON IN FUTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the criminal retrial of Don King dragged on
Wednesday like one of the boxing czar's self-promotional
monologues, a 27-year-old aspiring law student said it sure looked
to him as if the government was about to absorb the second half of
a lethal one-two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their case just wasn't convincing, to me personally,'' said
Courtney Decasseres, a graduate this spring of the Borough of
Manhattan Community College who is moving on to Lincoln University
in the fall. ``If I was on the jury, I would have to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that Decasseres and about 20 other city
students in the U.S. District courtroom in Manhattan on Wednesday
represented the Our Children Foundation, a privately funded youth
culture group that has been the grateful beneficiary of the man on
trial on charges of wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Brown, the foundation's director, claimed that the
students have been attending the trial not as character props to
make King appear more sympathetic to the jurors but as young
scholars assigned to keep journals on this retrial of a case that
originally ended when a hung jury forced Judge Lawrence McKenna to
declare a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a law club at the foundation,'' said Decasseres.
``We've been to some of the law schools in the city, but this is
the first time we've actually had the chance to be inside the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a grasp of the justice system. It's true
that Don King has been very helpful to us in the past, but I don't
find it difficult to be objective, though I can only speak for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it doesn't take a King sympathizer or sycophant to get
the idea that the government, like most old fighters, just didn't
know when to quit. The second time around, this case has generated
all the public interest of a bantamweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting Brown's students, you can find more people in the
ring after most fights than there have been most days in McKenna's
courtroom. In contrast to the first trial, King's worst enemies
have not shown up to gloat, or root. Wednesday, when the previous
day's events with the jury in deliberation created the anticipation
of another mistrial, the news media didn't exactly come with an
O.J.-like swarm.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, this trial has, inexplicably, lasted almost four
months, counting jury selection in mid-March. Mass murder trials
wrap up faster. Entire pro basketball and hockey playoff seasons
have come and gone. If Marcia Clark were the prosecuting attorney,
she would be on her fifth make-over by now. And without trying to
sound ignorant of King's reputation and to the tax evasion charge
that finally nailed Al Capone, the question that gnaws at the core
of this trial is this:
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how King has managed to stay ahead of the posse for
years, why would sensible people believe that a jury would convict
him of defrauding a truly bloodless victim, Lloyd's of London, of
$350,000 seven long years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like there's anyone here that you can feel sorry
for,'' said Decasseres, which is no doubt what half the jurors in
the first trial thought and what at least a couple on this one are
thinking, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury forewoman on Tuesday, the third day of
deliberation, wrote a note to the judge complaining of another
juror's intransigence, McKenna spent most of Wednesday interviewing
jurors to determine whether the jury was tainted and, presumably,
whether he should declare another mistrial. The lawyers stood
around watching computer screens scroll up those interviews. The
students did word jumbles and played connect-the-dots and sipped
Snapple drinks through straws.
</P>
<P>
   They came before 9 a.m. and left after 6, and by the end of
another long day, Decasseres and friends were getting the idea that
the practice of law is much more exciting on television. ``Just
waiting for it to end,'' he said. ``Whenever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   If King beats this rap again, then he will be free to make the
only compelling match left in the fight game: him against Mike
Tyson. Thursday, in fact, is the first day that Tyson is eligible
to apply to the Nevada State Commission to have his license
revalidated, a year having passed since he was banished for
munching on Evander Holyfield's ear. Tyson wants to again fight
Holyfield, but he is suing to have his contract voided with King,
his longtime promoter.
</P>
<P>
   King vs. Tyson, now that's must-see-court-TV _ unlike this one,
which has prosecution failure written all over it. If so, at least
the students will have gotten their lesson in judicial law, and
federal waste. &QL;

Are Redbirds dead birds? Next 4 games may tell
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ The St. Louis Cardinals are not dead yet. It just seems
that way by the crater-sized hole they dug for themselves during an
underachieving, injury-filled first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Louis' life-support machine could be turned off this
weekend during a four-game series with the National League
Central-leading Astros that begins tonight at Busch Stadium. A
series once expected to carry significant weight in determining the
NL Central title has turned into a ``must-win'' set for the
Cardinals, who sit 12{ games behind the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bigger series for them than it is us for us,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``If they lose three
of four or get swept, that pretty much puts the last nail in the
coffin. A split really doesn't do much for either team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though little has gone well for the Cardinals in relation to
their record, hardly anyone has bothered _ or cared _ to notice.
The entire country is too busy charting Mark McGwire's assault on
baseball's most sacred record _ Roger Maris' single-season mark of
61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, McGwire is often enough to keep the fourth-place
Cardinals (40-46) in a game. And with outfielder Brian Jordan, the
NL's top hitter this year at .339, St. Louis was predicted by many
to win the Central division after nose-diving to a fourth-place
finish in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has seemed to matter, though, as injuries,
particularly to the Cardinals' starting rotation, have taken a
toll. Starting pitchers Alan Benes (shoulder surgery), Matt Morris
(sore right shoulder) and Donovan Osborne (sprained left shoulder)
are on the disabled list _ although Morris is expected to be
activated and start Friday's game _ while shortstop Royce Clayton,
second baseman Delino DeShields and outfielder Ron Gant have also
been bothered by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis entered the All-Star break with 10 losses in its last
13 games, with eight of the defeats coming to lowly Detroit,
Minnesota, Cincinnati and Kansas City _ a combined 43 games under
.500. After being swept in three games last weekend at Cincinnati,
the Cardinals conducted a 55-minute team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the three days off and what we were going to
do after the break to get back (in the race),'' said St. Louis
manager Tony La Russa, whose team has averaged less than three runs
during its last 13 games. ``We also talked about how we played the
last few games. We had a lot to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals suggest it is too early to count them out of the
race. They open a season-long 11-game homestand today against the
Astros, from whom they took two of three games at the Astrodome a
few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a good position right now,'' said McGwire, the
majors' home-run leader at the break with 37. ``Do we have the
potential of catching them? Oh, yeah. The second half is the
weirdest time of the year. Everybody has seen gigantic leads
dwindle down to one or two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them tough in Houston. If we come out hard and win
four, I think it will send a message to the whole division that
we're for real, that the Cardinals are serious.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals do not gain ground in the division race this
weekend and fall further back in the pack, it's possible they might
consider shopping Jordan and Clayton, both of whom will be free
agents at the end of the season. Boston and San Francisco have been
rumored to be interested in Jordan, while Clayton could be headed
to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are well aware that just because you end the first
half atop the standings doesn't necessarily mean you'll remain
there. The Astros trailed Pittsburgh by one game at last year's
All-Star break before winning the division by five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals find themselves in a much worse predicament.
Before they challenge the Astros, they must find a way to move past
third-place Milwaukee and second-place Chicago. St. Louis is 5-9
against the rest of the Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be extremely difficult for them to come back,''
Hunsicker said. ``It's not just a matter of coming back and
catching us. They still have to catch two other teams.''

Astros in the driver's seat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ The Astros begin the traditional second half of the
season tonight five games ahead of the closest competitor in the
National League Central and 19 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Their first-half start was one for the record books, tying the
1979 club for the best 87-game start in franchise history. But as
the '79 team can attest, a rabbit start combined with a turtle
finish can result in road kill. The 1979 team, which also began the
season with a 53-34 record, played three games under .500 the rest
of the way and stumbled to a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The current Astros obviously hope to avoid that fate. With that
in mind, here are 10 questions that could hold the difference
between a major meltdown and consecutive division titles:
</P>
<P>
   1) Does the schedule favor the Astros in the second half?
</P>
<P>
   Because they have a five-game lead, the Astros control their own
destiny. In other words, as long as they take care of their own
business, they don't need to worry about what the rest of the
division is doing. Fortunately for the Astros, the tough part of
their schedule is behind them. Forty of their remaining 75 games
are against teams with losing records, and 38 of their remaining
games will be played at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   2) Which Jose Lima will return from the All-Star break?
</P>
<P>
   Lima was perhaps the Astros' biggest surprise during the first
two months of the season, but things have turned sour for him
lately. The durable righthander was 6-1 with a 2.82 earned run
average in his first eight starts, but he's only 1-4 with a 4.41
ERA in his last 10 starts. Home runs have been his biggest problem.
Lima only allowed five homers in his first eight starts, but he has
surrendered 13 long balls since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Lima has been surfacing,'' general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said. ``He needs to keep his emotions under control and
focus on his game plan and his location.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lima doesn't rebound, the Astros' rotation suddenly loses
some of its sting.
</P>
<P>
   3) Will the arms of Sean Bergman and Pete Schourek hold up for
the remainder of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Bergman is on pace to pitch 173 innings, which would be 38 more
than his career high, and Schourek is on pace to log 104 innings _
something he hasn't done since 1995, when he pitched 190 innings
for the Reds. Both have experienced arm troubles this season, and
Schourek is coming off elbow surgery. Bergman is coming upon
unfamiliar territory, and there has to be at least some concern as
to how he will handle the workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be some concern because of that, but
the more success they have, the more confident they become,''
Hunsicker said. ``People predicted Darryl Kile would fade down the
stretch (last season), and that turned out not to be true. I think
the more (Bergman) pitches, the better he will become. After seeing
what he has done, I've developed a degree of confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   4) Is there a turnaround in Mike Magnante's future?
</P>
<P>
   He began the season as the top lefthander out of the bullpen
before closer Billy Wagner, but youngsters C.J. Nitkowski and
Trever Miller have been more dependable. Hunsicker, manager Larry
Dierker and pitching coach Vern Ruhle are in Magnante's corner, and
he needs to support their faith in the coming weeks. The walks must
be reduced significantly.
</P>
<P>
   5) Will the addition of Jay Powell have the desired impact on
the bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   Powell proved himself as a setup man last season, working the
seventh and eighth innings before Marlins manager Jim Leyland
turned the game over to Robb Nen. With Doug Henry on board, Powell
won't have to carry that much of the load with the Astros, but he
will be a key member and should strengthen the relief corps. It
will be interesting to see how Powell's arrival affects Dierker's
usage of Magnante, Nitkowski, Miller and rookie Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   6) Will Jeff Bagwell avoid consecutive second-half tailspins?
</P>
<P>
   That's a safe bet. Bagwell was uncharacteristically cold after
the 1997 All-Star break, batting just .250. History suggests that
was a fluke. Bagwell is a career .306 hitter after the All-Star
break, and _ despite his struggles _ he still managed to hit 19
homers and drive in 57 runs in the second half of the 1997 season.
He ended the first half on a tear, and no one would be surprised if
Bagwell picks up where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   7) How does Richard Hidalgo fit into the mix?
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo will have to accept his new role as a fourth outfielder
when he returns from the disabled list because Carl Everett has
played too well in center field to return to a platoon. If Hidalgo
is smart, he'll accept the role better than Bob Abreu, who found
himself in a similar situation last season and sulked his way back
to the minors and ultimately out of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   8) Will the bench finally pitch in?
</P>
<P>
   This has been the only disappointing area on the team, and it's
a shame, because the bench was supposed to be so much better with
the acquisitions of Dave Clark and Jack Howell. Clark is hitting
just .150, and Howell is likely out for the season with a broken
left wrist. The Astros' .137 pinch-hitting average is the worst in
the National League. They only have two extra-base hits and seven
RBIs off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   9) Will any injured players make a contribution?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on much help here. Hidalgo notwithstanding, the
Astros can't rely on a significant contribution from their disabled
players. Pitchers Ramon Garcia and Chris Holt are out for the
season, and Howell is probably done, too. Righthanded reliever Jose
Cabrera is on a minor-league rehab assignment, but there may not be
room in the bullpen for him even if he does bounce back from a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   10) Is the current team good enough, or is another trade
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling would be a nice addition, as would be Pete
Harnisch. Hunsicker would love to add a top-notch starting pitcher,
but that's probably not going to happen. Regardless, the Astros are
more than good enough to win the NL Central, and it would be a
disappointment if they don't reach the NL Championship Series. By
most accounts, the Astros are one of the top five teams in the
majors.

BULLS' COACHING SEARCH DOWN TO 5 CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls have narrowed their search for a coach to five
candidates and expect to name a successor to Phil Jackson in the
next two weeks, a team official said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa State coach, Tim Floyd, long considered the leading
contender to replace Jackson, is scheduled to be interviewed, along
with four assistant coaches in the National Basketball Association:
the Bulls' Frank Hamblen, the Charlotte Hornets' Paul Silas, the
Indiana Pacers' Rick Carlisle and the Phoenix Suns' Scott Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, who is scheduled to be the first to meet with General
Manager Jerry Krause, will speak with him on Friday. The interview
process is expected to take between 10 days and two weeks, said the
team official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Several other candidates have been mentioned, among them former
Bulls player Bill Cartwright, now an assistant coach with the team;
Jim Paxson, also a former Chicago Bull, and George Karl, who was
dismissed as the Seattle Sonics' coach soon after his team was
eliminated from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   After having guided the franchise to six championships in the
1990s, Jackson announced soon after the Bulls won their most recent
title that he would not return to coach another season. Given that
he and Bulls' chairman Jerry Reinsdorf mutually agreed last summer
that they would part ways after Jackson completed a one-year deal
worth $5 million, there had been many rumors all season as to who
would take over the the team.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling among many league observers is that Krause, who
could not be reached for comment Wednesday night, will choose
Floyd, whom he has occasionally gone fishing with and considers a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Jordan, who has not decided whether to play next
season, may have veto power. The team official said that Jordan had
been consulted on each candidate and did not appear to have any
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle, 37, ran the offense for Larry Bird last season and is
regarded as one of the best young minds in the game. His system,
predicated on ball movement, helped the Pacers overcome many
quicker, more athletic teams. A former teammate of Bird's on the
Boston Celtics, Carlisle spent five years with the New Jersey Nets
before coaching under P.J. Carlesimo in Portland for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Silas was edged out by his friend and former teammate Paul
Westphal for the Seattle SuperSonics job last month. He turns 55 on
Sunday, but relates to young players and works well with them. He
has not been a head coach since 1983 when he finished his third
season with the San Diego Clippers before they moved to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming an assistant to Dave Cowens in Charlotte, he
coached under Pat Riley in New York, Chuck Daly in New Jersey and
Cotton Fitzsimmons and Westphal in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Hamblen is a career assistant coach. Hamblen, Jimmy Rodgers, who
recently resigned as a Bulls assistant, and former Bulls assistant
Jim Cleamons were hugely responsible for Chicago's success under
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, a long shot for the position, is the most intriguing
candidate. At 34 years old, he would unseat the New York Knicks'
Jeff Van Gundy as the youngest coach in the league if he were to be
hired. &QL;

WIFE, BOYFRIEND ARRESTED IN HUSBAND'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM WALSH AND JUDI VILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mesa man obsessed about his affair with his best friend's wife
killed the friend with an ax and stuffed the body in a bathtub,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The body remained in the tub for six days, while the man, the
victim's wife and a 2{-year-old girl lived in the one-bedroom,
one-bath apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're mine, I own you,'' Arthur Osborne, 48, told the
victim's wife, Elizabeth Constance ``Connie'' Terwilliger, 29,
according to a police source who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was an emotionally abused wife,'' the police
source said. ``She became involved briefly with Osborne. He became
emotionally obsessed with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Terwilliger told police that Osborne killed her husband,
Tom Terwilliger, when she refused to leave him because she still
loved him.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, police believe Tom Terwilliger was
slain about two months ago, on May 10, which was Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne and Terwilliger admitted that they eventually loaded the
body into a cardboard box and into Osborne's pickup truck, and then
took it to a desert area near Maricopa, the records said.
</P>
<P>
   Terwilliger told police Osborne was visiting the apartment May
10 when she went for a 45-minute walk with her daughter, leaving
Osborne and her husband alone, the records said.
</P>
<P>
   Terwilliger said that when she returned, Osborne showed her the
body in the bathtub and threatened to kill her and her daughter if
she told anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Terwilliger told police she never reported her husband's murder
because of Osborne's threat, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne also threatened to frame Terwilliger for the murder, the
police source said, if she ever found another boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell them it was you all along,'' Terwilliger quoted
Osborne as saying, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   Terwilliger's subsequent relationship with another boyfriend in
her apartment complex prompted Osborne to make good on that threat,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne called police to the Terwilliger apartment in the 1900
block of West University Drive on Thursday and told them he may
have disposed of a murder victim's body, the court records said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Osborne, who claimed he was Tom Terwilliger's best
friend, led police to Terwilliger's decomposed body, which was
identified through fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Osborne and Terwilliger were arrested by Mesa
police on suspicion of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   They came into the Mesa police station together around 5 p.m. to
inquire about Osborne's truck and some other property that had been
impounded, said Sgt. Brian Kozak, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Clayton Hamblen of West Mesa Justice Court
ordered Osborne and Terwilliger held without bond. A preliminary
court appearance is scheduled for July 21.
</P>
<P>
   In court records, both Osborne and Connie Terwilliger denied
killing Tom Terwilliger, 36, and accused each other of the crime.
They both admitted helping to dispose of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying she did it, she's saying he did it,'' the police
source said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Osborne was accused of lashing out
violently because of a relationship with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, Osborne was arrested in Kingman after an
attack on his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced in February 1990 to two concurrent seven-year
sentences for aggravated assault and attempted kidnapping, after a
sexual assault charge was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne apparently became angry when his girlfriend went out one
night and didn't return home until the following morning, according
to Mohave County Superior Court records.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman returned home, Osborne put a .38-caliber handgun
between her eyes, then hit her on the head with the gun, the
records say. He raped the woman and beat her with a belt before
forcing her to write a suicide note and then threatening to kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt too many people that I love,'' the note said. ``I can
no longer live with myself. I must kill myself. It's the only way
out. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The note was signed with the woman's name, Social Security
number and driver's license number, the court records say, but the
woman eventually escaped and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne initially was placed in medium security at the Arizona
State Prison at Florence, but was moved to minimum security in
April 1993, said Michael Arra, a spokesman for the state Department
of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was paroled in April 1994 and his parole ended that
October, Arra said.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's court appearance, a tearful Terwilliger hugged
relatives before she was led away to a Maricopa County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives declined comment, both in the courtroom and at a south
Phoenix mobile home park where Connie Terwilliger's parents live. &QL;

Column: All-Star Game still strikes chord
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ This is my favorite leftover note from the 69th
All-Star baseball gala:
</P>
<P>
   David Wells was only the third New York Yankees pitcher to start
in this showcase since 1969, when Mel Stottlemyre took the loss in
Washington. Mel was actually a replacement, pressed into service
when the game was postponed a day because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Denny McLain of Detroit had to miss his scheduled start because
of a previous appointment with his dentist. Either Denny was
suffering from a problem with a really major toothache, or the
incident reestablishes one of two things: the power of dentistry in
America, or the flakiness of the pitchers of another era.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear how many All-Star moundsmen wish they had
undergone a root canal Tuesday, as opposed to taking part in a game
that produced 21 runs, 31 hits and a marathon 13-8 win for the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when you talk to a baseball lifer, and you ask him (or
her) to explain the nuances of a game that had wiped out 16
pitchers, you can expect an answer along the lines of, ``That's
what makes this game so great.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is the beauty of baseball. It isn't always
greatness that captures our fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we are moved by a story of the heart. Walt Weiss, the
Atlanta shortstop, playing in his first All-Star Game at 34 and
doing it almost out-of-body. A week earlier, his 3-year-old son,
Brody, had a brush with death, then miraculously recovered from an
E-Coli bacteria infection.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss collected two hits, a run and an RBI, but he had eyes only
for his little boy, sitting in the stands, cradled in his mom's
lap. Brody passed a final medical test Tuesday night, eating a hot
dog.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we are grabbed by a story of redemption. This was a
game that made a hero of a player _ Baltimore's Roberto Alomar _
who had been the sport's most maligned man in 1996 after he spat on
an umpire. (At least Roberto never denied it. When a well-known pro
football player did the same to an opponent, he tried to claim it
was a sneeze.)
</P>
<P>
   Alomar led off the AL's sixth-inning rally with an infield
single, stole third and scored on a passed ball. His three hits
included a bases-empty homer and earned him the Most Valuable
Player trophy, a year after the honor was won by his big brother,
Sandy, the Cleveland catcher.
</P>
<P>
   There were four players _ the Alomars, Barry Bonds, and Junior
Griffey _ who were the sons of former players, making the game
suitable for family viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a game of individuals, really. It is not a team
sport, at least not in the sense football is. A Mark McGwire can
crunch homers at a record clip for a losing St. Louis team, as
Griffey does for Seattle. But Barry Sanders is going to get stuffed
like a cabbage if the Detroit Lions don't block a lick.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this exactly answers the question that was put to
Cal Ripken: Why is baseball's All-Star Game romanticized in a way
that doesn't apply to football or basketball? The Pro Bowl is
played after the season, when hardly anyone cares except the
players and their wives, who get a trip to Hawaii. The NBA All-Star
festival has enjoyed a recent boom, but it is still at bottom a
playground game, with an occasional trapeze act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with baseball,'' said Ripken, ``you begin with all
that history.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you do. Even the casual fan knows Babe Ruth hit the
first home run in an All-Star Game in 1933. Who else? Pick a year,
any year, and you might come up with Carl Hubbell, striking out
consecutively five of the greatest hitters the game has known; Ted
Williams riding Rip Sewell's ``eephus pitch'' over the fence; or
Reggie Jackson lifting one into the light towers at Tiger Stadium,
just like the scene from The Natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was managing in the minors,'' Ripken went on,
``we'd all get together and sit around the TV and watch the
All-Star Game. It made you feel good, something about the middle of
the summer that brings everyone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, it was the novelty of seeing the elite of the two
leagues tangle, as they did only three times a year, spring
training and the World Series being the others. It was that rare
chance to see on the same field Joe DiMaggio and Stan Musial, Lefty
Grove and Dizzy Dean, Mantle and Mays, on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that this special character was the trade-off when
the owners adopted interleague play _ which seems to be working, at
a price to be paid later.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell that seeing aliens from the other league is losing
its novelty when the players welcome their return to intramural
combat. McGwire was looking ahead to the Cardinals' four-game
series at home against the first-place Astros. ``I think we're 12{
games out,'' he said correctly. ``I know we play them tough. If we
win four, it sends a message: that the Cardinals are serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the Astros consider the source.

 DREYFUS BEGINS INQUIRY INTO MANAGER'S TRADING ACTIVITIES  (jw) 
 By   EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dreyfus Corp &UR; . &LR;  said Wednesday that it has placed the
former portfolio manager of two of its mutual funds on ``paid
administrative leave'' as part of an inquiry into the manager's
personal trading activities.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Dreyfus comes amid a widening investigation by
federal and state securities regulators into the activities of
Michael Schonberg, who until April was the lead manager of two
Dreyfus funds that have suffered big losses in the last two years
by investing in shares of small companies. The New York state
attorney general's office is conducting an investigation into
whether Schonberg, former manager of the Dreyfus Aggressive Growth
Fund and the Dreyfus Premier Aggressive Growth Fund, personally
benefited from directing the funds to buy shares of companies whose
securities he owned in his personal account, according to a person
involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has also begun a
preliminary inquiry into the situation, according to a person close
to the matter. Dreyfus, a subsidiary of Mellon Bank Corp., began
its own investigation last month into the trading activities of the
fund and Schonberg after a well-known short-seller raised questions
about the funds' investment in shares of Chromatics Color
Sciences, &UR;  &LR; a development-stage medical products company.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday announcing that it had placed Schonberg
on paid leave, Dreyfus said, ``Given the thoroughness required by
Dreyfus with respect to its previously reported inquiry and the
interests of all concerned, this initiative is designed to
facilitate the process and to assure that Schonberg's time will
continue to be devoted exclusively to this inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The current uproar over the Dreyfus manager erupted last month,
when Manuel Asensio, a New York investor who specializes in
short-selling _ that is, betting that the price of certain stocks
will fall _ issued a flurry of press releases accusing Dreyfus of
failing to properly supervise Schonberg.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg owned shares of Chromatics Color Sciences
International in his personal account before joining Dreyfus in
August 1995. Asensio contended that the manager's aggressive buying
of the shares for the Dreyfus funds was ``clear evidence of
wrongful utilization of investors' money.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg also owned other securities in his own personal
portfolio before buying them for the funds, including shares of
Tidel Technologies, formerly known as American Medical
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal for a portfolio manager to own securities that
are also held in a fund he manages. But federal securities laws
prohibit managers from taking certain actions in the funds they
manage that will benefit their personal accounts, and many fund
companies also have rules about when and how a fund manager can
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has been studying whether to tighten its rules regarding
personal trading. Barry Barbash, the director of the SEC's division
of investment management, which regulates mutual funds, said in an
interview that his staff would soon recommend to the commission
stronger compliance systems for managers' personal trading.
</P>
<P>
   Barbash said among the proposals being considered were measures
that would require a fund manager to disclose his personal
securities holdings upon joining a new company, that would require
a fund company to file its code of ethics with the commission, and
that would tighten the obligations of a fund's independent
directors in reviewing fund managers' personal trading.
</P>
<P>
   The New York attorney general's office is also looking into
whether Dreyfus misled investors in its disclosures about the types
of stocks in which the funds would invest and in its advertising of
the performance of the Aggressive Growth Fund in late 1996,
according to a person close to the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began in December 1996 after it was learned that few
investors in the fund had enjoyed the phenomenal performance that
was being advertised at the time by Dreyfus, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended Sept. 30, 1996, the Aggressive Growth Fund
gained 82 percent. But most of the gains occurred early in that
year, while the fund had only a few million dollars of assets.
After Dreyfus began advertising the fund's red-hot performance and
investors flocked to buy shares, the fund suffered losses, leaving
most shareholders in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the fund's total return in the 1996 fiscal year
equaled 82 percent, the fund's financial statements showed that it
lost nearly $11 million of investors' money.  &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tina Brown, the Oxford-educated and Fleet
Street-trained magazine editor who for better or worse pulled The
New Yorker into the late 20th century, announced Wednesday that she
would resign as editor to start a company affiliated with Miramax
Films that would publish a new monthly magazine, publish books and
produce films and television programming.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's announcement came after months of rumors of growing
tension between her and Conde Nast Publications, which owns The New
Yorker, over the company's attempts to make the magazine less
unprofitable. Although it won nearly two dozen major awards during
Ms. Brown's six-year tenure and newsstand sales rose 145 percent,
it lost $11 million last year. In total, it has lost more than $100
million in its 13 years of ownership by Conde Nast, which is in
turned owned by Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Harvey Weinstein, a co-chairman of
Miramax, said he approached Ms. Brown about the new venture just
one month ago after reading newspaper reports that her contract
with Conde Nast was expiring. Ms. Brown then introduced Weinstein
to Ronald Galotti, who is the publisher of Vogue magazine and had
worked with Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair, both owned by Conde Nast.
Galotti will leave Vogue, which is also owned by Conde Nast, to be
Ms. Brown's partner in the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Andrea Kaplan, said a successor to Ms.
Brown would be named shortly.
</P>
<P>
   An editor with a flair for show business, Ms. Brown transformed
The New Yorker from a venerated icon that some said was verging on
irrelevance into a kind of news magazine of the power elite. Her
resignation, effective Aug. 1, offers S.I. Newhouse Jr., who is
chairman of Advance Publications, the chance once again to reshape
the identity of The New Yorker, which more than most magazines has
reflected the particular intelligence and idiosyncracies of its top
editors, from Harold Ross and William Shawn to Robert Gottlieb and
Ms. Brown. But it remains unclear whether it will ever be possible
to make The New Yorker a home for the kind of high-quality literary
journalism and humor that made it famous, and, at the same time,
make it profitable for Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has had only the four editors in its nearly 75-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the staff said they were stunned and upset by the
news, which Ms. Brown delivered shortly after 10 a.m. to a small
group of writers and editors she had summoned to a meeting billed
as a discussion of coming issues.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Brown, she and Galotti will now embark upon the
seemingly risky adventure of trying to create the kind of so-called
synergy that has become a buzz word in media and entertainment
circles _ in this case, inventing a magazine from scratch to dig up
the kind of articles that might then be turned into movies and
television specials that Miramax, which is owned by Walt Disney
Co., would have the capacity to help package, circulate and
promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be the guinea pig of synergy,'' said Peter Kaplan,
editor of The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old daughter of George Hambley Brown, the British
movie producer who brought out the first Agatha Christie mystery
films, and Bettina Iris Mary Brown, Laurence Olivier's press agent,
who later became a gossip columnist for a magazine for expatriates
in Spain, Ms. Brown made her name in the early 1980s when she
rejuvenated the stodgy British society monthly, the Tatler, making
it slick and trendy and quadrupling its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   She went from there to editor in chief of Vanity Fair in 1984,
where again she nearly quadrupled its circulation in just five
years, putting celebrities on the cover, hiring photographers like
Richard Avedon and doubling or tripling what writers were paid.
Over the last six years, she has introduced many of the same
principles to The New Yorker, raising its circulation from 659,000
in late 1992 to 808,000 in the last half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Ms. Brown revolutionized the image and soul of
the magazine, long known for indulging its writers in articles of
impressive length on subjects inspired by their personal passions
as much as the news of the week. It was a magazine admired for
brilliant foreign reporting and its impeccable taste and sometimes
laughed at for its multipart series on topics like grains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown shifted its focus to the country's three power centers
_ New York, Washington and Los Angeles. She made it topical in ways
it seemed to have prided itself on never being. Its covers became
willfully provocative, its voice more than occasionally glib.
People talked about it constantly, admirers and detractors alike.
In response to the charge that she vulgarized the magazine, Ms.
Brown said Wednesday, ``I've always believed in lapses of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Ms. Brown introduced a new stable of widely
admired writers to The New Yorker, including David Remnick, Louis
Menand, Anthony Lane and Henry Louis Gates. Its coverage of the war
in Rwanda, by Philip Gourevitch, was highly praised. At the same
time, she enlisted Roseanne Barr as a guest editor of a special
issue on women, ran a profile of a dominatrix by Paul Theroux, and
invited Dick Morris to a breakfast with reporters and advertisers
two weeks after a sex scandal forced him to resign as an adviser to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went too far sometimes,'' said Michael Kinsley, editor of
the online magazine Slate, who formerly edited The New Republic and
who credited Ms. Brown Wednesday with making The New Yorker what he
called the most exciting magazine in America. ``But if you're
afraid of going too far, you don't go far enough. She takes risks.
Sometimes they're embarrassments but they're a price worth
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, rumors spread that Ms. Brown and Conde
Nast were increasingly unhappy with each other.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Ms. Brown's husband, Harold Evans, resigned as
president and publisher of Random House's trade group, which is
also owned by Newhouse. Though he said he left in order to become
editorial director and vice chairman of Mortimer Zuckerman's
publications, including The Daily News of New York, many media
executives suspected that Newhouse had at least been willing to go
along with the change because Evans was insufficiently concerned
with the business' bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Brown was said to be displeased by a decision to draw
The New Yorker under the corporate umbrella of Conde Nast and to
sell its advertising pages in packages with pages for other Conde
Nast publications. She had also objected unsuccessfully to a plan
by Conde Nast to move The New Yorker out of its home on West 43rd
Street into a new Conde Nast edifice in Times Square along with all
of the other magazines in the group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Brown was widely said to be dissatisfied with
the president of The New Yorker, Tom Florio. But when he was
suddenly replaced at the start of Memorial Day weekend, Ms. Brown
was not consulted on his successor. She was given just one day's
advance notice that the job would be filled by David Carey of Conde
Nast House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Ms. Brown and Weinstein, who is 46,
said they first discussed the subject of so-called new media
ventures on the Miramax plane flying back from a New Yorker
conference on the future at the Disney Institute in Orlando, Fla.,
and attended by media moguls like Michael Eisner, Disney's
chairman, and Barry Diller, chief executive of USA Networks. But
Weinstein said he did not formally approach Ms. Brown about the
undertaking announced Wednesday until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she then brought in Galotti, 48, who was
publisher of Vanity Fair during the last two years of Ms. Brown's
tenure there. He had left abruptly for a job at Esquire in 1993
amid rumors that Newhouse had forced him out; however, he returned
shortly afterward as publisher of Vogue. Galotti, who is said to
have been the model for the bombastic, sex-machine character called
Big in Candace Bushnell's column and now television series ``Sex
and the City,'' had also been founding publisher of Conde Nast
Traveler when Evans started it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weinstein, he and Ms. Brown reached an agreement on
the deal at 5 p.m. Tuesday. He said he and Galotti came to terms at
2:30 a.m. Wednesday. Ms. Brown, who had eaten lunch with Newhouse
on Monday without ever discussing her possible plans, said
Wednesday that she had informed Newhouse of her resignation at 9
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Brown and Galotti said that what attracted them most
about the offer, and what made it worth quitting their jobs for,
was the prospect of owning the company they would create. ``It is
the quintessential enticement that Harvey put before us,'' Galotti
said. Without that, they suggested, they would not have chosen to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Neither they nor Weinstein offered many details of the proposed
company, which is to be based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown will be chairman and Galotti will be president.
Weinstein said the company would be separate from Miramax but would
operate like a division, feeding projects to Miramax. The magazine,
which Ms. Brown would describe only with adjectives like ``upscale,
contemporary, sophisticated,'' is to make its debut in the fall of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Conde Nast announced that Richard Beckman,
publisher of GQ, would replace Galotti at Vogue. Ms. Kaplan, a vice
president for corporate communications at Conde Nast, said Newhouse
would make no statement on Ms. Brown's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Within Conde Nast itself, one conceivable candidate might be
Graydon Carter, Ms. Brown's successor at the highly profitable
Vanity Fair. But staff members said Wednesday that Carter had said
he was not Ms. Brown's replacement. Another rumored possibility
might be Kurt Andersen, who edited New York magazine and currently
writes a column called ``The Culture Industry'' for The New Yorker.
He said Wednesday night that he had not been approached.
</P>
<P>
   Other names being bandied about on the grapevine Wednesday
ranged from Remnick to Kinsley. ``Well, no one's called me,''
Kinsley said cheerfully, when asked if he was in the running. It
seemed at least conceivable, too, that Newhouse might have been
caught by surprise and not yet have a successor or a vision for the
magazine's future in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the staff of The New Yorker insisted Wednesday
that Newhouse had tried hard to convince Ms. Brown to sign a
five-year contract; they speculated that she had finally grown fed
up with dealing with Conde Nast. Admirers of Ms. Brown described
her departure as a terrible loss to the magazine; even those with
more complicated feelings about Ms. Brown were said to have never
wanted her to leave, for fear of getting someone worse.

MEXICO CUTS '98 BUDGET OUTLAYS TO MATCH DROP IN OIL INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico said Wednesday that it would slice an
additional $730 million from federal spending in 1998, taking
bitter fiscal medicine for the third time this year in an effort to
maintain stability despite dropping oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Added to federal budget trims announced in January and March,
the new reductions bring Mexico's cutbacks so far this year to $3.7
billion, closely matching its lost oil revenue. Finance Minister
Angel Gurria said Wednesday that the country would stick to its
original target of a modest federal deficit for 1998, on the order
of 1.25 percent of economic output.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is again seeking to shield itself from the fallout of the
economic turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deer-in-the-headlights syndrome in Mexico,'' said
Ernest Brown, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They
are making a very hard-nosed decision to cut yet again.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier cuts helped to sustain investor confidence in the
economic leadership of President Ernesto Zedillo. Growth has
continued to surge, reaching 6.6 percent in the first quarter, and
foreign investment continues to flow in.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's cuts showed that Mexico cannot protect itself
entirely against the volatility emanating from Asia. The government
still depends on oil revenue for about a third of its annual
income. Petroleum prices have plunged this year because of flagging
demand in the giant Asian economies, including Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The budget cuts are based on a new downward revision of the
estimated average 1998 price of Mexican petroleum exports that
Energy Minister Luis Tellez announced Wednesday to $11.50 a barrel
from $12.50.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexico is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, it has joined a coordinated global effort to
reduce the oil supply by cutting back its production by 200,000
barrels a day. Even so, Mexico's petroleum exports brought an
average of only $10.61 a barrel in the first half of this year,
Tellez said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gurria said that the federal spending cuts would not come out of
budgets for health, education, anti-poverty, police or justice
programs. About $280 million will be taken from exploration and
other programs of Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the state-owned
oil monopoly. The government also received an unexpected $370
million from increased tax collection and sales of state-owned
railroads and telecommunications services, Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were relieved that the government decided not to raise
any prices, which might have driven inflation upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said, `We are going to engineer more pain,''' Brown
of Morgan Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors welcomed the new cutbacks. The leading indicator of
the Mexican stock market rose 62.67 points, or 1.39 percent, to
4,573.28 points, its seventh gain in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision is sure to draw fire in Congress, where Gurria
is trying to win approval to transfer $65 billion in debts out of a
federal bank bailout program and include them in the overall
government debt.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bank bailout, the government will have to ask for
funds to service the interest on bad bank loans it took over from
weak or failed Mexican banks. But many lawmakers, including a
number from the government's own party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, regard the entire bailout as a political loser
in which Mexican taxpayers are being asked to absorb huge burdens
to pay for the mistakes of wealthy bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of spending cuts is likely to increase skepticism
in the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by the
opposition, about providing funds for the bank bailout, a crucial
piece of a broad package of urgently needed financial reforms the
government has been battling for since March.

BRONX OFFICIAL FILES U.S. COMPLAINT OVER STADIUM REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's effort to block a public
referendum on the future of Yankee Stadium was the target of
another attack Wednesday, when Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer filed a complaint with the Justice Department, contending
that blocking the referendum would violate the federal Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said the referendum _ on whether tax dollars should be
spent to build a new stadium for the New York Yankees _ would
sharply increase voter turnout in New York City, because most
residents firmly believe that the baseball team should not leave
its stadium in the Bronx. He said the referendum would increase
turnout particularly in the Bronx, where most voters are members of
minorities and ardently want the Yankees to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Voting Rights Act outlaws racially discriminatory voting
laws. It also requires New York City and other regions with a
history of low minority voter turnouts to submit all changes in
election procedures to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potentially disenfranchises hundreds of thousands of
voters,'' said Ferrer, who held a news conference at Yankee Stadium
on Wednesday to announce that he had asked the Justice Department
to investigate whether Giuliani was violating the voting act.
``Precluding the stadium referendum will not only decrease public
participation on all issues on the November ballot, but it will
suppress minority voter participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is trying to block the stadium referendum, proposed in
April by City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, by proposing another
referendum, which would ask voters to approve changes to the City
Charter. Under city law, charter-related questions take precedence
over other questions. The mayor wants to use a business tax to help
build a new stadium, probably in Manhattan, that he has said might
be necessary to dissuade the Yankees from leaving the city
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In attacking Giuliani's charter revision proposal Wednesday,
Ferrer joined a growing group of politicians and private citizens
fighting to keep charter-related questions off the ballot. A
commission named by the mayor to explore changes to the charter has
been assailed in recent weeks for rushing to complete its
recommendations before November.
</P>
<P>
   And in public hearings around the city, dozens of people have
accused the commission of plotting serious changes to the charter
for no reason but to help Giuliani keep the stadium question off
the ballot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commission appeared to be responding to the criticism
earlier this week, when its chairman, Peter Powers, announced that
the panel would stop exploring contentious changes in the balance
of power in city government _ like abolishing the office of the
public advocate _ and focus instead on less controversial issues.
But commission members have pressed on with their goal of making
recommendations in time for a November referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Powers and Giuliani have dismissed much of the criticism on the
charter questions as politically motivated, and Wednesday both said
Ferrer's complaint was not valid. ``It doesn't make any sense,''
Powers said. ``A lot of people will come out to vote, because there
is a tremendous amount of debate on this charter.'' He added, ``The
mayor set up a charter commission and this, in my mind, has nothing
to do with a baseball referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the charter commission, Elizabeth St.
Clair, said a charter-related referendum ``absolutely would not''
violate the Voting Rights Act, because it would not affect standard
voting procedures in the city. ``The Justice Department is not in
the business of dictating what a city should put on its ballot in
order to affect voter turnout,'' Ms. St. Clair said. ``We think
Ferrer is absolutely incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, whose borough stands to lose its most famous and
lucrative landmark if the Yankees depart, also boycotted a public
hearing held by the Charter Revision Commission in the Bronx on
Wednesday night, saying he did not want to participate in ``a
charade.'' But Giuliani said Wednesday that Ferrer's criticism was
only increasing the chance that the Yankees would leave the Bronx.
</P>

   ``They have a right to make a decision about where they want to
be,'' the mayor said of the baseball team. ``This is a mindless way
to approach trying to keep a private business in your borough.''

Let the no-names begin quest for true-grit team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ At one end, somebody named Nate Huffman was shooting
15-foot hook shots.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a guy who might be the shortest player in the league
even if the league is the WNBA, 5-5 Earl Boykins, was flinging
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Working on his free throws across the gym at Moody Bible
Institute was Acie Earl, whose bones were dug up by America's best
archaeologists just for this event.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Rudy Tomjanovich, right in the middle of the
action, perhaps feeling like he arrived on vacation only to find
the surroundings looking a whole lot different than they did in the
travel brochure.
</P>
<P>
   Except that this is hardly a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Tomjanovich's assistant, Del Harris of the Los Angeles
Lakers, said: ``We were suppose to come here, have a little workout
in the morning, then play golf all afternoon. But that's changed a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a little. When you expect Tim Duncan and Tim Hardaway
and get Tim Breaux and Tim Kempton, you know there's a lot of work
ahead when it comes to taking on the world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what USA Basketball is calling this adventure: Taking
On The World. For Tomjanovich, Harris and Lon Kruger of the
University of Illinois, all they have to do is whip this motley
crew of replacement players into shape in less than three weeks
before the World Championship of Basketball starts in Athens,
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 NBA players who were suppose to be on this U.S. team are
long gone, casualties of the labor dispute between the league and
its players.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's up to Tomjanovich and friends to make chicken salad
out of chicken feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bunch of guys working hard,'' Tomjanovich said
Wednesday night after the 29 hopefuls for the U.S. squad went
through their first workout, a two-hour-plus marathon packed with
scrimmage sessions. ``We're going to have five practices to
evaluate them, and then make our first cuts. We want to be as fair
as possible. We want to get the right chemistry. And we're looking
for players who complement each other well and play hard at both
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one other thing that Tomjanovich and his staff are
looking for: an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Without NBA players, the U.S. team will be a long shot to win
the gold medal in Athens. Therefore, Tomjanovich wants a team with
the kind of true grit John Wayne would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally tough guys,'' he said when asked what he was looking
for out of those trying out for the 12-man roster. ``I think those
teams over there (in Europe) feel they are going to have a cakewalk
with our NBA guys not going. And we've got to have guys who feel
it's us against the world and are really united. Toughness and
sticking together will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that everybody connected with the U.S. team is well
aware that America's role in the World Championships has changed.
Fans who were promised NBA stars will get no-named replacements.
But the depth of U.S. basketball will be challenged. And it's clear
that the underdog mentality has sunk in already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a different situation,'' Harris said. ``You go
from where you're the obvious overdog to where you're getting
reports from Europe that the teams over there are upset that we're
not sending good players, and that the fans are upset that they
paid money for tickets to see NBA players and are not going to see
a good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we jump into the role of underdog. At first, it was a bit
of a shock. But then, after you analyze it a little bit, it's
almost a challenge you can't resist. We really feel like this is a
worthwhile challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a big hurdle. But if we can do it, it's going to
be something that we'll remember. The odds are against us. But on
the other hand, we're going to end up being better than people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players showed as much quickly during the first
practice. Tomjanovich did not wish to single out any players, but
it was clear that former Texas Tech star Jason Sasser, former
Washington Wizard Larry Stewart and University of Connecticut
standout Richard Hamilton shined in the inaugural workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very few strangers to us out here, but now these next
four practices are going to be big as far as finding out what we've
got,'' Tomjanovich said. ``The NBA players not being here hasn't
changed how I feel about coaching this team _ that it's a great
honor. And it hasn't changed our goal _ and that's to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that the team is going to have to work
harder, and the coaches are going to have to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you are hoping for Jason Kidd and end
up with Warren Kidd.

BASEBALL REACHING FOR RECORDS, BUT HAS EXPANSION DILUTED
ACHIEVEMENTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Maris removed Babe Ruth's name from the record books when
he swatted 61 balls over fences in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years later, baseball statisticians have erasers
poised over Maris' name.
</P>
<P>
   Burly St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire has Maris'
single-season home-run record squarely in his sights, with 37, and
Ken Griffey Jr. (35) and Sammy Sosa (33) are also a threat to the
most hallowed record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   There is a common thread between Maris, McGwire, Griffey and
Sosa, other than their names and the phrase ``home-run record'' in
the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball expanded by two teams in 1961, adding the Los Angeles
Angels and Washington Senators. Baseball expanded by two teams in
1998, adding the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Maris hit 61? The popular, off-the-top-of-the-head
response is expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Why are McGwire, Griffey and Sosa challenging Maris? And for
that matter, why is Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez challenging
Hack Wilson's single-season record for runs batted in? Expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   And wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that expansion has an impact, but the
numbers behind the numbers indicate that the impact isn't as great
as generally believed. Yes, great hitters are having monstrous
seasons. However, the league-wide numbers are similar to a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for the expansion effect involves simple
arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason, it makes mathematical sense, that if you
take 22 pitchers that would be in the minor leagues and put them in
the big leagues, it's diluted,'' said Rangers broadcaster Tom
Grieve, who has seen expansion as a player, general manager and
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   There are some numbers to support the expansion-equals-offense
theory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the National League had a composite .243 batting
average, 2.99 earned-run average and averaged 6.86 runs per game.
The AL hit .230, had a 2.98 ERA and scored 6.81 run per game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when two teams were added to each league, the NL jumped
to a .250 average and 3.59 ERA, and scoring soared to 8.11 runs per
game. There was a similar bump in the AL, where the league average
went up to .246, the ERA to 3.62 and scoring to 8.18 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when two teams were added to the NL, scoring jumped by
more than a run per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With expansion, there's only a couple of shortstops that
weaken the field of shortstops,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``There's only a couple of first basemen that weaken
the field of first basemen. There's probably 30 to 40 pitchers that
weaken the field of pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbers behind the numbers suggest there's more to
it than expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the AL bumped the schedule by eight games. Teams played
162 games for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, expansion was accompanied by two significant rule
changes. In response to growing dominance by pitching, the mound
was lowered and the strike zone made smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, one of the new teams was the Colorado Rockies. Baseball
was played for the first time in the thin air of Denver, where
balls carry 7 percent farther than at lower altitudes. The Rockies'
team ERA of 5.41 was the worst in majors.
</P>
<P>
   For further evidence on what that does on scoring, check out the
All-Star Game on Tuesday when a record 21 runners crossed the plate
against the best pitchers in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   This season, players say there's no discernible difference in
the pitching from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much the same,'' Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros said. ``I'm sure you get the people who played 30, 40
years ago and they'll tell you about how expansion has diluted the
talent and this and that. Actually, if you look at numbers per
capita, the amount of people you're drawing from has increased.
You've got a larger population in the U.S., you're drawing from
people outside the U.S. So you can argue that the talent is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Perception and reality seem to agree. The statistics don't show
a big bump in offense this season.
</P>
<P>
   The overall batting average in the AL was .271 last year. It's
.272 this year. It was .263 in the NL in '97; it's down a point to
.262 now.
</P>
<P>
   Runs per game in the AL is up a bit from 9.86 to 10.13. It's
down in the NL from 9.35 last year to 9.14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still as competitive as it was last year,''
Rangers designated hitter Lee Stevens said. ``On any given night,
any starting pitcher can shut you down at this level. And good
hitters are going to get their hits off anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than show a dramatic increase, the statistics show a
continuation of the recent trend toward offense.
</P>
<P>
   There was no expansion in 1994, when Matt Williams was on pace
for 61 homers, Griffey was on pace for 58, Jeff Bagwell was on
target for 55 homers and 163 RBI, and Tony Gwynn was batting .394
when the players went on strike in August.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no expansion last year, when McGwire hit a
combined 58 homers for the Oakland Athletics and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been coming for the last three or four years,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``The hitters are getting bigger
and stronger and more disciplined every year. I think expansion has
something to do with it. This year, you've got 20 pitchers in the
big leagues that wouldn't be here otherwise. Every new ballpark
that's built has at least half of it that's a hitters' paradise.
All of these reasons have to do with the amount of offense we see
today.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one more reason why McGwire, Griffey and Sosa are taking
aim at Maris, and why Gonzalez is stalking Wilson. It's called
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is a great run producer taking advantage of the
opportunities his teammates provide him and staying healthy,''
Grieve said. ``McGwire, he's been there before. Griffey has been
there before. And Sammy Sosa, that seems to be a function of a
mechanical change he made. My personal opinion is that it's a
disservice to those four guys to attribute it to expansion. I don't
think that's fair. It's not like these guys have just come out of
nowhere. All four of them, they've been there before. They've done
this before.''

NOT ONLY HOME RUNS FIND THE BIG GAPS AT COORS FIELD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Coors Field is a state-of-the-art baseball facility
that makes club owners from New York to San Diego drip with envy.
</P>
<P>
   The home of the Colorado Rockies has four-star accommodations
and amenities for fans, players and the news media. It is Oriole
Park at Camden Yards with the magnificent Rocky Mountains as a
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field is perfect, except for one little flaw. It cannot be
defended in the most literal sense. In its four-year existence,
outfielders have not figured out how to approach their defensive
play, and pitchers have not mastered the art of avoiding
embarrassment in the only major league park a mile above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   These aspects, the main reasons for the wacky existence of the
pitching-poor home team, were finally put on full display Tuesday
night when the combination of a ballpark as an offensive weapon and
the best hitters in baseball resulted in the highest-scoring
All-Star Game in history. The television ratings, according to NBC,
were smashing, too: The 13.3 national rating and 25 share were the
highest since 1995, when the game earned a 13.9/25; the estimated
38 million viewers was the highest viewing total since the 1994
game attracted 42 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The American League, proving once again to be a little bigger
and brawnier despite the defection of Mark McGwire to the other
side, stopped the National League, 13-8. The teams, battering each
other to the delight of a Coors Field record crowd of 51,267,
scored the most runs since 1954 with the American League winning,
11-9. There were a record-tying 31 hits, including 26 singles that
broke the previous record of 26 singles. This mayhem assured
another first _ the longest All-Star Game: 3 hours 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The thin air of the Rockies and the wide expanses of the Coors
Field outfield deprive players of two of Hall of Famer manager Earl
Weaver's rules for success _ pitching and defense _ leaving only
the three-run home-run portion of his formula in place. And that
makes Coors the most offense-friendly park in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, one of the hitting stars _ the Orioles'
Roberto Alomar _ was named the most valuable player. The second
baseman, inheriting the trophy from his brother, Sandy, the 1997
All-Star MVP, went 3 for 4, ranging from a first-inning bunt to a
seventh-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's performance was indicative of the American League's
well-rounded and aggressive attack, which included a two-run double
by Cal Ripken Jr., a bases-empty homer by Alex Rodriguez, a record
five stolen bases and 16 singles, which eclipsed the one-team
All-Star Game mark of 13 singles. Ivan Rodriguez had three hits _
an All-Star record for a catcher. And he played only six innings.
</P>
<P>
   When the elements allowed, defense sparkled, especially when the
Yankees' Paul O'Neill helped preserve what was then a two-run lead
by throwing out Fernando Vina when the Brewers' second baseman
tried to score from second. O'Neill's throw from his uncustomary
position of left field ended a two-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the park, not individual plays that left the
All-Stars exhausted and in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coors Field,'' said Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette, ``kept
its reputation, and so it should.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of the 16 All-Stars to pitch only six, including starters Greg
Maddux and David Wells, were unscored upon. Fittingly, the winning
pitcher, Bartolo Colon of the Indians, clung to victory despite
having yielded a three-run homer to the Giants' Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What the game exposed to the world aside from the Rockies'
eternal plight at this height is that Coors is much more than a
home-run park. Yes, three home runs were hit, but the game was
decided in the gaps, between outfielders and infielders, between
outfielders and outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes this ballpark so tough to pitch in is
that the outfield is so big and hitters hit a lot of bloopers and
gappers,'' said Tom Glavine, the exemplary Braves' pitcher made
human when he allowed four runs in an inning and a third of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people realize, now, it's not the home runs,'' said
Bichette. ``It's been the hits all along, the bloop single, bloop
single, then the home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gwynn: ``I know people came expecting to see six, seven
home runs and they got some, but what they saw more was the grenade
attack. It was not very pretty, but hitters love it when they get
jammed and still find a way to get a hit. And that's what happened
tonight.'' &QL;

NO GAIN, NO PAIN WITH BUD LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So long as the owners and operators refuse to look beyond the
day and the hour; so long as clubs and individuals persist in
gaining personal headlines through public criticism of their
associates; so long as baseball people are unwilling to abide by
the rules they themselves make; so long as expediency is permitted
to replace sound judgment, there can be no satisfactory solution.''
_ Ford Frick, upon his resignation as commissioner of baseball,
1964 _ from Lords of the Realm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you thought baseball's party reached a rousing crescendo in
Denver this week, wait'll the owners kick it into another gear
today in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   First on their list of things to do: Pop the top on a Bud Light.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the facade officially ends. Today, the owners will crown
one of their own as ``king'' of baseball, and the traditional
concept of a commissioner of the game becomes a footnote in
history.
</P>
<P>
   They're not even going to try to fool us _ or themselves _
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years after Ford Frick, who never had nearly as much
to say while he was actually serving two terms in the
commissioner's office, became the first and only commissioner to
voluntarily walk away, the only thing that has changed is that the
wizards of Oz have come out from behind the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   They have decided to anoint fellow owner Bud Selig, a car
salesman who owns one of the weakest franchises in the game, as
``baseball commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   They should make it easy on everybody and call him by his real
title:
</P>
<P>
   Owners' Bobo.
</P>
<P>
   Or houseboy in residence.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   No more will they try to convince us that the commissioner
represents all of baseball _ the owners, the players, the fans _
which is a pity, because that was always good for a real belly
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Bud as a neutral party, what with him standing there
with his arm elbow deep in the cookie jar, is something even
baseball owners would be hard-pressed to attempt.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a positive to come out of today's meeting, it's that
we can finally put this farce of a commissioner's search behind us,
remove the laughable five-year ``interim'' tag from in front of
Selig's name and move on _ at long last.
</P>
<P>
   That Selig would eventually emerge as the owner's man has been a
foregone conclusion for a long time. He is one of them and they
like that, of course. Plus, Bud is a deal-maker within the context
of discovering which way the wind is blowing and then leading the
charge in that direction. That makes him seem like a leader, even
when reality is that he's simply smart enough to pick the winning
side in every issue.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't try to use Selig's radical realignment plan as
evidence that he's willing to step out and put his neck on the
line. How much realignment actually got done? One team _ his _
switched leagues and that was exactly what Bud wanted for the
Brewers. One other team, the Tigers, changed divisions. Not exactly
radical, huh? In the end, Bud waffled. It's what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bud will get the job because he's willing to take it, giving
his fellow owners a chance to focus on what they do best _ making
money. They're happy enough with his leadership by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   That it has taken so long might be a product of allowing the
specter of Selig (looking eerily like an undertaker) calling off
the 1994 World Series, to fade in the minds of fans.
</P>
<P>
   With Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. chasing Roger
Maris' single-season home-run record, with Juan Gonzalez stalking
Hack Wilson's 67-year-old RBI mark, with youngsters like Ben Grieve
and Kerry Wood coming into the game, baseball is riding a wave of
popularity again.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play has been a success, despite the grumbling of
prominent players like the Rangers' Will Clark, and the arrival and
success of players from South Korea and Japan have given the game a
colorful international flavor that bodes well for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Selig and CEO Paul Beeston have floated rumors that they might
even ask Paul Molitor, a longtime player rep, to become a deputy
commissioner if he retires after this season, an obvious peace
offering to the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   They're actually talking a pretty good game. Unfortunately,
that's just business as usual for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, ultimately, is plain and simple: On a day when
we had hoped for Dom Perignon, the best baseball can give us is a
watered-down Bud Light.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for all intents and purposes, the honorable office of
commissioner of baseball officially ceases to exist.

NURSING HOMES HIDE REPORTS OF FLAWS, GREEN CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A five-month investigation of New York City nursing
homes found that they routinely and illegally conceal bad
inspection reports, city Public Advocate Mark Green said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state laws require nursing homes to post inspection
findings by the state Department of Health, Green said, but few do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good law that is ignored,'' he said. ``Almost nobody
knows that the law exists. One hoped-for benefit of the
investigation is that caregivers placing their parents in nursing
homes will ask for these reports and they'll know which nursing
home to best contract with.''
</P>
<P>
   Green blamed the Health Department and Gov. George Pataki for
the lack of compliance. ``Every time we investigate,'' he said,
``we find the Health Department asleep at the switch. The governor
doesn't like business regulations on HMOs, hospitals or nursing
homes. In trying not to appear antibusiness, he has become
anticonsumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Health, accused Green of obscuring the facts for political gain.
Green is running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cited 28 homes in the last year for failing to
adequately display their inspection results, so it is something we
look for,'' Ms. Tarlton said. ``Mark Green, in an effort to get
publicity for his political ambitions, is continuing to present
very limited information in a dramatic way to unnecessarily alarm
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he sent two employees to 37 of the city's 180 nursing
homes. Of the 37, he said, 26 were rated ``deficient,'' meaning
that they had been cited for at least one deficiency in their most
recent available inspection report.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection found that 14 of the 26 homes rated deficient
either failed to post their most recent inspection report, posted
the report where residents would require assistance to review it,
or denied access to the report. Nine posted their inspection
reports legally, Green said, but either posted them so poorly _ for
instance, behind a door _ that it defeated the point of public
display, or obstructed the investigators' review of the reports in
a legal but intimidating manner by, for example, hovering over an
investigator as he read the report.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 26 homes rated deficient posted their reports
prominently and provided prompt, polite access, according to Green.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 10 of 11 homes with no deficiencies provided proper
posting and access, Green said.

COWBOYS AGREE TO TERMS WITH THREE DRAFT PICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys reduced their list of unsigned draft
picks from nine to six yesterday by reaching deals with three
players.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was defensive lineman Michael Myers, who was
chosen in the fourth round out of Alabama. Myers agreed to a
three-year deal, worth roughly $850,000, including a $245,000
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the fold are two seventh-round selections _ former
California running back Tarik Smith and former Georgia guard
Antonio Fleming. Both also agreed to three-year deals with
identical base salaries of $144,000 in 1998, $180,000 in '99 and
$216,000 in '00.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Jerry Jones Jr., who's handling the
Cowboys' end of negotiations for every contract except top pick
Greg Ellis, said things have gone pretty smoothly and expects to
have a few more contracts completed in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would be surprised if all of the players are not
signed by the start of training camp, July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone pretty much how you would expect,'' said Jones,
who's gaining a larger role in the Cowboys' front office. Jones
negotiated only three contracts last year.
</P>
<P>
   One reason haggling might be at a minimum this year is the
Cowboys' $3.34 million rookie pool. Most of the rookie money will
go to Ellis, the former North Carolina defensive end who the
Cowboys chose as the eighth overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   With parameters set by last year's No. 8 pick James Farrior of
the New York Jets and this year's No. 9 pick Fred Taylor of the
Jacksonville Jaguars, Ellis is looking at a deal between $1.7
million and $1.8 million per year, including a signing bonus of
around $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Farrior got $8.846 million over five years with a $4 million
signing bonus from the Jets and Taylor received $10.7 million over
six years with a $5 million signing bonus from the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of the other Cowboys' contracts will be for
league-minimum base salaries, leaving the agents room to negotiate
only on various bonus clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Crawford, Myers' agent, said he is happy they got
everything completed so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who was suspended for his senior season at Alabama
because of dealings with an agent, will be looked on by the Cowboys
to provide depth on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said Myers is ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a fair deal,'' Crawford said. ``He wasn't penalized for
sitting out. Mike just wants to play. He missed a whole year of
football. He just wants to get started.''

LEADING OFF FOR METS NOT PRODUCTIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manager Bobby Valentine says it is an insult to his
players to question the Mets' lack of production from the leadoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips points out that there are few
prototypical leadoff hitters around these days, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that the team's consistent
inability to score runs in the first half of the season was a major
reason why they hobbled into the All-Star Game break five games out
of the National League wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no question that the offensive weakness begins at
the top of the order, where the Mets rank 15th of 16 in the
National League in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage
(.306) and 14th in runs scored (49).
</P>
<P>
   The leadoff issue is just one of several key problems facing the
Mets as they head into the second half of this season, which begins
Thursday night at Shea Stadium against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   There is the bullpen, which seems just as thin and unreliable as
it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And there is outfielder Bernard Gilkey, who somehow seems just
as lost at the plate this season as he was last year.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the return of Todd Hundley, who is set to
play his first game for the Mets this season on Saturday night in
his new identity as an outfielder. During the nine months Hundley
spent recuperating from elbow surgery, the Mets went out and
acquired another power-hitting All-Star catcher, Mike Piazza, to
take Hundley's place behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Can Hundley quickly pick up where he left off as a hitter and
combine with Piazza to form a formidable one-two punch in the
middle of the Mets' batting order? Will he be sufficiently content
as an outfielder to truly embrace Piazza as the new catcher? Will
Piazza, a free agent after the season, feel comfortable enough with
the whole situation _ and with the Mets' ability to contend for a
playoff spot in coming years _ to sign a long-term deal with the
Mets? And will the Mets ultimately feel comfortable about
committing a fortune to Piazza if other holes on the team are going
to be left neglected?
</P>
<P>
   For all of these reasons, finding someone to do the job at the
top of the lineup does not appear to be the biggest issue at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things right now, the leadoff spot is a
little bit of a lesser priority,'' Phillips acknowledged just
before the All-Star break. ``The bigger thing is getting the
bullpen settled down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But with such weak numbers at the top, is it any wonder that
Piazza _ who batted third in his first 30 games with the Mets
before hitting cleanup in his last five _ had only 32 official
times at bat in his first 35 games as a Met with runners in scoring
position?
</P>
<P>
   Through their first 83 games, the Mets employed 72 different
batting orders, including 10 leadoff hitters. At the break,
according to figures compiled by the Elias Sports Bureau, the Mets'
leadoff hitters ranked 11th in the National League in extra-base
hits (22); sixth in walks (38); were tied for 10th in stolen bases
(9) and were 12th in slugging percentage (.335). They were,
however, third in runs batted in with 36.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae (35 games) and Edgardo Alfonzo (25) did the bulk of
the leadoff work for the Mets in the first half of the season. Even
though he batted only .234 before the break, McRae was productive
in various ways for the Mets, leading the team in extra-base hits
with 29, including a surprising 10 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But as a leadoff hitter, McRae batted only .210, leaving him
21st out of the 21 players in the league who hit first in a minimum
of 25 games. He was 19th out of 21 in on-base percentage (.305) and
16th of 21 in slugging percentage (.364), all of which suggests
that McRae did a lot better, and hit with more power, when batting
lower in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's numbers as a leadoff hitter weren't all that better.
The third baseman ranked 18th of 21 in batting average (.229); 15th
in on-base percentage (.324) and 18th in slugging percentage
(.344).
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Mets have yet to replace the Lance Johnson of
1996, who hit .333 for the Mets in the leadoff spot, with an
astounding 227 hits. Last year, Johnson was hampered by shin
splints and missed a significant amount of time before the Mets
traded him to the Cubs last Aug. 8 as part of a deal that brought
McRae and the beleaguered Mel Rojas to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Johnson has been hurt again and has barely played for
the Cubs. Still, Valentine bristles when the leadoff issue _ and
the implication that the Mets miss Johnson _ is brought up. He
recently defended both McRae and Alfonzo as leadoff hitters,
essentially saying that McRae's production speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   As for Alfonzo, Valentine expressed exasperation in the
widespread perception that the third baseman, who batted .315 last
season and is hitting .267 this year, is better suited to hit
second. In fact, Valentine believes Alfonzo has the potential to be
a good leadoff hitter now, even if he has yet to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Hundley makes a big impact quickly, the leadoff
problem won't be as troublesome. And if he spends the majority of
his time in left field, he will probably be putting his best friend
on the team _ Gilkey _ on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Gilkey put together a career year, hitting .317
with 30 homers, while driving in 117 runs. Last season, though,
Gilkey hit just .249 with 18 homers and 78 runs batted in, and the
numbers would have been even worse were it not for a surge in the
final weeks of the season. And since April 25, Gilkey is just 27
for 144 (.188) with three homers and 13 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Valentine tried Gilkey in the leadoff spot last
week, perhaps as a way to get him going. But Gilkey went hitless,
doing no better than everyone else who has been batting at the top
for the Mets.

EDITORIAL: NIGERIA EDGES TOWARD ANARCHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   The only way Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar can bring Nigeria back
from the brink of political chaos is to act immediately on his
promise Wednesday to restore democracy. With unrest and rioting
erupting, Africa's most populous nation cannot wait for Abubakar to
weigh his options. Nigeria urgently needs a civilian transition
government and a date for free elections.
</P>
<P>
   The death this week of Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner and the focus of the nation's hope for
democratic leadership, erased any tolerance among Nigerians for a
more extended transition from military rule. Nigerians even doubt
the government report that the cause of Abiola's death was a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, trying to quell the unrest, Wednesday spoke of the
importance of democracy and restoring the integrity of the
military, an encouraging but insufficient step. Abubakar's
government can try to quiet the nation with troops, with the
probable result of more deaths and fresh protests. Or it can give
Nigerians what they want, which is the opportunity to speak for
themselves. He should announce the immediate release of all
political prisoners and set the earliest possible date for a fair
election. He should then appoint an interim civilian government to
run the country until the election, and step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was the apparent winner of presidential elections in
1993, but the military government interrupted the vote count. When
he claimed the presidency the next year, he was imprisoned. He may
indeed have died of a heart attack, and the government's promise to
allow foreign doctors to participate in the autopsy is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But even that diagnosis would not absolve the government of Sani
Abacha, Abubakar's predecessor, of some responsibility for Abiola's
death. His health deteriorated steadily over four years in prison.
He was in solitary confinement at least some of the time, and one
of his children has said he was denied medical care.
</P>
<P>
   If Abubakar tries to retain power in the weeks ahead, violence
may escalate along ethnic and regional lines. Abiola was a Yoruba
southerner, a group traditionally shut out of Nigerian politics,
and his jailers were mainly Hausas from the north. That would be a
calamity for Nigeria.

RANGERS REMAIN IN RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Anaheim Angels perhaps made one mistake
en route to their place atop the American League West before the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels failed to bury the Rangers when the opportunity
presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were probably trying,'' Rangers first baseman Will Clark
said. ``They just couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule makes it so.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who enter the season's second half 11/2 games
behind the Angels, begin a stretch of 25 consecutive games against
the Athletics, Mariners, Orioles, Devil Rays, Royals, Twins, Blue
Jays and White Sox with this afternoon's game in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   All those with the exception of the Blue Jays enter the season's
second half with a sub-.500. record. The Rangers went 26-17 (.605)
against those eight teams before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next three weeks are very important for us,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said, ``because the next three weeks after
that, we've got 17 straight games with Boston, Cleveland and New
York. Those three teams are playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how well you're going to play against teams,
but the next three weeks we play Oakland, Seattle, Kansas City and
Baltimore. That'll be a stretch where we don't wall to fall behind
with that tough stretch coming in August.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity existed for the Angels to begin shoveling their
first clumps of dirt on the Rangers during June. The Rangers, who
began the season 18-7, won only 17 of 40 games after May 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baseball,'' Clark said. ``It comes and goes in cycles.
You ride it out. There's no switch you can turn on and off _ not in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The horrendous stretch included a season-high, six-game losing
streak June 27-July 3. The Angels, though, turned their six-game
deficit into only a meager, 11/2-game advantage before the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plus,'' Oates said. ``It could be a whole lot worse,
but I don't think there's anyone with enough pitching to run away
and hide _ well, except for the Yankees, which they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   What bodes worse for the Angels might be the manner in which the
Rangers concluded the season's first half. The Rangers enter this
afternoon's game with a modest, two-game winning streak and appear
to be cured of their defensive lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers concluded the first half with a streak of three
consecutive errorless games for the first time since June 18-20
after committing 30 errors during their previous 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got away from playing the type of baseball that we're
accustomed to playing,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``We're
not playing as well now as we were in May, but we can get back to
that level. We can be that good.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule should be beneficial to that cause.

DEATH OF SEX OFFENDER TIED TO MEGAN'S LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to change wording of lede graf) 
(ATTN: Calif) (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Last Tuesday, in the two blocks around the
scruffy rooming house where Michael Allen Patton lived alone, the
police spread the word door to door in stark fliers: Patton was a
paroled sex offender with a 22-year history of assaults on women
and young girls, a neighbor who had served 13 years in state
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Patton, a 42-year-old sign painter, was found
hanging by a rope tied to a redwood tree on the edge of this placid
town in the heart of Sonoma County's wine country, his discarded
bicycle nearby. Back in his room, across the street from a YMCA,
down the block from a middle school and close to a youth services
organization, investigators found a two-paragraph suicide note on
pocket notebook paper addressed to his sister, describing where his
body could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Patton was one of 1,600 people classified as high-risk, violent
sexual offenders statewide, with his record subject to public
dissemination under the provisions of California's year-old version
of Megan's law. He was one of 6 such offenders singled out by the
Santa Rosa Police Department last week in its first effort at
public notification. And while Patton's note made no mention of the
law or the disclosure, supporters and opponents of the law agreed
that the chain of events spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the inevitable consequence,'' said Elizabeth
Schroeder, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California and an authority on sex offender
notification laws. Ms. Schroeder said she believed that the case
was the first in the state in which a suicide followed public
notice. ``It was going to happen eventually,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials here expressed regret at Patton's death, but
they said that there was no indication of any vigilantism against
him and that they planned no change in their notification
procedures for the most serious offenders, those convicted of at
least two violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, local law agencies have wide flexibility in
handling notice about such people, while a total of 64,000
offenders' names are listed on a CD-ROM that is available for
public inspection in every county sheriff's office and some police
departments, but not otherwise widely distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed it, but there isn't anything we could've done
to prevent this as far as I can see,'' said Sgt. Ernesto Olivares,
supervisor of the Santa Rosa Police Department's sex crime and
family violence unit, which oversees the mandatory registration of
all 242 convicted sex offenders and public notice about the
high-risk ones in this city of 130,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we could've changed or can change,''
Olivares said. ``The intent of the law is to keep people informed
and aware of a potential threat in their neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   He said officers had only handed out the one-page fliers _ with
a color picture of the mustachioed, bespectacled Patton, who was 5
feet 5 inches tall and weighed 220 pounds _ to adults in person,
and did not leave them in mailboxes or under doors where children
might find them. Each flier was accompanied by a one-page cover
letter explaining the provisions of the law and warning of its
penalties for vigilantism, Olivares said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Patton's neighbors, Mike Lucas, a retired man on
disability who lives across the street with his wife, Patti, said
Patton could be seen walking in the neighborhood, unkempt _ ``like
a low-life,'' as Mrs. Lucas put it. The Lucases said that the
police flier had made them nervous but that they were glad to have
received it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that this pain caused him to take his life,'' Lucas
said. ``But I still want to know if there are violent people in my
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As states throughout the country rushed to pass sex-offender
notification laws after the murder of Megan Kanka by a convicted
offender in Hamilton Township, N.J., in 1994, civil liberties
groups warned that such efforts could drive convicted offenders
even further underground and make it impossible for them to find
jobs or put down roots in an effort to overcome their past.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakeland, Fla., man shot himself to death last year after the
Polk County Sheriff's Department ran an advertisement in The
Ledger, a Lakeland newspaper that is owned by The New York Times
Co., identifying him under Florida's notification law as a sexual
predator who had had oral sex with a 4-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we have to have a notion that punishment is
over,'' said Ms. Shroeder of the Civil Liberties Union. ``What
these public notification laws do is they essentially place a big
scarlet letter on someone's chest, that for the rest of this
person's life he will be publicly branded. The whole notion of
rehabilitation in this country has been lost, particularly for sex
offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials and legislators maintain that the
high recidivism rate among sex offenders justifies efforts to keep
their neighbors informed. And while disclosures of such offenders'
whereabouts have often prompted harassment and protests by
neighbors since the California law took effect 18 months ago, a
spokesman for State Attorney General Dan Lungren says his office
has yet to record a confirmed case of vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Attorney General Lungren has always maintained that Megan's
law provides a tremendous tool to the law-abiding public, to know
if there are convicted sexual criminals living among them in their
community,'' said the spokesman, Rob Stutzman. ``That public good
outweighs potential negatives that may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the law has been in force since last year, some cities
like Santa Rosa, 50 miles north of San Francisco, are just getting
up to speed on notifications, in part because of an effort to weed
out inaccuracies and outdated information on the state registry of
sex offenders. Before releasing the names of the six high-risk
offenders here, Olivares said, investigators visited each of the
men and explained what was happening. He said Patton had had no
particular reaction one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, The Press Democrat, which is also owned by
the Times Co., published Patton's name along with those of the five
other high-risk offenders, in an article about the police
notifications last week. The paper's managing editor, Robert
Swofford, said it had first adopted the policy last summer, when
the county sheriff's department issued its own notifications about
high-risk offenders living in unincorporated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we had to make the call, are we going to name
these people or not, and we made the decision that it's out
there,'' Swofford said, adding that the paper had tried to
interview all six men last week but that only two had agreed, and
Patton was not among them. ``When this one came around, we followed
the same practice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the paper quoted Pattie Davenport, who worked with
Patton at an unidentified sign company in nearby Petaluma, as
saying: ``They knocked the rug out from under him for something he
did 16 years ago. It wasn't fair. He was trying to live right.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said Patton's criminal record included
convictions dating to 1976 on charges of false imprisonment,
assault with intent to commit rape, rape by force or fear, oral
copulation with a child under 14 and unlawful sexual intercourse
with a child under 18. He was released from the California Men's
Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1995 after serving a 13-year sentence
for a 1982 conviction. His parole was to have expired next week.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown, executive director of the Sonoma County Family
YMCA, which is diagonally across the street from Mr. Patton's
rooming house, said that all of its programs for children took
place indoors or on gated playgrounds under close supervision, and
that it had not changed its practices in any way because of
Patton's presence in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had time to digest it,'' Brown said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Patton's death left more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a lot of assumptions about what he was
thinking,'' Olivares said. ``But only Mr. Patton knows, and he took
that with him.'' &QL;

DEFENDANT IN TERROR TRIAL IS SAID TO ASSAULT CO-DEFENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trial of two men charged with trying to bomb a
subway station was disrupted Wednesday when, the judge said, one of
the defendants assaulted the other in a cell near the courtroom
during a recess.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators in the courtroom in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
could not see the assault, but they could hear thumping noises and
a voice crying out, ``They're going to kill me!'' Shortly
afterward, the defendant said to have been assaulted, Lafi Khalil,
23, was returned to the courtroom by federal marshals with blood
streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was still in its room at that point, and was later
reported by court officials not to have been aware of the attack.
The panel was not told about the incident when Judge Reena Raggi
cut short the day's session and dismissed the jurors late Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil was treated for his injuries at Long Island College
Hospital in Brooklyn and was later returned to jail. The trial was
expected to resume Thursday morning, with more bailiffs assigned to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Raggi warned the defendant she said had committed the
assault, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar, that he would be removed from
the courtroom, and would have to watch his trial from a courthouse
cell via closed-circuit television, if he caused any disruption in
the courtroom. The judge also said the two men would be kept
separated in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Palestinian immigrants, are accused of conspiring
to explode a powerful pipe bomb in the city subway in what
prosecutors said was a planned ``act of international terrorism.''
The prosecutors, from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, hold
that the men were motivated by a hatred of Israel and opposition to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Rostal, a lawyer for Abu Maizar, told the jury when
testimony began Monday that her client had not intended to set off
the pipe bomb the police found when they raided his Park Slope,
Brooklyn, apartment last July 31, but rather that he had planned to
use it in a plot to defraud a government antiterrorism program of
money. Khalil's lawyer has not yet addressed the jury, but Khalil
told federal agents after his arrest that he had not known about
the bomb's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after the incident in the cell, another lawyer for
Abu Maizar, Michael Padden, told the judge that his client had
informed him that ``this was not an unprovoked incident'' but that
`` Khalil had made some highly provocative comments'' about Abu
Maizar and his family. Other people familiar with the incident, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, later said that the reported
remarks were threats to Abu Maizar's family should Khalil be
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Raggi made clear that she held Abu Maizar, 24,
responsible for the incident, adding _ as he sat before her without
expression at a defense table where Khalil was no longer present _
that this was ``only the latest in a string of reckless actions''
by Abu Maizar that included what she termed ``foolhardy escape
attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all here biting our nails for what he is going to do
next,'' she said. But she said she was rejecting a suggestion by
marshals that Abu Maizar be made to wear leg irons in court. Raggi
said it could prejudice jurors against Abu Maizar.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials have said that Abu Maizar, who faces a sentence
of up to life in prison if he is convicted, made two short-lived
escape attempts during pretrial hearings last month. In one,
officials said, he jumped onto a courtroom table but marshals
quickly tackled him. In the other, they said, he tore a section of
ceiling panels down in a courthouse cell in an apparent effort to
find a crawl space or air duct to squeeze through, but his effort
quickly ended when a ceiling support collapsed after he grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to Marshal Daniel Byrne, on Monday _ as
Abu Maizar was being led to the discharge area of the Manhattan
jail where he is being held, in preparation for being brought to
court for his trial _ he managed to slip one hand out of his
handcuffs. When asked why he did this ``right before the eyes of
authority,'' the marshal wrote in a letter to Judge Raggi, Abu
Maizar ``replied that nothing could hold him for long.'' &QL;

THIEF'S LEGAL MOVE BACKFIRES, `STRIKES' COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of all the mistakes Andre Terial Wilks has made in
his young life, perhaps the biggest was refusing to accept a
seven-year prison sentence for stealing a cell phone from a car.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 19-year-old Los Angeles man man suffered the
consequences in a case that troubled the judge and prosecutors
alike: Instead of seven years for the theft, he'll serve 25 to life
under the ``three strikes, you're out'' law.
</P>
<P>
   The judge imposed the life sentence in April but took the rare
step Wednesday of bringing Wilks back to court to reconsider her
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager apologized to the judge and begged for leniency.
It was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Shari K. Silver in neighborning San
Fernando let the life sentence stand, saying that she couldn't find
mercy _ only ``frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see the light at the time,'' the judge told Wilks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the Wilks case is a classic example of a
defendant acting as his own worst enemy. They said he could have
avoided a life sentence had he listened to his lawyer or mother or
uncle or the judge. Even when his attorney _ in a rare move _
allowed the prosecutor to speak with him, Wilks ignored the advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the head of a brick wall,'' Los Angeles County Deputy
District Attorney Jacquelyn Lacey said after the court hearing. ``I
felt that I perhaps could reach this particular defendant. I have a
son who is almost his age.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wilks' attorneys, the fault lies with the criminal justice
system _ not Wilks. They argue, their teen-age client shouldn't
serve a life sentence under the ``three strikes'' law for crimes he
committed as a juvenile. The 1994 law mandates a 25-to-life
sentence for a third serious felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that the criminal justice system has failed
to do the right thing in Mr. Wilks' case,'' said his lawyer, Deputy
Public Defender Richard Petherbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could have reduced the sentence by expunging one of
his two prior convictions for a purse-snatching spree committed a
week after he turned 16. Prosecutors say Wilks and a friend were
armed with a gun during the spree. Wilks' attorney says Wilks'
friend had the gun _ which might have been fake _ and no one was
assaulted or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Given these facts, the judge refused to drop either conviction.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that Wilks, a high-school dropout, chose to take
the case to trial even though everyone ``begged'' him to take the
plea bargain. Indeed, during one pre-trial hearing the judge
actually stepped down from the bench to have a personal chat with
the defendant _ another exceptionally rare move.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks' latest brush with the law occurred in September 1997 when
he and a 12-year-old friend were charged with breaking a car window
and taking a cell phone. Wilks' friend testified against him at
trial, saying they'd burglarized a house earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   While talking with Wilks before the trial, the prosecutor
explained to Wilks that he risked a life sentence if convicted at
trial. She also explained that her case was a solid one.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said the District Attorney's Office has since decided that
Wilks deserves a life sentence for reasons including that he showed
no remorse. Worse, he took the witness stand and perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' she said, ``he has earned his life
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilks' mother said his hard-headed attitude is just another sign
of his immaturity _ evidence that he's too young to understand the
consequence of his self-destructive legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people doing attempted murders who don't get that
much time,'' said his mother, Pamela Brown, 41, an unemployed
telemarketer.

IN MANY CITIES, NEW BULLETS HAVE NOT BROUGHT COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Hawaii)   (sidebar with NY-POLICE-BULLETS)  
 (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision by the New York City Police Department to issue
hollow-point bullets to its officers has generated debate, but the
ammunition has been standard issue in many other metropolitan
police departments for years and has generated few, if any,
complaints, law enforcement officials in those cities say.
</P>
<P>
   Besides federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and
the U.S. Marshals Service, at least 19 police departments in large
cities across the country either issue or allow officers to use
hollow-point ammunition. The bullets are relatively slow-moving
projectiles that expand quickly on impact. By comparison, the fully
jacketed ammunition that is standard in most military forces and is
still used by some police departments often travels at a greater
speed and does not readily break apart when it hits a target.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Police Department began issuing hollow-point
ammunition about a decade ago in the hope that the bullets would
have greater stopping power, said Sgt. Michael Griffin, the
department's range-master. All San Francisco officers now use a
.40-caliber subsonic hollow-point bullet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully jacketed ball ammunition is designed to produce wounds,
not necessarily incapacitate a person immediately,'' Griffin said.
``The idea in a war situation is that the wounded will tie up more
support personnel than the dead. But the issue in law enforcement
is survival. You want to stop an attacker as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, he said, hollow-point bullets ``have become
pretty standard in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   While the hollow-point bullets are deadlier, law enforcement
officials said that the ammunition's slower velocity and its
ability to collapse make it less likely to travel through walls or
ricochet off hard surfaces, thereby reducing the risk of injury or
death to bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin added that the greater stopping power of the bullets has
also allowed San Francisco police officers to fire fewer rounds
during violent confrontations. ``We train to fire two or three
shots at a minimum and on average we now see about three rounds
fired per incident,'' he said. ``Before it was closer to four or
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tanabe, a firearms technician with the Honolulu Police
Department, said violent movies and television shows had generated
what he said were needless concerns about hollow-point bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics usually don't understand the dynamics of a bullet and
go by the prejudices of Hollywood when looking at this one,'' he
said. ``They make it out to be a magic bullet, like it tears
people's arms off.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have worried that a hollow-point bullet could be much
more deadly to bystanders. They have also criticized use of the
ammunition because of the damage it does to a body when it strikes,
calling it ``cruel and unusual punishment,'' said Aaron Rosenthal,
a retired assistant chief in the New York City Police Department.
But Rosenthal said that, in general, officers are sufficiently
trained to hit their targets and avoid accidentally hitting
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not taught to fire at arms and legs, because that's a
way to get you to an inspector's funeral,'' he said. ``The idea is
to stop the combatant as quickly as possible and it is assumed
that, with the training an officer receives, he will be successful
and not hit anything else.''

SEC SAID TO BE ACTING ON POSSIBLE PRICE-FIXING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission, completing an
extensive investigation into possible price-fixing on the Nasdaq
stock market, is now negotiating settlements with _ and preparing
possible sanctions against _ several stock traders and as many as
two dozen brokerage firms, executives at several Wall Street firms
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives, who spoke on condition that neither they nor
their firms would be identified by name, said the commission _
using information culled from trading room audio tapes _ appeared
to be focusing on many of the same 24 brokerage firms that in July
1996 settled a civil antitrust suit that accused them of colluding
to inflate profits from trading shares on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, according to the executives, is weighing
proposed fines against many individual traders that range from
several thousand dollars up to many million dollars. Their firms
may also be subject to SEC sanctions. The amount of the proposed
fines relates to the amount of evidence found on recorded tapes
that the SEC subpoenaed as part of its investigation, the
executives said. Brokerage firms routinely tape the conversations
of their traders to prevent disputes about transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have gone through the tapes and have an arbitrary
number of people acting,'' said a senior official at one firm
Wednesday. ``They have some formula of amount per offense.'' The
SEC, this executive said, has listened to tapes and found a
specific number of instances in which, in effect, collusion on
prices took place.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the SEC and for several major brokerage firms,
including Goldman, Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Paine Webber,
Salomon Smith Barney, Warburg Dillon Read LLC, all declined to
comment on the issue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been investigating price-fixing on the Nasdaq
stock market since the summer of 1994, when a study by two
professors _ William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul
Schulz of Ohio State University _ argued that brokerage firms had
colluded to raise their profit margins from their trading on the
Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC subsequently investigated the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market. In August
1996, the SEC censured the NASD for its failure to regulate the
market adequately, prompting the NASD to overhaul the way it
regulates the Nasdaq market, and spend tens of millions of dollars
to reorganize its regulation of the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit brought against more than 30 brokerage
firms on behalf of investors who traded shares on the Nasdaq market
has also resulted in a number of settlements with individual
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The suit charged collusion and price-fixing. Herzog, Heine &AMP;
Geduld Inc., for example, in June 1997 agreed to pay investors
$30.6 million to its part of that case. The suit contended that the
firms colluded in trading spreads artificially wide in securities
trading on the Nasdaq market in the years between May 1989 and May
1994.

MAN CONVICTED OF DOUBLE MURDER MAY FACE EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Dalkeith McIntosh, an indigent 38-year-old
Jamaican immigrant, was convicted Wednesday of murdering two women,
making it possible that he could be the state's second man awaiting
death.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for 14 hours over three days, the jury found
that after a domestic quarrel, McIntosh gunned down his estranged
wife, Francine Williams, 47, and her 23-year-old daughter, Eunice,
in the summer of 1996 as they sat in a car here.
</P>
<P>
   The eight men and four women on the jury also found that he had
shot a 6-year-old boy, Anthony Williams, whom he had raised as a
son, but the child survived and eventually testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 1995 capital-punishment law provides for death in a
case that meets any of certain criteria, and prosecutors said
McIntosh's case met more than one.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of multiple first-degree murders, and he was
convicted of killing one person to keep her from being a witness
against him. The law also provides for death in particularly
heinous crimes, and the presence of the child was considered such a
factor, though the prosecution has not emphasized it.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the trial will enter the penalty phase, involving a
decision on either death by lethal injection or life in prison.
McIntosh's lawyer, William Tendy, will begin pleading for his life
by presenting witnesses to testify about his character and
background growing up in Jamaica.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like jurors in the Brooklyn trial of Darrel Harris, who
deliberated for 11 hours over two days before convicting of him of
capital murder, the jury worked with surprising speed, sometimes
deliberating through meals, before delivering their verdict to
Dutchess County Court Judge George Marlow at about 12:30 p.m. One
juror, a young woman, left the courtroom later, visibly distraught.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors had spent the last four weeks listening to often
emotional testimony. Wednesday, the small fourth-floor courtroom
was silent and McIntosh stared straight ahead without registering
emotion as the foreman foreman tolled off guilty verdicts to all 10
counts in the indictment. McIntosh sat motionless, seemingly numb,
as his lawyer tried to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very upset,'' Tendy said of McIntosh later. ``We
will spend a lot of time in the next few days talking to him.
That's really all we can do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On one count, the jurors found McIntosh guilty of second-degree
murder, not first-degree, because they did not believe the
prosecution had proved that he killed his wife, Francine, to
prevent her from testifying against him in a pending assault case.
They did, however, believe that he had killed Eunice Williams to
eliminate her as a witness to the slaying of his wife.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visibly crushed by the guilty verdict, Tendy said he had let his
client down and doubted whether he would ever undertake another
defense in a capital case. ``I don't think I could ever go through
this again,'' he said. ``If I hadn't let him down then we wouldn't
have the verdict we have right now. This was my responsibility. If
somebody's got to be blamed, it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   During a month of testimony from 52 witnesses, Tendy had pointed
out many reasons that might cause a jury to doubt McIntosh's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   There were no fingerprints on the gun presented as the murder
weapon, and no way to connect it definitively to the defendant or
the shootings. Nor was there a drop of blood on McIntosh's skin or
clothes when he was caught by police, although all three victims
were shot at point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of the verdict in this case is simply a reflection
of the strength of the evidence,'' said Dutchess County District
Attorney William Grady. ``But I will not say I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, said the district attorney, had been Anthony Williams.
Now 8, the only surviving witness to the slayings had testified for
an hour. He said he had been in the car, watching as ``Keith'' shot
his grandmother, Francine, in the head. The small boy testified
that the man whom he often called ``Daddy'' had then turned the gun
on him, shooting him in the mouth, then shot Anthony's aunt, Eunice
Williams, in the head, and fled.
</P>
<P>
   All these grisly details he recounted with chilling calm to
jurors. Finally the boy pointed at McIntosh when asked who had
committed the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony Williams is the only eyewitness and he provided the
jury with firsthand testimony,'' Grady said. ``We cannot
overemphasize the significant role that he played.''
</P>
<P>
   In the penalty phase, Tendy would not say which of McIntosh's
relatives would testify. He has two young children and other
relatives still living in Jamaica, as well as a sister in Texas.
Tendy would only say that he would use them to try to show ``what
this man's life was, so that they see him as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Trial testimony established that McIntosh came to the United
States in the late 1980s, did not have a regular job, and had been
found in possession of marijuana. ``Who cares about a poor, black
Jamaican immigrant,'' Tendy said to the all-white jury in his
closing statement. ``You know what the answer is _ nobody, and
that's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to show that his client was poor, Tendy said, ``He's
buying nickel bags for 40 bucks, he's got $10 in his pocket, he's
riding around on a bicycle, and he's living in a flea-bag with a
mattress on the floor.''  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Several days before socialite Irene Silverman
disappeared on Sunday, she met with a convicted felon who was
renting a room in her lavish town house and signed financial
documents in the presence of a notary public, police investigators
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While police did not have detailed information about the
documents, a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said the meeting could provide a clue about Ms.
Silverman's disappearance and a possible motive for foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting at Ms. Silverman's home on Manhattan's East
Side, her servants saw her arguing with the same tenant, detectives
said, and she threatened to evict the man from the $6,000-a-month
suite he had rented since June 14.
</P>
<P>
   In notes Ms. Silverman kept about the guests in her house, she
wrote extensively about the tenant, who identified himself as Manny
Guerin, but who has been identified by police as Kenneth Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust him,'' Ms. Silverman wrote, according to the
investigator who reviewed the papers. ``He seems suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The notary public who was at the meeting was interviewed
Wednesday but told police that Ms. Silverman did not read the
documents and had no idea what the meeting was about, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting and Ms. Silverman's notes on her tenants were the
focus of a sprawling investigation Wednesday, as a team of 50
detectives searched unsuccessfully for signs of her whereabouts.
Meanwhile, federal agents and Los Angeles investigators began
comparing notes with New York detectives, attempting to solve a
case with possible ties to a mother and son team of convicted
felons and the unsolved murder of a California man.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kimes, 23, who was arrested with his mother, Sante,
Sunday night on an unrelated fraud charge, was carrying several
pieces of Ms. Silverman's identification, including her passport.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 63, has a long criminal history, including
convictions for fraud, using fake credit cards, stealing a mink
coat and enslaving Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But the pair was arrested by federal agents late Sunday because
they are named in a Utah warrant for allegedly using a bad check to
purchase a $14,000 Lincoln Town Car.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses have refused to answer questions about Ms.
Silverman, leaving the authorities to speculate on why they were
carrying the identification of a woman whose wealth allowed her to
employ a staff of 10 domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes is scheduled to appear in court Thursday for a bail
hearing. His lawyer, Matthew Weissman, declined to discuss the
charges against his client.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles detectives, who are scheduled to arrive in New York
on Friday, said they wanted to question the Kimeses about the March
14 murder of a Granada Hills, Calif., man whose financial assets
were stolen after his death.
</P>

<P>
   ``We're going to meet with the New York detectives to look for
any similarities between the cases,'' Lt. Otis Dobine of the Los
Angeles Police Department said. ``We'd want to compare notes about
these people and go there to look into their possible involvement
in what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Silverman's case is still classified as a missing
persons investigation, her friends said Wednesday that they were
deeply concerned for her safety. The police found a small trail of
blood on the sidewalk of her home Sunday, but when detectives began
executing a search warrant Wednesday on the Kimeses' green Lincoln
Town Car, they found no evidence to lead them to Ms. Silverman, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have also searched an assortment of city parks,
vacant lots and garbage dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles detectives and federal agents were still trying
Wednesday to track the Kimeses' trail from their home in Southern
California to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Ms. Kimes and her husband, Kenneth Kimes
Sr., owned a chain of motels and kept homes in La Jolla, Calif.,
Las Vegas, Honolulu and Cancun, Mexico. But in recent years the
family had fallen on hard times, another investigator speaking on
the condition of anonymity said, and FBI officials began searching
for the Kimeses early this year after receiving complaints that
they were involved in a financial swindle in Las Vegas.

ROSEANNE TO TAKE ON DAYTIME TV
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Roseanne, the one-time queen of blue-collar
comedy, has shed a few dozen pounds, several inches of hair and
some of her trademark trashiness in preparation for her return to
television _ as a daytime talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian turned star-executive producer of ABC's sitcom hit
``Roseanne'' shared sketchy plans Wednesday for her latest project,
``The Roseanne Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles audiences can expect the syndicated show to debut on
KNBC-TV (Channel 4) on Sept. 14. While no time slot has been set
yet, it likely will air late weekday mornings against established
talkies like ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roseanne who stepped before the microphones at the
Television Critics Association's biannual press tour at the
Ritz-Carlton Huntington hotel in Pasadena, neighboring Los Angeles,
was a sleeker and quite possibly meeker model of the loudmouthed
housewife television audiences learned to love.
</P>
<P>
   She said she'll no longer micromanage the writers' room as she
did during the run of her sitcom. Her private life will not be
available for public consumption as it had been during much of the
past decade. And bawdy, off-key renditions of the national anthem
seem to be behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of over that,'' Roseanne said. ``A lot of television
shows have shown us how low we can go. I'd like to go the opposite
way and see how high we can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The show that's being co-produced and distributed by King World,
which is also behind Oprah Winfrey's show, has been in conception
for more than a year but has not begun taping at CBS Television
City in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne will open with a monologue, playing off people in the
studio audience like she did as a standup comic. She'll spend time
during the show discussing important topics such as rearing
children and women's weight issues. And she plans to lighten up by
playing recurring characters in comedy sketches.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be more star-driven than ``Oprah,'' more
controversial than ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' and less
outrageous than ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to reinvent the wheel a little bit,'' said
executive producer Eddie October, ``but we're not deluding
ourselves about the fact that this is a talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is will daytime audiences accustomed to the
softball humor of Regis Philbin and Rosie embrace Roseanne, a woman
better known for crass antics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who watch the talk show will be surprised how
learned she is and how well-versed she is in many topics,'' said
comedian-writer Ritch Shydner, who wrote for ``Roseanne'' in 1995
and 1996. ``She has an incredibly agile mind. She could talk to a
street person and have a conversation and talk to a politician and
have a conversation. She is earthy. I don't think she's gonna be a
female Dick Cavett.''
</P>
<P>
   But image consultant Jennifer Maxwell Parkinson of New York's
Look Consulting International says it'll take work to erase
tabloid-generated perceptions _ true or not _ that she is
everything from a schizophrenic to a tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can still use her cutting humor, but she has to focus on
sincerity,'' Parkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some simple fixes Roseanne can use to repair her
public image, said Anne Warfield of Impression Management
Professionals in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell her to wear softer suits and wear her hair softer
and not laugh as hard,'' Warfield said. ``She should lean into the
people to look more interested and have a connectiveness so she
would almost be a backdrop. Now she is in the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Roseanne needs lessons on how to succeed in show
business.
</P>
<P>
   She garnered large TV audiences, well beyond that of the
successful Springer, with her working-class sensibility. Her
self-titled sitcom had a strong run for its nine years on the air,
ranking in the top 10 for seven seasons from 1988 to 1995. It was
especially strong in delivering women viewers, the target of
daytime talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that her name has huge recognition,'' said Carol
Black, the general manager of KNBC. ``I think there's a huge and
diverse viewing audience that will relate to her and a huge
audience interested in tuning in to see what her show is like.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if you want any more details about her latest endeavor,
Roseanne will tell you herself: ``We're gonna do multiple topics
and it's gonna be a lot of comedy. It's kind of a little bit of
everything. We'll have a little bit like `Oprah' and a little like
`Rosie' and we'll have a little bit like blah, blah, blah.''

ON MAJORS CIRCUIT, NICKLAUS CALLS IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   Ending one of the most remarkable streaks in golf history, Jack
Nicklaus announced Wednesday that he would not play in the year's
final two majors, the British Open next week and the PGA
Championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to 1957, Nicklaus has played in the last 154
consecutive majors for which he was eligible, the longest streak of
that nature. He did not join the PGA Tour until 1962, so he was not
eligible to compete in the PGA Championship until that year, and he
did not play in the British Open until 1962. But Nicklaus has not
missed a major since the 1962 Masters, a streak of 146.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who turned 58 in January, said a sore left hip,
coupled with a sense that the time was right, contributed to his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to end the streak by having it said that Jack
Nicklaus could no longer play the game,'' Nicklaus said in a
statement issued by his Golden Bear International Inc. ``Instead, I
wanted to step back with the feeling that the competitive spirit
and ability still thrived within me. I wanted to end the streak on
my own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to end that streak at 153 at this year's Masters,
until the USGA kindly gave me an exemption to play in the U.S.
Open. However, I feel the the preparation time and physical demands
which are required to be competitive on a continuous basis are
difficult for me to satisfy at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Nicklaus' decision to end the streak was somewhat
unexpected because of his inspirational performance at this year's
Masters, when he tied for sixth, making him the oldest top-10
finisher in Masters history. Nicklaus also enjoyed a respectable
showing at the U.S. Open last month, when he made the cut and tied
for 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has won a record 18 majors: six Masters, five PGA
Championships, four U.S. Opens, and three British Opens. He also
won two U.S. Amateur championships and finished second in majors 19
times.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been better at playing his best golf in the biggest
tournaments. Whether it meant arriving at the site of a major
earlier than everyone else, or taking time off before a major to
rest and work on his game, Nicklaus mastered the art of peaking at
the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his greatest performance came at the 1986 Masters, when,
at age 46, he became the oldest winner of that storied event. But
Nicklaus has not won on the PGA Tour since, and it has become
harder for him to put together four consistent rounds good enough
to beat players 20 and 30 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that my ability to compete at the highest level is
marginal at best,'' Nicklaus said. ``As much as I enjoy playing and
competing in the world's major championships, I feel that it is
time to end my streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus will compete on the Senior PGA Tour at this week's Ford
Senior Players Championship, and will also play in the U.S. Senior
Open later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nicklaus will retain lifetime exemptions for the
Masters and the PGA Championship and an exemption into the British
Open until age 65.
