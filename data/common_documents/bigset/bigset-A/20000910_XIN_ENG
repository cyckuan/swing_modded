DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) --The Bangladeshi government
decided to build electric trains service in Dhaka, in a bid to
ease the traffic jams in the capital city, sources in the
communication ministry said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a 51-kilometer single-rail track will be built
on iron frames up to 60 feet high which will connect all the

<HEADLINE> Turkish Economic Czars Convene to Tackle Economy Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Recep
Onal said Sunday that strict monetary and financing policies, as
well as structural reforms, should be implemented simultaneously,
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a three-day conference, which opened Sunday in
Kemer town of southern Antalya province, Onal said that such moves
are imperative for dropping the medium-term inflation and keeping
on track macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, termed as the "Second Economic Summit" by local
press, senior Turkish officials in charge of economic affairs will
evaluate overall Turkish economy and put forward policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting began to convene from last year and was named "
Economic Summit."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is carrying on a three-year economic stability program
under a 4-billion-U.S.-dollar stand-by deal signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the loan package approved by the IMF, Turkey pledged to
reduce its chronic inflation and budget deficits, undertake a
comprehensive privatization program and reform agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
Onal said that basic economic indicators like prices, interest
rates and foreign currency reserves should not be deviated a lot
from the world markets, making Turkey competitive against its rival
countries which provide the same goods and services for the global
market.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Security Minister Yasar Okuyan said that the
Social Security Reform, which plays an important role in Turkey's
anti-inflation campaign, has produced results.
</P>
<P>
The program did not receive financing support from the Treasury
in June, July and August of this year for the first time in the
last eight years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the new social security system in Turkey will
take shape in the next five years, and until 2050, the deficits of
all social security organizations were expected to be overcome
totally.
</P>
<P>
Fuat Miras, chairman of the Union of Turkish Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges, said that they would continue to extend every
support to the government in its struggle against inflation.
</P>
<P>
Miras said that the sacrifices that the whole country was
bearing, should gain later, adding that the economic circles should
send the message that they are supporting the government's
stability program to drop the runaway inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stability program made major progress in the
first eight months of this year. "Structural reforms and necessary
economic legalization are very important developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the financial policy within the framework of the
stability program as "very successful."
</P>
<P>
"There was an important decrease in the general budget deficit.
However, the public expenditure reform has yet to be adopted," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury head Selcuk Demiralp said that the government has
taken several measures, aiming at increasing public revenues and
cutting public expenses.
</P>
<P>
He said that the desired targets can easily be achieved within
three years if the economic stability program, including financial
discipline and structural reforms, is implemented without
concession.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic performance in the first eight months
was "positive," adding that financial discipline will change macro-
economic imbalances blamed for the high chronic inflation and the
failure in a strong economic growth in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So, the final target of the economic stability program is to
drop the inflation to one-digit number within three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has targeted an economic growth rate of
5.5 percent this year, he believed that it would stand at 6-7
percent at the year end.

GAZA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Central Council (PCC)
decided Sunday to postpone the statehood declaration, Chairman of
the Palestine National Council Salem Zanoun announced.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun told reporters after the two-day meeting of the 129-

meet again before November 15 to decide when to declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the Executive Committee of Palestine Liberation
Organization will be authorized to take the necessary steps to
implement an independent state, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun said the Palestinian leadership made the decision to give
peace another chance. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said earlier
in the day the peace talks with Israel, which have been stalled
since the Camp David summit in July, will resume on Monday and
continue for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun also said that several committees have been set up to
prepare legal papers for the establishment of an independent state,
which Arafat had earlier said to proclaim as early as on September
13, the deadline set with Israel for a permanent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
But the peace deal is as elusive as ever as the two sides remain
far apart over the key final-status issues, especially the future
of Jerusalem, which aborted the Camp David summit between Arafat,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the Camp David summit, Barak offered the Palestinians limited
control over parts of the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, but
the Palestinians held firm in their longstanding position that the
entire eastern section should be under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later
annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians
want the eastern part as capital of a future state, while Israel
insists it is part of its "undivided" capital.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the summit, Arafat had launched an
international tour to rally support for the declaration of a state,
but world leaders advised him not to take unilateral step to avoid
conceivable violence and give peace more chance.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Limits Visits to Jailed Former Shas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Sunday decided to limit the number of
lawmakers who hope to visit the jailed former leader of the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party Aryeh Deri to one a week.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on the recommendation of a special Prisons
Service committee on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Normally, Knesset (parliament) members are free to visit
prisoners as often as they wish but Deri, who began to serve his
three-year imprisonment term last week for fraud and bribe-taking,
has been deluged by visitors, including those from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deri supporters have set up a prayer tent outside the
Ma'asiyahu prison in Ramla near Tel Aviv, where Deri is
incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
The imprisonment of Deri, the charismatic former Shas leader and
the first cabinet minister ever given to prison terms in the
Israeli history, has sparked violent protests by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the wave of protesting activities, Israeli chief
Rabbi Israel Lau said Sunday that he understood the feelings of the
Shas activists who sympathize with Deri, "as long as they don't
break the law, or beat a policeman or journalist, and as long as
they don't beat anyone."
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau met Sunday with President Moshe Katsav to discuss
the "secular revolution" initiated by Prime Minister Ehud Barak
last month to allow civil marriages, national service for all
including ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students and Arab youths, and the
abolition of the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau said that a country that values freedom of speech
cannot silence Shas supporters who express solidarity with "their
friend who is in prison," despite such solidarity "not having been
expressed for other people charged with similar offences."
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau also added that freedom of speech should not be

<P>
Referring to the "secular revolution," Rabbi Lau said that he
does not think a secular or Ashkenazi revolution will take place in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Knesset should discuss the future of the
country and maintain the status quo regarding religious issues. "We
should look for things that build a bridge between us, not things
that increase the rift," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lau praised Barak, saying that Barak had knowledge and
interest in Judaism that did not fall short of that of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Barak's recent pledge to allow buses to run and the state-run
airline El Al to operate on Shabbat has caused a big stir in the
political spectrum, drawing outcry not only from the religious
parties but also from his own Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Shabbat is the Jewish holiday which bans secular activities such
as driving, flying and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
Despite Barak's explanation that bus services will be provided
specifically to take the carless poor residents in some areas to
the beach on Shabbat, the move is seen by many as Barak's efforts
to woo the secular vote in the preparation for a possible early
election.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt for Negotiations With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat is to visit Egypt on Monday for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak on the negotiations with Israel, the
Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Mubarak on his meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton last Wednesday on ways of pushing forward the Mideast
peace process on the fringe of the U.N. Millennium Summit in New
York, Ambassador Zohdi al Qedra told Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He will also keep Mubarak posted on the decision taken by the
Palestinian Central Council (PCC) on the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state, al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day meeting, the PCC, the Palestinian mini-
parliament, agreed on Sunday not to declare statehood as initially
planned on September 13, and decided to meet again by November 15
to consider when the statehood declaration should be made.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's Monday visit will be the eighth to Egypt since the
Palestinian-Israeli Camp David summit ended on July 25 without an
agreement, largely due to the issue of Jerusalem, which both sides
claim as their capital.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed, 5 Others Injured in Traffic Accident in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nine people, including three
children, were killed and five others injured on Sunday when a
minibus plunged into a canal in southern Egypt, the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The bus was passing through the city of Beni Suef, 120
kilometers south of capital Cairo, when a tire burst and driver
Kadhafi Mursi lost control of the vehicle, crashing into the
adjacent Ibrahimiya canal, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to a hospital in Beni Suef while rescue
workers managed to pull five of the nine dead bodies from the
canal, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The driver survived the accident, the statement said, without
giving the number of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt due to reckless driving.
Official figures show that over 3,000 people die each year in
traffic accidents, which also incur around 1 billion U.S. dollars
of economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Palestinian Statehood Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel expressed on Sunday
its welcome to the delay of the Palestinian statehood declaration,
calling the move "a positive step."
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is a result of the position of the international
community which opposes unilateral steps that can only hurt the
peace process," Gadi Baltiansky, spokesman of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, said in New York, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Baltiansky is accompanying Barak on his trip to the United
States to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit. Barak is to return to
Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami also expressed his
welcome to the delay, hailing it as "positive."
</P>
<P>
Palestine Central Council (PCC) decided on Sunday in Gaza City
to postpone the statehood declaration, saying it will meet again
before November 15 to decide when to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The PCC also authorized the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization to tackle all the statehood-related issues,
while several committees have been set up to prepare legal papers,
including drafting the constitution, for the establishment of an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said earlier in the day that
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which have been stalled since
the Camp David Summit in July, will resume on Monday and continue
for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Sunday in Gaza
that the talks may be resumed on Tuesday after Barak's return from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, Israeli Chief Negotiator, said earlier on Sunday that
no meetings had been scheduled as yet but Israel was prepared to
resume talks with the Palestinians.

<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency that such a move would
drastically reduce the price of the much-needed drugs, making them
more affordable to the poor who are the worst affected in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister joined other African health ministers in
expressing concern over the exorbitant prices of anti-retroviral
drugs sold by international pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Theoretically, even if these drugs cost 10 U.S.
dollars a month per person, the majority of our people would still
not be able to afford them. That is why poverty and health are
inter-twined."
</P>
<P>
He was recently in Ouagadougou where he attended the 50th
session of the World Health Organization (WHO) regional meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was opposed to getting loans for HIV drugs as
this would worsen the debt crisis in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the international pharmaceutical companies
consider financing HIV and Aids programs, especially the provision
of anti-retroviral drugs for the worst affected countries like
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) planned to procure anti-retroviral drugs for the
region. This was cost-effective and would bring closer regional
unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) Seventeen members of Sierra
Leone's rebels, the West Side Boys, were killed and their
commander captured when British troops freed seven hostages in a
military operation Sunday morning, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer said in the
capital Freetown that 17 rebels were killed and 11 captured
including the commander, Brigadier-General Kallay, during Sunday's
military rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The British troops attacked the base of the West Side Boys at
the Occra Hills to the east of Freetown and set free 7 hostages,
including 6 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, held by the rebels for
more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
There had been casualties on both sides during the fighting,
said a senior British military officer, but declined to go into
details.
</P>
<P>
However, Sierra Leonean Military sources disclosed that one
British soldier had been seriously injured in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The abducted soldiers, including 11 Britons and one Sierra
Leonean, were taken hostage by the West Side Boys on August 25,
five Britons were later released.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Launch Common Electricity Supply Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They said at a meeting of the members of the Southern African
Power Pool (SAPP) preparation committee that once set up in one of
the SADC cities, the market will rally efforts and resources of
SADC members to jointly solve their power problems.
</P>
<P>
They said that the project would involve interconnecting the
national grids of the SADC member states to enable utilization of
excessive power within the region.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of creating such a market is to optimize the
electricity load profile of the member states in dealing with
problems like unpredicted power cuts which are a common phenomenon
in various SADC countries," they added.
</P>
<P>
A report for the project has been prepared by three power
companies, the TANESCO of Tanzania, the ESKOM of South Africa and
the ZESCO of Zambia, recommending construction of a 670-kilometer,
330-kilovolt transmission line from Pensulo, Zambia to Mbeya,
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements are underway to get a private firm to undertake
the project, they said, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, Kenya, which is currently facing acute power
shortage, could have brought power from any of the southern
African countries if Kenya's national gird is interconnected with
that of Tanzania and the Tanzanian one connected with that of
Zambia which is already connected with most of the states in the
south," they added.

<HEADLINE> Blockades Partially Paralyze Traffic in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- When some 1,700 trucks
honked and blared on Sunday, they were not celebrating the
Brussels Liberation Day that fell on the day.
</P>
<P>
They were loudly protesting against the ever-rising fuel prices
that have cut into the earnings of truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
The one-day protest was originally scheduled to end by mid-
afternoon and yet between 600 and 700 heavy-duty trucks refused to
leave downtown Brussels and they stopped side by side or
lengthwise on major streets to set up road blockades.
</P>
<P>
Holiday-makers as well as ordinary road users had to meander
their way through the city's smaller and back streets to get to
their destination.
</P>
<P>
Drivers of the leftover trucks said that they would not leave
until three o'clock on Monday morning, 12 hours after their
planned come-and-go drive-by protest has ended.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organized by the Union of Professional Road
Transport of Belgium, was aimed at persuading government
authorities to cut tax on fuels and levy more from the profits
made by oil refinery and distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the protesting trucks bore eminent catch-words of "SOS",
"same VAT for all" and "less social charges for more earnings".
</P>
<P>
One protesting truck driver told journalists that the rising
fuel prices are killing road transport and that can be interpreted
as indirectly killing the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
A European Union survey has found that more than 79 percent of
land transport is now carried by motor vehicles in the European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the protest were coaches, tanker trucks,
taxis, school buses, engineering vehicles, family cars, inter-city
buses and even motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
Another truck driver said that he was out before seven to take
part in the day's protest that followed a week-long road blockade
by truck drivers in neighboring France and truck driver
demonstrations in Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices, both petrol and diesel, rose by close to 20
percent in the last three years in Belgium. A liter of petrol now
costs around 48 Belgian francs (1.06 U.S. dollars) while a liter
of diesel costs around 35 francs (77 cents).
</P>
<P>
The protesters were demanding that the authorities reduce
government taxes on fuels and increase taxation on the profits
made by oil refinery and distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
Protesters claimed that TotalFinaElf, for one, made 136 percent
more profit in the first seven months this year to total 137
billion francs (3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the finance ministers from all 15 European Union
member states on Saturday indicated a "no change" of government
taxation policy regarding tax reduction for petroleum products in
the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers, however, urged the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to increase production so as to reduce oil
prices during their weekend meeting in Vienna. They hoped that oil
prices could return to a level that preserves worldwide growth.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Budget Minister Johan Vande Lanotte estimated that the
rising prices of crude oil alone cost his country 15 billion
Belgian francs (33.3 million U.S. dollars) more this year and that
could mean a decrease of revenue next year in the amount of 25
billion francs (55.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rocketing of oil prices posted since early 1999 has
triggered a debate in the EU on crude oil prices, refining and
distribution as well as taxation on oil products, the three
components of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials would hold the tight production quota by the
OPEC responsible for the rising crude oil prices that in turn had
led to rising fuel prices elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in February
this year following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when
the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Revealed as Safest Carrier by European Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada, the national
carrier, has been revealed as the world's safest airline by a
European development bank, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A passenger on one of its flights has only one-in-1.3 million
chance of being involved in any kind of accident, as is shown in a
table of risk commissioned by the bank in a bid to avoid booking
its staff with dangerous carriers.
</P>
<P>
The new table combines the accident history of airlines with 10
other safety factors, including management structure, fleet
composition and safety regulation in its home country. Under
traditional criteria, airlines have been assessed only by the
number of accidents.
</P>
<P>
"The law has changed over the years so that employers are more
responsible for their employees. Companies are increasingly keen
to minimize their exposure to risk," said John Trevett, who will
give details of his ranking system at the Aircraft Quality and
Safety Conference in Brussels this week.
</P>
<P>
Trevett, a former test pilot and a senior lecturer at Cranfield
University in Britain, spent three years developing the table,
which has been adopted by the International Association of Oil and
Gas Producers in collaboration with Shell and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Kick Off Parliamentary Elections on October 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will hold the next
parliamentary elections in three stages as of October 18,
Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken during a ministerial meeting in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria chaired by President Hosni
Mubarak, el-Sharif was quoted as saying by the country's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to issue a republican decree next Sunday,
envisaging the elections of the next People's Assembly will be held
in three phases between October 18 and November 15, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
El-Sharif said the first stage will run from October 18 to 25,
the second from October 29 to November 5 and the third from
November 8 to 15.
</P>
<P>
It is for the first time in Egypt's 134-year parliamentary
history that the parliamentary elections will be supervised by the
judiciary and carried out in three stages, rather than on a single
day.
</P>
<P>
According to an election plan worked out by the Interior
Ministry, there will be a total of 10,718 polling stations in 222
constituencies across the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian laws, the parliament has 454 members, of which
444 are elected by voters and the other 10 are appointed by the
president.
</P>
<P>
The republican decree stipulates that the new People's Assembly
opens session on December 14, el-Sharif said.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Spreads to Horses in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Blood tests conducted by
Israel's Veterinary Services have confirmed that at least 15 horses
in the central part of the country are suffering from the West Nile
fever, the Environment Ministry said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The animals were tested during the last two days after they
showed signs of weakness and instability, but the West Nile virus
does not make them wild, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the fields outside
the stables are being sprayed with anti-mosquito insecticide, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry added that it has received more than 3,000
complaints of mosquito infections in the past few days and local
councils are having difficulties in meeting the demand for
neighborhood spraying.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 Israelis have been infected so far by the virus and
three elderly patients in their 80s have died of illnesses caused
by the virus.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry on Friday held a meeting with health
experts, some of whom criticized the ministry for not doing enough
to increase public awareness of the virus, which often causes a
rash and slight fever in its victims but can be fatal to certain
vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The virus, found in birds, is spread by mosquitoes which bite
the birds and then pass the virus on when biting humans, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry officials said it is not clear whether there is
an outbreak of the virus, which has been known to exist in Israel
for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
There is no preventive medication against the virus in Israel
and the only available means of protection is pest control.

<HEADLINE> Talks to Free Remaining Iranian, Iraq POWs Under Way: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq have started
talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for
the exchange of the remaining prisoners of war (POWs) still held in
each other's country, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All evidence related to Iranian POWs and those missing in the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war have been submitted to the ICRC, and the
exchange of the remaining POWs will start after an agreement is
reached with Baghdad, said Brigadier General Abdollah Najafi, head
of Iran's commission for POWs.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency, the official said
that some 97 percent of Iraqi and Iranian POWs have so far been
repatriated through the offices of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the war between the two neighbors, Iran has
released 59,830 Iraqi POWs while Iraq has repatriated 39,417
Iranian POWs, he said, adding that the remaining 3 percent of POWs
are to be exchanged when an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Iran unilaterally released 728 Iraqi POWs last month, bringing
to 4,117 the total number of Iraq POWs released since the start of
the current Iranian year on March 20.
</P>
<P>
After the release, Najafi claimed that Iran had freed all
remaining Iraqi POWs. But he said that more than 7,000 Iraqis were
unwilling to return to Iraq and chose to stay in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Despite the claim, Baghdad holds that Iran still keep captive
29,000 Iraqi POWs, and Iran also accuses Iraq of holding over 3,000
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Unless the issue is solved completely, it will remain a major
stumbling block for normalization of ties between the two
neighbors, whose 1980-1988 war cost nearly 1 million lives.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Flowing Into China's High-tech Industries (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreign
businesses have begun to pour funds into China's high-tech
industries in recent years, showing a strategic change in
investment policies in China, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyan, director of the foreign investment department under
the MOFTEC, reported that almost 100 high-tech research and
development institutions under multinational corporations have
been established in China.
</P>
<P>
The institutions include the renowned Microsoft China research
institute, Intel China research center, Lucent China laboratory
and Hewlett-packard center for digital data processing technology.
Most of the institutions were set up in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Hu said, these research and development institutions are in the
fields of electronics, biology, information industry, medicine,
chemistry, building materials and textiles. They provide findings
for worldwide clients and products to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is attending the Fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade, which opened in the port city of Xiamen on
Friday, noted that this shows that foreign investors have turned
their attention to the high-tech sector in China, in accordance
with the global development strategy and new development in the
Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
This echoes with the development trend in which many countries
and multinational corporations have adjusted their strategies,
highlighting high-tech development, an industry which has grown
rapidly since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds first flew into China in 1980, most of which went
into traditional industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent Su, an economist from the United States, held that when
China's economy enters a higher phase of development, the
industrial structure will soon experience a transitional period,
namely economic growth will shift from labor-intensive industries
to capital-intensive high-tech ones.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a strategy of revitalizing the nation through
science and education under the tide of economic globalization and
information revolution, and has made technological innovation the
key factor that will push forward China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out that China has created new
opportunities for foreign business people to invest in its high-
tech industries through the strategic readjustment of economic
structure, in the development of China's western region, in the
reform of state enterprises and in opening its market in line with
the basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
William R. Fields, chairman of APEC from the U.S., said "large
scale industrialization and technical innovation have decided that
China will be the biggest market for western technologies in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Last year, China worked out a series of policies to encourage
multinational corporations to invest in the high-tech field,
preferential tax treatment for research and development centers
set up by foreign investors. This year, the State Council has
issued regulations encouraging foreign business people to develop
integrated circuits and the software industry.
</P>
<P>
It is known that a great number of multinational corporations
are building their production bases in the economically-developed
east and south China's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, for example, has decided recently that it will invest
more in the development of high-tech products in China.

<HEADLINE> Album on Canadian Chinese Laborers Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has published a photo
album about Chinese Laborers who built railways in Canada over a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 Chinese crossed the ocean and worked as
laborers laying the Pacific Railway in Canada during 1881-1895.
</P>
<P>
Containing hundreds of photographs and a large amount of
written material, the album depicts a vivid picture of the hardy
spirit that the Chinese people demonstrated in extremely harsh
work conditions and natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese workers took great risks and suffered great losses
and pains in building the most dangerous sections of the east-west
railway in Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to former Canadian Governor Rome Le Blanc, the
construction of the Pacific Railway is the proudest and most
amazing achievement in the history of Canada, through which the
efforts and toil of tens of thousands of Chinese people were
recognized.
</P>
<P>
The album is regarded as a condensed history of the Chinese
community in Canada. It sold out shortly after its debut in Canada
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The album is published by the Yunnan Publishing House in
southwest China.

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Market Full of Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry in China
will become a sector of great opportunity and high returns for
foreign investors, Sun Gang, Deputy Director of the State Tourism
Administration, said today.
</P>
<P>
He said at the fourth China Fair for International Investment
and Trade that China's tourism industry has at least five great
opportunities in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
The first is that the Chinese government has listed tourism as
one of the growth factors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The second is that local governments around China have given
priority to the development of tourism as a pillar industry of
local economies.
</P>
<P>
The third is due to the rich tourism resources in the western
part of the country becoming more open as the Chinese government
implements the strategy to develop west China.
</P>
<P>
The fourth involves the tourism sector increasingly open to
foreign investment following China's accession to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The fifth is that the rapid growth of the global tourism
industry will boost the Chinese tourism market.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, China became the fifth largest destiny for overseas
travelers and the seventh largest earner of tourist revenue in
terms of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Over the first seven months of the year, China scored an 18.6
percent increase in foreign exchange earnings from tourism over
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Rejects Deal With Israel Bypassing Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath stressed here on Sunday that
the Palestinian side rejects any peace deal with Israel that
bypasses the most sensitive issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, who is attending the Palestinian Central Council (PCC)
meeting in Gaza, told reporters that "what we can accept is
complete discussions on all issues, including the fate of
Jerusalem," noting that no major final-status issue can be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
The 129-member PCC, which entered its second day of meeting on
Sunday, is expected to announce a delay on statehood declaration
that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had earlier said to do as
early as on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat announced that the peace talks with Israel,
that founded in July over the future of Jerusalem, will resume on
Monday and the fresh round of talks are initially decided to last
for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said that the prime minister was ready to strike a deal with
the Palestinians that involves a delay on the Jerusalem issue as
proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton during the Camp David talks
last July.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the l967
Middle East war and holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims, is the
stumbling block in the 15-day Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations "provide
an opportunity to solve all problems including Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, territorial handover and security."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian stand was clearly based on international
legitimacy and signed agreements with Israel, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side hoped that the forthcoming rounds of talks
between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators could be crowned with
another three-way summit so that an overall solution could be
found, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of defer the Palestinian statehood
declaration, Shaath said he preferred to have it delayed until
another date so as to continue the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing the peace process as suggested by President
Clinton so as to give another and final opportunity for
negotiations, not out of fear from possible Israeli pressures or
sanctions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is our undeniable right to declare our state," the
Palestinian minister repeated, adding that the whole matter would
be decided by the PCC during its concluding session Sunday evening.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Auditing Begins in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
conference on auditing began here Sunday with a view to ensuring
transparency and accountability of government activities by
improving existing auditing system through sharing of experiences.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General
of Bangladesh in association with the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the World Bank, the conference on "Improving
Oversight Functions: Challenges in the New Millennium" was
inaugurated by Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The president said the expectations of common people do not
match the ground reality in countries like Bangladesh with
faltering democratic traditions.
</P>
<P>
"For the relatively new democracies like Bangladesh, the
improvement of oversight functions of the institutions responsible
for it is key to securing good governance and thus to improving
quality of life of their people," Shahabuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said the conference is
being held when Bangladesh is going through a critical phase of
reform in line with the first item of the ruling party's election
commitment of transparency and accountability.
</P>
<P>
He said there are simply too few accounting and auditing
professionals in Bangladesh. As of mid-1999, Bangladesh had a
total of 1,186 chartered and qualified management accountants,
among whom 203 were abroad.
</P>
<P>
This amounts to about 8 per million inhabitants, compared to
India's 98 per million and the Britain's 4,600 per million, the
finance minister added.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh has institutional arrangements for
performing oversight functions, they were not yet working
effectively or were not yet enforced adequately, said World Bank
country director Frederick Temple.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official stressed that Bangladesh's education
and qualification systems thus need to dramatically increase the
production of qualified accountants and auditors.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, the first of its kind in the country,
was participated by representatives from 18 foreign countries
including the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, India and
China.

<HEADLINE> Geological Experts on Potential for Oil Exploration on Lake Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malawian geological experts
said vital information is missing to fully establish the existence
of oil on the bed of Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa,
a report reaching here said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kamphiyo, director of Malawi's geological survey, told
journalists various research and oil exploration companies have
since 1981 only confirmed the existence of sedimentary rocks which
could be hydrocarbon (oil and gas) bearing.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to determine if there are hydrocarbons under Lake
Malawi bed is to sink an exploratory drill hole to penetrate the
strata," he said in an interview on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lake Malawi, covering about 25,000 square kilometers, occupies
one third of the entire Malawi. Part of it stretches into its
northern neighbors of Tanzania and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The freshwater lake lies at the southern end of the African
rift valley, which is 560 kilometers long, 80 kilometers wide, 722
meters at its deepest point and lies about 474 meters above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
Kamphiyo said surveys had indicated thick sediments of
hydrocarbons which have the potential of hosting oil.
</P>
<P>
"All we are trying to do is to sell the idea to the
international world that we have potential for oil exploration,"
he said, adding: "There is a lot of exploration work to be done,
more especially to drill a few holes to enable us to know what is
down there."
</P>
<P>
Noting that oil exploration "is an expensive and high risk
venture that requires specialized technology and substantial risk
capital," Kamphiyo said since 1989, no other international oil
company had ventured into hydrocarbons exploration of Lake Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The first research on oil and gas on Lake Malawi was conducted
in 1981 by Duke University of America. The survey revealed that
thick sequences of up to three kilometers of sedimentary rocks
were present under wide areas of the lakebed, raising the status
of the lake as a target for hydrocarbon exploration.
</P>
<P>
Kamphiyo mentioned international efforts for oil exploration on
the lake by Shell Exploration B.V. of the Netherlands, Hunt's
International and Mobil Oil corporation, but all failed.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said: "We will keep on promoting the lake for
oil exploration."
</P>
<P>
Malawi imports all its petroleum products from abroad.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. Newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- GOP split on best strategy for Bush. With eight weeks to go
before Election Day, Republicans are nervously asking a
fundamental question about George W. Bush: Can he beat Al Gore on
character and credibility issues that have failed repeatedly to
work against Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, the largest such
operation in the world, has become paralyzed by infighting among
its top officials and failed to halt new waves of human rights
violations -- including abductions and rapes -- by the country's
armed factions.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Congress is posed to approve large increases in spending by
federal agencies, pushing the national budget to record levels.
Top Republicans predict a federal budget for the 2001 fiscal year
allowing at least $614 billion for discretionary spending,
exceeding a ceiling set in April.
</P>
<P>
-- Danes face a referendum to decide whether to preserve the
krone and their status or follow 12 other states of the 15-member
European Union in abandoning their money for a shared currency,
the euro.

<HEADLINE> China's Interior to Play Key Role in Hong Kong's Economic Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China's interior will play a
key role in the third economic transformation of Hong Kong, in
which Hong Kong will change from a trade port to a technical
innovation and service-oriented center, as the economic
globalization occurs at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Hong Kong's scientific circles, who are
attending the Fourth China Fair for International Investment and
Trade, said that relying on the support from China's interior
areas and close cooperation with these areas are the most decisive
factors for the successful transformation of Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong completed its first economic transformation in the
1950s, when it changed from an entrepot trade port to a
manufacturing center. Its second transformation occurred in 1978,
when Hong Kong gradually changed into a service center mainly
featuring real estate and finance.
</P>
<P>
Economist Zhang Xiaoji said China's interior can offer more
opportunities for Hong Kong to complete its third economic
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Hong Kong said China's interior areas are
advantageous in terms of basic research, scientific research
equipment, personnel training, and these areas have made some
achievements in the high-tech fields, while Hong Kong has abundant
funds, advanced management, a developed market and rich
information resources, all of which can help Hong Kong transfer
the research achievements in China's interior areas into rapid
application.
</P>
<P>
As the economic globalization speeds up and China's accession
into the World Trade Organization enters the final stage, the
Chinese government has decided to strengthen its competition on
the international market through technical innovation. China is
also working out a series of policies encouraging foreign
businessmen to invest in the high-tech fields and to expand the
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that there are broader prospects for the
cooperation between China's interior and Hong Kong in terms of
information, biology, new materials, and ocean and environmental
protection technologies.
</P>
<P>
China's economy, which has been back on track for benign
developments, constitutes a guarantee for Hong Kong's economic
transformation, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Allowed to Control West-East Gas Pipeline Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businessmen are
welcome to invest in the west-east gas transmission projects, and
are permitted to have a controlling share in such projects, said
an official with the State Council today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ai, from the developing western region office, told
representatives of multinational corporations that this was one of
China's special policies encouraging the inflow of foreign funds
into the western region.
</P>
<P>
Another special policy, Zhao said, will allow the involvement
of foreign investors in the construction of urban gas pipeline
networks.
</P>
<P>
The official said, foreign businessmen who invest in the west-
east gas transmission projects, will enjoy preferential policies
in terms of communication and energy resources, as well as other
preferential policies associated with the development of the
western region.
</P>
<P>
Four gas transmission lines are being built in China, Zhao said.
The first, which is 4,167 km long, connects the Tarim Basin in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to Shanghai in
the east; the second is 935 km long, and runs from Qaidam Basin in
Qinghai Province and ends at Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province;
the third, which is 695 km long, runs from Zhongxian County of
Chongqing Municipality, southwest China, and ends at Wuhan,

The four lines respectively transmit 12 billion cubic meters, 2
billion cubic meters, 3 billion cubic meters and 1.2 billion cubic
meters of gas annually.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the spokesman for the State
Administration of Light Industry said today that China has opened
all of the 44 sectors in the light industry to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Postponing Statehood Declaration Most Likely: Senior Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The dominant opinion in the
ongoing session of the Palestinian Central Council (PCC) was for
postponing statehood declaration to late this year, Palestinian
National Council (PNC) Chairman Salim Zanoun said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Before attending the PCC morning session, Zanoun said, "All
speech makers unanimously agreed that the statehood declaration
delay should not exceed the end of this year."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Few members proposed an open postponement"
and explained that "an open delay provides (Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud) Barak with the opportunity to go ahead with his plans to get
us remain under endless limited self-rule."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Zanoun threatened to quit his post as head of the
Palestinian legislative body, in case the Palestinian statehood
declaration was postponed to a post-2000 date.
</P>
<P>
Some PNC members proposed that Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO)'s Executive Committee should follow up the developments until
another date was set for declaring the independent Palestinian
state or invite the PCC, the PLO's mini lawmaking body, for another
meeting to take the proper decision.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the potential dates, Zanoun said, "PCC meeting on
February 2, l999 set the end of this year for the planned
declaration."
</P>
<P>
The end of this year, Zanoun said, means either November 15, the
anniversary of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's 1988 symbolic
declaration of independence in Algiers, or January 1, the date
marking the beginning of the armed struggle against Israel by
Arafat's group, Fatah
</P>
<P>
He denied as "baseless" the report quoted by local Al-Quds daily
from Agence France Press (AFP) that Arafat was angry with Zanoun
over the reshuffle in the PCC, stressing that "restructuring the
PCC should take place after the Palestinian statehood declaration,
not before it."

<HEADLINE> Barak Not to Retract Shabath Transport Statements: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will not retract his statements regarding the establishment
of public transportations on the Shabath and permitting Israel's
national carrier El Al to operate on weekends, Israel Radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shabath, which starts Friday evening and ends Saturday evening,
is the weekend holiday for the Jews. During the Shabath, El Al has
to ground all its planes while public transportations have to stop
their operations and Jewish people have to stay at home reading
bibles. Despite wide-ranging criticism, Barak will not retract
his statements, but will try to continue this "civil revolution"
and initiate such changes, the report quoted sources close to Barak
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's Television Channel 1 from New York
on Friday, Barak said his government should take the advantage of
the fact that there are no religious parties in the coalition to
initiate the "civil revolution" by implementing the plans to run
buses in Tel Aviv and have El Al planes to fly on Shabath.
</P>
<P>
Criticism was hurled at Barak both from the religious parties
and his own One Israel party following the weekend statements.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox Shas party Chairman Eli Yishai said on Sunday
that the prime minister's acts were "hysterical," while National
Religious Party (NRP) Chairman Yitzhak Levy said Barak "is making a
mistake."
</P>
<P>
Senior party members of One Israel also said on Sunday that
Barak's intentions oppose party policy to maintain the status quo
in relations between religion and state.
</P>
<P>
"All the internal surveys say that 70 percent of members and
supporters of the party want to continue with the status quo. If
Barak wants to change this, he has to bring the topic to debate
within the party where he would meet strong opposition," a party
source told the radio.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Barak's plans, Minister Without Portfolio Michael
Melchior from Meimad party said Friday that his party would not
agree to an initiative to separate religion and state and "totally
abolish Shabath in Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between Meimad and One Israel is based on a
recognition of Israel as a Jewish state and democratic state,
whereby its Jewish character is strengthened. I am convinced that
the prime minister does not intend to break the rules," he said,
adding that "Meimad would bot be a partner to such a thing."
</P>
<P>
Meimad holds one of the 26 Knesset (parliament) seats in the
Labor Party-led One Israel alliance. The third partner, former
foreign minister David Levy's Gesher (Bridge) party, quit the
alliance early August over Barak's peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been implementing a "civil reform" plan that has
already included a cabinet vote on disbanding the Ministry of
Religious Affairs. He hopes to work on drafting a constitution and
allowing anyone to be married in a civil ceremony instead of a
religious one.
</P>
<P>
Last week, acting Transportation Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak
said that El Al might begin to fly on Shabath before the
privatization move is completed.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Briefs on U.N. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer said on Sunday that the globalization has promised new
opportunities for the humanity, but careful attention should be
paid not to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the points he made during the just-concluded United
Nations Millennium Summit, Sezer said, "I considered the trust in
people's will and the respect for law as important values."
</P>
<P>
Sezer made the remarks in a press conference at the Esenboga
Airport in Ankara upon his return from New York, where he attended
the U.N. summit.
</P>
<P>
"In my speech at the summit, I said that we should make civil
society to play a more important role in protecting democracy
against all extremist movements and fanaticism, and enlarging
democracy's limits," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I noted that democratization and economic development were
parallel processes. We should prioritize education of the youth,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sezer also called for a U.N. reform in order to make it more
transparent, and equip it with means that are necessary to protect
peace and stability. "I noted that poverty was the main reason of
instability in the world and more sources should be allocated for
social and economic programs in the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day summit, Sezer also held bilateral talks
with a total of 24 heads of state and government, including United
States President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 1.5 Tons of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces on
Sunday seized some 1,500 kilograms of opium in the Mir-Javeh border
region in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The province borders war-torn Afghanistan, the world's largest
opium producer.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Naser Shabani, commander of the provincial
security forces, told the agency that eight camels and some weapons
were also confiscated from the international smugglers during the
operation. However, the smugglers have fled across the border.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of its borders with
Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up efforts to combat drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (parliament) has earmarked 200 billion rials
(about 24.4 million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the eastern
borders from drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 740 drug traffickers and 174 Iranian police officers
were killed in narcotics-related confrontations, according to
government reports.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Blames Jewish Settlers for Hebron Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh on Sunday criticized the Jewish settlers in
the West Bank city of Hebron for causing the violent climate there.
</P>
<P>
Sneh, who was touring the city, charged that some members in the
Jewish community in Hebron are more responsible than the
Palestinians for the rise in violence in the volatile city, said
Israeli Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said some people from both sides in the city are
trying to riot up the situation. But "much to my regret," said
Sneh, "our information points to the Jewish settlers as being
responsible for the violent incidents recently."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Jewish community in Hebron refused to meet with
Sneh, accusing him of constantly defaming them at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Hebron, the only city divided between areas of
Israeli and Palestinian control, has been the scene of a wave of
violent incidents between Jewish settlers and Arabs. The Israel
Defense Forces spoke of an atmosphere of growing extremism which,
to a large extent, has been created by settlers in the Jewish
enclave.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is now home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers living in 63 settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian media last month quoted Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat as saying that Israel had agreed to evacuate
the Jews from Hebron, which evoked strong denial from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and angry response from the settlers.
</P>
<P>
In response, Jewish settlers in Hebron vowed to start a "
struggle without limits" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The future of settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one
of the tough issues to be settled by the Israelis and Palestinians
in the final-status negotiations, which also include the status of
Jerusalem, border, water resources, and the return of Palestinian
refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- A gas pipeline will be built from Iran to Armenia to
help promote gas trade between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the 141-kilometer pipeline is to be completed
in the fall of 2001. Once the whole line is completed, it could
carry 1.5 million cubic meters of gas per day to Armenia.
</P>
<P>
A consortium comprising Russian company Gazprom, French company
Gaz de France, the National Iranian Gas Company and the Armenian
Energy Ministry will be set up for the project, which costs some
124 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Britain has decided to help rebuild a quake-hit
Turkish province.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding signed between the British
and Turkish governments Saturday, Britain undertakes to carry out a
master plan designed by British companies to rebuild Yalova,
northwestern province that is among the hardest hit by the August
1999 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 850 million dollars in financing is needed for the
rehabilitation work, which will primarily be performed by British
companies active in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Haitian Minister of Commerce and Industry Gerald
Germain invited investments from Turkey, saying that his Caribbean
Island state is a good place for Turkish textile industry
investors.
</P>
<P>
Germain made the call when he was visiting Ekrem Demirtas,
chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Izmir, southwest Turkey,
during the just-concluded Izmir International Fair.
</P>
<P>
Demirtas agreed, referring to the fact that the United States
does not apply textile sector quotas to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
"Haiti enjoys a privileged position vis-a-vis U.S. quotas and
could be a strategic textile and ready-made garment base for
Turkish merchants," he said.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- World Bank has agreed to extend a 21.3-million-dollar
soft loan for supporting Yemen's torrential irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's Industry Ministry said the credit would be used to carry
out strategic programs designated to improve and rehabilitate the
irrigation system of a 213-acre area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) has agreed on extending a 6-
million-dollar financial grant for Yemeni water, sewerage and

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Ruling Party Candidate Killed Amid Elections Campaigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A ruling party candidate for
Sri Lanka's October general elections was shot dead Sunday by
unidentified gunmen in the eastern district of Batticaloa as
elections campaigning was in full swing, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Cheliyan Perinpanayagam of the People's Alliance (PA) was
gunned down in a village near Batticaloa town, some 300 kilometers
east of Colombo, said the sources, adding that one of his key
supporters was also killed.
</P>
<P>
Commandos of the elite Special Task Force rushed to the scene
on receipt of the information and searched the area for the gunmen
who had got away by then, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Perinpanayagam, a former mayor of Batticaloa town, recently
joined the PA after resigning from a Tamil party. He is the first
candidate to be killed in the run-up to the October 10 general
elections. No one has yet claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened throughout the country last week as
campaigning for the elections began amidst fears of poll-related
violence and assassination attempts by Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
At least five people have been killed in election-related
violence since the 10th parliament was dissolved on August 18.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rejects Accusations Over S. Leonean Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military has
rejected as outrageous claims allegedly accusing its senior
officers of deliberately undermining the Indian United Nations
commander in Sierra Leone by maintaining close contacts with local
rebel groups and being more interested in pursuing business deals,
said a source reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria has done more than any country, laid down more lives
than any other country, to fight the rebels in Sierra Leone," an
anonymous senior military officer was quoted as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that claims in a leaked confidential U.N.
report, purportedly written by Indian U.N. commander in Sierra
Leone Major General Vijay Jetley, allegedly accusing Nigerian
officials of maintaining close contacts with the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in return for diamonds were "
outrageous".
</P>
<P>
In the four-page report, Jetley allegedly charged Nigerians of
plotting a conspiracy to force him out as the U.N. commander in
the west African country, saying that he had become a victim of
the machinations of these countries which were trying to scuttle
the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigerian military officials said that Jetley's claims
do not fully reflect Nigeria's role in the civil war in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
A senior Nigerian military official noted that his country in
1998 sent thousands of troops into Sierra Leone to oust a RUF-
allied rebel government and restored to power the elected
president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
It was also Nigerian forces to expel the RUF from the capital
Freetown in January 1999 when the RUF attacked the capital city,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Differences between Nigerian and Indian forces in Sierra Leone
have long been "an open secret". Nigeria had publicly campaigned
for the removal of Jetley, declaring that he should be replaced by
a Nigerian because Nigeria supplies the largest troop contingent
in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> British Hostages Freed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Six British hostages held by
the rebel West Side Boys for over two weeks have been freed after
its troops launched a successful military attack at the rebel's
militia base early on Sunday, according to a military source
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The six freed hostages, along with one Sierra Leonean army
officer, were safely aboard a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship off
Freetown, capital of the west African country, a spokesman for the
British Ministry of Defense was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Authorization for Sunday's military operation was taken at the
highest level, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the military operation was carried out by
troops from the elite Parachute Regiment, who were flown into
Sierra Leone early last week as a "precautionary measure".
</P>
<P>
The British troops began military operations early on Sunday at
the militia base of the West Side Boys in the Occra Hills to the
east of Freetown. However, it is still not clear there might be
any casualties in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The military attack followed the failure of securing the
release of the hostages through negotiations and the rebel's
threat to kill their captives.
</P>
<P>
The abducted soldiers, 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, were
captured by the West Side Boys on August 25 when they were
patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway, and five British
soldiers were later released.

<HEADLINE> Britain Attacks Sierra Leone Rebel Base, Hostages "Safe" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- British forces attacked a
rebel base in Sierra Leone on Sunday and rescued six British
soldiers being held hostage there for half a month, said General
Charles Guthrie, chief of Britain's defense staff.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's good news. We decided to attack the place where
the hostages were being kept at half past six this morning", BBC
quoted Guthrie as saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is still very confused, there is fighting going
on," he said, adding: "I've just had it confirmed that the
hostages are safe."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there are any casualties among the hostages
or soldiers, Guthrie said he did not know but "wouldn't rule them
out."
</P>
<P>
He declined to say where the British troops came from to launch
the attack.
</P>
<P>
BBC said the freed hostages might now be safe aboard a Royal
Fleet Auxiliary vessel at Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, a
former British colony in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Ministry declined to confirm this and said
more details would be provided at a news conference later in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, a rebel group in Sierra Leone seized 11 British
soldiers and an officer of the Sierra Leone Army. It had freed
five of the hostages after Britain agreed to offer them some
equipment and food.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapped British soldiers were members of the 400-strong
British special force with the task to train the new Sierra Leone
Army.

BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- It was quite a spectacle
when more than 2,000 motor vehicles, mostly heavy-duty trucks and
tourist coaches, honked and blared on Sunday in downtown Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Instead of celebrating the Brussels Liberation Day that fell on
Sunday, they were protesting against the ever-rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The high noon driving-by protesters, organized by the Union of
Professional Road Transport of Belgium, meandered its way by the
European Union (EU) institutions and the high streets of Brussels,
causing traffic difficulties for Sunday holiday-makers.
</P>
<P>
One police officer said that it was the first time for him to
see so many motor vehicles moving in to protest.
</P>
<P>
Most of the protesting vehicles bore eminent catch-words of "
SOS", "same VAT for all" and "less social charges for more
earnings."
</P>
<P>
A truck driver taking part in the demonstration said the rising
fuel prices are killing not only road transport business, but also
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
An EU survey shows that trucks transport more than 79 percent
of the land-shipping goods in the EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the one-day protest included tanker
trucks, taxis, school buses, engineering vehicles, family cars,
commuter buses and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
The one-day protest, said a truck driver, is to support the
week-long road blockades in neighboring France and truck driver
demonstrations in Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that petrol and diesel prices have increased by
about 20 percent in the last three years in Belgium. A liter of
petrol now costs around 48 Belgian francs (1.06 U.S. dollars), and
a liter of diesel, 35 francs (77 cents).
</P>
<P>
The protesters were demanding the authorities reduce taxes on
fuels and increase taxes on the profits earned by oil refinery and
distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
Protesters claimed that Total Fina Elf, for example, made 136
percent more profit in the first seven months of this year to
reach 137 billion francs (3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the finance ministers from all the 15 EU member states
expressed a "no change" of government taxation policy regarding
reduction of taxes on petroleum products in EU countries during
their Saturday meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to increase oil production so as to reduce oil
prices at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also hoped that oil prices could return to a level that
preserves worldwide growth.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Budget Minister Johan Vande Lanotte estimated that the
rising prices of crude oil alone cost his country 15 billion
Belgian francs (33.3 million U.S. dollars) more this year and that
could mean a decrease of revenue of 25 billion francs (55.5
million dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing oil prices since early 1999 has triggered a
debate in the EU on the crude oil prices, oil refining and
distribution as well as taxation on oil products.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials would hold the tight production quota by the
OPEC responsible for the rising crude oil prices that in turn have
led to rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of 30 dollars a barrel and it entered that band in February this
year following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when the
crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> China Gun for Men's Team Gold at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The all-conquering Chinese
men's gymnasts are going all out to bring home the elusive
Olympics team's gold in Sydney this month.
</P>
<P>
China captured their fourth consecutive men's world
championship last year in Tianjin with a massive margin and now
the only missing piece of jigsaw in the picture of their world
supremacy is the Olympics title that has been dominated by the
Russians for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
China have entered the Olympics twice as team world champions
but have never won a team Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
The nation's sports officials has set a task of up to three
Olympics gold medals for the gymnastics team, and obviously the
trophy they desire most is from the men's team event.  Believing
to possess a "best ever men's team in the China's gymnastics
history", head coach Huang Yubin says he is full of confidence to
lead his men to the ultimate Olympics glory.  "We're going very
well in the training and I have no doubt China is the top
favourite in the men's team event," Huang says.
</P>
<P>
While Huang is blessed with an enviable pool of young talents
on their prime time to choose from, his arch rivals Russia are
struggling to form a well-balanced effort to defend their title
with only half of the six-man team on the world level and the
other half ways behind.
</P>
<P>
Top gymnastics official Zhang Jian believes the men's team's
gold would be a safe bet. "The lads are on the peak; they're
burning with the desire to win and their spirits are soaring," he
says. "The timing is just perfect." It is believed China has
decided five of their six-man team, with 19-year-old vault world
champion Li Xiaopeng leading the pack which also includes pommel
horse specialist Xing Aowei and three all-around gymnasts Huang Xu,
Yang Wei and Lu Yufu.
</P>
<P>
The remaining berth in the team is to be decided between Dong
Zhen, who clinched the rings world title in hometown Tianjin last
year, and Xiao Junfeng, who hit the form earlier this year with
four vault gold medals in a row at the World Cup Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Besides men's team's event, China are able to strike gold in
other eight events at Sydney Olympics, Zhang reveals. They're men'
s all-around, vault, rings, parallel bars, pommel horse, floor and
women's uneven bars and balance beam.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious men's individual all-around title, which was
snatched by Li Xiaoshuang four years ago at Atlanta, would prove
to be a tough battlefield of no more than ten gymnasts mainly from
China, Japan, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese challenge in the event lie in a joint force of Xing
Aowei, Yang Wei, Huang Xu and Lu Yufu. They can expect a
formidable rivalry in the shape of Belarus veteran Ivan Ivankov
and three top Russians Alexei Nemov, Alexei Bondarenko and world
champion Nikolay Krukov.
</P>
<P>
In the men's vault event, China will depend on a tandem of
world champion Li Xiaopeng and World Cup winner Xiao Junfeng. Also,
Li is eager to repeat his gold medal-winning performance in the
parallel bars event of the 1997 worlds and is a major contender
for the floor title.
</P>
<P>
China will be looking at world silver medallist Xing Aowei for
the pommel horse gold and world champion Dong Zhen for the rings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's gymnasts pale in comparison with the men's,
with only two realistic chances of reaching the top podium in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Huang Mandan and Ling Jie, silver and bronze medallist at last
year's worlds respectively, will be trying to uproot Russia's
Olympics defending champion Svetlana Khorkina from the uneven bars
championship. The Russian heartthrob has never fumbled in the
event of any major competitions since the 1995 world championships.
</P>
<P>
Ling will also have a shot at the balance beam event in Sydney,
but the 18-year-old world champion will be finding Khorkina
waiting there again, alongside women's all around world champion
Maria Olaru of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The gymnastics delegation has never returned home empty handed
since China resumed their Olympics entry in the 1984 Los Angeles
Games. Things seem to be no different this time in Sydney.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai welcomes both large
and small enterprises from outside China and the country's Taiwan
to invest in its Pudong New District.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yupeng, vice mayor of Shanghai, made the remarks while
briefing participants on the investment environment in Pudong at
the on-going Fourth China Fair for International Investment and
Trade, which opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said, the Pudong New District, established ten years ago,
has attracted 98 of the world's top 100 industrial enterprises,
which have invested in 181 projects. The district now has more
than 6,300 overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwanese-funded enterprises is 639, with a
combined investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

will further open the market for financial insurance, high-tech
industries and service trade. The district will also speed up the
construction of infrastructure facilities including harbors,
airports and other projects to attract more overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's gross domestic production (GDP) has increased by 14
times compared with ten years ago, and its per capita GDP now
exceeds 5,000 U.S. dollars a year. Its 1999 GDP accounted for one-
fifth of Shanghai's total.

<HEADLINE> China to Become World's Largest Phone Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China will become the No.1
telephone market in the world in five years, Jiang Shaobing, an
official with the Ministry of Information Industry, said today at
the Fourth China Fair for Investment and Trade, which is being
held in the port city of Xiamen, in southeast China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the number of fixed-line and mobile phone users
is estimated to exceed 600 million in 2005.
</P>
<P>
China now has 120 million fixed-line phone users, with more
than 18 million registered in the first six months this year, and
60 million mobile phone subscribers including 16 million
registered in first half of the year. The numbers of fixed-line
phone users and mobile phone subscribers rank second and third
respectively, in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, there are only 14.7 phones per 100 Chinese people, or
32.1 phones per 100 persons in urban areas. There are 4.7 mobile
phones for every 100 people.
</P>
<P>
He added that, by June this year, the number of Internet users
in China exceeded 16 million.
</P>
<P>
In another development, sources from the Ministry of
Information Industry said that the sales volume of China's
electronic information products will amount to 1 trillion yuan (
about 120 billion U.S. dollars) this year, or 9 percent of the
world's total. By 2005, the sales volume is expected to double the
2000 figure.

ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's sheep production

feeding of the sheep is based on rangelands, natural pastures and
roadsides.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Minister Without Portfolio Michael Melchior is
threatening to pull his Meimad faction out of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's already minority coalition over plans to run buses in Tel
Aviv and have El Al planes fly on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Barak had again broached his ideas for the plans, which had been
dubbed a "civil revolution," in an interview Friday with Israel's
Channel One Television.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the government should take advantage of the fact that
there are no religious parties in the coalition to initiate such
changes. He specifically spoke of making it possible for the
residents of Tel Aviv's carless residents to go the beach on
Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian source said during the weekend that "five weeks
of intensive negotiations" will be held between the Palestinians
and Israel. Dennis Ross, the special U.S. envoy to the Middle East,
will also participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States will hold talks with
Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia over proposals to implement
religious sovereignty over the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Arabic language international daily Al-Hayat,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat suggested to U.S. President Bill
Clinton during their meeting in New York that there be "Muslim
sovereignty" over the Temple Mount, which will be under control of
the Islamic "Committee of Jerusalem" headed by Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton paid a special courtesy visit
Saturday to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at his hotel in New
York. Barak's wife Nava, his senior adviser Danny Yatom and Knesset
(parliament) member Yossi Sarid were also present during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told them that he had noticed a significant change
toward Israel during the Millennium Summit at the United Nations
General Assembly last week. During the international gathering of
over 150 world leaders, Barak was commended for his courage in
leading Israel along a path of peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. is still trying to gather support among Arab
and Muslim countries in an effort to influence Arafat to soften his
stance on Jerusalem and provide him with international backing.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The 129-member Palestinian Central Council convened Saturday
for a two-day meeting in Gaza and is expected to decide Sunday to
delay the declaration of statehood scheduled on September 13,
possibly until mid-November, to allow more time for reaching a
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than two thirds of council members appear to support
delaying the declaration, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere in the council is in favor of delaying the
declaration to give the negotiations a chance," said Palestinian
Minister for Parliament Affairs Nabil Amr.

<HEADLINE> Talks to Resume Tuesday for Release of Foreign Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government's chief
hostage negotiator Robert Aventajado said Sunday that negotiations
will resume Tuesday for the release of two French journalists
still held by the Abu Sayyaf on the southern island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
It is not safe right now to negotiate as tension still runs
high among the Abu Sayyaf ranks, Aventajado told reports Sunday
afternoon upon his arrival in the central city of Cebu, The ABS-
CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out Saturday morning in Jolo between two
factions of the Abu Sayyaf before it released four remaining
Europeans of 21 hostages kidnapped from Malaysia's resort island
of Sipadan in April.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not stable in the area. If we begin
operations, the lives of the two French journalists would be
placed in danger," said Aventajado, who flew to Cebu to report to
French ambassador Gilles Chouraqui concerning the delay in the
release of the French nationals.
</P>
<P>
He also said Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Ndang needs to recover
his confidence in the security of his men and the two French men
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator said the French journalists, abducted in
Jolo in July while covering the hostage crisis, would have been
freed Saturday together with the four Sipadan hostages but for the
factional fighting.
</P>
<P>
The feuding occurred between one faction led by Andang, better
known as Commander Robot, and Mujib Susukan and another faction
led by Abu Sabar and a certain commander Randy over whether to
release four or all the six European hostages.
</P>
<P>
The faction of Abu Sabar allegedly ambushed Andang and his men
on suspicion that the latter had cheated them out of their fair
share of the ransom the Abu Sayyaf was supposed to have received.
</P>
<P>
A team of government emissaries going to Jolo for the handover
of the hostages was caught in the ambush which killed one
bodyguard of the negotiating team and wounded five others.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Andang has assured him that the two French
journalists are under his custody, not with the faction of Abu
Sabar as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Libyan chartered airplane will fly in Cebu Sunday
afternoon to take the released Europeans to Libya.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Libya had agreed to pay one
million U.S. dollars each for the six foreign hostages in addition
to an earlier offer of 25 million dollars in ransom to the Abu
Sayaf for the release of hostages.
</P>
<P>
But both Tripoli and Manila have denied that they paid any
ransoms. Libya said its funds were for livelihood projects for the
Muslim areas in Mindanao in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> APEC Finance Ministers Meeting Ends in Brunei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bandar Seri Begawan, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The 7th meeting
of finance ministers of the 21 APEC member economies concluded
here Sunday with a statement for member economies to adopt
effective policies for ensuring sustainable growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed the regional economy and measures to
ensure the sustainable growth necessary for increased economy
prosperity in the region, a joint statement issued at the end of
their two-day meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"We resolve to continue to pursue sound economic and financial
policies and to carry out the structural reforms necessary to
sustain this progress," the ministers said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
On economic and financial situation, the ministers expressed
satisfaction with the efforts of each economy in overcoming the
negative impact of the Asia financial crisis, regaining the
momentum of economic growth and maintaining high level of growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is no room for complacency...Much remains to be
done to implement crucial financial and corporate sector
restructuring and to strengthen key domestic financial, economic
and judicial institutions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reached a consensus that sustainable growth is
the prerequisite for regional stability and prosperity and to this
end, they urged each economy to adopt effective macro-economic
policies and conduct in-depth reform and economic restructuring so
as to ensure steady and sustainable development of regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
On global financial system, the ministers stated that it is
important to get the views of all economies in discussions on
global financial issues and sought broader representation in this
debate.
</P>
<P>
They noted that progress has been made in developing
international standards, codes and best practice guidelines in a
wide range of areas and supported the key standards identified by
the Financial Stability Forum and encouraged APEC economies to
implement them in accordance with their circumstances and
priorities.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the growing importance of cross-border capital
mobility, the ministers emphasized the significance of
strengthening the collection, dissemination and sharing of data on
cross-border capital flows to cover both debt and non-debt flows.
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized the importance of constructive engagement
to assist economies to strengthen regulatory and supervisory
frameworks.
</P>
<P>
The ministers supported the efforts of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and its members to engage in a comprehensive
review of its core facilities to ensure more effective use of its
resources.
</P>
<P>
They endorsed the policy conclusions of the Voluntary Action
Plan for Promoting Freer and More Stable Capital Flows, saying "We
therefore resolve to continue policy reforms that enable us to
take advantage of the opportunities available in international
capital markets. We will establish in APEC a voluntary policy
dialogue on strengthening financial markets, particularly focusing
on issues related to the implementation of international financial
standards and codes."
</P>
<P>
On strengthening economic and corporate governance, the
ministers said sound economic and corporate governance will
encourage the return of capital to the region. "APEC will
undertake a policy dialogue on strengthening corporate governance
in this region, starting in early 2001."
</P>
<P>
The ministers have formed a task force on company accounting
and financial reporting to improve the quality of financial
disclosure and auditing practices in APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
On fighting financial crimes, the ministers welcomed the
agreement to establish an APEC working group that would conduct a
survey of the domestic, legal and regulatory frameworks for
fighting financial crime and recognized the need for strong
measures to combat money laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud
and other criminal or unethical activities.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that information technology has the potential to
increase sustainable economic growth, the ministers called on
economies to formulate and implement appropriate policies and
arrangements to facilitate electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that a working group on electronic payment systems,
consisting of financial experts from member economies, would be
established to develop and implement programs to foster paperless
trading.
</P>
<P>
Besides the APEC finance ministers, senior representatives from
IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also attended
the meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Legislators' High Salary Increments Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's local government
officials have spoken against Members of Parliament for awarding
themselves high salary increments.
</P>
<P>
"Members of Parliament are our enemy number one," the East
African Standard quoted the councilors as saying in a statement
issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a seminar organized by the Association of Local Government
Authorities of Kenya, the councilors across the country complained
that local officials should not be left out in terms of the salary
raise.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that all district officials should receive a 100
percent increase in salaries.
</P>
<P>
However, the local officials did not cite the poverty situation
in the country as the reason to criticize the legislators, but
mentioned their relatively low salary.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi Deputy Mayor Joe Aketch noted that while the
legislators were earning 650,000 shillings (about 8,600 U.S.
dollars) including allowances per month, monthly salaries for
local officials were only 10,000 shillings (about 130 dollars) or
below.
</P>
<P>
Over half of Kenyans are still living under the poverty line
with less one dollar per day.
</P>
<P>
On August 1, the National Assembly of Kenya passed a bill to
raise increase transport allowance from around 1,000 dollars to
about 3,500 dollars, which has led to massive public opposition.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The No. 3 reactor shut down
automatically Sunday at a nuclear power plant in central Russia
due to unknown reasons, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown at the Beloyarskaya plant followed a sharp change
in the electric current frequency in the energy system, Interfax
said, quoting a spokesman with the Ministry for Emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The incident poses no threat to human being and the
environment because the safety system is operating reliably, said
plant Director Oleg Sarayev.
</P>
<P>
The radiation levels are normal in the town, according to the
Ministry for Emergencies.
</P>
<P>
A commission of the Russian State Inspection Department is
investigating the causes of the shutdown. Resumption of the No. 3

<HEADLINE> IOC President Gets Apology from Olympics Minister for Bus No-show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympics Minister
Michael Knight gave his personal apology to Juan Antonio Samaranch
after the International Olympic Committee president was left
stranded when his bus failed to turn up.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch and the rest of the IOC executive board had planned
to visit the Olympic broadcast center on Saturday but cancelled
because the bus laid on by Games organizers was delayed for more
than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"We waited 25 minutes outside the hotel and were told that it
could be another 10 so the president called off the trip, " one
executive board member said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch confirmed Sunday he had been forced to cancel but
denied he had been furious.
</P>
<P>
"Not true. I was not angry," he said during a tour of the
athletes village.
</P>
<P>
"It was very easy to explain. We cancelled the trip because
the bus was not there. We were waiting for 20-25 minutes. They
said it would be 10 minutes more. It was not possible (to continue
with the planned visit). I had a very important meeting."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said Knight, who has reportedly annoyed IOC
officials by what they see as a high handed attitude, had phoned
him from Melbourne to offer his personal apology.
</P>
<P>
And the transport official responsible for the mix-up had been
personally spoken to by the IOC president.
</P>
<P>
"I was very kind with him. Even I gave to him a small present,
" said Samaranch, adding that he understand there could be
transport problems from time to time.
</P>
<P>
"Every time in every Games there are difficulties with
transportation, in all Games ... in all Games ... this is not an
exception," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe not to Pull Troops out of Congo: High Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not pull its
troops out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) despite
its high costs until the Lusaka peace accord is implemented and
the United Nations (U.N.) troops deployed, Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia
Tirivafi Kangai as saying Zimbabwe was aware of the cost
implications of its involvement in the DRC but the move was pan-
Africanist.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our foreign policy to reciprocate and defend a
neighboring country that is being invaded," he said in an
interview here at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Zimbabwe is waiting for the implementation
of the Lusaka agreement signed last year, and deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force so that it can pull out its troops and cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Simba Makoni told the
parliament that Zimbabwe could ill-afford to continue supporting
the war in the DRC which has already cost it 200 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> "Three Musketeers" of Thai Tennis to Compete in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Tennis "Three
Musketeers" of Paradorn Srichaphan, Tamarine Tanasugarn and
Benjamas Sangaram finally made it to the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine, the most famous tennis player in the kingdom, walked
into the Olympiad on her 42nd world ranking, while Paradorn and
Benjamas win their Olympic berths as wild carders of the
International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Olympics marks not only the largest number of
Thai tennis players ever to compete in the Olympiad, but also the
first time that the Kingdom will attend both the men's and women's
singles apart from the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, Thailand only made their entries
in the women's doubles when Benjamas and another female player
lose in the first round in 1992, and Benjamas and Tamarine fought
their way into the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The "Three Musketeers" are aiming to reap a better result when
they march onto the Sydney tennis courts as underdogs.
</P>
<P>
Considering the world-class opponents, their hopes of an
Olympic medal is bleak. However, the trio has the capability to
win tough matches and to top some of the big names, said Olarn
Issara, the Thai tennis team coach.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Paradon, who ranks 85th in the world and is the
first Thai male tennis player to attend the Olympiad, has less
experiences when compared with top players, but he is confident of
upsetting those elite players.
</P>
<P>
"Although I am still young and my ranking is not quite high, I
think I can match any top guy if I can maintain my form," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the trio, Tamarine should have the best run, provided she
is not drawn into a tough section, said Olarn. "On her day, the 23-
year-old female player can be a hard nut to crack and is treated
with respect by the world's top players," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of this year, she made history when she teamed up
with Paradorn to reach the mixed doubles final in the Hopman Cup.
She also enjoyed moderate success in the singles this year by
reaching the third round in the Australian and U.S. Opens and a
fourth round berth in Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Being modest, she considers herself an unfancied player in the
Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to perform her best in the Games, but not
everyone wins. I will be playing in the singles for the first time.
It is going to be as tough as any other professional tournament,"
said Tamarine, the first Thai to play in the Olympics' women's
singles.
</P>
<P>
As regards to doubles specialist Benjamas, 25, she has been
training intensively for the past five months to win qualification,
which will make her the first Thai tennis player to take part in
three Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
She now ranks 165th in the world.

KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Border police Saturday
confiscated from an Indian vehicle four quintals of hemp at a
local market in Mahottari district bordering India, The Kathmandu

The local mafia gang attempted to set fire on the jeep carrying

American newspaper along with critical comments from the director
of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, Barry
McCaffrey.

<HEADLINE> Rogge: Olympic Games Becomes Too Big and Expensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Games was becoming
a logistical nightmare for the hosts and should be scaled back,
said an International Olympic Committee member on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rogge said that the Olympics nowsdays can only be
handled by sophisticated cities such as Sydney as many smaller
nations were unable to afford such big-scale floods of personnel
movement and logistical backups.
</P>
<P>
The Games "are still not too big for Sydney or any other big
city of the size, but they are too big for some continents, they
are too big for some sub-continents, and we have to descale them
whilst keeping their quality," Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Africa, South America, India and China have never
staged an Olympics Games.
</P>
<P>
Rogge, a candidate to succeed Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC
president, said the Olympics must be made affordable for less
developed regions while still bringing the world's best athletes
to one city.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never spread the Games to different cities because the
value of the Games lies in very simple factors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the unity of place -- one city, the unity of time - two
weeks, no more, the unity of action -- all the biggest sports in
the world and the best athletes in the world in the same city at
the same time."

<HEADLINE> Spain Asks Britain to Repair Its Nuclear Sub in Gibraltar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Josep
Pique on Saturday called on the British government to repair its
stricken nuclear-powered Tireless submarine in Gibraltar as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The submarine limped to Gibraltar on May 19, a week after the
discovery of a coolant water leak while it was between Sicily and
the coast of North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Britain promised Spain that the Tireless will leave the port
immediately after repairs, but until now the repairs work has not
started.
</P>
<P>
Britain's procrastination aroused protests and angers in Spain.
Some ecological organizations asked the submarine to get out
immediately and the citizens nearby even asked the authorities to
appeal to the International Court in The Hague. Just two days ago,
the Spanish government called in the British ambassador for a
detailed information of the malfunction.
</P>
<P>
The British side said the sub posed no risk to Gibraltar and
that the British government has coordinated with the Spanish
authorities ever since the troubles happened.
</P>
<P>
Repairs are expected to begin until the safety scrutiny has
been completed and approved. In order to deal with the problem,
Britain and Spain set up a "standing contact group" on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar, an area of 5.9 square kilometers, is now the only
colony left on the European continent. It became Spanish territory
in 1501. In 1704, Britain occupied it and turned it into a
military fortress. Spain has long demanded the return of the
strategic "rock" at the gateway from the Atlantic to the
Mediterranean.

The "simple detail" was reportedly written in a note by Castro
himself, in which he says that the meeting occurred at the end of

<P>
The note says that it was a greeting, including a handshake,
that lasted less than 20 seconds.

During his stay in New York, Castro demanded U.N.
democratization and said the present international economic and
political order is unsustainable.
</P>

He also offered to send some 3,000 Cuban doctors to fight HIV/
AIDS and other diseases in Africa.

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three overseas-funded
enterprises were established in the Qingdao Economic and
Technological Development Zone in the first seven month this year,
with 260 million U.S. dollars in investment, 83 percent and 71
percent higher than the figures in the same 1999 period
respectively, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly established projects, investment in nine
surpassed 10 million U.S. dollars each, Business Weekly of China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone was established in October 1984. Approved by
the State Council, it is one of the 14 economic and technological
development zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jie, director of the zone's administrative committee,
said that the development of the economic zone is essential to the
whole city, noting "we have put introducing overseas funds at the
top of our list."
</P>
<P>
To date, 1,173 overseas-funded projects from more than 50
countries and regions have set up in the zone, with a total
investment of 3 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pillar industries in the zone include household electronic
appliances, petroleum, pharmaceutical, mechanics, new construction
materials and processing trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the GDP of the zone soared to 786 million U.S. dollars,
30 percent higher than in 1998. From 1994 to 1999, the zone's
industrial output value increased more than four times, jumping
from 3 billion yuan (about 363 million U.S. dollars) to 16.6
billion yuan (about 2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fast increase was attributed to the zone's sound investment
environment, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Its Qianwan Harbor is a natural port with a yearly handling
capacity of 22 million tons of cargo. The completed 200,000-ton
ore dock is the biggest in Asia. North of the harbor are two

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed on Saturday spending about 1.6 billion dollars for the
prevention of forest fires in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the money will help communities recover from
forest fires and also pay for getting rid of forest underbrush to
prevent future blazes.
</P>
<P>
"This excessive undergrowth fuels forest fires, making them far
more dangerous and difficult to control," Clinton said in his
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The United States is experiencing one of the worst wildfire
seasons in half a century, with 38 large fires continuing to burn
across nine states.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.6 million acres of forest have been burned so far
in the western states. "I'm committed to working with the
Congress to secure this critical funding," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He announced the release of nearly 40 million dollars for 90
restoration projects across the West.
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman are expected to meet with western state governors in
Denver next week to discuss cooperative projects for removing
underbrush and small trees.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Demands FARC Turn Over Hijacker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
Saturday demanded the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) immediately turn over a hijacker to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
A man, being transferred between cities to take part in a
judicial proceeding, hijacked a DASH-300 commuter airliner with
about 20 passengers on board and forced it to land in rebel
territory in the south on Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was then allowed to leave immediately and returned to
the central city of Neiva with all the other passengers unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, the government's high commissioner for
peace, Camilo Gomez, asked the FARC to turn over the hijacker,
identified as Arnobio Ramos Embuz, and avoid causing difficulties
for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the biggest guerrilla group in the country, confirmed
the plane landed at the airport in San Vicente del Caguan province,
but denied the hijacker is a member of the guerrilla organization.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker is "a common criminal," FARC spokesman Andres
Paris said. "This was not a guerrilla action, nor a FARC action."
Police said he was a FARC member who killed a police officer.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on whether the FARC would hand over the
hijacker to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Gomez said the incident was a very unfortunate episode that
needs a prompt solution as it might undermine the fragile peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The San Vicente del Caguan buffer zone was created with the
only purpose of facilitating peace talks between the government
and the FARC, said Gomez adding that the FARC should not use the
buffer zone for any other purposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan public
sector's net foreign debts were 2.577 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of June, some 5 percent up over December 1999, according to
official data.
</P>
<P>
This figure is 12.3 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP), compared with 11.6 percent of the GDP at the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Factors that caused the debt expansion lay mainly in the non-
financial public sector, whose debts grew 307 million dollars over
this period. The rise is due to the increase in the issuance of
titles in foreign currency and the acquisition of loans from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The gross foreign debt rise, however, was offset by the
increase of international reserves, together with the rise in
deposits of the residents in foreign currency.

It is the sixth time that Sampras is in the final, which gives
him a chance for his fifth U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Sampras will go for his 14th career Grand
Slam title against 20-year-old Russian sixth seed Marat Safin, who
disposed of a fatigued Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-1) in
the day's first semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Sampras takes a daunting 13-2 record in Grand Slam finals into
the championship match against the young Russian.
</P>
<P>
"After last year being home with a bad back, it was tough not
being here, but I got myself back in shape and I'm glad I'm back
in the final of such a great event," Sampras told the crowd after
earning his first trip back to the U.S. Open final since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to putting himself in position to add to his Grand
Slam title record, Saturday's win vaulted Sampras to the top of
the ATP Champions Race standings for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was somewhat lucky to get out in straight sets. He

down the line just wide.

1990, was also up a break early in the third set at 3-0 but gave
it back in the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
The fiercely competitive ninth seed later led 5-4 in the tie-
break. But the seven-time Wimbledon champion took the final three
points, reaching match point on one of his patented leaping
overhead volleys.

<TEXT>

<P>
SAO PAULO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil soccer manager
Wanderley Luxemburgo is facing trial for allegedly evading taxes
between 1993 and 1997, according to local paper Folha de S.Paulo
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Justice in Rio de Janeiro agreed on Friday to
process charges filed by the federal attorney general's office
that accused Luxemburgo of dishonestly concealing his income to
tax authorities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
If convicted Luxemburgo, who is in Australia coaching Brazil's
Olympic soccer squad, could face a jail sentence of between two
and five years.
</P>

Howard said Sunday the decision taken by his Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock was taken after consideration of a number
of factors,including the Olympic charter, and safety and security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan boxing official Gafur Rakhimov and basketball
official Carl Ching Men-Ky from Hong Kong, China, were refused
entry to Australia because of their alleged criminal connections.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, released Sunday, Howard assured Samaranch that
Australia had adhered to all its Sydney Games commitments.
</P>
<P>
"The paramount consideration in decisions taken to refuse entry
has been the safety and security of the Australian community," the
letter said.

<HEADLINE> Stam May Miss Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stam, who was making his comeback from a hamstring injury, was
forced to come off at half-time in the match, in which Man United
won 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Club manager Alex Ferguson blamed the firm pitch and claims he
does not know if the Dutch center-half, who had the same problem
at the end of last season, will recover in time to face Anderlecht.
</P>
<P>
"He has had to come off with an Achilles injury," said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"I think that while the grounds are firm like this, it's going
to be a problem for him. We need softer ground and he'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait and see for Wednesday, and we took him off
as a precaution to try and protect him for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"But, hopefully, he will be all right."
</P>
<P>
United's win takes them back to the top of the Premiership on
goal difference from Leicester City.
</P>
<P>
Paul Scholes opened the scoring in the 14th minute before
Fabien Barthez saved Niall Quinn's flick-on. Teddy Sheringham
doubled United's advantage and the impressive Scholes rifled home
the third seven minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was impressed with the quality of the goals, but not
the overall display.
</P>
<P>
He felt it might have been a different story if Barthez had not
saved Quinn's effort from Emerson Thome's header.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the result, but I didn't think the
performance was too great," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I thought the manner of the goals was fantastic and that was
the main feature for me.
</P>
<P>
"The first goal was an absolutely brilliant goal - the movement,
the cross from David and the finish.
</P>
<P>
"The second and third goals were maybe not as good, but were
still terrific goals.
</P>
<P>
"I think, though, the save from Barthez was vital because we
then went up the other end and scored the second goal. These
things win games."
</P>
<P>
Gerard Houllier admitted his relief at a last ditch 3-2 victory
over brave Manchester City at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Liverpool led 3-0 at Southampton and caved in to
concede a point. And they almost suffered to same fate at City's
hands, the Maine Road team hitting back from two down to draw
level before Dietmar Hamann scored his second goal of the match to
clinch a desperate victory.
</P>
<P>
Houllier said: "At least this time we showed guts and character.
Manchester City were a real handful, particularly in the air.
</P>
<P>
"We dropped points at Southampton through lack of character,
this time it was our character that gave us our win.
</P>
<P>
"They play a direct way, but it suits them, and they are well
organised. The fact that they won at Leeds in midweek says
everything about them.
</P>
<P>
"They have a fine young 'keeper, in Steve Howey an experienced
defender and a hard working midfield. They've signed two
international quality strikers and, from what I've seen, they will
have no problem staying up."
</P>
<P>
He added: "As a neutral it was very entertaining, but as a
manager you can't be pleased with that, particularly when we
suffered as much as we did out there. But we did show guts, and
the fact that we are winning while not playing well, is important.
"
</P>
<P>
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger suffered a nasty feeling of deja vu
at Valley Parad as his team dominated their encounter with
Bradford but had to settle for a point after a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Ashley Cole's first goal for the club levelled Stuart McCall's
10th-minute opener.
</P>
<P>
"It is just like the Sunderland game where we had chance after
chance," said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit frustrating because we played very well but we
showed great spirit to keep going.
</P>
<P>
"At least here we didn't lose but it is another of those games
we should have won."
</P>
<P>
Despite his team's dominance, Wenger knew the Gunners could
easily have been beaten had Benito Carbone not smashed a glorious
chance over the bar with 13 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
"Bradford did very well and they had us in trouble with long
balls, corners and free-kicks and we didn't take our chances.
</P>
<P>
"Thierry Henry did well but it is difficult to come back from 1-
0 down away from home."
</P>
<P>
Under-fire Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli was full of praise for
his players after they bounced back from the disappointment of
surrendering two points to Arsenal in midweek with a 0-0 draw away
to Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
"We came here to get the three points and the way we played, I
think, showed that," he said. "Newcastle played very well.
</P>
<P>
"It was wide open. Both teams tried their best to win the match,
so that was a good attitude for a team that has been under fire
for the last three days.
</P>
<P>
"We showed that composure and confidence. We could have won it,
we could have lost it - it was a cracking football match."

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are highlights of
major environment news stories Xinhua released from September 3 to
September 8:
</P>
<P>
Forest Parks Flourish in Guangzhou
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong Province has 16 forest
parks, the biggest number in all provincial capitals in China.
</P>
<P>
As a regional political and economic hub, Guangzhou has forest
covering 41.5 percent of the city area, or 224,000 ha. The city
spends over 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) annually on
tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Local forest parks combine landscape gardens and amusement
grounds with stone-laid walk-ways through woods. The refreshing
environment and convenient infrastructure have made local forest
parks very popular.
</P>
<P>
Germany-Sponsored Forest Project in Northwest China
</P>
<P>
The 20th Germany-sponsored forestation project in China has
been launched in Yan'an, the famous revolutionary base in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
With 12 million Deutsche Marks (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars)
from the German government, China will plant 15,700 hectares of
forest and another 2,300 hectares of forest that yields earnings,
and consolidate some 18,000 hectares of farmland in nine years in
Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
China and Germany began to cooperate in forestation eight years
ago. Since then, Germany has donated some 220 million Deutsche
Marks (about 100 million U.S. dollars) to China for forestation
and Germany-aided forests have covered some 100 counties and towns
all over the country.

<P>
Worsening Environment Calls for Sustained Development
</P>
<P>
The heads of State and government across the world are
gathering in the U.N. headquarters in New York this week to
discuss the major challenges facing the whole mankind in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges they will discuss is the deteriorating
environment and the strategy of sustained development.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented development over the past few hundred years
has resulted in the most brilliant civilization of today. But the
price is dear: global warming, water shortage, spreading
desertification and disappearing bio-diversity. The homeland of
mankind is losing its fertility and beauty, a bitter fruit borne
out of an unsustainable way of human activity.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Mbeki Reiterated His Stance on Aids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mbeki has been strongly criticized for the government's AIDS
policies and for his support of Aids theorists considered to be
dissident by mainstream science.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, due to be published on Monday, Mbeki
reiterated his stance that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there is such a thing as acquired immune deficiency.
The question you have to ask is, what produces this deficiency?"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you go through the literature, ordinary standard
literature available in medical schools, there will be a whole
variety of things [that] can cause the immune system to collapse,"
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Endemic poverty, the impact of nutrition, contaminated water,
all of these things, will result in immune deficiency," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that on the African continent, repetitive infections
like malaria and sexual transmitted diseases like syphilis are
also contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
"This is precisely where the problem starts. No, I am saying
that you cannot attribute immune deficiency solely and exclusively
to a virus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said there is a lack of consensus among scientists as to
whether there is a link between HIV and Aids.
</P>
<P>
He said if it is believed that HIV destroys a person's immune
system, it would mean someone with tuberculosis would not be
treated for that disease, which also causes immune deficiency, but
for AIDS only.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he believes the virus is only partly to blame for
immune deficiency.
</P>
<P>
 "If the scientists come back and say this virus is part of
the variety of things from which people acquire immune deficiency,
I have no problem with that," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
 "But to say this is the sole cause therefore the only
response to it is anti-retroviral drugs, I am saying we'll never
be able to solve the AIDS problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Race Official Killed Accidentally in Italian GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A young race official died on
Sunday at the Italian Grand Prix held in the Italian northern city
of Monza. He was hit by a wheel which flew into the air during a
multi-car crash at the start of the race.
</P>
<P>
The man, Paolo Gislimberti, 33, was given a heart massage
before being taken by ambulance to Monza hospital.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after arrival, he died of injuries to his head and
chest, police said.
</P>
<P>
Gislimberti was a member of the Monza circuit's volunteer anti-
fire unit, known as 'lions' for the courage they have shown in
emergencies. He was married.
</P>
<P>
"Leave us with our grief," said a woman member of the fire-
fighting group. "Today is a terrible day for us."
</P>
<P>
According to initial reports, it appeared that Gislimberti was
on the wrong side of the guard rail at the side of the track when
he was hit.
</P>
<P>
The Monza prosecutor's office ordered the sequestration of the
Arrows team racing car from which the wheel is believed to have
detached itself during the spectacular cart-wheel crash of Pedro
De La Rosa.
</P>
<P>
In Maranello, home of the Ferrari racing team which won Sunday'
s race, ordered that there be no celebration procession through
the town out of respect for Gislimberti's family.

<TEXT>
<P>
Berlin, September 10 (Xinhua) -- German Transport Minister
Reinhard Klimmt is still unsatisfied with the latest output
increase of the oil producing countries, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Klimmt was quoted by "Saarbrueker Zeitung" as saying that he
believed the 800,000 barrels per day increase decided by the
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
will give "certain relief" to soaring oil prices, but its members
"must truly produce more".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Europe-wide protest against high oil prices and
government energy tariffs have also broken out in Germany, as
truck drivers and farmers blockaded towns of Uelzen and Hildesheim,
both in the state of Niedersachsen.
</P>
<P>
The largest-circulated German newspaper Bild reported that the
union of truck drivers threatened to spread the blockade next week
to other cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
The truck drivers demanded lower energy tax, which was
repeatedly rejected by the government.

<HEADLINE> British Soldier Killed in Raid in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Sunday that
one of its soldiers died and another was seriously injured when
British troops attacked a rebel base in Sierra Leone to free six
British soldiers held hostage.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Defense is able to confirm that one U.K. (
United Kingdom) serviceman was killed in action during this
operation," the defense ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The deceased was dead on arrival at a British ship where the
others were medically examined, the defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"One more serviceman is seriously wounded, but his life is not
at risk," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that another 11 British soldiers
suffered minor injuries in the raid.
</P>
<P>
"These casualties are regrettable but are at the low end of the
scale for such a difficult and complex operation. Our thoughts are
with the families of all those involved," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry officials also said 18 Sierra Leone rebels, 15
men and three women, had been taken prisoner and handed over to
the United Nations, which in turn handed them over to the Sierra
Leonean police.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the British
operation had been "fully successful" and paid tribute to the
skills and professionalism of the armed forces, saying they were
the finest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside his Downing Street office a few minutes before
the British soldier's death was announced, Blair said he felt
immense pride in the armed forces.

"We agree with the report that the measures should be lifted,"
the spokesman said, but adding that Britain was not taking action

Austria's 14 European Union partners froze bilateral contacts
with Vienna in February, after the far-right Freedom Party, then
led by the controversial Joerg Haider, entered a coalition
government.

The EU report, presented last week, said Austria's protection
of the rights of immigrants and minorities was as good as in other
EU countries and in some respects better. It advised that
maintaining the sanctions would be counter-productive.

difficult position, as France has been a leading supporter of the
sanctions against Austria.

French European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici reportedly
said on Sunday that EU countries needed to reach a consensus
before deciding whether to lift sanctions against Austria.

Media reports here said Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen said on Sunday he would urge fellow European Union
leaders to end their diplomatic boycott of Austria immediately and
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker has also urged a
quick end to the measures.
