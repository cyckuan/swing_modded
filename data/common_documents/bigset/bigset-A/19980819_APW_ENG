Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with markets' afternoon close, dollar-yen rate, quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese yen gained against the U.S. dollar
Wednesday on growing concern over possible government intervention
in the market to support the Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks rose.
	   The yen rose to 144.64 to the dollar at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), up
1.14 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also stronger than its late
New York rate of 145.00 yen.
	   The Japanese currency strengthened against the dollar overnight
in New York as rumors flew that Asian central banks were selling
U.S. Treasury bills to raise cash as a possible prelude to an
attempt to bolster the yen.
	   The U.S. currency's slide accelerated in Tokyo after the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Wednesday that monetary
authorities may act soon to prop up the yen.
	   ``For investors, the risk of a strong yen is getting higher.
They should be careful. The opportunity for yen-supportive
intervention is getting near,'' Sakakibara said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, shares were buoyed by
the yen's sudden strengthening and a rise overnight in U.S. stocks
traded on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 342.55
points, or 2.27 percent, to 15,406.34 at the end afternoon trading.
On Tuesday, the average rose 269.13 points, or 1.82 percent.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 139.80 points Tuesday to
close at 8,714.65.
	   On Wednesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section picked up 16.99 points, or 1.46
percent, to close at 1,183.71. The TOPIX rose 14.69 points, or 1.3
percent, the previous day.
	   Turnover on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 384 million shares, up slightly from 324.76 million
shares Tuesday. Advancers beat retreaters 858 to 263, while 147
issues were unchanged.
	   There was some concern, however, that natural investor interest
is not there, said Stephen Wood, a senior salesman at ING Baring
Securities.
	   ``I think there is still a lot of bad news over the next few
weeks'' as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party battles with the
political opposition in parliament over its bank reform bills, he
said at the end of morning trading.
	   Traders said the market has room to climb higher following its
recent sharp falls, but that it will likely run into heavy selling
around the 15,500-point level.
	   ``The market is a bit top-heavy around 15,500,'' said Naoki
Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities.
	   Worries about the economy and the smooth passage of bills to
clean up the nation's ailing banking system will continue to cap
the market's rise.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.190 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.155 yen, pushing its price down to 111.80 yen
from 112.07 yen.

Facing crackdown, IRA dissidents `suspend' bombing campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from deputy first minister, Sinn Fein,
Irish deputy prime minister  &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a security crackdown and
widespread public revulsion, the Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for a car-bomb atrocity called a surprise
``suspension'' to their violence Wednesday.
	   The coded statement to the Dublin office of the Irish News, a
Belfast newspaper, came just hours after the ``Real IRA'' claimed
responsibility for Saturday's car bomb in Omagh, which killed 28
and wounded 220. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Northern
Ireland history.
	   ``Please God, let this be genuine,'' said Joe Byrne, the leading
Catholic politician in Omagh, who visited the homes of seven
families grieving lost loved ones, many of whom will be buried
Wednesday.
	   ``It's of course too late for those killed and injured in the
bomb attack in Omagh, but it is the only correct response,'' said
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   ``We may find that at last hope is breaking through, because
those outside the peace process now see the urgent need to become
part of it,'' he said.
	   The statement by the Real IRA _ so called because its leaders
refuse to use a different name from the mainstream organization _
stopped short of announcing a formal cease-fire.
	   But the dissidents cited widespread public horror and an appeal
from Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern as a reason to ``suspend''
their attacks indefinitely and begin ``a process of consultation on
our future direction.''
	   The dissidents' earlier statement claimed they hadn't meant to
kill anybody but had planned to cause damage only to ``commercial''
targets in the religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kilometers)
west of Belfast.
	   That provoked Ahern _ in the Irish Republic's seaside town of
Buncrana, where three victims of the bombing aged 8 to 12 will be
buried Wednesday _ to demand immediate declarations of cease-fires
from the Real IRA and other anti-British gangs refusing to join the
IRA's July 1997 truce.
	   Ahern's Cabinet plans to meet in Dublin in emergency session,
starting at 11 a.m. (1000GMT), to plan what security and legal
moves it must make to suppress the new IRA faction.
	   ``Very tough measures are on the agenda and I have no doubt that
we will agree to the introduction of what's necessary to destroy
this organization,'' said Ireland's deputy prime minister, Mary
Harney. `` We are going to put them down and it's as simple as
that.''
	   David Trimble, Protestant leader of Northern Ireland's embryonic
cross-community government, said he found the Real IRA statement
``pretty contemptible actually.''
	   ``I don't know if any statement from this crowd would have any
credibility,'' said Trimble, who will meet Ahern in Dublin on
Wednesday evening to be briefed on the crackdown plans.
	   And Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon, said the
Real IRA made its gesture only because it was ``staring the
certainty of imprisonment in the face.''
	   Sinn Fein's McLaughlin said the Real IRA statement should
inspire two other anti-British gangs, the Continuity IRA and the
Irish National Liberation Army, to call their own truces. The
Continuity faction was formed following a 1994 IRA truce, while the
INLA was founded during the IRA's first lengthy truce in 1975. Both
have mounted bomb, mortar and gun attacks in the past year.

Threats top list of Cambodia's post-election intimidation: U.N.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Scores of opposition members have
been threatened or attacked by Cambodian strongman Hun Sen's forces
since last month's elections, but there have been no confirmed
political killings, a U.N. report said Wednesday.
	   The U.N.'s special representative for human rights in Cambodia
said in the seven-page report that victims allied with the
opposition have been threatened at gunpoint, had shots fired over
their heads and been beaten.
	   But the report stated that the U.N. Human Rights Center ``has
not received a single report of killing showing possible political
motives since the election'' and most acts of intimidation appear
to have been initiated at a local level.
	   In contrast, the office recorded at least 30 deaths alleged to
be political killings in the weeks that led up to the parliamentary
elections July 26. It found evidence of political motivation in
only about six of the cases.
	   Post-election intimidation ``appears to have been ... the
reassertion by local authorities of their authority and power after
days of pre-election uncertainty, as well as a warning to their
rivals in the community that they are now more vulnerable than
ever.''
	   Hun Sen's appeal Aug. 2 for his supporters to refrain from
retribution was followed by a large drop in threats and other acts
of intimidation, the report said.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority
in National Assembly seats in the election, but lacks the
two-thirds majority required to form a government and is seeking
allies among the opposition.
	   The main opposition parties, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy, have refused to join a new government until their
claims that Hun Sen won by massive fraud are investigated.
	   The elections came a year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a violent coup. At least 100 of the prince's
supporters were killed by Hun Sen's forces in the months that
followed.

Israeli soldier reported killed, three wounded in Lebanon ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an
armored Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon Wednesday, killing a
soldier and wounding three others, security officials said.
	   They said the guerrillas fired anti-tank Sagger missiles and set
off a roadside bomb as the patrol passed near the village of Rihan,
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in
an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   An Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded in the 9
a.m. (0600GMT) attack, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity. They said an Israeli helicopter
was seen evacuating casualties from the scene.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired Sagger missiles and
detonated a ``powerful bomb'' near the Israeli patrol, killing a
soldier and wounding three others.
	   Israeli military officials had no immediate comment on the
attack.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands facing the
occupied zone, the officials said. No casualties were reported from
the shelling.
	   On Monday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is used by Hezbollah as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied militiamen. No
casualties were reported in the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

Annan's envoy says U.N.-Iraq dispute not yet at crisis point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A special U.N. envoy left Baghdad on
Wednesday, saying Iraq-U.N. relations had not reached a crisis
point despite his failure to convince the government to allow
resumption of U.N. arms inspections.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, left for Habbaniya air base outside the capital to fly to
Bahrain and on to New York.
	   He is due to brief Annan on Thursday on his talks with Iraq's
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   His departure came a day after he announced that he had failed
to convince Iraqi officials to back down from the freeze on
cooperation with the inspectors assigned to find Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, in effect blocking inspections.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah said Tuesday.
	   Iraq announced in early August that it would refuse to cooperate
with the inspectors because they were not really working toward the
lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq that prevent the free export of
oil, its most valuable commodity.
	   The U.N. Security Council declared the move unacceptable.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the inspectors must declare Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weapons before the sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be canceled.
	   Before leaving Wednesday, Shah said he still hoped a solution
could be found to allow resumption of arms inspections.
	   ``I will not say it is a crisis,'' he said. ``I still think that
a lot of discussion, negotiations and bilateral talks can take
place.
	   ``I think and I hope that the Security Council and Iraq would be
able to work this out,'' Shah said as he left the headquarters of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the weapons inspections.
	   Shah described his talks with Aziz as ``friendly and cordial''
and said he was ready to return for further negotiations with the
Iraqis.
	   Shah arrived Aug. 13 in Baghdad with a letter from Annan to Aziz
about the latest standoff.
	   The council also has sent letters to the U.N. agencies in charge
of arms and nuclear inspections backing their mandates to carry out
their work but giving no guidance on how to deal with Iraq's
defiance.
	   When asked why the council hadn't threatened Iraq with
ultimatums, such as threats of military action, the council
president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said the time wasn't right for
such a strong message.
	   ``I don't think that anyone in the council has suggested that we
have reached a point at which consideration of severest
consequences would be necessary,'' he said.

Suspended jail term for author of child sex letters to Ghana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A man who encouraged child sex in
letters to Africans in Ghana on Wednesday became the first person
convicted under a new sex law that protects minors overseas.
	   In the County Court, Harry Ernst Ruppert, 55, received a
six-month suspended jail term after admitting he wrote letters
urging people in Ghana to start a school to train children as young
as age 4 in sexual acts.
	   Judge Michael Kelly said he thought the likelihood of Ruppert's
plan being carried out was remote, and that Ruppert's likely
motivation was ``one of sexual self-gratification by writing'' the
letters, he said.
	   Ruppert, a printer, pleaded guilty to three counts of
encouraging others to engage in sex acts with children under 16
years _ a new offense created as part of government moves to crack
down on Australians committing child sex crimes overseas.
	   Legal sources said Ruppert's was the first conviction in
Australia for encouraging others to engage in child sex, although
others have been convicted of engaging in child sex overseas.
	   In passing sentence, Kelly said he had some doubts whether
Parliament intended cases of encouraging foreigners to have sex to
be prosecuted.
	   The judge said if that was intended by Parliament, an Australian
could be prosecuted even if the sexual conduct encouraged was legal
in the country where it occurred.
	   But Kelly said he had set his doubts aside, considering Ruppert
pleaded guilty.
	   ``Once one accepts that the offense has been committed, one is
obliged I think to consider that the accused contemplated and
intended the most horrible perversion of the young,'' he said.

Ten political prisoners released in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government on Wednesday
freed ten East Timorese political prisoners as part of an annual
clemency to mark the country's independence day.
	   The ten were democracy activists who had been jailed for seeking
independence for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was
annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   Five of the prisoners _ David Dias Ximenes, Salvador Da Silva,
Gaspar Da Silva, Boby Xaview Luis Pereira _ had been held in Becora
penitentiary in East Timor's capital of Dili.
	   They were released in a ceremony attended by the city's military
chief Lt. Col. Endar Priyanto and chief prosecutor Musalolo
Hendrik.
	   Pedro Da Luis, Moises Freitas Moreira and Marcelino Fragan were
released from a prison in the coastal town of Baucau, east of Dili,
Hendrik said.
	   Two other inmates _ Manuel Da Silva and Aleixo S. Corterial _
were released from the Ermera prison, he said
	   Wednesday's clemency left 89 political prisoners remaining in
jails in East Timor, Hendrik said.
	   On Independence Day on Monday the government released 17 East
Timorese prisoners and reduced the terms of 220 others.
	   The 1976 annexation of East Timor occurred a year after
Indonesian troops intervened in a civil war that broke out during
the last days of Portuguese colonial rule.
	   The United Nations, however, still consider Portugal the
governing power of the territory.

Jailed jet-set banker to appeal prison-leave cancellation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government says jailed jet-set banker
Mario Conde can still benefit from a weekend-leave program while he
appeals a judge's ruling that cancels the furlough.
	   A judge overseeing penal affairs ruled Tuesday that Conde was
not eligible for leave because he had not served enough of his
four-year, two-month sentence for embezzlement and because he has
another corruption trial pending.
	   But the National Directorate of Penal Institutions, which
granted Conde leave on Aug. 4, said later Tuesday that its initial
decision still stood while Conde's lawyer appeals against the
judge's ruling.
	   In February Conde began doing time for defrauding 600 million
pesetas (dlrs 4.3 million) from a firm linked to Banesto, the bank
he was running at the time.
	   The furlough program lets Conde out on weekend leave twice a
month, and grant him an additional 48 days of what amounted to
vacation. He got out for the first time on Aug. 7.
	   But that day a prosecutor objected on grounds that Conde and 10
other suspects are still on trial on other corruption charges
involving Banesto. If convicted in the second trial, Conde could
get more than 40 years.
	   The penal affairs judge sided with the prosecutor.
	   With his slicked-back hair and high-society friends, Conde was
for many a garish symbol of the get-rich-quick mentality that
characterized much of Spanish business in the 1980s.

Union planning action against seatshop ``slaves''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A trade union said Wednesday it plans
to take two Brisbane fashion houses to Federal Court to face
allegations that they are keeping children as young as eight in
slave-like conditions in Queensland sweatshops.
	   The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia is taking
the action as part of a clampdown on child labor operations it says
exist in Brisbane suburbs, the Courier-Mail newspaper reported.
	   Ethnic Communities Council chairman Nick Xynias described the
employers as ``animals.''
	   ``I was very strong against cheap labor and we brought it to the
attention of government a few years back,'' Xynias said.
	   ``I understood it was gone but I'm not surprised it still
exists,'' he said.
	   Two Brisbane shops have already been charged with breaching pay
and condition laws and failing to keep proper records, the
newspaper reported.
	   Owners will appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court within the
next two months facing fines of up to U.S. dlrs 6,000 (10,000
Australian dollars).

Troubled Singapore company has five ships stranded in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Five ships of a financially troubled Singapore
company have been stranded in ports in Japan, India and Indonesia,
unable to pay salaries or port duties, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The vessels belonging to Thon Soon Shipping have been detained,
some since June, over disputes over cargo, unpaid crew salaries and
repair and port bills, The Straits Times said.
	   The troubles for the Singapore shipping firm started last May
when its parent company, Thong Soon Holding, was reported to have
debts exceeding 55 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 32 million),
while its net assets were estimated at less than 30 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 17 million).
	   The company's appeal last May for protection from creditors was
rejected, leaving the fate of five of its ships uncertain.
	   The number of crew members on board and their nationalities are
unknown, the Straits Times said.
	   The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore has been involved
in negotiations among the ship owner, local port authorities, cargo
owners and crew.

Australia backs Gusmao's release, says foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Indonesia should release East Timor
independence leader Xanana Gusmao to encourage a negotiated
settlement to the conflict in the disputed territory, Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   ``We would favor the release of Xanana Gusmao in the context of
a process of reconciliation and settlement in East Timor,'' Downer
said in an address to a human rights conference.
	   ``Australia recognizes that Xanana Gusmao has a central role in
the resolution of the East Timor issue.''
	   Gusmao was arrested in 1992 for fighting against Indonesian
control of East Timor. Under former President Suharto, Indonesia
invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year
later.
	   Australia is the only country to recognize Indonesian
sovereignty over East Timor. The United Nation does not.
	   Downer said Australia supported a process of dialogue and
reconciliation between the people of East Timor and the Indonesian
government and ``any process that would provide the East Timorese
people with significantly greater say in the running of their own
affairs.''
	   He said Australia would accept any settlement to which both
parties agreed.
	   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia John McCarthy had recently
visited East Timor, and had spoken with Gusmao in the Jakarta jail
in which he is being held to seek his views on the island's future,
he said.
	   Gusmao remains in jail despite the recent release of hundreds of
prisoners as part of Indonesia's independence day celebrations.
	   In an annual tradition, Indonesia freed dozens of prisoners
nationwide and granted sentence reductions to others to mark
independence day Monday. In East Timor, authorities freed 17
prisoners and cut the terms of 220 others, all of them criminals.
	   Gusmao was granted only a four-month reduction in his 20-year
sentence.

Islamic militant coalition warns Americans of new attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A coalition of Islamic militant groups
warned that ``strikes will continue from everywhere'' against the
United States, the group said in a statement published Wednesday in
a leading Arabic newspaper.
	   The communique from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders, formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden in February, was printed in the London-based daily Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate similar to that of the Soviet Union,'' the
statement said. ``Strikes will continue from everywhere, and
Islamic groups will appear one after the other to fight American
interests.''
	   The Jihad front is believed to be a coalition of six
fundamentalist groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its
statement was sent Tuesday to Al-Hayat's bureau in Cairo.
	   Al-Hayat said it came with three other statements from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the two deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7.
	   In one statement, the Holy Shrines group said it would
``continue shipping more American dead bodies to their unjust
government ... until we humiliate America's arrogance and roll its
dignity in the mud of defeat.''
	   The group had not been hear of before the explosions in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left 257 people dead and
more than 5,500 injured. Among the dead were 12 Americans.
	   The separate statement from the Jihad coalition tied the motive
for the embassy attacks to U.S. involvement in Somalia in the early
1990s.
	   ``The two embassies, which the Islamic Army for the Liberation
of Holy Shrines bombed, have supervised the killings of at least
13,000 Somali civilians in the treacherous attack led by America
against this Muslim country,'' it said.
	   A U.N. peacekeeping mission dominated by the United States
landed in Somalia in late 1992 and provided protection for food
distribution to help end a famine in the east African country.
	   But the U.N. force became bogged down in Somalia's factional
fighting, and 18 U.S. soldiers were killed before the force
withdrew in 1995 without solving the political problems.
	   The statement from the Jihad coalition said that when the Holy
Shrines group claimed responsibility for the bombings ``it became
clear to everyone, including the American people, that we were not
lying when we warned them.''
	   The group had issued a warning of attacks, printed in Al-Hayat,
several days before the embassy bombings.
	   Al-Hayat said the three other statements of the Holy Shrines
group were titled ``Open Letter to the Kenyan people,''
``Congratulations'' and ``A Communique to People.''
	   The first statement said that the Nairobi's bombing ``was
targeting the American presence only ... and the Islamic Army's
intention was not to hurt Kenyan people.''
	   The second was to congratulate Muslims ``for taking revenge from
the American Crusader criminal gang.''
	   The third warned of more attacks and asked Muslims ``not to get
close to anything American so that what happened in Nairobi won't
be repeated and so that they won't be hit by the fire of the
soldiers of God'' by mistake.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two men armed with a meat cleaver attacked a
fiery talk show host outside a radio station just before his
morning broadcast Wednesday, leaving him in serious condition with
deep cuts in his arms, legs and back.
	   Legislators _ often the targets of Albert Cheng on his shows _
condemned the attack, and some said they believed it was triggered
by his commentaries.
	   ``This is a challenge to ... our freedom and the rule of law,''
James To, chairman of the legislature's security panel, told
Commercial Radio where Cheng worked.
	   The men, one carrying the cleaver, ambushed the flamboyant
52-year-old broadcaster as he walked from a parking lot to the
radio station, said a police spokeswoman on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police said the assailants, both in their 30s, remained at
large. Although Cheng has alienated many people on his shows,
police said the motive of the attack was not immediately known.
	   A police unit that specializes in fighting organized crime is
investigating the case, but a spokeswoman refused to comment on
whether the case was related to triads, or Chinese gangs.
	   Cania Wong, a hospital spokeswoman, said Cheng was in serious
condition after eight hours of surgery to reconnect some muscle,
bone and nerve tissues. He sustained six cuts, Wong said.
	   Legislator Martin Lee, Cheng's friend and chairman of the
territory's largest party, the Democrats, said on official radio
the attack ``was a very shameful and cowardly act.''
	   Cheng is especially popular among blue-collar workers, many of
whom enjoy venting their anger at the government on air. Time
Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the
territory last year.
	   Lam Yuk-wah, who co-hosts the morning show, said he would keep
the program's style and format, but refused to speculate on the
motive for the assault.
	   Commercial Radio said in a statement it was shocked and angry at
the incident, and strongly condemned the violence. It also reported
that Shelley Lau, the territory's director of home affairs, visited
Cheng and said such violence would not be tolerated.
	   Famous for his liberal stance and outrageous attacks on
officials and government policies, Cheng hosts a popular morning
talk show, Teacup in a Storm, on weekdays on Commercial Radio. He
also hosted several TV programs.
	   Cheng recently lost a libel suit to another former radio talk
show host on a rival station. Earlier this year, he was embroiled
in a controversy with the manpower secretary, who demanded an
apology from a TV station for remarks Cheng made about him and his
policies.
	   ``Cheng always has his unique personal viewpoints,'' said Ann
Chow, a spokesman for Asia Television. ``He listens to the common
people's voices.''
	   He charged in an address to foreign reporters earlier this year
that the government was clamping down on the media, and said
government officials had become reluctant to appear on his
programs.
	   Several photojournalists have been attacked on assignment
recently, but violence against the media is not common here.
	   In 1996, a controversial magazine publisher had an arm hacked
off by assailants in his office. The case has not been solved, but
speculation focused on Chinese gangs, possibly trying to prevent
articles on their activities from appearing in the magazine.

Thai farmers plant trees to clear bank debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai farmers in financial trouble can
now settle their bank debts by planting trees, an official at a
state-run bank said Wednesday.
	   Farmers whose bad debts resulted from reasons beyond their
control can ask the lender, the Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives, to take part in a tree-planting project
to help pay off their obligations, said Arthon Petcharatana, the
bank's director of public relations.
	   Each will officially be paid 160 baht (dlrs 4) per day, but will
receive only 60 baht (dlrs 1.50) because the other 100 baht (2.50
dlrs) will go toward their debts, Arthon said.
	   A pilot project, to be inaugurated Aug. 29, will be carried out
in three northeastern selected districts. Each is prepared to
handle about 90 cases, Arthon said. Applications are still being
made.
	   Other government agencies will be asked to participate in the
project as it expands to the next phase.
	   The measure is an attempt to address the plight of the country's
poor farmers amid one of the worst economic crises in decades, said
Arthon.
	   The state-run bank lends to individual farmers whose main source
of income comes from selling crops grown on their own land. About
20 percent of its 4.8 million customers are behind payments, Arthon
said.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strengthening Japanese yen and an overnight rally
on Wall Street helped power a rebound in the Tokyo stock market
into a second day on Wednesday, with the key index gaining nearly
2.3 percent.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 342.55
points, or 2.27 percent, to 15,406.34 at the end afternoon trading.
On Tuesday, the average rose 269.13 points, or 1.82 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section picked up 16.99 points, or 1.46 percent, to close at
1,183.71. The TOPIX rose 14.69 points, or 1.3 percent, the previous
day.
	   The two-day surge came after a string of tumbles in Tokyo stocks
triggered in part by fears the government may not move quickly
enough to stimulate Japan's stagnant economy.
	   Traders said the rise may simply be a sign of how far the market
had fallen until Monday.
	   ``The market was technically oversold,'' said Dhia Amir, senior
institutional sales trader at Nomura Securities.
	   One factor behind the recovery was the performance of stocks on
New York's Wall Street on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
gained 139.80 points to close at 8,714.65.
	   Turnover on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 384 million shares, up slightly from 324.76 million
shares Tuesday. Advancers beat retreaters 858 to 263, while 147
issues were unchanged.
	   There was some concern, however, that natural investor interest
is not there, said Stephen Wood, a senior salesman at ING Baring
Securities.
	   ``I think there is still a lot of bad news over the next few
weeks'' as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party battles with the
political opposition in parliament over its bank reform bills, he
said.
	   Traders said the market has room to climb higher following its
recent sharp falls, but that it will likely run into heavy selling
around the 15,500-point level.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.195 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.155 yen, pushing its price down to 111.77 yen
from 112.07 yen.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, slipped against the yen on growing
concern over possible government intervention in the market to
support the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar was at 144.16 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.62 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also weaker than its late
New York rate of 145.00 yen. The dollar hit a high of 145.03 yen
and a low of 143.95 yen during the day's trading.
	   The dollar weakened overnight in New York as rumors flew that
Asian central banks were selling U.S. Treasury bills to raise cash
as a possible prelude to an attempt to bolster the yen.
	   The U.S. currency's slide accelerated in Tokyo after the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Wednesday that monetary
authorities may act soon to prop up the yen.
	   ``For investors, the risk of a strong yen is getting higher.
They should be careful. The opportunity for yen-supportive
intervention is getting near,'' Sakakibara said.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, three wounded

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday, less than two
hours after an Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded
in a guerrilla attack, security officials said.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
of Mlita, a village in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a Hezbollah
stronghold just across from an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
the south, the Lebanese officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (1.8 miles) further north from the village of Rihan
where an Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded in a
guerrilla ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   It was not known whether there were any casualties from the
10:30 a.m. (0730GMT) raid, the second in south Lebanon in three
days.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah antiaircraft guns fired at the
raiding jets, but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israeli military officials reported their planes struck at south
Lebanon but made no mention of casualties in the preceding
guerrilla attack.
	   The air raid came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an armored
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, killing a soldier and wounding
three others, the security officials said.
	   They said the guerrillas fired anti-tank Sagger missiles and set
off a roadside bomb as the patrol passed near Rihan, about 10
kilometers (6 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied border enclave.
	   An Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded in the 9
a.m. (0600GMT) attack, the Lebanese officials said. They added that
an Israeli helicopter was seen evacuating casualties from the
scene.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired Sagger missiles and
detonated a ``powerful bomb'' near the Israeli patrol, killing a
soldier and wounding three others.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands facing the
occupied zone, the officials said. No casualties were reported from
the shelling.
	   On Monday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is used by Hezbollah as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied militiamen. No
casualties were reported in the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

11 children fall sick after eating at McDonald's in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Eleven children suffered food poisoning after
eating at a McDonald's restaurant in Singapore, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Seven girls and four boys from a local primary school complained
of stomach pain and vomiting Tuesday about an hour after a meal of
burgers and french fries at the restaurant, The Straits Times said.
	   The children were among a group of 130 students from Singapore's
Khen Cheng Primary School who had lunch at the McDonald's, after a
trip to Singapore's East Coast Park, the report said.
	   The eleven were taken to a hospital, and released to home care
several hours later, it said.
	   McDonald's director of operations, Davy Wee, said the company is
investigating this ``isolated incident,'' The Straits Times said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Acting on information from a suspect in
the U.S. Embassy bombing, investigators raided a Nairobi hotel
where the explosive was believed to have been made, a Kenyan
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Daily Nation said the raid was carried out Tuesday morning
by 15 FBI agents and six Kenyan detectives wearing bulletproof
vests who carried away several boxes.
	   Meanwhile, a Pakistani newspaper reported Wednesday that the
suspect held in Nairobi gave a detailed account of worldwide
anti-American operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group
based in Afghanistan.
	   Kenyan police and U.S. authorities declined comment on the
latest reported developments.
	   If true, the two reports signify a major breakthrough in the
investigation into the Aug. 7 bombings that killed 257 people at
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   In Pakistan, a border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were
detained at the Afghan border and were being questioned about the
bombings. The men were stopped Saturday, said Bakhtiar Khan, chief
of the Pakistani border post near the northern city of Peshwar.
	   The New York Times also reported Wednesday that a Saudi and a
Sudanese were arrested at the Afghan border. The newspaper said
Odeh had named the men as accomplices.
	   The Nairobi newspaper report said a bomb consisting of 800
kilograms of TNT was assembled over a period of several days in
rooms 102 and 107 of the hotel, the paper said, citing unidentified
sources. It reported that the raid occurred at the Hill Top Hotel,
which was not listed in the Nairobi telephone directory.
	   However, a man who answered the telephone at the Hilltop Lodge
and identified himself as the night clerk, Omar Jana, told The
Associated Press on Wednesday that agents had stormed that site the
day before.
	   Jana said police arrested manager James Nganga and took the
hotel's guest register.
	   The agents were acting on information provided by Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested Aug. 7 in Pakistan and returned Aug.
14 to Kenyan authorities investigating the cause of the Aug. 7
blast, according to the paper. The bomb, at a busy intersection in
downtown Nairobi, killed 247 people, among them 12 Americans.
	   The newspaper report was the first word of the raid. FBI, Kenyan
and Tanzanian police were remaining largely mum on the progress of
their investigation into the nearly simultaneous bombings in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   ``I know nothing about it,'' embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   Frank Scafidi, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said he could not
confirm the newspaper's report. ``It's entirely possible, I just
don't know. I don't have anything now,'' he said.
	   The report said the two hotel rooms reportedly were occupied
from Aug. 3-7 by four foreigners involved in the bombing _ two
Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi Arabian. On the day of the
bombing, they were said to have completed the final assembly in a
pick-up truck and driven the bomb across the city to the U.S.
embassy downtown.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said Odeh was the
chief assembler of the bomb, and flew out of Naoribi Aug. 6 after
ensuring that the final preparation were in place. It said he is
believed to have had five accomplices, three of whom died in the
bombing, with the other two still at large.
	   In Islamabad, The News said Odeh, during a week of questioning
by Pakistani intelligence officials before he was handed over to
Kenya last Friday, revealed that he is a member of a secretive
guerrilla group led by Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who is in
hiding in Afghanistan.
	   Odeh claimed the group has carried out successful operations
against U.S. interests in countries including Somalia, Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan, the newspaper said.
	   Odeh, identified as a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer,
reportedly claimed to be an expert at handling shoulder-fired U.S.
Stinger missiles. The United States supplied such missiles and to
Afghan forces fighting a Soviet invasion in their country in the
1980s, and bin Laden was among the foreigners who fought alongside
Afghans.
	   Odeh, according to The News report, said bin Laden sent him and
others to Somalia to fight U.S. peacekeepers sent there, and they
used Stingers to shoot down U.S. military.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who flew back to
Washington after stops in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi on a whirlwind
trip to show U.S. support, has expressed satisfaction with the
investigative work done so far, but she said she didn't expect
answers overnight.
	   ``The investigation, I think, is proceeding fairly well, thanks
to a good degree of cooperation by Kenya and Tanzania,'' she said
in Nairobi.
	   Kenyans said a mournful goodbye Tuesday to Rose Wanjiku Mwangi,
36, who struggled for life in vain under the bombed-out rubble of
the U.S. Embassy while the world watched and waited for five days.
	   As Rose was being mourned and buried, Albright toured the rubble
of the two bombed-out embassy sites. She pledged to seek emergency
funding from Congress next month to pay for re-establishing embassy
operations in Tanzania and Kenya and to compensate families that
``suffered irreparable harm.''

U.S. delegation: famine kills up to 2 million in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two million North Koreans _ nearly 10 percent of
the population _ may have died during three years of a continuing
famine in North Korea, aides to U.S. Congress members said
Wednesday.
	   Video footage brought back from the secretive communist country
by the congressional staff delegation showed sickly, emaciated
children, some with stick-thin bodies.
	   One young child too weak to sit up had to be propped up in the
corner of a room in an orphanage. Older children filmed during the
delegation's week-long visit appeared severely stunted by long-term
malnutrition.
	   To make it through the persisting food shortages, North Koreans
are eating weeds, grasses and corn stalks that are mashed into
powder and sometimes mixed with flour to make noodles or cakes.
	   The delegation brought back dark brown, musty smelling sticks of
these ``alternative foods'' that had the appearance of bits of old
leather.
	   ``The food shortage continues,'' said Mark Kirk, one of the
bipartisan delegation's four members and counsel to the House
International Relations Committee's Republican majority. ``They are
out of food. That's clear.''
	   Over the past three years, the famine has killed an estimated
300,000 to 800,000 people annually, with the number of deaths
peaking in 1997, apparently the famine's worst year, Kirk said. He
said the figures came from U.S. government sources, refugees and
North Korean exiles.
	   ``Two million would be the highest possible estimate,'' Kirk
said. He added that while the figure is ``probably not that high,
it's within the realm.''
	   Deaths were most likely fromid.
	   Foreign food aid is clearly saving lives, and the international
community is feeding nearly every child under the age of seven, the
delegation said. Death rates are highest among people not covered
by aid programs, including children over six and the elderly, it
said.
	   The United States _ which fought North Korea in the 1950-53
Korean War and remains a staunch supporter of capitalist South
Korea _ is now the communist country's largest donor, contributing
some 200 million metric tons (220 million tons) of food aid.
	   In an apparent bid for more U.S. aid, North Korean officials
told the delegation they would stop exporting missiles if
compensated for lost earnings. House International Relations
Committee staff member Peter Brookes said they mentioned a figure
of U.S. dlrs 500 million a year.
	   Kirk said the offer came from Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan, who also heads North Korea's delegation in four-way talks
with China, the United States and South Korea.
	   This year's crops look better than last year's, but North Korea
will still lack food after the harvest, the delegation said. Nor
has the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il implemented
any significant reforms to reverse the country's economic decline,
it said
	   Preparations for Kim's expected presidential inauguration on
September 9 were almost ``constant,'' said Brookes.
	   He said they saw children at 11 o'clock one night who were still
practising ceremonies for the inauguration.

Algerian, Moroccan leaders reportedly meet in bid to end rift
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The prime ministers of Algeria and
Morocco met secretly in western Algeria this week, a newspaper
reported Wednesday, indicating a possible thaw in relations after
years of tension.
	   Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and his Moroccan
counterpart Abderrahmane Youssoufi held their first meeting in the
town of Bousfer near the port of Oran on Tuesday, the independent
Algiers daily El Watan reported.
	   The newspaper cited a ``reliable source'' and said Oran airport
officials confirmed the Algerian prime minister had flown there
this week.
	   There was no confirmation from either Algerian or Moroccan
authorities.
	   The report follows recent calls by Moroccan officials for
improved relations with Algeria that have been cool since 1994. In
that year, Morocco imposed visa requirements on Algerians and
Algiers retaliated by closing their common border.
	   The two countries fought in 1976 over the Western Sahara and
have accused each other of supporting Muslim militants in each
other's countries.
	   But officials have increasingly expressed a willingness to
cooperate in suppressing militant movements with links in both
Morocco and Algeria.
	   Authorities in Europe have said they found evidence in recent
months of a Moroccan Armed Islamic Group. Algeria's Armed Islamic
Group, or GIA, has claimed or been linked to massacres and bombings
in a 6 1/2-year-old insurgency.
	   Morocco has long criticized Algeria for hosting the Western
Sahara's Polisario independence movement in the western city of
Tindouf. Plans for a referendum in the territory, signed last year
in Houston, Texas, held out the prospect of resolving the issue.
	   Morocco claims the Western Sahara, rich in phosphates, minerals
and fishing rights, as its own. About the size of Utah, the
territory would increase Morocco's size by 45 percent.

Two children killed in war-era bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two 13-year-old children were killed while
playing with bombs that that had been dug up from a dried-up river
in central Vietnam, local police said Wednesday.
	   Police said the explosion occurred last week in Quang Binh
province after the children found the bombs in dirt that villagers
dredged from the Kien Giang river, which has dried up during an
ongoing drought.
	   Villagers have found several dozen bombs in the river bed,
police said.
	   Quang Binh was fiercely bombed by airplanes and shelled by
artillery from warships during the Vietnam War to prevent resupply
of North Vietnamese troops fighting in the south.

Elderly Dutch prince undergoes successful eye surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Bernhard, the father of
Dutch Queen Beatrix, has undergone successful surgery to repair a
partially detached retina in his left eye.
	   ``The prince came through the surgery well and has already
returned to Soestdijk Palace,'' a brief Royal House statement said
Tuesday.
	   The surgery was performed Tuesday at the Academic Hospital in
the central Dutch city of Utrecht. Bernhard returned home the same
day. Dutch media reported Wednesday that the prince suffered vision
problems while on vacation and returned to the Netherlands for the
surgery.
	   Bernhard, 87, the husband of former Queen Juliana, remains in
generally good health despite surgery last year on an enlarged
prostate.

Unknown illness claims five lives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A mysterious illness that kills within
four to 12 hours of the first symptoms has claimed five lives in
the central province of Nghe An, a local official said Wednesday.
	   Hoang Xuan Loc, chief of Nghi Quang village, said four people
between the ages of 51 and 73 died Friday of the same symptoms.
Another victim died Saturday. No other fatalities have been
reported since then.
	   All suffered from serious headaches, chest pains and
disorientation and vomited clear fluid, Loc said. None had a fever.
	   Provincial and district health workers have been sent to the
village to investigate the illness but have been unable to find the
cause, he said.
	   On Saturday, 42 villagers who suffered from slight headaches
showed up at the village clinic, fearing they had the same illness,
Loc said. They all returned home after being given some medicine.
	   The local government advised villagers through loudspeakers to
take antibiotic pills as a precaution.
	   Nghe An is among three central provinces that have been hardest
hit by an on-going drought. Most of Nghi Quang's villagers are
fishermen.

Syrian, Iraqi oil ministers hold talks on pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Syrian and Iraqi oil ministers held
talks on cooperation and the reopening of an oil pipeline for Iraqi
petroleum that was closed 16 years ago.
	   Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid said Wednesday's meeting
was a follow-up to one at which the reopening of the pipeline was
decided. But when asked if a decision was made on when to begin its
operation, he said ``not yet.''
	   He spoke briefly to reporters following a nearly two-hour
meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The two sides agreed to reopen the pipeline linking Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria
and Tripoli in Lebanon during a July meeting in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Jamal's visit is the first by a Syrian
oil minister since relations were cut at the beginning of the
1980-88 war.
	   The Syrian-Iraqi pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000
barrels a day. Rashid has said the pipeline would first pump
300,000 a day on an experimental basis.
	   The two sides also are discussing opening a second oil pipeline,
with a capacity of 1.4 million barrels daily, and an oil refinery.
	   Permission from the United Nations would be required before
either pipeline can be operated. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions
that prevent free exports of its oil since the 1990 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.
	   In February, the U.N. Security Council decided to allow Iraq to
increase the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from
dlrs 2 billion within six months to dlrs 5.2 billions. The
oil-for-food deal is an exemption to the U.N. sanctions.

Japanese economy officials say little chance of deflation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese economic officials on Wednesday
downplayed fears that the recession-bound country was headed
towards a devastating round of deflation.
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said prices may drop, but the trend was not out of control.
	   ``I can't say there is no risk at all of deflation, but the
economy isn't in a deflationary spiral now,'' he told Parliament.
	   Some economists fear that stagnant consumption in Japan could
lead to price slashing. That in turn could reduce production, bring
layoffs and further depress consumption in a dangerous cycle.
	   Also speaking in Parliament, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru
Hayami also said that the Japanese economy will likely avoid
falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   ``As the impact of the government economic package begins to be
felt, ... the risk of a deflationary spiral will likely be
avoided,'' Hayami said, referring to proposed tax-cuts and spending
measures aimed at spurring consumption.
	   Sakaiya also said the government should not prop up stock and
land prices.
	   ``It's undesirable, considering the working of the free market
economy, to intentionally and as a matter of policy cause land and
stock prices to rise,'' he said.

Japanese opposition figure says flexible on financial bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A top official of Japan's largest opposition party
offered Wednesday to be flexible on crucial financial reform
legislation _ but only if the ruling party makes concessions first.
	   Yukio Hatoyama, deputy secretary general of the Democratic Party
of Japan, urged the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to be more
aggressive on financial system restructuring.
	   In a luncheon speech, Hatoyama called for deeper disclosure of
bank finances and penalizing managers of failed financial
institutions for missteps.
	   ``When and if the government shows flexibility in adopting all
of the above in principle, I believe the DPJ will adopt a flexible
response,'' Hatoyama said.
	   Parliament is now considering a package of bills proposed by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government aimed at cleaning up
Japan's massive bad loan problem.
	   The opposition, however, has threatened to block the measures
unless they are strengthened.
	   Hatoyama said that the government did not seem to be headed for
stronger measures to clear up the banking mess, pointing to
comments by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that he would not
allow any of Japan's top 19 banks to fail.
	   ``It is clear that the LDP, the Finance Ministry and banks
continue to maintain their secretive system,'' Hatoyama said.
	   Debate on the six financial bills being discussed in parliament
has been rancorous in recent days, as the opposition party has
stuck by its stance that the bills don't go far enough.
	   At the center of the government's banking plan is a ``bridge
bank'' proposal to allow the government to use public funds to take
over failed banks and keep them lending to healthy corporate
customers for up to five years while buyers for the institutions
were sought.
	   The opposition's plan is similar, but the Democratic Party says
it would be faster and more aggressive in closing insolvent banks.
Hatoyama offered the DPJ's plan of temporarily nationalizing failed
banks as a more stable alternative to the government's proposal.

McDonald head of 10-nation league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian John McDonald was Wednesday
elected head of a new 10-nation governing body for rugby league, a
sport recovering from a split forced by media magnate Rupert
Murdoch.
	   The Rugby League International Federation reunites the sport
which was split by Murdoch's Super League and replaces the
breakaway body's international board.
	   McDonald said he was proud to be elected chairman.
	   ``International rugby league is the lifeblood of the sport and
we can now go forward and develop a positive international program
for the future,'' McDonald said.
	   Britain's Maurice Lindsay, chairman of the Super League board,
also missed out on the deputy position behind McDonald, losing a
vote to fellow Briton Sir Rodney Walker. Walker had a strained
relationship with Lindsay.
	   ``I have agreed to stand as vice-chairman for the first year and
I am delighted to do so,'' Walker said Wednesday.
	   The ten countries forming the RLIF are: Australia, New Zealand,
Great Britain, France, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Western
Samoa, Fiji, Cook Islands and Tonga. Each nation will have one
vote.

Annan's envoy says U.N.-Iraq dispute not yet at crisis point

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ United Nations envoy Prakash Shah left
Baghdad on Wednesday, saying Iraq-U.N. relations had not reached a
crisis despite his failure to convince the government to allow
resumption of U.N. arms inspections.
	   Shah, the special envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
went to Habbaniya air base outside the capital where he later left
on a flight to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus en route to New
York.
	   He is due to brief Annan on Thursday on his talks with Iraq's
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   His departure came a day after he announced he had failed to
convince Iraqi officials to back down from the cut-off of relations
with the inspectors assigned to find Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, in effect blocking inspections.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah told reporters
Tuesday.
	   Iraq announced in early August would refuse cooperation with the
inspectors, saying they were not really working toward the lifting
of U.N. sanctions on Iraq that prevent the free export of oil, its
most valuable commodity.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the inspectors must declare Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weapons before the sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be canceled.
	   Before leaving Wednesday, Shah said he still hoped a solution
could be found to allow resumption of arms inspections.
	   ``I will not say it is a crisis,'' he said. ``I still think that
a lot of discussion, negotiations and bilateral talks can take
place.
	   ``I think and I hope that the Security Council and Iraq would be
able to work this out,'' Shah said as he left the headquarters of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the weapons inspections.
	   Shah described his talks with Aziz as ``friendly and cordial''
and said he was ready to return for further negotiations with the
Iraqis.
	   ``I will be going to New York, and if the council wishes further
discussions, I will be prepared,'' he said.
	   Shah arrived last Thursday with a letter from Annan to Aziz
about the latest stand-off.
	   After Iraq cut off relations with the inspectors, denying them
the Iraqi escorts necessary for inspections, the U.N. Security
Council declared the move unacceptable.
	   On Tuesday, the council sent letters to the U.N. agencies in
charge of arms and nuclear inspections backing their mandates to
carry out their work but giving no guidance on how to deal with
Iraq's defiance.
	   When asked why the council hadn't threatened Iraq with
ultimatums, such as threats of military action, the council
president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said the time wasn't right for
that strong a message.
	   ``I don't think that anyone in the council has suggested that we
have reached a point at which consideration of severest
consequences would be necessary,'' he said.

Pinto, the wine maker and drinker, finally wins gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials saying Bagach was within rules &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Antonio Pinto's formula for a
successful track career: draw your strength from some home-grown
wine.
	   It may not be everyone's winning equation, but it seems to work
for the small man from northern Portugal.
	   Pinto, 32, who owns a vineyard and says he drinks 4-5 bottles a
wine every week, added a gold medal that has been missing in his
career when he won the men's 10,000 meters on the opening day of
the European Championship on Tuesday.
	   Twice a winner of the London Marathon, Pinto was lacking a major
championship title.
	   ``I didn't want to end my career without a medal of some kind,''
Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.
	   He finally earned it with clever race tactics. Pinto settled
into the slow early pace. With about six laps left in the race,
Pinto and the two Germans, Dieter Baumann and Stephane Franke,
moved ahead of the field,
	   With about 4 1/2 laps left, Pinto switched into a higher gear
and easily left the Germans behind to win in 27 minutes, 48.62
seconds.
	   Baumann, a former Olympic 5,000 champion, ended up with the
silver in 27:56.75, Franke took the bronze in 27:59.90.
	   Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine won the gold medal in the men's shot
put _ but he wasn't sure he would actually collect it.
	   Bagach said the judges had accused him of putting weights in his
socks to make himself more stable. ``That's at least what they are
saying,'' said Bagach, who is no stranger to controversy.
	   But competition officials issued a statement Wednesday saying
the weighted ankle attachments worn by Bagach were within the
rules.
	   Bagach was stripped of the gold medal at the World Championship
in Athens last year after testing positive for the stimulant
ephedrine. He was also disqualified for drug use as far back as
1989.
	   Bagach's winning distance was 21.17 meters.
	   Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany won the silver at 20.98, while the
bronze went to another Ukrainian, Yuriy Belonog, at 20.92.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday had six on the schedule: the women's javelin,
men's long jump, hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and
the women's 10,000.
	   Three British sprinters led the field into the men's 100
semifinals. Dwain Chambers and Darren Campbell both won their heats
in 10.26 seconds, while Marlon Devonish won his in 10.28.
	   Geir Moen of Norway also advanced, along with Charalambos
Papadias of Greece, winner of the last heat in 10.31.
	   In the women's 100-meter qualifying, reigning champion Irina
Privalova of Russia, back after a serious hamstring injury, won her
heat in 11.22 seconds to advance.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece qualified with the fastest time,
11.04, while Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine, the world 200 champion,
clocked 11.06.
	   Kiril Sosunov of Russia led the field in the men's long jump
qualifying with a leap of 8.14.
	   The women's javelin should see a battle of two Finnish stars,
Olympic champion Heli Rantanen and world champion Trine Hattestad.
	   The men's hammer throw is likely to be a hit with the fans, with
three Hungarians in the running for the gold.

Viagra bust: Alpine restaurant raided for contraband sauce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Viagra hasn't been approved in France yet, but a
restaurant in the Alps thought it found a way to get around the
law. The secret was in the sauce.
	   The secret didn't last long. Inspectors from the French Bureau
of Competition and Repression of Fraud descended on the restaurant
in Thonon-les-Bains on Tuesday and seized their supply of the new
virility drug bought in Switzerland.
	   ``I don't feel like a criminal,'' said Jean-Louis Galland, the
chef at the Hotel de la Restauration, who mixed the
impotence-fighting drug in a fig vinegar sauce.
	   Galland said he may find another way to carry on with his
impotence-fighting cuisine.
	   ``We have a doctor from another country who contacted us because
he had a natural product that poses no heart risk and is like
Viagra,'' he told Europe 1 radio. ``So we'll let people know if we
use it as a replacement for Viagra.''

U.S. diplomats vow to try to get Kosovo sides together

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Albanian government is asking
for an urgent meeting with Yugoslav authorities after Serb mortars
exploded across the border from rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The shelling, which the Albanians said lasted for two hours
Tuesday, prompted local officials on the Albanian side of the
frontier to evacuate children and the elderly from border
communities.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, an interior ministry official
told The Associated Press that the government was asking for an
urgent meeting of a joint Yugoslav-Albanian border commission to
discuss security but no reply had been received.
	   The official said 15 mortars exploded about 1.5 kilometers
(nearly a mile) inside Albanian territory. There were no
casualties, he said.
	   But the incident fueled fears that the conflict in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence, could spread
throughout the southern Balkans.
	   About 1,700 troops from the United States and 13 other countries
are conducting a military exercise in the Albanian capital to
demonstrate NATO's commitment to containing the Kosovo crisis.
	   On the diplomatic front, U.S. envoys are pressing efforts to
arrange direct talks between the Serb government and a Kosovo
Albanian delegation formed last week to bring the conflict to an
end and chart the future of the province, which is part of Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   On Tuesday, the Kosovo Albanians spurned an offer by the Serbs
to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must cease and tens
of thousands of Albanian civilians must be allowed to return to
their homes.
	   The European Union's human rights commissioner, Emma Bonino, was
touring refugee areas of Kosovo on Wednesday for a first-hand
assessment of the crisis.
	   On Tuesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been
meeting with Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders, reiterated that
neither side should count on achieving anything by force and should
keep working at negotiations.
	   ``The process has just begun. We have a long way to go, but it
has begun,'' he said.
	   Complicating the diplomacy is the fact that the leading ethnic
Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, faces opposition within the
Albanian community because of his pacifist tactics for resolving
the crisis.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has rejected Rugova's
leadership in favor of hardliner Adem Demaci.

Regional leaders to back Kabila, some with troops and arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL HARTNACK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Four southern African countries have
declared their support for Congo President Laurent Kabila, with
Zimbabwe's defense minister announcing Wednesday that his country
would send troops to the war-torn country.
	   Top officials from Namibia, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe said
Tuesday after meeting in Harere that they would help defend
Kabila's government against a rebel insurrection that Kabila claims
is backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``There is preparedness ... in this region to give the support
in whatever manner that is within our capabilities and this should
be done soonest,'' President Robert Mugabe said at a press
conference late Tuesday.
	   In recent weeks, Kabila has been traipsing from Cuba to southern
Congo to Angola looking for friends to help hold off the rebels _
an army of his former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disaffected members of the president's own military.
	   Speaking in a local radio interview Wednesday morning,
Zimbabwe's Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said it had become clear
that Congo had been invaded.
	   ``It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both materiel and manpower, is given to
(Congo) in order to restore peace and stability,'' Mahachi said. He
offered no other details.
	   ``We are convinced that the rebel force is supported from Uganda
and Rwanda,'' Mahachi said.
	   Rwanda and neighboring Uganda, which together helped Kabila oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year, both have
denied involvement in the latest rebellion.
	   It was not known what support Angola, locked in its own
burgeoning civil war, and Zambia planned to offer Kabila.
	   On Tuesday, Namibia's largest daily reported that Namibian
defense troops loaded 21 tons of arms and ammunition into two
Boeing aircraft bearing registration marks of an Angolan air
charter outfit.
	   At least one of the planes took off for Lubumbashi, a Kabila
stronghold in Congo, Die Republikein reported.
	   At a summit meeting Aug. 8 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, regional
presidents _ including those from Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania _
agreed to keep the conflict in Congo from spreading and said they
would not take sides.
	   South Africa, which opposes regional military involvement in
Congo, sent a representative to Tuesday's meeting, while its
defense and foreign ministers traveled to the Great Lakes region on
Tuesday to try to forge a political solution in the Congo war.
	   South Africa's foreign affairs spokesman Andre de Munnik said
Wednesday his government had no immediate comment on Zimbabwe's
plans to send troops.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said Tuesday that South
Africa would oppose Kabila's request for aid and military
assistance from the region.
	   Zimbabwe's decision to dispatch troops surprised diplomatic
observers in Harare, who said they expected leaders to wait until a
group of foreign ministers returned from their mission to verify
Kabila's assertion that Rwanda and Uganda were backing the rebels.
	   Zimbabwe has already sent military advisers to help Kabila over
the past weeks.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two men armed with a meat cleaver attacked a
fiery talk show host outside a radio station just before his
morning broadcast Wednesday, leaving him in serious condition with
deep cuts in his arms, legs and back.
	   Legislators _ often targets of Albert Cheng on his shows _
condemned the attack, and some said they believed it was triggered
by his commentaries.
	   ``This is a challenge to ... our freedom and the rule of law,''
James To, chairman of the legislature's security panel, told
Commercial Radio where Cheng worked.
	   The Hong Kong Journalists Association said that if Cheng was
attacked for his outspoken commentaries, it was a direct challenge
to freedom of speech.
	   The men, one carrying the cleaver, ambushed the flamboyant
52-year-old broadcaster as he walked from a carpark to the radio
station, said a police spokeswoman on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police said the assailants, both in their 30s, remained at
large. Although Cheng has alienated many people on his shows,
police said the motive of the attack was not immediately known.
	   A police unit that specializes in fighting organized crime is
investigating the case, but a spokeswoman refused to comment on
whether the case was related to triads, or Chinese gangs.
	   Cania Wong, a hospital spokeswoman, said Cheng was in serious
condition after eight hours of surgery to reconnect some muscle,
bone and nerve tissues. He sustained six cuts, Wong said.
	   Legislator Martin Lee, Cheng's friend and chairman of the
territory's largest party, the Democrats, said on official radio
the attack ``was a very shameful and cowardly act.''
	   Cheng is especially popular among blue-collar workers, many of
whom enjoy venting their anger at the government on air. Time
Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the
territory last year.
	   Lam Yuk-wah, who co-hosts the morning show, said he would keep
the program's style and format, but refused to speculate on the
motive for the assault.
	   Commercial Radio said in a statement it was shocked and angry at
the incident, and strongly condemned the violence. It also reported
that Shelley Lau, the territory's director of home affairs, visited
Cheng and said such violence would not be tolerated.
	   Famous for his liberal stance and outrageous attacks on
officials and government policies, Cheng hosts a popular morning
talk show, Teacup in a Storm, on weekdays on Commercial Radio. He
also hosted several TV programs.
	   Cheng recently lost a libel suit to another former radio talk
show host on a rival station. Earlier this year, he was embroiled
in a controversy with the manpower secretary, who demanded an
apology from a TV station for remarks Cheng made about him and his
policies.
	   ``Cheng always has his unique personal viewpoints,'' said Ann
Chow, a spokesman for Asia Television. ``He listens to the common
people's voices.''
	   He charged in an address to foreign reporters earlier this year
that the government was clamping down on the media, and said
government officials had become reluctant to appear on his
programs.
	   Several photojournalists have been attacked on assignment
recently, but violence against the media is not common here.
	   In 1996, a controversial magazine publisher had an arm hacked
off by assailants in his office. The case has not been solved, but
speculation focused on Chinese gangs, possibly trying to prevent
articles on their activities from appearing in the magazine.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ British Airways will issue hooligan
passengers soccer-style yellow warning cards to combat ``air
rage,'' the airline said Wednesday.
	   The notices warning offenders they face arrest on touchdown
unless they cease their disruptive behavior will be issued from
Sept. 1.
	   British Airways said the crackdown, triggered by a 400 percent
rise in air rage incidents in the past three years, was aimed at
drunk and abusive passengers and passengers breaking the worldwide
smoking ban on flights.
	   The notices would also warn recipients they would be liable for
costs if their behavior forced the captain to divert to the nearest
airport.
	   ``We hope the yellow card system will prove the ultimate
deterrent which, if ignored, can be used in court to ensure a
successful prosecution,'' British Airways's director of safety,
security and environment, David Hyde, said in a statement.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national car
distributor is trying to export car parts to Europe and North
America, the company's managing director said Wednesday.
	   ``We have already submitted quotations to the Rover and Lotus
groups, both renowned UK-based firms,'' said Edaran Otomobil
National's managing director, Adzmi Abdul Wahab, in an interview
with the national news agency, Bernama.
	   EON is the distributor for all models of the Malaysian national
car, Proton. More than half the cars sold in Malaysia each year are
Protons.
	   Lower Proton sales in the last one year because of the economic
crisis have forced the car maker to lower production, creating huge
inventories of car parts.
	   ``Previously, due to the high demand for Proton cars, the
components were needed at home but with the lower demand now in
view of the economic crisis, the components can be exported,''
Adzmi was quoted as saying.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia will open two rice import
tenders as the country struggles to meet demand in the wake of a
recent drought, the government said Wednesday.
	   Food Minister Saefuddin said the state food distribution
organization, Bulog, would open a tender on Aug. 26 for the
importation of 600,000 tons.
	   Another 600,000-ton tender would be offered in September, he
said.
	   Until recently, Indonesia had prided itself on being
self-sufficient in rice production.
	   However, the minister said it would have to import a total of
3.1 million tons by the end of the current fiscal year on March 31,
1999.
	   He said 1 million tons had already been imported.
	   More would be brought in under aid deals with various donor
countries and organizations as well as soft loan arrangements with
Japan and Taiwan.
	   About 100,000 tons would be imported from Vietnam and Indonesia
is now negotiating with Thailand for a shipment of another 500,000
tons.
	   Rice production is down this year thanks to a crippling drought
blamed by on the El Nino weather phenomenon.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The national labor movement plans to set up a
savings and loan cooperative to help workers borrow cash if they
fall short during the economic crisis, it was reported Wednesday.
	   The National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore Labor
Foundation have raised almost 15 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
8.5 million) for the new NTUC Thrift, according to a report in The
Straits Times.
	   Rates will probably be in line with those offered by savings and
loan agencies based in workplaces, said Chng Hee Kok, director of
NTUC Thrift. After saving for a period of time, members will be
allowed to borrow according to their ability to repay, he said.
	   No start-up date was given.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese economic officials on Wednesday
downplayed fears that the recession-bound country was headed
towards a devastating round of deflation.
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said prices may drop, but the trend was not out of control.
	   ``I can't say there is no risk at all of deflation, but the
economy isn't in a deflationary spiral now,'' he told Parliament.
	   Some economists fear that stagnant consumption in Japan could
lead to price slashing. That in turn could reduce production, bring
layoffs and further depress consumption in a dangerous cycle.
	   Also speaking in Parliament, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru
Hayami also said that the Japanese economy will likely avoid
falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   ``As the impact of the government economic package begins to be
felt, ... the risk of a deflationary spiral will likely be
avoided,'' Hayami said, referring to proposed tax-cuts and spending
measures aimed at spurring consumption.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A top official of Japan's largest opposition party
offered Wednesday to be flexible on crucial financial reform
legislation _ but only if the ruling party makes concessions first.
	   Yukio Hatoyama, deputy secretary general of the Democratic Party
of Japan, urged the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to be more
aggressive on financial system restructuring.
	   In a luncheon speech, Hatoyama called for deeper disclosure of
bank finances and penalizing managers of failed financial
institutions for missteps.
	   ``When and if the government shows flexibility in adopting all
of the above in principle, I believe the DPJ will adopt a flexible
response,'' Hatoyama said.
	   Parliament is now considering a package of bills proposed by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government aimed at cleaning up
Japan's massive bad loan problem.
	   The opposition, however, has threatened to block the measures
unless they are strengthened.
	   Hatoyama said that the government did not seem to be headed for
stronger measures to clear up the banking mess, pointing to
comments by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that he would not
allow any of Japan's top 19 banks to fail.
	   ``It is clear that the LDP, the Finance Ministry and banks
continue to maintain their secretive system,'' Hatoyama said.

Newk backs Rafter to win more Slams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ John McEnroe believes Patrick Rafter
has probably won the only Grand Slam of his career, but John
Newcombe is backing his fellow Australian to add a few more to last
year's U.S. Open title.
	   No.3-ranked Rafter has hit top form at the right time, winning
two lead-in events to this month's Open at Flushing Meadows, and
Newcombe believes he has yet to reach his peak and is capable of
taking the world No.1 spot.
	   ``By the end of 1999 you will see him as a pretty complete
player and then he will have his best years in 2000 and 2001,''
Newcombe said Wednesday. ``I am fairly confident I will be proven
right that by the end of 2001 Pat will have three or four grand
slams under his belt and will have spent his share of time at
No.1.''
	   Consecutive ATP Tour Super Nine titles in Montreal and Mason,
Ohio, have made Rafter the top form player approaching the Open. He
has played 10 straight singles matches and will still play in New
Haven and Long Island before the Open, raising the specter of
burnout.
	   ``If he's not tired it's better to play,'' Newcombe said. ``If
he was starting to feel weary then maybe he should think about not
playing (Long Island).''
	   While McEnroe riled Australian fans by suggesting Rafter was a
one slam wonder, Rafter believes he is playing well enough to add
to last year's triumph, listing himself as one of four leading
contenders alongside Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Marcelo Rios.
	   ``Andre is going to be tough. Pete is always going to be
lurking, very dangerous,'' Rafter told Australia reporters in a
telephone conference call Wednesday.
	   ``Rios, you never know, it's hard court and he has not had great
results lately but he's a tough opponent over four or five sets.
	   ``Hopefully I can do well, and then you have really got another
10-15 guys who can really cause a lot of trouble, guys like
(Richard) Krajicek and (Goran) Ivanisevic. Goran looks good to me
and he'd be my dark horse.''
	   Rafter said he was committed to playing both coming tournaments
before making his title defense and did not believe he had peaked
too soon.
	   ``I feel pretty good at the moment,'' Rafter said. ``I don't
think it can ever come too early, I think you have to try and take
it when you can.''

Moody's cuts its credit rating on Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings on the
debt of Japanese automakers Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan
Motor Corp. on Wednesday, citing worries about their weak earnings.
	   The U.S. credit rating agency lowered its long-term debt rating
for Mitsubishi Motors Corp. from ``Baa2'' to ``Baa3,'' one step
above ``speculative grade.''
	   The downgrade coincided with a sharp decline in Mitsubishi
Motors' stock _ the shares sank to an all-time low of 288 yen
Wednesday morning before closing the day at 291 yen, unchanged from
Tuesday. The stock has fallen 13 yen, or 4.28 percent, this week.
	   A lower credit rating is associated with a higher risk for the
companies' lenders. The cut would likely raise borrowing costs for
the automakers.
	   Moody's attributed its action to ``mounting difficulties and
pressures'' that Mitsubishi Motors faces ``in its efforts to
restore its long-term profitability.''
	   The carmaker itself predicts it will lose 26 billion yen (dlrs
181 million) in 1999, after it suffered a loss of 102 billion yen
(dlrs 708 million) last year.
	   ``Mitsubishi has experienced difficulties in its overseas
operations and has not kept up with the increased pace of new
product introductions within its home market,'' Moody's said in a
press release.
	   Moody's cut its long-term debt rating for Nissan Motor and its
subsidiaries from to ``Baa3'' from ``Baa1'' in response to ``the
company's weak financial performance in both its Asian and U.S.
operations,'' the company said.
	   The agency said its outlook for Nissan's ratings remained
``negative,'' indicating it may lower the rating again.

Russia keeps tight control on markets following ruble devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government warned Wednesday that it
will exercise tight control over the country's currency, part of an
effort to prevent panic on the streets and financial markets.
	   The Central Bank has sent a telegram to regional branches saying
that any exchange offices whose rates for buying and selling
foreign currency are more than 15 percent apart will face swift
punishment, the Interfax news agency reported. The move is designed
to prevent currency speculation, the report said.
	   The government effectively devalued the ruble on Monday, saying
it would not intervene to buoy the price until it fell to 9.5 to
the dollar.
	   Since then the Central Bank has kept a tight rein on the
currency markets. Trading on the major interbank market was
suspended last week. The smaller MICEX exchange opened for trading
for just 35 minutes Wednesday, with the ruble ending at 6.99 to the
dollar.
	   Reaction on the streets has varied but remained essentially
calm. Depositors for the most part have been unable to make dollar
withdrawals since last week, but lines in banks have remained at
usual length.
	   After plunging earlier this week, a survey of Russian banks by
the daily Kommersant newspaper found that rates have bounced back
somewhat to between 8.5 and 7.5 rubles to the dollar. The paper
said bankers expect the rate to stabilize between 7 and 7.5 rubles
to the dollar.
	   In a reaction to the financial crisis, the government announced
Wednesday that it was postponing the sale of a 5 percent stake in
the state natural gas giant RAO Gazprom _ one of a number of
privatizations designed to raise cash for the government.
	   Igor Shuvalov, acting head of the Federal State Property Fund,
said interest in the Gazprom stake remains ``huge,'' but confusion
on the foreign exchange market hampers the sale.
	   ``In recent days, too much has changed,'' Shuvalov told a news
conference. ``We need some time for the situation to stabilize, but
I hope the (market) conditions will return to the previous stage
within this week.''

Facing crackdown, IRA dissidents `suspend' bombing campaign

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a security crackdown and
widespread public revulsion, the Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for a car-bomb atrocity called a surprise
``suspension'' to their violence Wednesday.
	   The coded statement to the Dublin office of the Irish News, a
Belfast newspaper, came just hours after the ``Real IRA'' claimed
responsibility for Saturday's car bomb in Omagh, which killed 28
and wounded 220. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Northern
Ireland history.
	   ``Please God, let this be genuine,'' said Joe Byrne, the leading
Catholic politician in Omagh, who visited the homes of seven
families grieving lost loved ones, many of whom will be buried
Wednesday.
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the announcement
but said it was ``not enough; too late.''
	   ` `On the day 16 victims are buried, I think it's an insult to
believe words mean anything,'' she said. ``The pain and the grief
don't go away, and I think it is a bit late.''
	   Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
said the suspension is ``of course too late for those killed and
injured in the bomb attack in Omagh, but it is the only correct
response.''
	   ``We may find that at last hope is breaking through, because
those outside the peace process now see the urgent need to become
part of it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks ended sharply higher Wednesday
on continued government intervention and a strong overnight gain on
Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue-chips,
jumped 411.66 points, or 5.7 percent, to close at 7,622.58.
	   The index is up 14 percent since the Hong Kong government on
Friday began snapping up selected blue chips in an effort to keep
share prices up and hold speculators at bay.
	   Analysts said it appeared the government was determined to
punish the speculators.
	   ``To do so, you have to be determined to keep the buy going for
awhile to put further pressure on those players who are still
betting on the (market's) downside,'' said Andrew Fernow of Vickers
Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   Government moves coincided with share prices surging from Tokyo
to Taipei on the back of a sharp rally on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 percent to close at 8,714.65.
	   The Hang Seng index surged more than 7 percent in early trading
on government buying of blue-chip heavyweights such as HSBC
Holdings, Hong Kong Telecommunications and CLP Holdings.
	   Gainers were led by HSBC Holdings which was up 11.50 to close at
167.50; Hutchison Whampoa, which gained 2.40 to close at 38.00; and
China Light, which gained 1.80 to close at 34.70.
	   The day's only loser was Hang Lung Development which was down
0.10 to close at 6.00.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific gained 0.35 to close at
6.10.

Newk backs Rafter to win more Slams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS tournament in fourth graf from Montreal to Toronto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ John McEnroe believes Patrick Rafter
has probably won the only Grand Slam of his career, but John
Newcombe is backing his fellow Australian to add a few more to last
year's U.S. Open title.
	   No.3-ranked Rafter has hit top form at the right time, winning
two lead-in events to this month's Open at Flushing Meadows, and
Newcombe believes he has yet to reach his peak and is capable of
taking the world No.1 spot.
	   ``By the end of 1999 you will see him as a pretty complete
player and then he will have his best years in 2000 and 2001,''
Newcombe said Wednesday. ``I am fairly confident I will be proven
right that by the end of 2001 Pat will have three or four grand
slams under his belt and will have spent his share of time at
No.1.''
	   Consecutive ATP Tour Super Nine titles in Toronto and Mason,
Ohio, have made Rafter the top form player approaching the Open. He
has played 10 straight singles matches and will still play in New
Haven and Long Island before the Open, raising the specter of
burnout.

Officials fear spread of malaria in central Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rash of malaria cases has been recorded in
central Russia and emergency workers fear an epidemic, a news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Nineteen people so far have been registered with malaria in the
Ulyanovsk region, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow. With
hot weather breeding plenty of mosquitoes, conditions are ripe for
the disease to spread, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Some of those infected the disease into the region from the
Central Asian republics of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Health officials disinfected some apartments and have begun a
general mosquito extermination campaign.

Australian named chief of development for ICC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Ross Turner was named
Wednesday to head the International Cricket Council's program to
develop the sport outside of the major cricket powers.
	   Turner, a former Sydney club cricket player, will coordinate the
program aimed at taking cricket to new countries and expanding the
sport's profile.
	   ``There is a need for a development program, if you look at
currently where cricket has spread from its embryonic stages it is
basically a commonwealth map because of the game's origins,''
Turner said.
	   ``The program will take two tacks, firstly to increase
participation levels across the globe and then increase the
standard of play.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Prison officials are conducting mock
executions to train personnel and test equipment ahead of the first
execution in the Philippines since the death penalty was restored
in 1994, officials said Wednesday.
	   Leo Echegaray, an impoverished house painter who was convicted
of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, is expected to be executed
by lethal injection this month.
	   National Penitentiary director Pedro Sistoza said the prison has
staged three trial runs recently in a lethal injection chamber
built last year outside the prison in suburban Muntinlupa, where
Echegaray is detained with more than 600 other death row convicts.
	   On Friday, prison officials will inject the lethal chemicals on
a live animal, he said. He did not say what animal would be used.
	   ``It's all systems go,'' Sistoza said.
	   A lower court convicted Echegaray in 1994, and the Supreme Court
upheld the ruling in 1996.
	   In 1997, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision, saying
Echegaray ``must be permanently prevented'' from repeating his
crime. It later said he could be executed by lethal injection
between Feb. 27 and Aug. 27, 1998.
	   In February this year, however, the Supreme Court stopped a
lower court from fixing a specific date for the execution until it
had ruled on a petition by Echegaray's lawyers questioning the
constitutionality of execution by lethal injection.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty, but a law
that took effect in January 1994 restored it for 11 ``heinous''
crimes including rape, murder and drug trafficking.
	   Opponents of the death penalty say it disadvantages the poor who
can't afford good lawyers to defend them. They also say that the
crime rate has not declined despite the restoration of capital
punishment.
	   Proponents, however, say the penalty has not yet sent its
message to would-be criminals because no one has been executed
under the 1994 law.
	   The Supreme Court automatically reviews death sentences and has
so far approved the execution of 16 convicts.
	   President Joseph Estrada can stop executions by granting
executive clemency or a commutation of the sentence. He has said,
however, that he would not stop the execution of Echegaray because
the crime he committed was not caused by poverty and was the ``act
of an animal.''
	   Estrada added the execution would deter more rapes and other
crimes.

Philippine shares rally, peso stronger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing average for peso

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares staged a strong
technical rally Wednesday, spurred by overnight gains on Wall
Street and stronger Asian currencies.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed 41.42 points, or 3.1 percent, higher at 1364.59,
following a 12.54-point decline Tuesday. The main index was mostly
lower for the past nine sessions, shedding 236.21 points during the
period.
	   ``Wednesday's rally was on technical factors,'' said Ariel Ruiz,
analyst for Angping and Associates Securities Inc. ``Prices are too
low for investors to ignore.''
	   Ruiz, however, warned not to expect Wednesday's rally to be
sustained for the long term, saying volume was thin, an indication
that the rally had no fundamental basis.
	   ``In the short term, investors will continue to closely monitor
regional developments,'' said Ruiz.
	   Total volume of shares traded Wednesday stood at 334 million
shares from the previous day's 234.9 million.
	   Ian Kane, a trader with Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said
bargain-hunting may continue Thursday, enabling the main index to
break its 1366-point resistance level.
	   ``Unless something very negative happens, we expect the main
index to finally head for the 1400-point area in the next session.
But we may see profit-taking afterwards,'' said Kane.
	   Ruiz said uncertainty still dogs regional currency markets.
Particularly worrisome would be movements in the Japanese yen and
the Chinese yuan.
	   Regional currencies were stronger Wednesday in step with the
yen. The dollar was changing hands around 144.24 yen, down from
144.87 yen in late New York trading Tuesday.
	   The Philippine peso closed higher against the dollar Wednesday,
buoyed by the stronger Japanese yen and slack demand for the U.S.
currency, traders said.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 42.845 on the Philippine
Dealing System, down from Tuesday's average of 43.028.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 128.7 million compared with dlrs 113 million
Tuesday.
	   ``Trading was dominated by inter-bank transactions, with banks
keeping their dollar offer rates low following the strengthening of
the yen,'' a trader with a foreign bank said.
	   Traders expect the demand for dollars to pick up in the coming
days, however, as commercial clients are expected to find the
peso-dollar rates increasingly attractive.

US Marines hunker down to guard US compound after terrorist threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ About 120 heavily armed Marines were
hunkered down Wednesday around the U.S. diplomatic compound,
providing what their commander described as ``robust security''
against a possible terrorist attack.
	   The Marines from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit were rushed
to the compound Sunday after American officials learned of a
possible terror attack similar to the embassy bombings that killed
257 people in East Africa.
	   Another 200 Marines from the same unit are taking part in a NATO
exercise designed to show the Alliance's commitment to prevent the
fighting in neighboring Kosovo province from spilling over into
Albania and other countries of the southern Balkans.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said. ``Have we
made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think twice before
tackling it. This is robust security.''
	   U.S. officials have given few details of the threat which
prompted the heightened security. But Helland said his security
measures were designed to prevent a car bomb, similar to the ones
that killed 257 people at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   On Friday, the State Department ordered the evacuation of all
non-essential personnel and family members from Tirana, citing a
possible terror attack. The move followed press reports about the
possible presence in Albania of Islamic extremists.
	   One day before the Africa bombings, an Arabic language newspaper
in London, al-Hayat, published a letter from the ``International
Islamic Front for Jihad'' vowing revenge against the United States
for the arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   In order to prevent a repeat of the East Africa bombings, the
Marines have installed 3-meter (10-foot) iron barricades around the
Rilindja Ridge complex, home to American diplomats in Tirana and
the temporary site of the American embassy.
	   Marines in full battle gear, some armed with machine guns, stand
guard or are hunkered down in makeshift bunkers. Albanian police
and private Embassy security guards stop and search all vehicles
before allowing them to wind down the 500-meter (yard) dirt road to
the main gate.
	   A half dozen, 3 meter (10 foot) square concrete pots, decorated
with red and yellow flowers, stand in the middle of the road.
Guards even inspect military vehicles.
	   In addition, the USS Austin, with 400 additional Marines and 400
sailors, is moored about 16 kilometers (10 miles) offshore. Helland
said he can bring them ashore if he believes reinforcements are
necessary.
	   He said a decision will be taken later on whether to keep the
Marines there after the NATO exercise ends Friday.
	   In a letter Tuesday to Congress, President Clinton said U.S.
authorities had received ``credible information of a possible
attack'' against the Tirana embassy ``similar to the attacks
against our missions'' in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.

Arafat, Peres to mark anniversary of Oslo agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former
Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres are to take part in a ceremony
commemoraring the fifth anniversary of the now-stalled Oslo Middle
East peace process, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will not attend.
	   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen said the
government hopes Netanyahu will send a representative for the
Monday ceremony. U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross also is to take
part.
	   The accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization was finalized the night of Aug. 19-20 1993 after
months of Norwegian-brokered talks that were held in secret. It was
formally signed on the U.S. White House lawn the following month.
	   Although the accord raised hopes for an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the peace process has been deadlocked
since Netanyahu was elected prime minister in 1996.
	   The Palestinians are furious that Netanyanu has continued
expanding settlements on Palestinian territory in the occupied West
Bank, while Netanyahu refuses to pull out of Palestinian areas in
accordance with the Oslo agreement, insisting that the Palestinians
are not serious about stopping terrorism.

Knife-wielding man arrested at offices of TV network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A knife-wielding man was arrested Wednesday after
threatening a guard at a Tokyo television network and demanding to
meet a female broadcaster, police said.
	   The 35-year-old suspect was immediately seized by three other
guards and handed over to police. Nobody was hurt in the incident
that occurred in the first floor lobby of the TV Tokyo
headquarters, said police spokesman Takashi Fujiwara.
	   Fujiwara said the man was a single and unemployed, but declined
to give his name because he may be mentally ill.
	   The suspect told police he was filled with the urge to meet the
announcer while watching her on a television program, Fujiwara
said.
	   Fujiwara said the man first came to the headquarters in the
morning and demanded the meeting, but was rejected. Two hours
later, he returned and started brandishing a 9.5 centimeter (3.8
inches) pocket knife, Fujiwara said.
	   Police arrested the man on charges of violating firearms and
swords control laws, which carries a maximum penalty of three years
in prison. Fujiwara declined to identify the announcer.

Government asks troops to regroup as rebels advance on Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ After launching air strikes against rebel
positions, President Laurent Kabila's appeal for military help has
been answered by nearby Zimbabwe.
	   The government Wednesday began preparing to airdrop paratroopers
behind rebels lines near the western town of Kitona, one day after
bombing the town's airport, Information Minister Didier Mumengi
said in a telephone interview.
	   A key political figure in the rebel movement, denied the
reports.
	   ``They are liars,'' said Bizima Karaha, Congo's former foreign
minister who fled Kinshasa earlier to join the rebellion.
	   The reported attacks come as rebel forces _ a coalition of
ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwanda soldiers and disenchanted members of
Kabila's army _ were moving to take Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150
kilometers (90 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Kitona, near Congo's Atlantic coastline, was one of the first
towns captured by the rebels after they revolted against Kabila
earlier this month. Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of
staging the rebellion and fighting alongside the rebels.
	   Rwandan Tutsi soldiers _ once the core of Kabila's forces _
defected en masse two weeks ago to join the uprising. Rwanda and
Uganda played instrumental roles in helping Kabila topple the
government of longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Relations have since soured and it is widely believed that those
countries are providing some support to the new rebel movement.
	   Both countries and the rebels themselves deny the charges.
	   ``There has been no invasion, what's going on here is that the
Congolese themselves are fighting for their freedom,'' said Arthur
Zahidi Ngoma a leading rebel opposition politician.
	   But a regional commission investigating Kabila's claims is
backing the Congo.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, that country's Defense
Minister Moven Mahachi said on local radio it had become clear that
Congo had been invaded.
	   ``It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both material and manpower, is given to
(Congo) in order to restore peace and stability,'' Mahachi said.
	   Zimbabwe said it will send troops to back Kabila's efforts to
hold off the advancing rebels. Zambia, Namibia and Angola also said
they would support Kabila.
	   ``The countries that met in Harare are aware of the peril of the
Rwandan and Ugandan adventure,'' Congo's Information Minister
Mumengi said.
	   It was not known what support Angola, locked in its own
burgeoning civil war, and Zambia plan to offer Kabila.
	   On Tuesday, Namibia's largest daily reported that Namibian
defense troops loaded 21 tons of arms and ammunition into two
Boeing aircraft bearing registration marks of an Angolan air
charter outfit.
	   Kabila, working from his former southern stronghold city of
Lubumbashi, ordered the government to regroup its military on
Tuesday after a key battalion defected to the rebel side.
	   The Zulu Battalion, one of the first to march into Kinshasa
after Kabila's forces last year ousted longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko, quit the government side recently and are now holding
the town of Inga _ home to one of Congo's primary power-generating
dams.
	   Over the weekend, Kabila met in Angola with that country's
president, Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, to ask for military help.
Angola last year also helped Kabila defeat Mobutu.
	   Kinshasa remained powerless Wednesday, its third straight day
without electricity, which was cut off from Inga.
	   At crowded stores throughout the city, residents continued to
stock up on provisions, while tense soldiers patrolled streets and
searched traffic along roads leading into Kinshasa.
	   An exodus of hundreds of foreigners continued on Tuesday after
the United States closed its embassy over the weekend and withdrew
all of its staff.
	   A chartered ferry shuttled several groups of foreigners across
the Congo River to the neighboring Republic of Congo.

Arrest of Mexico's most infamous kidnapper reveals chilling
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous and UPDATES with more details. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Lopping off victims' ears was standard
practice for Mexico's most infamous kidnapper. Before his capture
this week, police said he even used makeup on one dead victim to
convince relatives the earless man was still alive and worth a
ransom.
	   After a nine-month manhunt, Daniel Arizmendi Lopez, known as the
``ear lopper,'' was arrested Monday and arraigned Tuesday.
	   The ears were sent to relatives to pressure them to pay ransom.
In statements Tuesday, Arizmendi showed no remorse and even said
one police officer had participated in his kidnap gang, accused of
21 kidnappings in about three years.
	   The kidnappings epitomized an unprecedented crime wave in Mexico
City, which has prompted a surge in bodyguards, driven away
business and brought travel warnings from the U.S. Embassy.
	   In his statements, Arizmendi, 39, a former Morelos state police
officer, said he never repented his actions and wanted to be
executed.
	   ``I wish there was a death penalty ... a whole life in prison is
ugly, I think death would be nicer,'' Arizmendi told the Azteca
television network. ``Maybe I'm not so right in the head as I
appear.''
	   Mexico does not have the death penalty, and Arizmendi could face
a maximum of 40 years in prison on each homicide or kidnapping
count if convicted.
	   Prosecutor Samuel Gonzalez said Arizmendi and 39 accomplices
under arrest could get a total of ``several thousand years'' in
prison.
	   ``I never felt anything (for the victims), nor shame,''
Arizmendi said, describing how he used butcher's shears to cut up _
or off _ victims' ears, without anesthesia.
	   ``I never heard one of them ask me not to do it, perhaps because
they didn't have the opportunity,'' Arizmendi said, describing how
victims were bound, pushed to the floor and sliced.
	   In the interview, Arizmendi acknowledged killing two of his
victims, while Gonzalez said he confessed to killing three of his
accomplices.
	   Arizmendi said only one policemen had participated in
kidnappings, while prosecutors say five officers are under arrest
or investigation for aiding the band.
	   Arizmendi also reportedly raped a female victim and threatened
to cut the breast off another.
	   Arizmendi was arrested Monday night in Naucalpan, a northwestern
suburb of Mexico City by police acting on information from
accomplices and wire taps. He had about dlrs 500,000 in cash with
him.
	   He was first taken to the north-central state of Queretaro to
lead police to the shallow grave of kidnap victim Raul Nieto del
Rio.
	   The Aug. 6 kidnapping of Nieto del Rio _ whose body was made up
to appear alive even after the kidnappers had killed him _ was
Arizmendi's last alleged crime.
	   ``I never felt pleasure when I mutilated people, but it didn't
horrify me or cause me shame,'' he said. ``A lot of people think it
was for the money'' _ Arizmendi said he got a total of about dlrs
30 million in ransoms _ ``but it was nothing more than to see if I
could get away with or not.''

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Persis Khambatta, a former Miss India, who
was a navigator in the U.S. film ``Star Trek _ The Motion Picture''
died in Bombay following a heart attack, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Khambatta, 49, who died Tuesday in a Bombay hospital, had
undergone a by-pass operation in 1983.
	   She began modeling at the age of 13 and went on to win the Miss
India beauty crown in 1965, dressed in off-the-rack clothes she
bought in London at the last minute.
	   Khambatta starred in a few Hindi language films in India, then
went to feature in Hollywood productions, such as ``The Wilby
Conspiracy,'' ``Conduct Unbecoming'' and ``Night Hawks.'' Her
biggest break as an actress was playing Lt. Aliea in the ``Star
Trek'' movie.
	   Khambatta's funeral, held in Bombay on Wednesday, was attended
by some 40 family members and close friends.
	   She is survived by her mother and a brother.

Two European journalists reported expelled from Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A French journalist has become the second
foreign newsman expelled from Myanmar this week for entering the
country under the pretense of being tourists, official newspapers
reported Wednesday.
	   Philippe Grangereau was deported Monday for ``illegally
gathering information'' while in the country on a tourist visa,
newspapers said. Cassette tapes and documents hidden on his body
were seized.
	   Grangereau, who works for the Paris newspaper Liberation, had
apparently met with officials of the opposition National League for
Democracy, headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   On Tuesday, the military regime said that an Italian journalist,
Maurizio Giouliano, who was blacklisted for illicitly gathering
news in Myanmar, also known as Burma, earlier this month was
expelled when he tried to enter the country again.
	   Reporters Sans Frontieres _ Reporters Without Borders _ said in
a faxed statement that Franklin was arrested by plainclothes police
as he left NLD headquarters and expelled Aug. 17 from Yangon.
	   The group said in a letter to Gen. Than Shwe, the top leader of
the ruling State Peace and Development Council, that Franklin had
his film and audio tapes confiscated and was denied the right to
phone the French Embassy.

Spanish man with machete attacks blind beggar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A man with a machete attacked a blind
panhandler, Spanish police said Wednesday.
	   The 51-year-old suspect confessed, saying the beggar had
insulted him and his sister when they declined to give him money.
The victim said the assault was unprovoked.
	   Police said the man had been walking around with a machete in a
shoulder-holster. ``He told us he has been under psychiatric care
for the last few years,'' a police spokesman said.
	   The beggar, a 32-year-old North African, suffered a machete blow
in the ribs in the August 3 attack. The suspect was arrested
Tuesday.
	   In another incident, a man poured gasoline over a homeless man,
struck a match and set fire to him early Wednesday.
	   The 28-year-old victim was hospitalized with burns on his legs
and hands. He had been sleeping with three other homeless people on
a street in downtown Madrid.

Israel not expecting immediate immigration rush over ruble crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is deeply concerned about the economic
crisis in Russia and does not see it as an opportunity to entice
more Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel, a senior immigration
official said Wednesday.
	   ``A stable Russia is good for the world. It's good for Israel.
It's good for the region. It's good for the Jews,'' said Avraham
Burg, head of the Jewish Agency which brings Jews to Israel.
	   Burg and other immigration officials met Wednesday to discuss
the Russian crisis.
	   Burg told The Associated Press he did not expect an immediate
dramatic rise in the number of Jews seeking to leave Russia, but
that Israeli officials would monitor the situation closely.
	   Burg said the government expected about 50,000 Jews would come
to Israel from the former Soviet Union per year. In the last
decade, nearly 800,000 immigrants have arrived.
	   The Russian government announced the devaluation of the ruble
currency Monday, a move which was expected to hit Russian consumers
hard and lead to the collpase of many Russian commercial banks.

Divisions at top as IOC holds doping crisis meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ With its credibility on the line
and its leaders divided, the International Olympic Committee holds
an emergency meeting Thursday to face up to the spiraling doping
crisis in sport.
	   Galvanized by a summer of drug scandals, IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch has convened the special meeting of his executive
board to address the Olympic movement's most intractable problem.
	   Ten years after Ben Johnson was stripped of his 100-meter gold
medal for using steroids at the Seoul Olympics, the use of
performance-enhancing drugs is damaging the image of the sports
world as never before.
	   In recent weeks, the Tour de France was blighted by revelations
of systematic doping in cycling, top U.S. athletes Dennis Mitchell
and Randy Barnes were suspended after failing drug tests, triple
Olympic gold medalist Michelle Smith-De Bruin was banned from
competitive swimming for manipulating a urine sample and Italy's
Serie A soccer league was rocked by doping allegations.
	   IOC officials say Thursday's meeting is designed to set the
agenda for an international doping summit scheduled for Lausanne in
January.
	   But it will also provide the opportunity for Samaranch to
explain his recent controversial remarks on the subject.
	   In an interview with a Spanish newspaper, Samaranch said the
list of banned substances should be drastically reduced and
suggested that performance-enhancing drugs should be prohibited
only if they are harmful to athletes.
	   The statement stunned the Olympic world, including some of
Samaranch's closest advisers.
	   The IOC said Samaranch had been misinterpreted, but he has not
denied making the statement.
	   Samaranch's remarks have brought out sharp divisions at the top
of the Olympic hierarchy, set off bickering between rival sports
administrators and weakened his own position after 18 years as the
most powerful man in international sport.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, who as chairman of the IOC medical
commission has led the organization's anti-doping campaign for more
than 30 years, said he was ``aghast'' at Samaranch's comments.
	   ``People who want to reduce the (banned) list are the people who
want to let doping function,'' he told the French newspaper Le
Figaro.
	   In a startling allegation, De Merode claimed that Samaranch, who
is Spanish, was backing the philosophy of many doctors in Spain who
``have rejected the ethics of their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said.
	   Angry Spanish government officials accused de Merode of smearing
Spain's reputation and demanded that he offer an explanation.
	   Though he is no longer on the IOC executive board, de Merode is
scheduled to attend Thursday's meeting and will be expected to
clear the air with Samaranch.
	   ``A lot of people are hoping (de Merode) might retire,''
Australian IOC member Phil Coles said. ``He's been there such a
long time. You never know what he's going to say.''
	   Jacques Rogge, an executive board member and vice president of
the medical commission, has also contradicted Samaranch's view that
the banned list should be slashed.
	   While Samaranch argues that the list is ``like a book'' and
needs to be simplified, Rogge says all the drugs listed should be
there because they are open to abuse by athletes.
	   But there is also a body of opinion that the list should be
trimmed of substances found in common medications which have no
real performance-enhancing qualities.
	   Australian IOC board member Kevan Gosper said he plans to
present a 10-point proposal, including the possibility of imposing
financial penalties on drug cheats.
	   Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from the United States,
doesn't expect Thursday's meeting to formulate new policy.
	   ``We already have a policy on drugs,'' she said. ``It's there.
It's clear. Athletes know what it is. This is a chance to review
where we've come, what the changes are and to plan the convention
in January.''
	   Many Olympic officials want governments and police forces to
take a bigger role by chasing the doctors and traffickers who deal
in doping substances, as occurred during the Tour de France.
	   ``I don't think you can get a full solution to this without help
from the civil authorities,'' IOC vice president Dick Pound of
Canada said.
	   But German board member Thomas Bach warned that athletes should
not be the police targets.
	   ``We can't have a situation where we have to fear police raids
in the Olympic village in Sydney,'' he said.

Arafat, Peres to mark anniversary of Oslo agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former
Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres are to take part in a ceremony
commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accord, but
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend.
	   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen said the
government hopes Netanyahu will send a representative for the
Monday ceremony. U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross also is to take
part.
	   The accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization was finalized the night of Aug. 19-20, 1993, after
months of Norwegian-brokered talks that were held in secret. It was
formally signed on the U.S. White House lawn the following month.
	   Although the accord raised hopes for an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the peace process has been deadlocked
since Netanyahu was elected prime minister in 1996.
	   The Palestinians are furious that Netanyanu has continued
expanding settlements on Palestinian territory in the occupied West
Bank. Netanyahu refuses to pull out of Palestinian areas in
accordance with the Oslo agreement, insisting that the Palestinians
are not serious about stopping terrorism.

Police suspend raid on Hyundai pending last-ditch negotiations

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ With police standing by in case they
fail, government negotiators made a last-ditch attempt Wednesday to
end a month-long strike at Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest
automaker.
	   Some 15,000 riot police were poised to forcibly disperse
striking workers who have barricaded themselves inside Hyundai's
sprawling plant at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of
Seoul.
	   The use of force to break up the strike carried the risk of
embarrassment for the government of President Kim Dae-jung. As a
former opposition leader, he denounced past authoritarian regimes
for what he called excessive and brutal use of police force.
	   The government also sought to avoid televised scenes of helmeted
police with shields and batons clashing with workers armed with
steel pipes and firebombs _ images that could scare away badly
needed foreign investment in South Korea's battered economy.
	   ``We will continue our mediation efforts until Thursday morning.
This will be the last attempt. If no progress is made by then, I
can't tell what's going to happen,'' said Rep. Cho Sung-joon.
	   Cho was part of a five-member negotiating team from President
Kim's governing party who met separately with Hyundai's managers
and union leaders overnight to try to defuse the tension.
	   Cho said the talks were making little progress, but added ``it
is still too early to abandon all hope.''
	   Thousands of police stood by in nearby school grounds, out of
sight of the 5,000 workers and their families who have been
encamped inside the Hyundai plant since July 20 to protest rising
layoffs.
	   Workers blocked all eight gates to the plant, reinforcing
barricades with hundreds of brand-new passenger cars and trucks
loaded with oxygen tanks, which they threatened to explode if
police move in.
	   The workers were joined by about 200 wives, some of them
pregnant, and small children.
	   Police arrested four students who tried to sneak bottles, paint
thinner and gasoline into the plant Wednesday. Police suspected the
students planned to make Molotov cocktails.
	   The governing party delegation flew in late Tuesday after
mediation efforts by Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho failed.
	   Hyundai's 26,000-member union wants the company to take back
1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic
sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce its work
force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   State-owned KBS-TV reported that in overnight negotiations, the
union repeated its proposal that the company cancel its layoff
plans in exchange for workers' pay cuts, a proposal already
rejected by management.
	   In Seoul, chief presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said it ``is
the government's firm position that layoffs, allowed by law, must
be accepted by the union.''
	   A flexible labor market is a key part of reforms South Korea
promised to make in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package by
the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The number of jobless people has since doubled to 1.5 million
and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end, a shock to South
Korean workers long accustomed to lifetime employment.

Doctors check health of Suu Kyi in standoff with government
</HEADLINE>

group reporting anti-government sticker campaign, graf 5-6

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her food running low, Aung San Suu Kyi
was visited by her doctors Wednesday, the eighth day of a roadside
protest against Myanmar's military regime ahead of a Friday
deadline she has set for political change.
	   Myanmar authorities said they allowed Suu Kyi's two personal
physicians to visit her Wednesday in her van parked on a bridge 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon and they planned to do so
again Thursday.
	   They also permitted the doctors to visit her Tuesday, during
which the physicians informed Suu Kyi that her party's chairman,
Aung Shwe, had met with Khin Nyunt, one of the most powerful
generals in the junta that rules Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   It was the first meeting between National League for Democracy
leaders and the top generals in the military government in more
than a year.
	   Meanwhile, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles'
opposition group, claimed that authorities in the country's second
largest city, Mandalay, were offering cash rewards for information
on who had been placing anti-military stickers around the city.
	   The placement of such stickers could not be independently
confirmed. According to the ABSDF, the stickers called for protests
against the military and to support Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize, and the NLD.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues have been encamped in her van on a
bridge outside Yangon since last Wednesday, when they were stopped
by authorities during their fourth attempt in two months to travel
to the city of Bassein to meet supporters.
	   Bus passengers passing the site of the standoff said police have
been stopping vehicles and randomly checking identification cards.
Bus drivers have told passengers not to look out the window and
wave at Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi's party did not comment on her physical condition.
During the last standoff, she became ill with a high fever and
dehydration after the government prevented her from obtaining food
and water, according to the NLD.
	   The party said its chairman was allowed to raise issues with
which it is concerned during the meeting with Khin Nyunt.
	   Among them are Suu Kyi's right to travel freely within Myanmar
and the party's demand that the government finally allow Parliament
to convene by Aug. 21. The party has given no indication what it
will do if, as likely, the government refuses.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in Parliament in elections
in 1990, but the military never allowed the assembly to meet.
	   All three official newspapers ran front-page photos of the Khin
Nyunt-Aung Shwe meeting.
	   Nonetheless, a commentary in the New Light of Myanmar attacked
former army officers who have joined the NLD, naming Aung Shwe and
Vice Chairman Tin Oo, both former generals.
	   It accused them of ``following the policy of a woman (Suu Kyi)
who is trying to bring about the disintegration of Myanmar at the
behest of Western countries.''
	   Similar attempts to set up a series of meetings between the
military and NLD leaders last year broke down when the government
refused to allow Suu Kyi to take part. The NLD said it had the
right to choose who represents the party at any talks.
	   During last year's meeting, the NLD said it was not permitted to
raise its concerns. Instead, Khin Nyunt used the opportunity to try
and convince Aung Shwe that Suu Kyi had broken laws.
	   Tin Oo, who refused to give details about what was discussed in
Tuesday's meeting, said it was too soon to call it encouraging.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, three wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday, less than two
hours after an Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded
in a guerrilla attack, security officials said.
	   Two fighter jets fired two missiles on the hills of Mlita, a
village in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a Hezbollah stronghold
just across from an Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south,
the Lebanese officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about 3 kilometers (2
miles) north of the village of Rihan where an Israeli soldier was
killed and three others wounded in a guerrilla ambush earlier
Wednesday.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing at suspected guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah
highlands facing the occupied zone, the officials said. No
casualties were reported from the shelling.
	   It was not known whether there were any casualties from the air
raid, the second in south Lebanon in three days.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah antiaircraft guns fired at the
raiding jets but missed, according to the officials, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Israeli military officials said their planes struck at south
Lebanon, but they made no mention of casualties in the preceding
guerrilla attack.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks across the border.
	   On Monday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is used by Hezbollah as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied militiamen. No
casualties were reported in the raid.

Iraq's photographers honor day Saddam took up camera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraq's photographers have decided to honor
the day last year when President Saddam Hussein took some snapshots
of fellow citizens, naming Sept. 16 national photographers' day.
	   The daily Al-Thawra on Wednesday quoted Adeeb Shaaban, president
of Iraq's Photographers Association, as saying the date ``marks the
occasion when the camera was honored by the hand of the creative
leader Saddam Hussein.''
	   Hussein took the snapshots of Iraqi citizens while visiting
Salaheddin in northwest Iraq.
	   The association unveiled a mural of Hussein holding a camera at
its headquarters Tuesday to ``symbolize how both the camera and the
photographers pay allegiance to the leader,'' said Al-Thawra, the
newspaper of the president's Baath Party.
	   Murals of the Iraqi leader in various poses _ smiling, sipping
coffee, shoveling or swathed in an Arab cloak _ dot streets and
squares throughout Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents and Kenyan detectives raided a
Nairobi hotel in their pursuit of information about the U.S.
Embassy bombing. Investigators Wednesday confirmed the raid but
declined comment on a newspaper report that the prime suspect said
he had made the bomb there.
	   Reportedly acting on a tip from Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 15 FBI
agents and six Kenyan detectives wearing bulletproof vests raided
the Hilltop Hotel Tuesday morning and carried away several cartons.
	   The police swoop was reported in Wednesday's Daily Nation and
confirmed by hotel employees. The independent newspaper _ the
largest in East Africa _ also carried a front page photo of a man
identified only as an unidentified FBI agent carrying a carton.
	   Hotel workers said FBI agents returned Wednesday to take video
and still pictures of the hotel, located in River Road
neighborhood, a seedy section of downtown Nairobi.
	   The Aug. 7 attack on the embassy a kilometer away from the hotel
killed 247 people. An almost simultaneous bombing killed 10 at the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   In a joint statement, the FBI and Kenyan police investigators
confirmed that ``searches were conducted'' at the Hilltop Hotel on
Tuesday. They declined to elaborate, saying only: ``The
investigation is proceeding in a logical manner and no further
comment will be made at this time.''
	   In other important developments Wednesday, a Pakistani newspaper
reported that Odeh, who reportedly gave the information for the
Nairobi raid, gave a detailed account of worldwide anti-American
operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group based in
Afghanistan.
	   And a border official in Pakistan said a Saudi and a Sudanese
were detained at the Afghan border and were being questioned about
the bombings. The men were stopped Saturday, said Bakhtiar Khan,
chief of the Pakistani border post near the northern city of
Peshawar.
	   The New York Times said Odeh had named the men as accomplices.
	   The developments appeared to indicate that investigators, who
have remained mostly mum about their progress, have made major
breakthroughs in tracking down the bombers.
	   The Daily Nation report said a bomb containing 800 kilograms
(1,760 pounds) of TNT was assembled over several days in the
Hilltop Hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   A man who identified himself as the night clerk at the hotel,
Omar Jana, told The Associated Press that agents had stormed the
hotel. Jana said police arrested manager James Nganga and took the
hotel's guest register and copies of bills.
	   The agents were acting on information provided by Odeh, who was
arrested Aug. 7 in Pakistan and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan
authorities investigating the blast, according to the paper.
	   The newspaper said the hotel rooms where the bomb was made were
occupied from Aug. 3-7 by four foreigners involved in the bombing _
two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi Arabian. On the day of
the bombing, they were said to have completed assembly of the
explosive in a pickup truck and driven it to the embassy.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said Odeh flew out of
Nairobi Aug. 6 after ensuring that the final preparation were in
place. It said he is believed to have had five accomplices, three
of whom died in the bombing, with the other two still at large.
	   Hotel supervisor Abdulrahman Mohamed Said, whose father Mohamed
Said, is the owner, said no one took special notice of the guests
until the raid.
	   ``All the workers here remember them as ordinary guests,'' he
said.
	   Kishor Raghwami, a contractor who is renovating some of the
hotel's 34 rooms, said most of the hotel's clientele is Kenyan Arab
or other Arabs who are Muslims as well.
	   One of the rooms on the second floor of the four-story hotel is
used for prayers, and mats were neatly spread on the floor
Wednesday. None of the workers knew where the hotel owner was.
	   In Islamabad, The News said Odeh revealed during a week of
questioning by Pakistani intelligence officials that he is a member
of a secretive guerrilla group led by Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden, who is in hiding in Afghanistan.
	   Odeh claimed the group has successfully targeted U.S. interests
in countries including Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the
newspaper said.
	   Odeh, identified as a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer, claimed
to be an expert at handling shoulder-fired U.S. Stinger missiles.
The United States supplied such missiles to Afghan forces fighting
a Soviet invasion in their country in the 1980s, and bin Laden was
among the foreigners who fought alongside Afghans.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who flew back to
Washington after stops Tuesday in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi on a
whirlwind trip to show U.S. support, expressed satisfaction with
the investigative work, but she said she didn't expect immediate
answers.

Facing crackdown, IRA dissidents `suspend' bombing campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Irish government quotes; fixes writethru

 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a security crackdown and
public revulsion, the IRA dissidents who killed 28 people in Omagh
announced a suspension of their violence Wednesday as bereaved
families prepared to bury 16 more of the dead.
	   The British and Irish governments said the ``Real IRA's''
statement would not deter police from hunting down and punishing
the killers who planted the bomb Saturday.
	   ``We are talking about evil and depraved people. It is hard to
take seriously any comment they make,'' said Mary Harney, deputy
prime minister of the Irish Republic.
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the Irish
Roublican Army splinter group's announcement, but said it was too
little and too late.
	   ``On the day 16 victims are buried, I think it's an insult to
believe words mean anything,'' she said.
	   ``We will charge them if we can,'' she said. ``We will prosecute
them and we will put them away for a very long time.''
	   Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
said the suspension is ``of course too late for those killed and
injured in the bomb attack in Omagh, but it is the only correct
response.''
	   ``We may find that at last hope is breaking through, because
those outside the peace process now see the urgent need to become
part of it,'' he said.
	   The Real IRA's statement to the Dublin office of the Irish News,
a Belfast newspaper, came just hours after the group claimed
responsibility for Saturday's car bomb, which also wounded 220. It
was the deadliest terrorist attack in Northern Ireland history.
	   The statement stopped short of a formal cease-fire. But it cited
widespread public horror and an appeal from Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern as a reason to ``suspend'' the group's attacks
indefinitely and begin ``a process of consultation on our future
direction.''
	   The dissidents' earlier statement claimed they hadn't meant to
kill anybody but had planned to cause damage only to commercial
targets in the religiously mixed town, 70 miles (110 kilometers)
west of Belfast.
	   That provoked Ahern _ in the Irish Republic's seaside town of
Buncrana, where three young victims of the bombing were being
buried Wednesday _ to demand immediate declarations of cease-fires
from the Real IRA and other anti-British gangs refusing to join the
IRA's July 1997 truce.
	   The ``Real'' IRA is so called because its leaders refuse to use
a different name from the mainstream organization.

Brunei charges Briton for smuggling beer and whiskey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ A Briton who works for the
defense ministry and heads Brunei's eminent yacht club has been
charged with smuggling whiskey into the dry Islamic sultanate,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Andrew Dobson, 51, quit his position as commodore of the Royal
Brunei Yachting Club after he was charged, said a statement faxed
by club officials.
	   On Tuesday, Dobson pleaded not guilty to two charges of
smuggling liquor that was allegedly found in his yacht and car. If
convicted, he could be imprisoned for months and fined. His dlrs
18,000 yacht and car may also be seized.
	   Foreigners are allowed to bring in only two bottles of alcohol
and must declare their cargo.
	   According to prosecutors, Dobson was arrested on June 27 shortly
after customs officers stopped his car and found two bags stuffed
with beer and liquor near the capital Bandar Seri Begawan.
	   They allegedly discovered more cases of beer and whiskey in
several compartments on his yacht ``Velella.''
	   Dobson told the officers he brought dlrs 835 worth of liquor
from the neighboring Malaysian city of Labuan for personal
consumption.
	   Since Islamic Brunei banned the import and sale of alcohol five
years ago, a thriving underground market has grown. Smuggled beer
is served secretly in teapots in some restaurants and young men
gather late at night at private clubs to drink.
	   The tiny oil-rich kingdom of 300,000 people has been ruled by a
Muslim royal family for more than 500 years.

U.S. diplomats vow to try to get Kosovo sides together

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albanians urging meeting with
Yugoslavs after border incidents; UN rights commissioner touring

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Albanian government is asking
for an urgent meeting with Yugoslav authorities after Serb mortars
exploded across the border from rebellious Kosovo province, an
official said.
	   The shelling, which the Albanians said lasted for two hours
Tuesday, prompted local officials on the Albanian side of the
frontier to evacuate children and the elderly from border
communities.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, an interior ministry official
told The Associated Press Wednesday that the government was asking
for an urgent meeting of a joint Yugoslav-Albanian border
commission to discuss security but no reply had been received.
	   The official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
said 15 mortars exploded about 1.5 kilometers (nearly a mile)
inside Albanian territory. There were no casualties, he said.
	   The incident fueled fears that the conflict in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanian rebels have been fighting for independence since
Feb. 28, could spread throughout the southern Balkans.
	   About 1,700 troops from 14 countries are conducting a military
exercise in the Albanian capital to demonstrate NATO's commitment
to containing the Kosovo crisis.
	   On the diplomatic front, U.S. envoys were trying to arrange
direct talks between the Serb government and a Kosovo Albanian
delegation formed last week to bring the conflict to an end and
chart the future of the province, which is part of Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   On Tuesday, the Kosovo Albanians spurned an offer by the Serbs
to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must first cease
and tens of thousands of Albanian civilians must be allowed to
return to their homes.
	   The European Union's human rights commissioner, Emma Bonino, was
touring refugee areas of Kosovo on Wednesday for a first-hand
assessment of the crisis.
	   On Tuesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been
meeting with Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders, reiterated that
neither side should count on achieving anything by force and both
should keep working at negotiations.
	   ``The process has just begun. We have a long way to go, but it
has begun,'' he said.
	   Complicating the diplomacy is the fact that the leading ethnic
Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, faces opposition within the
Albanian community because of his pacifist tactics for resolving
the crisis.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has rejected Rugova's
leadership in favor of hard-liner Adem Demaci.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A twin-engine sightseeing plane
carrying 10 people crashed into the Foveaux Strait south of New
Zealand's South Island on Wednesday, killing four people and
leaving another missing, police said.
	   Most of the five survivors, who were in the water for an hour,
were injured, police spokesman Paul Visser told The Associated
Press.
	   A mayday call was received by Invercargill Airport four minutes
after the South Air Cessna 402 aircraft took off from Stewart
Island, which is below the South Island, said constable Visser.
	   Both engines shut down and the plane crashed in the strait, he
said.
	   Search aircraft and fishing boats found the wreckage near the
fishing port of Bluff, at the tip of the South Island.
	   Survivors and the bodies of the dead were pulled from the sea
and taken ashore for transfer by helicopter to hospital. After
initially reporting two deaths, police said later that four bodies
were pulled from the water.
	   The five injured were taken to Southland Hospital in
Invercargill, ambulance superintendent Bob Cooper told National
Radio.
	   ``They range from very serious to serious, at this stage,'' he
said. ``We believe four of the persons taken to hospital are
adults, and one child.''
	   Search boats using lights continued to comb the area after
nightfall for the missing passenger, as weather forecasters issued
a gale warning for the strait area.
	   Invercargill police spokesman Tim Brown said police are still
trying to identify the dead and injured, and it was still not known
whether any foreign nationals were on the crashed plane.
	   He said the flight was believed to be carrying members of New
Zealand's hospitality industry, returning from a two-day fishing
adventure trip to the island.

China's swollen Songhua River roars through Harbin, areas flooded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with more dikes bursting, higher
water levels, troops dispatched; picks up 10th graf pvs

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ The rain-swollen Songhua River punched
through dikes around a key Chinese industrial city Wednesday,
unleashing flooding that sent people fleeing.
	   Raging waters overwhelmed two 30-meter-long (100-foot-long)
dikes protecting a highway bridge in Harbin, a northeast China
provincial capital of 9 million. Local officials tried to use
trucks to plug the gaps but water continued to seep through, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Traffic was cut off on the highway, which links Harbin with the
oil city of Daqing. People trying to protect the highway prepared
to abandon the area, Xinhua said.
	   Earlier in the day, the river broke a dam 50 kilometers (30
miles) outside of the city and flooded land near the airport, but a
city spokesman said the airport remained secure.
	   Troops built a 1.5-meter (5-foot-high) restraining wall of metal
rods and wood planks atop a 26-kilometer-long (15-mile-long) levee
to keep the raging river out of Harbin.
	   In parts of the city, families afraid the dikes might leak left
their homes and camped in roadside tents.
	   Flooding on Wednesday, however, was along the river's north
bank, opposite the main part of Harbin.
	   Rains pushed the Songhua to a record 120.61 meters (398 feet)
high _ more than a meter (three feet) above the dikes' safety
level. Forecasters predicted more rains and higher waters through
Friday, Xinhua said.
	   Waters also continued to rise along the Yangtze River in central
China. Military commanders sent 13,500 troops to help 30,000
soldiers protect dikes around three cities in the hard-hit Dongting
Lake area, Xinhua said.
	   Heavy rains this summer have triggered the worst flooding along
the Yangtze in 44 years. More than 2,000 people have died
nationwide and millions have been left homeless.
	   In Harbin, the Songhua covered Sun Island, leaving just the
bridge that connects it to Harbin visible. Part of Harbin's ice
festival is held on the island each winter.
	   In Daqing, 270,000 soldiers, oil workers and other civilians
were working night and day to prevent the Nen River from
overwhelming the oil field and a nearby city of 2.3 million people.
	   The government ordered soldiers to build a new dike to protect
the No. 7 oil production base, Xinhua reported. The base was
endangered by possible breaches of the Nanyin Reservoir, whose
water on Tuesday was 24 centimeters (less than 10 inches) below the
danger mark, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, a 15-kilometer (9-mile-long) dike, the last defense
protecting Daqing city, was completed on Tuesday.
	   Flooding also was severe in Jilin, the province south of
Heilongjiang. In the northeastern part of Jilin, floods drove
nearly half of the 2 million people of Baicheng city out of their
homes this summer, Xinhua reported.
	   The central government issued an urgent order on Tuesday
demanding that local governments stabilize prices of necessities
and be on the alert to punish any hoarding and speculation during
the floods.
	   It said provincial governments could impose price ceilings on
food and materials for flood control and rebuilding.

IMF expects lower than 1 percent economic growth for Philippines in
</HEADLINE>
1998

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
expects the Philippine economy to grow less than 1 percent in 1998
due to the poor agricultural production in the first half of the
year.
	   ``We'll be lucky if we'll have positive (gross national product)
growth of 1 percent for this year,'' said Henri Lorie, the IMF
representative to the Philippines.
	   The IMF expects GNP to grow 2-3 percent in 1999, Lorie said
without elaborating.
	   Philippine agricultural production in the first half of the year
dropped 7.2 percent, its worst performance in 20 years, due to a
drought caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   The IMF's 1998 GNP projection for the Philippines is lower than
the government's revised forecast of 2-3 percent.
	   An IMF mission is expected in Manila next week to assess the
country's economic performance over the past seven months and
review targets for the rest of the year.
	   The effects of the regional financial crisis on the economy will
be considered, Lorie said.
	   The country's growth targets are part of conditions set for a
dlrs 1.4 billion loan from the IMF to defend the Philippine peso if
the currency comes under extreme speculative pressure.
	   Lorie declined to say whether the IMF has also revised its
inflation target for the Philippines.
	   He noted with approval, however, that inflation declined to 10.4
percent in July from 10.7 percent in June.
	   Under the loan arrangement, the IMF's average inflation targets
for the Philippines technically remain at 7.5-8.5 percent in 1998
and 6-7 percent in 1999.
	   The government, however, recently revised its 1998 inflation
target upwards to 9.5-10.0 percent.

Rescuers find survivors from landslide; scores feared killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with soldiers rescuing nine more villagers,
details on devastation. CORRECTS name of river to Kali sted Malpa. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Army troops slipped and crawled across mud
and fallen rocks on Wednesday to rescue nine people from a remote
Himalayan valley on a pilgrimage route to Tibet. Another 200 people
were missing and feared killed in landslides.
	   With bad weather grounding rescue helicopters for the second
day, a team of 75 soldiers picked their way across rain-soaked
mountains to reach a camp site for Hindu pilgrims that had become
what one official described as ``a valley of death.''
	   Torrential rains toppled a mountain of mud and boulders into the
valley before dawn Tuesday. The rain and mud changed the course of
the Kali River, triggering a flash flood that swept away the
pilgrims' huts. A small guest house with nine people asleep inside
tumbled into the river valley, but they all were found alive,
officials said.
	   Soldiers pulled out nine more people Wednesday: six villagers
and three porters who were accompanying the pilgrims to a sacred
shrine across the Chinese border in Tibet.
	   ``The condition of the survivors is serious due to their
exposure to freezing wind and rain for more than 24 hours,'' said
Brigadier Avadesh Prakash, the local army commander. He said the
bodies of many of the victims may have been swept away in the
flood, making an accurate count of the dead difficult.
	   ``There is no trace of the others,'' said L.R. Yadav, the top
administrator of Pithoragarh, 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of
New Delhi.
	   ``According to the rescue workers, it resembles a valley of
death. Backpacks, gas stoves, food cans and other articles
belonging to the people are strewn all around. There is no trace of
the fiberglass huts or the dwellings of the villagers,'' Yadav said
in a telephone interview.
	   Among the missing pilgrims was Protima Bedi, a noted Indian
dancer who often led dance troupes on world tours and who ran a
dance academy in southern India. She was the mother of Pooja Bedi,
one of India's most popular film actresses.
	   Before leaving her home in Bangalore, Protima Bedi talked about
dancing in the Himalayas, and told The Pioneer newspaper she
intended to meditate and ``become one with nature.''
	   Limited rescue operations began Tuesday by a handful of soldiers
of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police who were stationed nearby and who
had been injured themselves in the mudslide, said Naresh Dayal, the
interior minister in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
	   The soldiers informed authorities about the disaster by radio _
the only communication link with the site on the first day _ then
clawed through the mud to reach the bodies of nine villagers, Dayal
said.
	   Nine injured people were taken to hospitals Tuesday, state
government officials said.
	   The army rescuers reached the site Wednesday to find nine more
survivors huddled under boulders, said Prakash, the army commander.
Another rescue team was on the way, but evacuation of survivors
would have to wait until the storm clouds and fog cleared.
	   The missing included 60 pilgrims, most of their 45 porters and
seven government officials accompanying them. The rest of the
victims were road workers and local villagers.
	   The pilgrims reached the camp site Sunday, but bad weather
hampered them from setting out on their 200-kilometer (120-mile),
12-day trek to the Manasarowar Lake across the border. Hindus and
Buddhists revere the four-faced Himalayan peak, known as Kailasha,
or the abode of bliss.
	   India's Foreign Ministry, which organizes the pilgrimage, set up
emergency control rooms in New Delhi and Pithoragarh to field calls
from frantic relatives.
	   Three other groups were inside Tibet, and the government planned
to seek Chinese help in evacuating them back to India.
	   This was the second disaster to hit mountainous Uttar Pradesh in
one week. Last Wednesday, a landslide killed at least 42 people and
hundreds of animals, and destroyed several houses and shops in the
nearby Ukhimutt region.

More Russian military officials in Tajikistan to discuss Taliban

threat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two more top Russian officials arrived in
Tajikistan on Wednesday to help strengthen the borders between
Central Asian nations and Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov and Chief of the
General Staff Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin arrived in Dushanbe, the Tajik
capital, to meet President Emomali Rakhmonov, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Sweeping victories by the Taliban Islamic army in Afghanistan
have led the former Soviet republics in Central Asia to fear an
influx of of weapons and refugees fleeing the conflict across their
borders.
	   The officials' visit follows a trip by the head of Russia's
border service, Col. Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, who held similar talks
with Rakhmonov.
	   Russia has 25,000 troops in Tajikistan to help guard the border
with Afghanistan.
	   Meanwhile, the foreign and defense ministers from Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan will meet August 22 to
discuss the situation in Afghanistan, Interfax said.
	   The meeting will give the central Asian nations a chance to show
their solidarity over the perceived Afghan threat, said Kazakhstan
Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev.
	   ``We view the war in Afghanistan as an inner Afghan conflict and
think the Taliban are wise enough not to move towards the Central
Asian states' borders,'' he said, according to Interfax.

Gorbachev lashes out at Yeltsin, calls for early elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
lashed out at his long-time rival, Boris Yeltsin, and called again
for early presidential and parliamentary elections in Russia.
	   In an interview published in parts Tuesday and Wednesday in the
Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper, Gorbachev described the Russian
government as ``de-facto bankrupt'' and said only 4 percent of
Russians trusted their president.
	   Early elections, he told the Ukrainian daily, is ``the only way
out of the political crisis... But to hope that Yeltsin would agree
to it, and following Gorbachev's advice, is a utopia.''
	   ``Yeltsin has a pathological fear of losing power,'' added
Gorbachev, who now runs a private think tank in Moscow. ``This man
has a rare talent for destroying things.''
	   Gorbachev also said Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
Krasnoyarsk regional Gov. Alexander Lebed, a former general, had
the best chances to win Russia's presidential elections, scheduled
for 2000.
	   Lebed, who came in a strong third in the 1996 presidential
ballot, says he might run for president again if he succeeds in
turning around the economy in Krasnoyarsk, a large territory in
Siberia. Luzhkov so far has denied any presidential aspirations.
	   Although both men are known for their command methods of
leadership and are said to be authoritarian, Gorbachev dismissed
fears of a new dictatorship in Russia.
	   ``Luzhkov and Lebed are not among the politicians alien to
democracy,'' he said. ``I think no dictatorship is threatening the
country if either of them comes to power. On the other hand, they
both are strong-willed men, and each has the strength to impose the
dictatorship of the law.''

Pinto, the wine maker and drinker, finally wins gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning's results, Tilli reinstated &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Grit Breuer of Germany, a former
champion with a drug-tainted past, led all qualifiers in the
women's 400 meters at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Breuer won the title in 1990 when she was still a junior and an
East German. She resumed competing in August 1995, after serving a
three-year drug ban.
	   An Olympic bronze medalist at age 16 with the East German
1,600-meter relay team, Breuer ran an astonishing anchor leg to
help Germany win the gold at last year's World Championship.
	   Breuer, who won the event recently at the prestigious Zurich
meet, clocked a time of 51.60 seconds to advance to the semifinals
of the one-lap race. Helena Fuchsova of the Czech Republic won her
heat in 51.61, while Olga Kotlyarova of Russia took hers in 51.62
as the favorites advanced.
	   In the men's 400, the three British sprinters who are tops in
Europe this season all advanced without problems.
	   Mark Richardson, the fastest in Europe this year at 44.37, won
his group in 46.05, the third fastest of all heat winners. Iwan
Thomas and Solomon Wariso also advanced to keep alive British hopes
of a medal sweep.
	   In the men's pole vault, reigning Olympic champion Jean Galfione
easily cleared 5.60 meters to win one of the two heats and advance
to the final. Maksim Tarasov of Russia, the 1992 Olympic champion,
also cleared 5.60 to advance.
	   Dragutin Topic of Yugoslavia, the 1990 European high jump
champion, won his heat as all favorites cleared 2.24 to advance to
the final.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday had six: the women's javelin, men's long jump,
hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and the women's
10,000.
	   Stefano Tilli of Italy, one of the 100-meter semifinalists, was
reinstated by the Jury of Appeal. Tilli had been disqualified for
verbally abusing a referee who did not let the Italian run a lap of
honor after qualifying Tuesday.
	   Tilli apologized and was reinstated.
	   The jury also ruled that Alksandr Bagach of Ukraine can keep his
shot put gold medal.
	   The jury said the weighted ankle attachments worn by Bagach were
within the rules. The weights give better rotation to an athlete
just before he makes the throw.
	   Bagach is no stranger to controversy.
	   He was stripped of the gold medal at the World Championship in
Athens last year after testing positive for the stimulant
ephedrine. He was also disqualified for drug use as far back as
1989.
	   Bagach's winning distance Tuesday was 21.17 meters.
	   Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany won the silver at 20.98, while the
bronze went to another Ukrainian, Yuriy Belonog, at 20.92.
	   Another winner Tuesday, Antonio Pinto of Portugal, seems to have
an unusual formula for athletic success: drink your home-grown
wine.
	   Pinto, 32, who owns a vineyard and says he drinks 4-5 bottles a
wine every week, added a gold medal that has been missing in his
career when he won the men's 10,000 meters.
	   Twice a winner of the London Marathon, Pinto was lacking a major
championship title.
	   ``I didn't want to end my career without a medal of some kind,''
Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.
	   With about 4 1/2 laps left, Pinto switched into a higher gear

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a security crackdown and
widespread public revulsion, the Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for a car-bomb atrocity announced a surprise
``suspension'' to their violence. Wednesday's coded statement to
the Dublin office of the Irish News, a Belfast newspaper, came
hours after the faction calling itself the ``Real IRA'' claimed
responsibility for Saturday's car bomb in Omagh, which killed 28
and wounded 220. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Northern
Ireland history. Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the
announcement but said it was ``not enough; too late.'' Mitchel
McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said: ``We
may find that at last hope is breaking through, because those
outside the peace process now see the urgent need to become part of
it,'' he said. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators acting on information from a
suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing raided a Nairobi hotel where
the bomb was believed to have been made, a Kenyan newspaper
reported Wednesday. Fifteen U.S. FBI agents and six Kenyan
detectives wearing bulletproof vests carried away several boxes
from the raid Tuesday, according to the Daily Nation. The Aug. 7
attack in downtown Nairobi killed 247 people. An almost
simultaneous bombing killed 10 at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. Also Wednesday, a Pakistani newspaper reported
that the suspect who gave the information for the raid, Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, gave a detailed account of worldwide anti-American
operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group based in
Afghanistan. Kenyan police and U.S. authorities did not inform the
media about the reported raid Tuesday and declined to comment on
the latest reported developments. If true, the two reports would
signify a major breakthrough in the investigation into the
bombings. (EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Prosecutors have called Monica Lewinsky back
to the grand jury to respond to President Bill Clinton's testimony
about their ``inappropriate'' relationship, legal sources said. On
Monday, Clinton acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with the
former White House intern but refused to detail specific sexual
contact. Prosecutors summoned Ms. Lewinsky to respond Thursday,
said sources familiar with the request, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. A few lawmakers have called for his resignation, and
even members of his own Democratic party expressed disappointment
with the president. But House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican,
counseled restraint, saying, ``It's premature for anyone to make
any judgment.'' Hillary Rodham Clinton sent word she ``believes in
this marriage,'' her first public expression on her husband's
infidelity. (US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Thunderstorms and fog blocked rescue
helicopters from taking off Wednesday for a remote valley in
northern India where landslides and floods may have washed away up
to 200 people. Military helicopters were on standby for a second
day as fog shrouded the valley in northern India. Torrential rains
toppled a mountain of mud and boulders into the Himalayan valley on
Tuesday, triggering a flash flood that swept away the tents of some
100 Hindu pilgrims on their way to a sacred shrine in Tibet. The
other casualties were local villagers. Officials said up to 200
people were missing and feared dead, but only nine bodies had been
recovered by late Tuesday. Among the missing was Protima Bedi, a
noted Indian dancer who often lead dance troupes on world tour, New
Delhi Television reported. She also is the mother of Pooja Bedi,
one of India's most popular film actresses. (INDIA-LANDSLIDE)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ After launching air strikes against rebel
positions, President Laurent Kabila's appeal for military help has
been answered by nearby Zimbabwe. The government began preparing
Wednesday to airdrop paratroopers behind rebels lines near the
western town of Kitona, one day after bombing the town's airport,
Information Minister Didier Mumengi said in a telephone interview.
A key political figure in the rebel movement denied the reports.
The reports of attacks came as rebel forces _ a coalition of ethnic
Tutsi fighters, Rwanda soldiers and disenchanted members of
Kabila's army _ were moving to take Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150
kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital, Kinshasa. Kabila
accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of staging the rebellion and
fighting alongside the rebels. Rwanda and Uganda, which both played
instrumental roles in helping Kabila topple the government of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, have denied involvement
in the latest rebellion. (CONGO)

Thai central bank explains bank, finance company seizures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Tuesday it
took over seven financial institutions last week because they did
not have a sufficient capital adequacy ratio and were having
serious cash crunch problems.
	   The Bank of Thailand issued a statement explaining its rationale
after criticism that the reasons applied in last Friday's takeover
of two banks and five finance companies were not disclosed.
	   Laem Thong Bank PCL, Union Bank of Bangkok PCL and the five
non-bank lenders are being forced by the central bank to write off
their registered capital. Their 10 baht (24 cent) par-value shares
will be written down to one satang (0.0024 cents) a share.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, known officially as the
Financial Institutions Development Fund, will then take over the
seven institutions by swapping its debt for new shares.
	   The central bank said in the statement Tuesday that the capital
adequacy ratio _ a bank's capital as a percentage of its loans _ of
the seven institutions had fallen below 4 percent.
	   Under the law, banks are required to maintain the ratio at 8.5
percent while finance companies must keep it at 8.0 percent.
	   It said these institutions also had serious cash flow problem
because they had borrowed from the FIDF more than twice the amount
of their net reserves.
	   The central bank said the seven institutions had mountains of
problem loans which did not generate interest revenue, but their
expenditure remained high.
	   It said when taking into account the high interest they paid on
deposits and the tougher loan-loss reserve requirements, expenses
had eaten into shareholder equity. It said in some cases, the
shareholder equity had become negative.
	   In the actions taken last Friday, Laem Thong Bank will
subsequently be merged with state-owned Radhanasin Bank.
	   Union Bank of Bangkok will be merged with Krungthai Thanakit, a
state-owned finance company, along with the five finance companies
nationalized last Friday and the seven other finance companies
nationalized earlier this year.

Asian markets rebound on stronger yen and overnight Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
gain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After days of lackluster performance, most
Asian markets closed higher on Wednesday, buoyed by a stronger yen
and a 1.6-percent gain on Wall Street overnight.
	   Tokyo stocks extended their rebound from a string of recent
tumbles with the Nikkei 225 average gaining 342.55 points, or 2.3
percent, to close at 15,406.34.
	   A stronger yen, which had fallen to an eight-year low against
the dollar last week, and a 139.8-point overnight surge in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average helped pull up Japanese stocks.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed sharply higher on a stronger yen.
The KOSPI index was up 10.75 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at
301.90.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks ended sharply higher on continued
government intervention made easier by Wall Street's gain.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue-chips _
jumped 411.66 points, or 5.7 percent, to close at 7,622.58.
	   The index was up 14 percent since the Hong Kong government on
Friday began snapping up selected blue chips in an effort to keep
share prices up and hold speculators at bay.
	   Analysts said the government's move to discourage speculators
coincided with share prices surging from Tokyo to Taipei.
	   The Hang Seng index surged more than 7 percent in early trading
Wednesday on government buying of blue-chip heavyweights such as
HSBC Holdings PLC, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. and CLP
Holdings Ltd.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended higher on lower domestic
interest rates and a recent government announcement of measures to
eliminate failing banks. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index
gained 7.69 points, or 3.3 percent, to end at 243.37.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on the back of a
stronger rupiah, a stronger yen and a bullish trend in the major
regional equities markets. The JSX composite index was up 2.035
points, or 5 percent, to close at 405.890.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed higher on expectations that
Kuala Lumpur may follow Hong Kong's lead and use government funds
to buy up stocks. The benchmark Composite Index finished 27.81
points higher, or 8.8 percent, to close at 343.47.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares staged a strong technical rally,
spurred by overnight gains on Wall Street and stronger Asian
currencies. The PSE Index was up 41.42 points, or 3.1 percent, to
close at 1,364.59.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed as a wave of late selling knocked
many shares off their highs. The STI Index was down 4.58 points to
close at 923.04.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices were stronger after Wall
Street's overnight climb and improving Asian markets. The All
Ordinaries Index was up 70.6 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at
2,636.1.
	   TAIPEI: Shares rode the rise in major global stock markets,
though the increase wasn't enough to erase falls in previous
sessions. The Weighted Price Index surged 111.81 points, or 1.6
percent, to close at 7,293.40.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher, matching gains in
regional markets after Wall Street's overnight surge. The NZSE-40
Capital Index was up 40.83 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at
1,969.28.

African rhino population on the up after years of decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source to Wednesday August 19 at 1800 GMT; note
fund is known as World Wildlife Fund in North America. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ After more than 20 years of rapid
decline caused mainly by poaching, the number of African
rhinoceroses surviving in the wild is slowly rising again, the
World Wide Fund for Nature said Wednesday.
	   New WWF and World Conservation Union estimates show the number
of the animals in African rhino-range countries rose to 11,065 in
1997 from 9,971 in 1995.
	   ``It may not seem a very large increase, but when you consider
the difficulties dealing with illegal hunting over large areas,
this is definitely good news,'' said Dr. Holly Dublin, chairman of
the WWF's African rhino working group. ``These figures are a sign
that Africa's rhinos are not lost and can be conserved if adequate
safeguards and conservation strategies are set in place.''
	   Despite an international ban imposed in 1977 on the trading of
rhino products, the market for horn continues to flourish, a WWF
statement said.
	   The black rhino population in Africa plunged to barely more than
2,000 in the mid-1990s from around 65,000 in 1970. Conservation
efforts in several African countries have, however, helped lift
estimated numbers to 2,599 in 1997 from 2,408 in 1995.
	   The estimated total population of white rhinos in the African
wild has risen to 8,466 in 1997 from 7,563 in 1995. Some 7,913 of
those are in South Africa, WWF spokesman Javier Arreaza said.
	   Species of rhino still exist in Indonesia, India, Malaysia,
Nepal and Vietnam, but these, too, are endangered because of
poaching and loss of habitat, said Arreaza.
	   There are believed to be 2000 Indian rhinos in India, up to 300
Sumatran rhinos in Indonesia and Malaysia and up to 75 Javan rhinos
in Indonesia and Vietnam.
	   Poachers have targeted African rhinos in recent decades to
satisfy a ``feverish'' demand for the animal's highly priced horn
in China, where it is used in traditional medicine, the WWF
statement said. The horn is also sought after in the Middle East.
In Yemen, for example, it can fetch up to dlrs 550 a pound to make
decorative dagger handles.
	   Anti-poaching efforts and conservation strategies involving
government agencies, local communities and private land owners in
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Namibia have played a major role
in gradually restoring rhino populations, the WWF statement said.
	   Some of these countries, such as South Africa, have provided
rhinos for breeding programs in other African countries where
numbers have dwindled.
	   WWF says long term success can only be achieved by increasing
consumers' awareness of the problem, securing enough cash for
conservation. ``A lot remains to be done,'' Dublin said.

Thai banks' lending rates at nine-month low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's biggest commercial bank
announced Wednesday it was cutting its lending rates by half a
percentage point, as prime rates at the country's top banks fell
below 15.25 percent for the first time in nine months.
	   Commercial bank prime rates have come down in response to a
relaxation of central bank monetary policy in mid-June, following
the stabilization of the baht in foreign exchange markets. They had
been around 19 percent before that.
	   Bangkok Bank said that effective Tuesday it had lowered its
prime rate, or minimum lending rate, to 15.00 percent from 15.50
percent.
	   The country's second-largest bank, state-owned Krung Thai Bank,
lowered its prime rate 0.25 percentage point to 15.00 percent
effective Wednesday.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said in early
July that keeping short-term interest rates too high for too long
damages Thailand's prospects for recovery. They were raised last
year in an effort to strengthen the baht as Asia's economies melted
down.
	   Tight money policy was mandated by the terms of a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout organized by the International Monetary Fund.
	   As the country fell deeper into recession in the first half of
1998, commercial bank and finance company lending collapsed.
	   Institutions are still loathe to risk new lending as loan-loss
provisioning requirements have been tightened and non-performing
loans head towards an estimated 40 percent of total loans.
	   Total commercial bank loans grew only 2.9 percent between the
end of December and the end of June, according to central bank
data.

Britain sends more troops to Brazzaville in case of evacuation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has dispatched 75 more Royal Marines, some
equipped with boats, to Brazzaville in case a military evacuation
is needed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where rebels are
fighting to topple the government
	   The troops, flown in from Ascension Island in the Atlantic, will
join 45 Royal Marines already in Brazzaville, across the Congo
River from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Defense Ministry
said Wednesday.
	   In addition, 120 British military personnel, including logistics
and command and control specialists, will be deployed in
Libreville, capital of Gabon, the ministry said.
	   ``The government is ... in close consultation with allies,
particularly the French who have forces in Brazzaville,'' a
ministry statement said. ``These further precautionary measures do
not, in any way, imply that a military assisted evacuation from the
DRC will be necessary.''
	   About 150 British nationals are still in the Democratic Republic
of Congo despite Foreign Office warnings to leave.

Remains of Holocaust victims to be brought from Poland to Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ More than half a century after the Holocaust,
dozens of Israeli families want to exhume the bodies of relatives
killed in the Nazi genocide in Poland and bring the remains to
Israel.
	   The reburial, which would be unprecedented in scope, became
possible after Polish pathologists agreed to help their Israeli
colleagues identify the remains, an Israeli physician said
Wednesday.
	   The Israel Institute of Forensic Medicine was flooded with phone
calls from relatives of Holocaust victims after the agreement was
first reported on Israel radio Wednesday morning.
	   One Israeli immigrant from Poland, Zvi Kamionka, said he turned
to the institute after hearing the news. ``My family consisted of
more than 120 people and I am perhaps the only one who survived,''
said Kamionka, 66, a retired technician.
	   The head of the Israeli pathological institute, Dr. Yehuda Hiss,
said in the past he was unable to help families because there was
no arrangement with Poland for identifying the remains.
	   Some families had remains brought to Israel only to learn that
they were not those of their relatives, Hiss told Israel radio.
	   The head of the Forensic Medicine Institute in Warsaw, Dr.
Aleksander Dobrzynski agreed to carry out the tests with the
participation of a rabbi. ``This is a major turning point and a
humanitarian act on the part of the Poles,'' Hiss said.
	   The agreement was also welcomed by Avraham Burg, chairman of the
Jewish Agency, a semi-official body dealing with relations between
Israel and world Jewry.
	   ``It's very important for Holocaust survivors who never had a
chance to bury their loved ones here during the communist regime in
Eastern Europe,'' Burg said.
	   Most of the Holocaust victims were gassed and cremated, and the
ashes were dumped. However thousands were shot by the Germans and
buried in mass graves, or packed into synagogues which were set on
fire.
	   These victims were also buried, said Stephan Grayek, head of the
Federation of Polish Immigrants in Israel and a survivor of the
Warsaw ghetto uprising.
	   Over 3 million Jews lived in Poland before World War II. Most of
the 6 million Jews killed in the Nazi genocide perished in Poland.
	   In the post-war period, Israel's relations with Poland's
communist regime were cool. After the 1967 Mideast war, Eastern
European countries, including Poland, severed relations with
Israel. Poland restored ties in 1990.
	   Hiss said the agreement was made possible by modern
identification techniques and by cordial working relations which he
forged with the Polish experts during a recent visit to Warsaw.
	   Grayek said the families, by bringing their relatives' remains
to Israel, would be able to visit the graves regularly and could be
confident that their resting place would be permanent and would not
be disturbed.

Portugal's jobless rate falls to 4.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's unemployment rate dropped to
4.5 percent in the second quarter of 1998, down from 5.9 percent in
the first quarter, the National Statistics Institute said
Wednesday.
	   The statistics include only mainland Portugal, excluding the
autonomous island regions of Madeira and the Azores.
	   On the continent, the total number of unemployed fell to 218,100
people at the end of June compared with 283,000 people at the end
of March and 300,700 people at the end of 1997, the Institute said.
	   Portugal has an active population of 9.46 million people and one
of the lowest jobless rates in the 15-member European Union.
	   The economy is buoyant, with the government forecasting growth
of 4.2 percent this year.

Anti-piracy groups demand crackdown on illegal software
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Entertainment industry executives
accused the government of failing to enforce anti-piracy laws and
demaded that it crackdown on rampant software piracy, a news report
said.
	   ``We want the total commitment of the government in fighting
piracy, especially during this economic slowdown,'' Francis Peter,
director of Intellectual Property Protection was quoted as saying

	   Peter estimated that annual sales of pirated video compact discs
and music compact discs in Malaysia amounted to 300 million (dlrs
71.4 million), nearly half the amount taken in by legitimate
copies.
	   He said the music and motion picture industries had lost about
100 million ringgit (dlrs 25 million) as a result of pirates, who
sell their wares openly in marketplaces around the capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Earlier this week, several intellectual property protection
groups urged the government to clamp down on manufacturers of
illegal VCDs and CDs.
	   The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, however, said
it did not have jurisdiction to seize machines used by makers of
the pirated CDs, VCDs and CD-ROMs.
	   According to a recent survey of Southeast Asia's software
industry, an estimated 84 percent of the software in the region was
illegal.

Leading Austrian journalist dies at 75
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hellmut Andics, prominent Austrian
journalist, author and screenwriter, died of a heart attack late
Tuesday at age 75.
	   Andics, son of an Austrian military officer, was born in Vienna
in 1922.
	   After training as an engineer, he drifted into journalism,
writing for a number of Vienna newspapers including ``Die Presse''
and ``Kurier.''
	   He also authored a number of popular German-language histories,
including ``The State Nobody Wanted,'' ``The Austrian Century,''
and ``The Jews of Vienna,'' saying that he wanted to interest
ordinary readers in history and historical figures.
	   He also wrote a number of film and television scripts which were
well received in the German-speaking world.
	   Andics was also active in cultural projects in the eastern
Austrian province of Burgenland, where he lived for a number of
years. He served as director of the regional television station in
Burgenland from 1982 until 1986.
	   He was survived by his wife, Gertrud, and two sons.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government calling Suu Kyi trip ``camping
visit,'' grafs 10-11

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her food running low, Aung San Suu Kyi
was visited by her doctors Wednesday, the eighth day of a roadside
protest against Myanmar's military regime ahead of a Friday
deadline she has set for political change.
	   Myanmar authorities said they allowed Suu Kyi's two personal
physicians to visit her Wednesday in her van parked on a bridge 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon and they planned to do so
again Thursday.
	   They also permitted the doctors to visit her Tuesday, during
which the physicians informed Suu Kyi that her party's chairman,
Aung Shwe, had met with Khin Nyunt, one of the most powerful
generals in the junta that rules Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   It was the first meeting between National League for Democracy
leaders and the top generals in the military government in more
than a year.
	   Meanwhile, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles'
opposition group, claimed that authorities in the country's second
largest city, Mandalay, were offering cash rewards for information
on who had been placing anti-military stickers around the city.
	   The placement of such stickers could not be independently
confirmed. According to the ABSDF, the stickers called for protests
against the military and to support Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize, and the NLD.
	   Suu Kyi and three colleagues have been encamped in her van on a
bridge outside Yangon since last Wednesday, when they were stopped
by authorities during their fourth attempt in two months to travel
to the city of Bassein to meet supporters.
	   Bus passengers passing the site of the standoff said police have
been stopping vehicles and randomly checking identification cards.
Bus drivers have told passengers not to look out the window and
wave at Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi's party did not comment on her physical condition.
During the last standoff, she became ill with a high fever and
dehydration after the government prevented her from obtaining food
and water, according to the NLD.
	   The government, in a press statements faxed to Bangkok,
Thailand, claimed Wednesday that threats of violence made it too
dangerous for Suu Kyi to travel and characterized her standoff as a
``camping visit ... alongside a gently flowing stream.''
	   ``Local villagers and officials said Ms. Suu Kyi has been
somewhat reclusive,'' the government said. ``She has been spending
most of her time inside her air-conditioned camper reading novels
and listening to music and news.''
	   The party said its chairman was allowed to raise issues with
which it is concerned during the meeting with Khin Nyunt.
	   Among them are Suu Kyi's right to travel freely within Myanmar
and the party's demand that the government finally allow Parliament
to convene by Aug. 21. The party has given no indication what it
will do if, as likely, the government refuses.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in Parliament in elections
in 1990, but the military never allowed the assembly to meet.
	   All three official newspapers ran front-page photos of the Khin
Nyunt-Aung Shwe meeting.
	   Nonetheless, a commentary in the New Light of Myanmar attacked
former army officers who have joined the NLD, naming Aung Shwe and
Vice Chairman Tin Oo, both former generals.
	   It accused them of ``following the policy of a woman (Suu Kyi)
who is trying to bring about the disintegration of Myanmar at the
behest of Western countries.''
	   Similar attempts to set up a series of meetings between the
military and NLD leaders last year broke down when the government
refused to allow Suu Kyi to take part. The NLD said it had the
right to choose who represents the party at any talks.
	   During last year's meeting, the NLD said it was not permitted to
raise its concerns. Instead, Khin Nyunt used the opportunity to try
and convince Aung Shwe that Suu Kyi had broken laws.
	   Tin Oo, who refused to give details about what was discussed in
Tuesday's meeting, said it was too soon to call it encouraging.

Aid agency contemplates withdrawing from North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NKorea-Famine

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Doctors Without Borders may leave North Korea
unless the communist country grants the aid group better access to
people sickened by famine, an official said Wednesday.
	   Doctors Without Borders has distributed medicines in North Korea
for a year, but has found it hard to gauge the results because of
official limits on the agency's work, said William Claus, an
official based in Brussels overseeing the aid program.
	   ``We want access to homes, institutions, everything,'' said
Claus, who was in North Korea last month for negotiations on the
issue.
	   So far, North Korean officials have balked at the request for
more access and instead asked the group to provide equipment and
raw materials to make medicines, something the agency does not do,
Claus said.
	   ``It would seem that the priority of the government of North
Korea and ours are not the same,'' said Justine Geldard, a Doctors
Without Borders spokeswoman based in Hong Kong.
	   ``We will pull out as a last resort,'' she said. ``If the
negotiations fail we may have no choice.''
	   Claus said September was the deadline for a decision. The group,
one of a half-dozen aid organizations in the North Korea, has 12
people working in 3 provinces, he said.

Tax authorities seize cars from Ukraine's debtor companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Continuing their crackdown on tax
delinquents, tax authorities in Ukraine have seized more than 2,000
cars from debtor companies and plan to sell dozens of them,
newspapers said Wednesday.
	   Chief executives of debtor organizations and companies would be
ordered to organize the sales and then surrender the money to the
government, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   The daily Fakty said 2,293 vehicles were seized by tax
officials, to be returned only after the debts are paid. Officials
plan to sell 44 cars that would bring the budget 194,000 hryvna
(dlrs 92,400), it said.
	   The unorthodox crackdown began earlier this month after the
government reported a ``critical'' situation with budget revenues
and Pension Fund payments.
	   Ukraine has been plagued with poor tax collection since
independence in 1991. The situation got worse this year, with the
government spending more than 90 percent of budget revenues to
cover foreign debts.
	   The state is currently owed 7 billion hryvna (about dlrs 3.5
billion) in taxes, or about a third of annual budget revenues. The
debt to the state Pension Fund stands at about 3 billion hryvna
(dlrs 1.5 billion).
	   Last week, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko summoned nearly
1,500 business executives and regional officials from among the top
debtors to a civil defense forest base near the capital, Kiev.
	   He said the debtors would live in tents and listen to lectures
on natural disasters until they agree to pay their overdue taxes.
But the debtors, in fact, left the camp within two to three days,
mostly limiting themselves to promises.
	   Another group of executives is expected to arrive in the camp on
Thursday, the Dyen newspaper reported.
	   Pustovoitenko also has threatened to fine and even prosecute top
officials from debtor organizations and companies.
	   ``After fines we'll have to resort to criminal proceedings,'' he
said last week.
	   The prime minister's crackdown, however, has yielded few results
so far.
	   As of last week, the debtor executives have channeled some 100
million hryvna (dlrs 47 million) to the Pension Fund, and 63
million hryvna (dlrs 31.5 million) to the budget.

Anti-car theft plan to make border with Palestinians a reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stung by an epidemic of car thefts, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has come up with an
ambitious plan to create an obstacle course of boulders, concrete
walls and electronic devices separating Israel and the West Bank.
	   But the plan has drawn an outcry from hard-line members of
Netanyau's coalition, who say it will create a de facto border
between Israel and land it has not agreed to give up.
	   A recent police report showed that a car is stolen every 12
seconds in Israel, with most ending up in Palestinian areas of the
West Bank. In response, Israel's Cabinet voted this week to erect
barriers along about 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the 324
kilometer-long (200 mile) pre-1967 border between Israel and the
West Bank _ known as the Green Line.
	   Netanyahu's government had in the past strongly opposed a plan
by its dovish predecessors to set up a ``separation zone'' of
fences, watch towers and electronic surveillance along the Green
Line.
	   Critics argued that the new plan could pre-empt the outcome of
negotiations on a final peace agreement with the Palestinians. The
Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, an idea opposed by Netanyahu's government.
	   ``We are throwing money away,'' said Deputy Education Minister
Moshe Peled. ``I am sure this intelligent country can think up
better ways to fight theft and terror than re-making a non-existent
border.''
	   Peled said the Cabinet decision would give the Palestinians
false hope that Israel might one day return all of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War, getting rid of the barbed wire that marked the border and
building new roads and settlements across it.
	   Ephraim Sneh, a former general and a leading member of the
opposition Labor Party, said the government was only belatedly
recognizing reality.
	   ``This is the actual border,'' he said Wednesday. ``At last they
are doing what we recommended when we were in power.''
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the police also
want the government to fund the deployment of an additional 2,000
troops along the Green Line to prevent thieves from skirting
checkpoints by using back roads.
	   Other critics said the government's decision was hasty.
	   Uzi Landau, chairman of parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the government should formulate a new security
doctrine before deciding whether to set up a divider, however
temporary.
	   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the dovish opposition Meretz
Party, said the Cabinet decision was final proof that the hardline
government had abandoned its claims to all of the West Bank.
	   ``It has again been proven that the viewpoint of the dovish camp
is the more sober and practical one,'' Sarid told Israeli newspaper
Yediot Ahronot.

Indonesian Supreme Court annuls ruling on Megawati lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Supreme Court has ruled that a
lower court has no authority to proceed with a lawsuit filed by
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the ousted leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party.
	   In its Aug. 18 decision, the country's highest tribunal upheld a
verdict by the Central Jakarta Court two years ago that was later
annulled by Jakarta's High Court.
	   Megawati was removed from the Christian-nationalist coalition
party, known as PDI, in a military-sponsored party congress in June
1996, when Indonesia was still under the authority of former
President Suharto.
	   In May, President B.J. Habibie took over from Suharto after
riots and protests, pledging democratic reforms in the nation of
202 million.
	   Megawati, the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesian's founding
president, filed the lawsuit in October the same year against 16
breakaway PDI leaders, the home affairs minister, the armed forces
chief and chief of police for allegedly plotting her ouster.
	   ``The Supreme Court ruling shows that there is no significant
change in the legal system even under the dubbed `reform
government' that replaced the autocratic one,'' said Megawati's
chief lawyer, Robert O. Tambunan.
	   The district court had ruled that the matter was an ``internal
affair'' of the party, but Megawati appealed to the high court,
which in October last year ruled on her favor.
	   But the government-backed party leaders and other defendants
appealed to the Supreme Court.
	   ``This is undoubtedly a politically inspired ruling. It runs
against the feelings of law and justice of the society,'' Tambunan
said.
	   Megawati was ousted because of her consistent call for greater
democracy in the country, which was ruled with an iron hand by
Suharto for the last three decades.
	   Her ouster triggered riots in Jakarta on July 27, 1996,
following the storming of the party's headquarters by police and
Soerjadi's supporters.
	   At least five people were killed and more tan a dozen are still
missing from the rioting.

 &UR; Belgium says chance of 6th evacuation flight from Kinshasa fading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium said Tuesday chances were
fading that Congo will let it organize a sixth charter flight to
complete the evacuation of some 1,000 foreigners from Kinshasa.
	   ``I fear that flight it won't happen. I don't think that we are
going to get'' approval from Kinsahsa, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Huub Cooeremans.
	   Since last Saturday, Belgium has charted five civillian planes
that have ferried 981 foreigners from Kinshasa to Libreville,
Gabon. Seventy others, who want to leave, remained in Kinshasa and
the Belgian government hoped it could get Congo to agree to a sixth
evacuation flight.

Syria says no peace talks without full commitment to withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Peace talks with Israel cannot resume
without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a government newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The comment in the daily Tishrin came a day after Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai urged resuming negotiations,
saying Israel had a new formula for the Golan but making clear it
did not involve a full pullback.
	   ``The road of peace is clear to whoever wants peace. Without a
full commitment to the principle of a full pullout from the Golan
and the establishment of just and equal security arrangements, the
peace negotiations will not see light once again,'' Tishrin said in
an editorial.
	   The comment echoed Syria long-standing position on the Golan,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later
declared annexed. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than two
years ago.
	   Syria and the previous Israeli government reached an informal
agreement on a full withdrawal from Golan, but the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected that agreement,
saying it was never completed.
	   Other Syrian government-run newspapers also responded to
Mordechai's comments. The daily Al-Thawra said Israeli statements
are no longer of concern to Syria.
	   ``What really concern us is a binding and responsible stand, a
thing which the Israeli leaders lack,'' it said.
	   The English-language Syria Time said: ``Syria is not in a hurry
to achieve an unjust peace. Unjust peace is tantamount to war ...
It's rejected.''

Swiss judge recommends Pakistan indict Ms. Bhutto, her lawyer says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge has decided that there is sufficient
evidence to indict former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on charges
of money laundering, her Swiss lawyer said Wednesday.
	   But Geneva-based Judge Daniel Devaud, who already has filed
similar charges against Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has
decided against charging Ms. Bhutto himself, said the attorney,
Dominique Poncet.

Thai prime minister urges Cabinet to more transparency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has warned
his Cabinet that lack of transparency by some ministers could
undermine public trust in the government, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   The Nation cited an unnamed government source as saying Chuan
was concerned about growing public distrust and pointed to media
coverage of alleged corruption among state-run hospitals in buying
overpriced medicines and equipment.
	   The Rural Doctors Society has reportedly alleged that government
hospitals are purchasing drugs and medical equipment from specific
companies at two to three times the regular price.
	   Chuan told the Cabinet that the Ministry of Public Health has
denied any wrongdoing and that the senior officials at the ministry
suspected that the accusations have been spread by companies that
lost on the bids.

Russian police seize mine from woman's handbag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police detained a woman who was carrying an
anti-personnel mine in her handbag as she walked along a city
street in a restive southern Russian region, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The woman, who was not identified, said she had just found the
mine and was taking it to a police station, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   But police said the mine looked suspiciously clean for an object
found on the street and that the woman was walking in the opposite
direction from the nearest police station.
	   The report did not say what triggered police officers'
suspicions of the woman.
	   The incident took place in the town of Izobilny in the Stavropol
region, which borders on breakaway Chechnya and other volatile
regions, Dagestan and Ingushetia. The area is teeming with weapons
and frequently troubled by violence.

	   At the moment Pakistan authorities have blocked Ms. Bhutto from
leaving the country because of her legal problems there, noted
Poncet. Even if he were to indict her himself, she would be under
no obligation to face charges here, he added.
	   Devaud, instead, has formally asked Swiss federal authorities to
relay his recommendation to the Pakistan government that it indict
her in Pakistan, Poncet said.

	   Swiss federal officials in Bern said they were unable to comment
on whether Devaud's recommendation had been relayed to Pakistan.
	   Pakistani Ambassador S.M. Inamullah said in Bern that he would
be informed of any recommendation only after the Swiss Embassy in
Islamabad had passed it on to his government.
	   Devaud said last month when he charged Zardari that he was
trying to determine whether Ms. Bhutto could claim diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity before deciding whether to charge her in
Switzerland.
	   Pakistani officials have said the gave Devaud numerous documents
that showed Zardari and Ms. Bhutto had used Swiss connections to
receive kickbacks on Pakistan government contracts.
	   Ms. Bhutto has rejected the allegations as being concocted by
her political adversaries.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in November 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule, which she claims are concocted
by political opponents. Zardari was widely blamed for her downfall.
	   Late last month, Ms. Bhutto asked a provincial court in Pakistan
to declare illegal documents she said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
government sent to Swiss officials.
	   The Pakistan government maintains kickbacks from Pakistani
government contracts flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   In June, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ two who were
executives of companies that did business with Pakistan and a
lawyer who served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family frozen in seven Geneva banks.

Thai banks' lending rates at nine-month low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 5th graf that June's 19 percent interest rate was
repurchase rate sted prime rate.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's biggest commercial bank
announced Wednesday it was cutting its lending rates by half a
percentage point, as prime rates at the country's top banks fell
below 15.25 percent for the first time in nine months.
	   Bangkok Bank said that effective Tuesday it had lowered its
prime rate, or minimum lending rate, to 15.00 percent from 15.50
percent.
	   The country's second-largest bank, state-owned Krung Thai Bank,
lowered its prime rate 0.25 percentage point to 15.00 percent
effective Wednesday.
	   Commercial bank prime rates have come down in response to a
relaxation of central bank monetary policy in mid-June, following
the stabilization of the baht in foreign exchange markets.
	   The repurchase rate _ the interest rate charged for lending
between the central bank and commercial banks _ had been 19 percent
before then. It is now 10.25 percent.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said in early
July that keeping short-term interest rates too high for too long
damages Thailand's prospects for recovery. They were raised last
year in an effort to strengthen the baht as Asia's economies melted
down.
	   Tight money policy was mandated by the terms of a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout organized by the International Monetary Fund.
	   As the country fell deeper into recession in the first half of
1998, commercial bank and finance company lending collapsed.
	   Institutions are still loathe to risk new lending as loan-loss
provisioning requirements have been tightened and non-performing
loans head towards an estimated 40 percent of total loans.
	   Total commercial bank loans grew only 2.9 percent between the
end of December and the end of June, according to central bank
data.

Malaysia has low foreign debt burden, says deputy PM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's relatively low foreign
debt burdens have given it more leeway to dodge the worst effects
of the region's economic crisis, the deputy prime minister said
Wednesday.
	   ``I'd like to make it clear that our foreign debt servicing is
still low, at less than 6 percent of the value of our exports,''
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told reporters.
	   ``We are still able to maintain our foreign reserves. This gives
us some room,'' said Anwar, who's also finance minister. He didn't
elaborate on what the government planned to do with the space for
maneuvering.
	   Malaysia's foreign reserves have hovered at around dlrs 21
billion over the past few months, which is equivalent to about 3.5
percent of total imports.
	   Nevertheless, he said the government would still be looking for
foreign loans. The country's leaders have previously said they are
seeking extra funding from Japan and agencies like the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The government is also preparing to announce new economic
measures ``in due course,'' Anwar said, though he didn't indicate
what these measures could be.
	   Meanwhile, he also backed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's view
that the government should examine ways to support the stock
market, including using the Tabung Haji _ a fund which helps
Muslims save cash to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   After Mahathir's Tuesday announcement, traders said share-prices
on Malaysia's benchmark stock index surged strongly on Wednesday,
with most of the buying coming from state-linked funds and
speculative purchases by traders.
	   Nevertheless, they warned that government coffers are already
stretched and the money required for sustaining a continued climb
in the stock market is in short supply.

German medical student jailed for ecstasy tablets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A German medical student was sentenced
Wednesday to five and a half years in jail for smuggling ecstasy
tablets worth more than U.S. 175,000 (Australian dollars 300,000)
into Australia.
	   Peter Schubert, 34, pleaded guilty in the West Australia state
Supreme Court to importing 513 grams of ecstasy seized by police at
Perth airport on March 30 this year.
	   ``You and three other persons...were each wearing a girdle
beneath your clothing, and inside each girdle there were six socks
containing (a total of 6,007) tablets,'' judge Henry Wallwork said
at a sentencing hearing.
	   ``Some young people have their lives ruined by these drugs and,
of course, their families also suffer greatly from the results of
their drug abuse.''
	   With a street value of about U.S. dlrs 30 (Australian dollars 50
per tablet), the ecstasy was estimated to be worth more than U.S.
dlrs 175,000 (Australian dollars 300,000).
	   Schubert, who will be eligible for parole after 30 months, told
the court he was offered about U.S. dlrs 5,000 (Australian dollars
8,400) by a friend of his 21-year-old wife to bring the drugs into
Australia from Amsterdam.
	   The court heard that at the time, the fifth-year medical student
was desperate for money to support his wife and 18-month-old son.
	   Australian Federal Police arrested Schubert at the airport,
along with fellow accused Monika Jezowski, 32, Linda Diefenbach,
31, and 35-year-old Jorge Lindke.
	   Jezowski pleaded guilty earlier this month to drug trafficking,
and will be sentenced in the Supreme Court on Aug. 28.
	   The other two Germans will plead to similar charges at the
Supreme Court on Sept. 1.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's banking system can survive the current
financial crisis and the sharp devaluation of the ruble if the
government takes measures to prevent panic, the leader of Russia's
banking association said Wednesday.
	   ``The main goal is to calm people and restore confidence in the
banking community,'' Sergei Yegorov, who chairs the Association of
Russian Banks, said at a news conference.
	   Banking analysts have predicted that a third to a half of
Russian banks may fail, largely because they are over-dependent on
ruble assets that are worth a third less after Monday's effective
devaluation.
	   Yegorov tried to sound upbeat, predicting that the majority of
Russia's 1,600 commercial banks would be able to overcome the
current crisis. He said only between 200 and 250 banks are in the
immediate danger.
	   Many customers visiting Moscow banks on Wednesday didn't share
Yegorov's optimism.
	   ``The banks are in danger and withdrawal is the only reasonable
thing now,'' said Semyon Shengelai, 51, a construction manager, who
tried to close his dollar account in SBS-Agro, one of Russia's
largest banks.
	   Like clients at other banks, he was told to return in several
days if he wanted to get dollars. Banks were paying out rubles,
however, at the official rate, which stood at 6.9 after brief
trading Wednesday.
	   At exchange booths on the street, however, the dollar was
trading between 8 and 9.5 _ the lower end of the trading band set
by the government on Monday.
	   ``It's vexing. I don't want any rubles at this rate,'' said
Nikolai Ivanov, another exasperated bank client. The ruble will
keep falling.''
	   The Central Bank predicted that the national currency will
stabilize at around 7 rubles a dollar in the next few days as the
market regulates itself.
	   The bank has been keeping a tight rein on the currency markets.
Trading on the major interbank market was suspended last week as
banks feared doing business with each other. The smaller, Central
Bank-controlled MICEX exchange opened for trading for just 35
minutes Wednesday, with the ruble ending at 6.99 to the dollar.
	   In a move to curb the currency speculation, the Central Bank
also ordered that any exchange offices whose rates for buying and
selling foreign currency are more than 15 percent apart will face
swift punishment.
	   Yegorov attributed the current shortage of dollars at local bank
branches to purely technical problems resulting from the increased
demand for hard currency. He said the Central Bank has agreed to
sell commercial banks more dollars to cope with the higher demand.
	   He also called on the government to approve legislation that
would reassure the Russians who keep an estimated dlrs 80 billion
in savings under their mattresses. Only about 30 percent of
Russians' savings are deposited in banks, one reason lines at most
banks remained at usual length despite the crisis.
	   In other developments Wednesday:
	   _ The Russian economy continues to contract at a rapid rate. GDP
fell by 4.5 percent in July compared to last year _ the sharpest
monthly drop since September 1996, according to the State
Statistics Committee.
	   Meanwhile, industrial output in July fell by as much as 9.4
percent compared to 1997, the committee said. This was the sharpest
fall since December 1994.
	   _ In a reaction to the financial crisis, the government
announced it was postponing the sale of a 5 percent stake in the
state natural gas giant RAO Gazprom _ one of a number of
privatizations designed to raise cash for the federal budget.
	   _ The government postponed announcement of a controversial debt
restructuring plan until Monday in an apparent sign that it is
reconsidering terms that would have been especially painful for
foreign investors.
	   The government said it wasn't able to meet payments on the
treasury notes, and would force investors to accept longer-term
paper. Foreign investors have sharply criticized informal drafts of
the plan, which they feared would give Russian banks preferential
treatment.

Ukrainian Cabinet discusses 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet held a session Wednesday
to discuss the 1999 budget draft that it wants to submit to
parliament next month.
	   The initial version presented by Finance Ministry officials
provided for combined state and regional budget revenues of 26.2
billion hryvna (dlrs 12.5 billion at the present exchange rate) and
spending of 27.9 billion hryvna (dlrs 13.3 billion).
	   The draft also included an estimated 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 3
billion) to service the mounting state debt in 1999, a significant
increase from the 3.6 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.7 billion) this year.
	   The government ordered all ministries to submit budget proposals
by Aug. 25, and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said he wants
to submit the draft to parliament by Sept. 10.

Ukraine's defense minister pleads for more money in 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's defense minister pleaded with the
Cabinet on Wednesday to allocate more money for the former Soviet
republic's military in its 1999 budget draft.
	   The minister, Oleksandr Kuzmuk, noted that his ministry was
allocated 1.6 billion hryvna (about dlrs 762 million at the current
exchange rate) in 1998, which only covers 46 percent of what the
army needs.
	   The draft budget for 1999 earmarks an ``unrealistic'' 1.3
billion hryvna (dlrs 620 million) for the ministry, and ``the
consequences of that decision might be tragic,'' Kuzmuk told
government officials at a Cabinet session.
	   He appealed to the Cabinet to allocate at least ``the minimum
necessary sum'' for the military, providing for the payment of
salaries, clothes, food and the preservation of the country's
defense capabilities, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ukraine's military, presently comprising 350,000 people, is to
be slashed by 17,000 servicemen in 1998, according to the Defense
Ministry. The army, like that in neighboring Russia and other
ex-Soviet republics, has been badly hurt by the Soviet collapse and
ensuing economic problems.

Watchdog slams Slovakia for weak human rights commitment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An international watchdog group for
human rights said Wednesday it fears that basic human and political
rights are under threat in Slovakia.
	   In a report released Wednesday, the Vienna-based International
Helsinki Federation for Human Rights and the Slovak Helsinki
Committee addressed what they see as 14 crucial human and political
rights problems facing the Slovak government and people.
	   Representatives of the two groups told reporters they aimed to
point out issues that pose the greatest threat to democracy in
Slovakia, which split peacefully from the Czech Republic in 1993.
Major problems include the government's altering of ballots for a
referendum on NATO and the direct elections of the president in
1997, freedom of the media, criminal investigations and minority
rights, they said.
	   ``We are worried that basic political rights are under threat in
this country,'' said Aaron Routs, executive director of the IFH in
Vienna.
	   The report also comes in response to a statement made by Slovak
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who said that ``Slovakia guarantees
basic human rights.'' European and American officials have
criticized Meciar for undemocratic behavior.
	   Routs said the two groups were particularly ``concerned that the
election process may be manipulated, based on the behavior of the
government up to this point.'' Slovakia is to hold parliamentary
elections on Sept 25-26.
	   Last week, Meciar's party attempted to prevent the opposition
from registering as a political party, but the move was overruled
by the Supreme Court.
	   ``The attempt to take the opposition's registration from being
registered as a party, suggests that there is a fear of a fair
political contest,'' Roust said.

Swiss judge recommends Pakistan indict Bhutto, her lawyer says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge has decided that there is sufficient
evidence to indict former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
on charges of money laundering, her Swiss lawyer said Wednesday.
	   But the Geneva-based judge, who already has filed similar
charges against Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has
formally asked Swiss federal authorities to relay his
recommendation that Pakistan indict her, said the attorney,
Dominique Poncet.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in November 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule, which she claims are concocted
by political opponents. Zardari was widely blamed for her downfall.
	   Pakistan's government maintains that Ms. Bhutto and Zardari
received kickbacks from government contracts sent through companies
based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   Authorities have prevented Ms. Bhutto from leaving Pakistan
because of her legal problems there, Poncet said.
	   Poncet said Judge Daniel Devaud decided against indicting Bhutto
himself since she is under no obligation to face charges in
Switzerland.
	   Devaud said last month that he was trying to determine whether
Ms. Bhutto could claim diplomatic or parliamentary immunity before
deciding whether to charge her in Switzerland.
	   Swiss federal officials in Bern declined to comment on whether
Devaud's recommendation had been relayed to Pakistan.
	   Pakistani Ambassador S.M. Inamullah said in Bern that he would
be informed of any recommendation only after the Swiss embassy in
Islamabad had passed it on to his government.
	   Pakistani officials have given Devaud numerous documents that
showed Zardari and Ms. Bhutto had used Swiss connections to receive
kickbacks on Pakistan government contracts.
	   Ms. Bhutto says the allegations were concocted by her political
adversaries.
	   In June, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ two who were
executives of companies that did business with Pakistan and a
lawyer who served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Swiss authorities have frozen about 20 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and her
family in seven Geneva banks.

Five killed, seven injured in flash floods in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed five people and
injured seven in northern and southern Yemen, a government official
said Wednesday.
	   Three people were killed Tuesday in a valley in the southern
province of Abyan, one was reported missing and two others were
seriously injured, the official said, speaking under customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Two people were killed and five others seriously injured in the
northern Sada province Tuesday after a four-story building they
were staying in was destroyed by floods.
	   Last week, 18 people were killed in floods in different parts of
Yemen.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

US Marines hunker down to guard US compound after terrorist threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ About 120 heavily armed Marines were
hunkered down Wednesday around the U.S. diplomatic compound,
providing what their commander described as ``robust security''
against a possible terrorist attack.
	   The Marines from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit were rushed
to the compound Sunday after U.S. officials learned of a possible
terror attack similar to the embassy bombings that killed 257
people in East Africa.
	   Another 200 Marines from the same unit are taking part in a NATO
exercise designed to show the Alliance's commitment to prevent the
fighting in neighboring Kosovo province from spilling over into
Albania and other countries of the southern Balkans.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said. ``Have we
made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think twice before
tackling it. This is robust security.''
	   U.S. officials have given few details of the threat which
prompted the heightened security. But Helland said his security
measures were designed to prevent a car bomb, similar to the ones
that killed 257 people at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   On Friday, the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of
all nonessential personnel and family members from Tirana, citing a
possible terror attack. The move followed press reports about the
possible presence in Albania of Islamic extremists.
	   One day before the Africa bombings, an Arabic language newspaper
in London, al-Hayat, published a letter from the ``International
Islamic Front for Jihad'' vowing revenge against the United States
for the arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   In order to prevent a repeat of the East Africa bombings, the
Marines have installed 3-meter (10-foot) iron barricades around the
Rilindja Ridge complex, home to American diplomats in Tirana and
the temporary site of the American embassy.
	   Marines in full battle gear, some armed with machine guns, stand
guard or are hunkered down in makeshift bunkers. Albanian police
and private Embassy security guards stop and search all vehicles
before allowing them to wind down the 500-meter (550-yard) dirt
road to the main gate.
	   A half dozen, 3-meter (10-foot) concrete cubes, decorated with
red and yellow flowers, stand in the middle of the road. Guards
even inspect military vehicles.
	   In addition, the USS Austin, with 400 additional Marines and 400
sailors, is moored about 15 kilometers (10 miles) offshore. Helland
said he can bring them ashore if he believes reinforcements are
necessary.
	   He said a decision will be taken later on whether to keep the
Marines there after the NATO exercise ends Friday.
	   In a letter Tuesday to Congress, President Bill Clinton said
U.S. authorities had received ``credible information of a possible
attack'' against the Tirana embassy ``similar to the attacks
against our missions'' in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.

Umpire incident prompts cricket security review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English cricket will undergo a security review
after umpire John Holder was knocked to the ground by an
over-zealous fan following a limited-overs between England and
South Africa at Edgbaston.
	   An English Cricket Board spokesman Wednesday said the incident
would be reviewed by the ground management working committee in the
lead-up to next year's cricket World Cup in England.
	   Holder was walking towards the pavilion after South Africa's
14-run win Tuesday when a member of the 20,000-strong crowd tried
to grab a stump from him. The stump contained a miniature camera
and was worth 10,000 pounds (dlrs 162,500).
	   The 53-year-old umpire, a former English county cricket fast
bowler, said it was a shock to be knocked to the ground.
	   Stewards restrained the fan and he was later taken into custody
by police but released.
	   ``I'm alright, but it's not something I want to happen again,''
Holder said.
	   ``I think he (the fan) wanted a stump. I'm not going to make a
complaint about it. The stewards dealt with it.''
	   England advanced to Thursday's limited-overs series final
against Sri Lanka despite losing to South Africa at Edgbaston.
South Africa scored 244 and needed to beat England by 47 runs to
earn a place in the final. England was all out for 230 in reply.
	   South African captain Hanse Cronje said his team was looking
forward to returning home for a short break after playing 16 tests
and 27 limited-overs internationals since October.

Spy agency summons Roman Catholic priests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government spy agency on Wednesday
summoned nine Roman Catholic priests for possible arrest on charges
of engaging in political activities during their visit to North
Korea.
	   The Rev. Moon Kyu-hyon and eight others will be interrogated on
whether they attended North Korean events aimed at denouncing rival
South Korea, said the Agency for National Security Planning,
Seoul's main watchdog against communist sympathizers.
	   The priests were allowed to make a seven-day visit last week to
North Korea on condition that they attend only religious functions
celebrating the Aug. 15 anniversary of Korea's liberation from
1910-45 Japanese colonial rule.
	   But they broke their promise _ and the South's draconian
national security laws _ by paying tribute to the late North Korean
President Kim Il Sung lying in state in a Pyongyang palace, agency
officials said, quoting North Korean news media.
	   The priests were members of the South's Korean Catholic Priests'
Council for Justice, a human rights group.
	   Upon their return home Wednesday, the priests refused to comment
on the charges against them.
	   Moon was convicted in 1990 of making an unauthorized visit to
North Korea and served three years of a five-year prison term
before being granted amnesty by the government.
	   No one from either North or South Korea can visit the other side
without approval from their governments, which is rarely given. But
several South Korean students have defied the ban and made illegal
visits to the North since the 1980s.
	   Five of them appeared in a news conference sponsored by the spy
agency Wednesday and accused North Korea of using South Korean
students for anti-Seoul propaganda.
	   ``We apologize to the people for illegally visiting the North,''
said Park Sung-hee, 29.
	   The five student leaders made their unauthorized visits to North
Korea between 1991 and 1996.
	   They were dispatched by Hanchongryon, South Korea's largest
student group, which is outlawed for its pro-North Korean demands,
including the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. soldiers from South Korea.
	   After their North Korean visits, they had stayed in Berlin as
political refugees.
	   They returned home in early this month, saying they were
disenchanted with the North Korean regime. Prosecutors questioned
but released them after they criticized North Korea.
	   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a bloody three-year war in the early 1950s.

India's court stops death sentence to woman following protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The first woman in India to be sentenced
to death won a reprieve Wednesday when the Supreme Court reduced
the sentence to life term in jail following widespread protests,
local news agencies reported.
	   The case against Ram Shri was taken up by the
government-appointed National Commission for Women, which pleaded
that she should not be sentenced to death because her
three-year-old daughter would be orphaned.
	   Shri along with her parents and a brother were all sentenced to
death by a local magistrate in the state of Uttar Pradesh on
charges of murdering four neighbors, United News of India and Press
Trust of India news agencies reported.
	   On Wednesday, three Supreme Court justices reduced the sentence
to life term in jail, saying the death sentence is awarded only in
the ``rarest of rare cases,'' which the case did not fit into.
	   Death sentences are rare in India and are usually carried out
through hanging.

Two dead, one missing after plane crashes in sea off New Zealand

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A twin-engine sightseeing plane
carrying 10 people including a family from the Bahamas crashed into
the Foveaux Strait south of New Zealand's South Island on
Wednesday, killing four people and leaving a 7-year-old boy
missing, police said.
	   Most of the five survivors, who were in the water for an hour,
were taken to hospital with hypothermia and other injuries, police
spokesman Paul Visser told The Associated Press.
	   Police identified the injured as Adam Chisholm, 78, of
Invercargill, New Zealand; John Chisholm, 43, of the Bahamas;
George Chisholm, 11, of the Bahamas, Samantha Chisholm, 10, of the
Bahamas; and Brian McEwan, late 40s, of Invercargill.
	   The missing boy Russell Chisholm, from the Bahamas, had not been
found when police called off a sea search late Wednesday night, and
was presumed drowned.
	   A mayday call was received by Invercargill Airport four minutes
after the South Air Cessna 402 aircraft took off from Stewart
Island, which is below the South Island, said constable Visser.
	   Both engines shut down and the plane crashed in the strait, he
said. Search aircraft and fishing boats found the wreckage near the
fishing port of Bluff, at the tip of the South Island.
	   Survivors and the bodies of the dead were pulled from the sea
and taken ashore for transfer by helicopter to hospital. After
initially reporting two deaths, police said later that four bodies
were pulled from the water.
	   The five injured were taken to Southland Hospital in
Invercargill, ambulance superintendent Bob Cooper told National
Radio.
	   ``They range from very serious to serious, at this stage,'' he
said. ``We believe four of the persons taken to hospital are
adults, and one child.''
	   Search boats and helicopters using lights continued to comb the
area after nightfall for the missing boy, as weather forecasters
issued a gale warning for the strait area.
	   The search was called off about 10:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) and would
be resumed at dawn Thursday, Invercargill police spokesman Tim
Brown said.
	   The four people who died are pilot Robin Ronald Andrews, 51, of
Invercargill; Eric Hawkes, 58, of Invercargill; Caroline Gay
Francis, 39, of Stewart Island; and Ivan Thomas Mitchell, 57, of
Christchurch.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's banking system can survive the current
financial crisis and the sharp devaluation of the ruble if the
government takes measures to prevent panic, the leader of Russia's
banking association said Wednesday.
	   ``The main goal is to calm people and restore confidence in the
banking community,'' Sergei Yegorov, who chairs the Association of
Russian Banks, said at a news conference.
	   Banking analysts have predicted that a third to a half of
Russian banks may fail, largely because they are over-dependent on
ruble assets that are worth a third less after Monday's effective
devaluation.
	   Yegorov tried to sound upbeat, predicting that the majority of
Russia's 1,600 commercial banks would be able to overcome the
current crisis. He said only between 200 and 250 banks are in the
immediate danger.
	   Many customers visiting Moscow banks on Wednesday didn't share
Yegorov's optimism.
	   ``The banks are in danger and withdrawal is the only reasonable
thing now,'' said Semyon Shengelai, 51, a construction manager, who
tried to close his dollar account in SBS-Agro, one of Russia's
largest banks.
	   Like clients at other banks, he was told to return in several
days if he wanted to get dollars. Banks were paying out rubles,
however, at the official rate, which stood at 6.9 after brief
trading Wednesday.
	   At exchange booths on the street, however, the dollar was
trading between 8 and 9.5 _ the lower end of the trading band set
by the government on Monday.
	   ``It's vexing. I don't want any rubles at this rate,'' said
Nikolai Ivanov, another exasperated bank client. The ruble will
keep falling.''
	   The Central Bank predicted that the national currency will
stabilize at around 7 rubles a dollar in the next few days as the
market regulates itself.
	   The bank has been keeping a tight rein on the currency markets.
Trading on the major interbank market was suspended last week as
banks feared doing business with each other. The smaller, Central
Bank-controlled MICEX exchange opened for trading for just 35
minutes Wednesday, with the ruble ending at 6.99 to the dollar.
	   Yegorov attributed the current shortage of dollars at local bank
branches to purely technical problems resulting from the increased
demand for hard currency. He said the Central Bank has agreed to
sell commercial banks more dollars to cope with the higher demand.
	   He also called on the government to approve legislation that
would reassure the Russians who keep an estimated dlrs 80 billion
in savings under their mattresses. Only about 30 percent of
Russians' savings are deposited in banks, one reason lines at most
banks remained at usual length despite the crisis.
	   In other developments Wednesday:
	   _ The Russian economy continues to contract at a rapid rate. GDP
fell by 4.5 percent in July compared to last year _ the sharpest
monthly drop since September 1996, according to the State
Statistics Committee.
	   Meanwhile, industrial output in July fell by as much as 9.4
percent compared to 1997, the committee said. This was the sharpest
fall since December 1994.
	   _ In a reaction to the financial crisis, the government
announced it was postponing the sale of a 5 percent stake in the
state natural gas giant RAO Gazprom _ one of a number of
privatizations designed to raise cash for the federal budget.
	   _ The government postponed announcement of a controversial debt
restructuring plan until Monday in an apparent sign that it is
reconsidering terms that would have been especially painful for
foreign investors.
	   The government said it wasn't able to meet payments on the
treasury notes, and would force investors to accept longer-term
paper. Foreign investors have sharply criticized informal drafts of
the plan, which they feared would give Russian banks preferential
treatment.
	   _ Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75,844
million rubles (around dlrs 100 million) as of the beginning of
this month, the State Statistics Committee said. The government has
said the debt restructuring and devaluation will make it possible
to fulfill its long-time pledge to pay off those wage arrears.
	   _ Real income of Russians dropped 8.9 percent in the first seven
months of the year in comparison with the same period in 1997,
according to the government statistics.

Truck hijackers kidnapped driver's son because he was cute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two thieves who hijacked a truck and
trailer from a man whose three-year-old son was sleeping inside
said they took the boy along because he was cute, police said
Wednesday.
	   Attavee Chumsai, 25, and Pornchai Sintra, 23, overpowered
Somchai Pachai's father Sunday and stole the truck. They abandoned
it in Pathumthani province, near Bangkok, that night after it broke
down and fled with the boy, police said.
	   They later left him with Pornchai's brother before taking a taxi
to buy amphetamines in downtown Bangkok. After the purchase, they
forced the driver at gun point to drive them back to Pathumthani,
firing shots out the window along the way.
	   Desperate to save his life, the driver, Suphan Pukoksoong,
pulled up by a police station and dashed inside screaming for help.
The pair drove off in his cab, but were cornered by police cars
about two kilometers (1.2 miles) down the road.
	   Police said the two suspects will be charged with car theft and
possessing firearms, but not kidnapping for the moment. They told
police that they meant no harm to the boy, who they described as
cute. There was no suggestion of sexual abuse.
	   Somchai has been returned to his parents.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium said Tuesday chances were
fading that Congo will let it organize a sixth charter flight to
complete the evacuation of some 1,000 foreigners from Kinshasa.
	   ``I fear that flight it won't happen. I don't think that we are
going to get'' approval from Kinsahsa, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Huub Cooeremans.
	   Since last Saturday, Belgium has charted five civillian planes
that have ferried 981 foreigners from Kinshasa to Libreville,
Gabon. Seventy others, who want to leave, remained in Kinshasa and
the Belgian government hoped it could get Congo to agree to a sixth
evacuation flight.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A twin-engine sightseeing plane
carrying 10 people including a family from the Bahamas crashed into
the Foveaux Strait south of New Zealand's South Island on
Wednesday, killing four people and leaving a 7-year-old boy
missing, police said.
	   Most of the five survivors, who were in the water for an hour,
were taken to hospital with hypothermia and other injuries, police
spokesman Paul Visser told The Associated Press.
	   Police identified the injured as Adam Chisholm, 78, of
Invercargill, New Zealand; John Chisholm, 43, of the Bahamas;
George Chisholm, 11, of the Bahamas, Samantha Chisholm, 10, of the
Bahamas; and Brian McEwan, late 40s, of Invercargill.
	   The missing boy Russell Chisholm, from the Bahamas, had not been
found when police called off a sea search late Wednesday night, and
was presumed drowned.
	   A mayday call was received by Invercargill Airport four minutes
after the South Air Cessna 402 aircraft took off from Stewart
Island, which is below the South Island, said constable Visser.
	   Both engines shut down and the plane crashed in the strait, he
said. Search aircraft and fishing boats found the wreckage near the
fishing port of Bluff, at the tip of the South Island.
	   Survivors and the bodies of the dead were pulled from the sea
and taken ashore for transfer by helicopter to hospital. After
initially reporting two deaths, police said later that four bodies
were pulled from the water.
	   The five injured were taken to Southland Hospital in
Invercargill, ambulance superintendent Bob Cooper told National
Radio.
	   ``They range from very serious to serious, at this stage,'' he
said. ``We believe four of the persons taken to hospital are
adults, and one child.''
	   Search boats and helicopters using lights continued to comb the
area after nightfall for the missing boy, as weather forecasters
issued a gale warning for the strait area.
	   The search was called off about 10:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) and would
be resumed at dawn Thursday, Invercargill police spokesman Tim
Brown said.
	   The four people who died are pilot Robin Ronald Andrews, 51, of
Invercargill; Eric Hawkes, 58, of Invercargill; Caroline Gay
Francis, 39, of Stewart Island; and Ivan Thomas Mitchell, 57, of
Christchurch.

IRA dissidents `suspend' bombing as its victims are laid to rest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with funerals, CORRECTS spelling of Shaun &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army
dissidents who committed Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
atrocity pledged Wednesday to stop bombing, hours before most of
their victims were laid to rest.
	   The so-called ``Real IRA,'' until now committed to wrecking the
IRA cease-fire of July 1997, announced it had indefinitely
``suspended'' its efforts to bomb Northern Ireland towns ``as a
direct result of the Omagh tragedy.''
	   Although they denied trying to kill anybody, the dissidents' car
bomb Saturday in the religiously mixed town killed 28 civilians and
wounded 220, mostly women and children.
	   While some politicians greeted the announcement with relief,
Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern Ireland, Mo
Mowlam, called it ``an insult'' to the dead and maimed.
	   Noting the 13 funerals taking place Wednesday in and near Omagh
and three more in the Irish Republic seaside resort of Buncrana,
she said: ``The pain and grief are such that this is just a little
too late.''
	   In Buncrana, on Ireland's rugged northwest coast, an estimated
8,000 mourners bade an anguished farewell to the town's three lost
boys _ James Barker and Shaun McLaughlin, both 12, and Oran
Doherty, 8 _ who died after they accompanied Spanish exchange
students across the border to visit a historical park near Omagh.
	   ``We all feel responsible ... but there was supposed to be
peace,'' said the school principal, Sinead McLaughlin, whose
students formed a uniformed guard of honor alongside all three
coffins en route to St. Mary's Catholic Church. Shaun was an altar
boy at another local church.
	   James' parents, Donna and Victor Barker, who had moved to
Buncrana from their native England last year for a better quality
of life, looked like broken souls as they walked behind their son's
casket.
	   Oran's six siblings, from his 3-year-old brother Oisin to
20-year-old Amanda, linked arms behind his coffin, which was draped
in the green-and-white banner of the soccer team he loved, Glasgow
Celtic.
	   Two Spaniards _ 24-year-old teacher Rocia Ramos and 12-year-old
student Fernando Bacelga, who had been living with the Barker
family _ also died in the blast and were buried Tuesday in their
native Madrid.
	   In Buncrana, children led the congregation in special prayers
for their souls in English, Spanish and Gaelic.
	   Fernando's older brother and more than 30 Spanish students _
some bearing bandages from shrapnel wounds and perforated eardrums
_ and their relatives attended the Buncrana service. Ten Spanish
students remain hospitalized, including two girls with critical
head wounds.
	   The Rev. Shane Bradley, Buncrana's Omagh-born priest, noted that
more than 3,000 people had been killed in the past three decades of
conflict over Northern Ireland, but that this appeared to be ``our
saddest moment, our darkest hour.''
	   ``This wound runs too deep, and the scar will be on us all 'til
we go to our own graves,'' he said.
	   In the church were Irish President Mary McAleese and Jose Maria
Sanz-Pastor, Spain's ambassador for Ireland. Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, walked
closely behind the three boys' coffins.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant first
minister of Northern Ireland's new cross-community government
established by the agreement, also attended, before heading for
Omagh for the funerals of a 60-year-old man and his 27-year-old
son.
	   Trimble said he found the Real IRA's statement that it would
suspend violence ``pretty contemptible'' and untrustworthy, since
their misleading phoned warnings in Omagh had ``herded the people
directly to the car bomb like lambs to the slaughter.''
	   He said the continuing threat posed by dissidents underscored
his demand for IRA commanders to start handing over their hidden
weaponry to international arms inspectors, as April's agreement
calls for.
	   Trimble will meet Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin on
Wednesday evening to be briefed on plans by the Irish government to
suppress the Real IRA and imprison its commanders.
	   Speaking before the Irish Cabinet met in emergency session to
strategize with security chiefs, Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney
said she had ``no doubt that we will agree to the introduction of
what's necessary to destroy this organization. We are going to put
them down and it's as simple as that.''
	   The village of Dunnamanagh, midway between Buncrana and Omagh 40
miles (65 kms) to the south, also ground to a grief-stricken
standstill for the Catholic burial of 21-month-old Breda Devine,
who was born three months prematurely and spent most of her life
ailing before being slain in the bombing.
	   Her mother Tracey, 27, remains hospitalized with burns over half
her body.
	   The oldest victim, 65-year-old Mary Grimes, was buried after
Requiem Mass in the village of Beragh. Her 30-year-old daughter and
18-month-old granddaughter were the first of Omagh's dead to be
buried Tuesday.

	   TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) _ A car on Wednesday crashed through a
police barrier outside a hotel where Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is vacationing, police said.
	   Three policemen were lightly injured, said police spokesman Boaz
Goldberg. The car carrying three people got away and was chased by
police, Goldberg said, adding that the driver's motive was not

Estrada says former Marcos general can return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday a former military chief who fled with former strongman
Ferdinand Marcos into exile in 1986 is no longer a security threat
and can return home.
	   But Estrada said Gen. Fabian Ver will have to face charges of
being an accomplice in the 1983 killing of opposition leader
Benigno Aquino Jr if he decides to return.
	   Ver, one of Marcos' closest aides, fled with Marcos to Hawaii
after a ``people power'' revolt forced them from power.
	   Ver has since lived in an undisclosed country and has not been
permitted to come home. Presidential executive secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said there have been reports that Ver is ailing and wants to
return home.
	   ``Every Filipino, whether he has a pending court case or not,
has every right to return to his country,'' said Estrada. ``General
Ver, as a Filipino, has a right to come home.''
	   Former President Corazon Aquino, who rose to power after Marcos'
ouster, had banned Ver from returning, citing security threats.
	   Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino, continued the ban. Ramos was
Ver's deputy under the Marcos regime but later defected to the
military rebels who mutinied against Marcos.
	   Ver was accused of involvement as military chief in the 1983
assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. at Manila's airport but was
acquitted while Marcos was still in power.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos follower, said that although Ver will
have to face charges in the Aquino murder, he cannot be forced to
identify the mastermind of the assassination.
	   ``We are in a democracy,'' he added. ``It is his right if he
will speak or not. If he does not want to testify, we cannot force
him.''

Polish peacekeeper wounded in shellfire in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Polish soldier was wounded Wednesday when
a mortar round hit near the vehicle he was driving in south
Lebanon, U.N. officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said the 23-year-old Polish sergeant suffered shrapnel wounds to
his legs and was taken to a U.N. field hospital in the border town
of Naqoura.
	   The wounded man's name would not be released until his family
was notified, the officials said. The shell hit near Zibquine, a
Shiite Muslim village 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Tyre and
north of the Israeli-occupied border enclave,
	   U.N. officials were investigating whether the mortar was fired
by Israeli forces or the Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
seeking to expel Israeli soldiers from Lebanon.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after a brief Israeli
incursion. The 631-strong Polish contingent which deployed in 1992
has lost six soldiers.
	   Nine nations contribute to the 4,500-member UNIFIL force. They
are Finland, Italy, France, Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal
and Fiji.

Report: four killed in recent years at secret research institute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Four workers have been killed and 25 injured in
recent years in separate accidents at a secretive biological
weapons research institute near Tel Aviv, the British magazine
Foreign Report reported Wednesday.
	   In one of the accidents, Israeli authorities came close to
ordering the evacuation of homes near the Israel Biological
Research Institute in Nes Ziona, a small town about 20 miles (35
km) southeast of Tel Aviv, the report said.
	   Last year, an aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that no accidents have ever taken place at the facility. He was
responding to an Israeli legislator who said the institute posed a
danger to nearby homes and should be moved.
	   On Wednesday, David Bar-Illan, another Netanyahu aide, refused
comment on the Foreign Report story and on claims by the magazine
that Israel produces chemical and biological weapons at Nes Ziona.
	   Last year, Israel's Haaretz daily reported that the institute is
developing antidotes to various types of nerve gas, including the
deadly VX reportedly in Syrian hands.
	   A former director of the institute, Marcus Klingberg, was
sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1983 for reportedly passing
secrets about biological warfare to the Soviet Union. The trial was
held in secret and not made public until 1993.

	   BUNCRANA, Ireland (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese, who
attended Wednesday's funeral of three local boys killed in the
Omagh carbombing, brought along a poem by students at Buncrana's
elementary school.
	   The handwritten poem _ which uses the imagery of Protestant
orange and Catholic green _ celebrated April's peace agreement and
its overwhelming approval in public referendums the next month in
both parts of Ireland.
	   One of those slain Saturday, 12-year-old Shaun McLaughlin,
helped deliver it during a visit to her official Dublin residence

	   Under the proposed legislation, presented Tuesday by Justice
Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos, news directors who allow the
material to be broadcast would also face charges.
	   While slander and libel laws covering the media already exist,
the proposed amendment would expand the definition. For example,
insulting a politician or a member of the public through the
broadcast media would become a criminal offense.
	   But no guidelines have been presented yet on what constitutes an
insult and what can be deemed legitimate criticism or satire.
	   Yannopoulos' plan does not cover the print media and reflects
the free-for-all atmosphere in Greek broadcasting, particularly on
private radio and television. Some news programs degenerate into
shouting matches with guests trading barbs and accusations.
	   The proposed bill must be approved by parliament. No date for
the vote has been set.
	   The legislation could be unconstitutional, the Athens daily
Exousia said Wednesday, adding that it could be seen as ``the
criminalization of freedom of expression and of the free exchange
of views through the media.''
	   Yannopoulos' statements ``overturn the permanent principles
concerning press freedom,'' complained Aristides Manolakos,
president of the Athens Journalists' Union.
	   ``We hope the government will reconsider the issues before
proceeding with the submission of a draft bill restricting the
freedom of the press,'' he added.
	   Prokopis Pavlopoulos, deputy of the conservative opposition New
Democracy party, noted that ``Mr. Yannopoulos is the last person
who can give lessons concerning the decorum of political speech.''
	   Known for his outspoken and often abrupt manner, Yannopoulos was
often criticized for his own acid tongue in the early 1990s, when
he used a television show to defend the late Socialist Premier
Andreas Papandreou.
	   At the time, Papandreou was being tried on corruption charges by
a special court, and Yannopoulos spent hours lambasting and hurling
epithets at opponents, critics, judges and lawyers. Papandreou was
acquitted in January 1992.

Cars of late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to go on sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Luxury sedans given to late Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu _ including a Buick from former
President Richard Nixon _ will be offered at auction this fall, a
government employee said Wednesday.
	   Already, hundreds of would-be buyers from the United States,
Britain, South Africa and Germany have asked for more information
and the government has set up a web site.
	   At the auction, which likely will take place in late September
in Bucharest, five cars and a bus will be offered for sale, a
government spokesman said, declining to give his name.
	   They include a custom-made Buick Electra 225, a present from
Nixon in 1976, valued at lei 115,400,000 (dlrs 13,260), a Brown
Hillman presented in 1974 by te Shah of Iran worth about lei 33
million (dlrs 3,800) and a Mercedes 350, specially ordered in 1969
for Zoe Ceausescu, daughter of the late dictator. It is worth an
estimated lei 32 million (dlrs 3,700)
	   All the vehicles will be re-evaluated by a special commission.
It is also possible that Ceausescu's boats will be included in the
auction.

Police seize nearly 47,000 pirated compact discs and video discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong police on Wednesday seized nearly
47,000 pirated compact discs and pornographic video discs valued at
U.S. dlrs 130,000.
	   Eighteen unidentified people were arrested as police raided 13
shops in a busy shopping mall, seizing 44,000 compact and video
discs and 2,730 pornographic video discs, a police statement said.
	   Police did not give any other details.
	   Hong Kong officials are under pressure, particularly from the
United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. U.S. officials say Hong Kong has become a production and
distribution center for pirated discs since officials in mainland
China began cracking down.
	   Early this year, U.S. officials decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watch list for copyright violation.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth U.S.
dlrs 83 million, the biggest such seizure in Hong Kong's history.

At T-minus 500, Champagne producers boosting stock for 2000 fete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The huge lightboard on the Eiffel Tower shined 500
on Wednesday, marking the number of days before the year 2000, and
French Champagne producers say they'll be ready with plenty of
bubbly.
	   Annual production from the eastern Champagne region is about 136
million bottles. But producers who kept stock from previous years
plan to have more than twice that -- 310 million bottles -- on hand
next year to toast the new millennium.
	   ``We were able to prepare ourselves,'' Daniel Lorson, spokesman
for the Interprofessional Committee of Wines of Champagne, told Le
Parisien daily.
	   As a result, the association doesn't expect price increases
beyond 5-6 percent by next year.
	   But some rare vintages are already snapped up, or going for a
mint. Three-liter bottles of 1993 Dom Perignon are going for 12,000
francs (dlrs 2,000) apiece.
	   The Champagne region -- which under strict French winemaking
regulations is the only one that can sell ``Champagne'' in France,
makes 15 percent of the world's sparkling wine from 31,000 hectares
(76,500 acres).
	   Much of the extra stock for next year comes from unsold bottles
from French recession years of 1992-94, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, swanky Paris hotels like the Ritz have been booked by
millennium revelers for more than two years.
	   But some three-star restaurants still have room. And the Jules
Verne, the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower's second level, only
begins taking reservations from September 1999, Le Parisien daily
reported.

Suspected Kashmiri militants gun down three shepherds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ Two weeks after suspected Kashmiri
militants massacred 34 civilians in a Himalayan state, unidentified
attackers shot and killed three shepherds in the same region,
police said Wednesday.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for Tuesday's shooting
in Sappa Cholu, a village in Himachal Pradesh state, 675 kilometers
(420 miles) north of New Delhi. But police blamed Muslim guerrillas
for the killings of the three Hindu villagers.
	   Details of the attack were not clear, but Tarun Kapoor, a local
government administrator said four gunmen were involved in the
incident.
	   Two weeks ago, guerrillas killed 34 sleeping construction
workers in two pre-dawn attacks in Himachal Pradesh.
	   Kapoor said the gunmen were apparently frustrated by the
increased police security in the state following the earlier
killings.
	   Muslim separatists in Kashmir have been fighting government
soldiers in Kashmir since 1989 to make the region independent of
India. In recent months, many guerrillas have moved into
neighboring states following increased crackdown on militants.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's banking system can survive the current
financial crisis and the sharp devaluation of the ruble if the
government takes measures to prevent panic, the leader of Russia's
banking association said Wednesday.
	   ``The main goal is to calm people and restore confidence in the
banking community,'' Sergei Yegorov, chairman of the Association of
Russian Banks, said at a news conference.
	   Banking analysts have predicted that a third to a half of
Russian banks may fail, largely because they are over-dependent on
ruble assets that are worth a third less after Monday's effective
devaluation.
	   Yegorov tried to sound upbeat, predicting that the majority of
Russia's 1,600 commercial banks would be able to overcome the
current crisis. He said only between 200 and 250 banks are in the
immediate danger.
	   Many customers visiting Moscow banks on Wednesday didn't share
Yegorov's optimism.
	   ``The banks are in danger and withdrawal is the only reasonable
thing now,'' said Semyon Shengelai, 51, a construction manager, who
tried to close his dollar account in SBS-Agro, one of Russia's
largest banks.
	   Like clients at other banks, he was told to return in several
days if he wanted to get dollars. Banks were paying out rubles,
however, at the official rate, which stood at 6.9 after brief
trading Wednesday.
	   At exchange booths on the street, however, the dollar was
trading between 8 and 9.5 _ the lower end of the trading band set
by the government on Monday.
	   ``It's vexing. I don't want any rubles at this rate,'' said
Nikolai Ivanov, another exasperated bank client. The ruble will
keep falling.''
	   The Central Bank predicted that the national currency will
stabilize at around 7 rubles a dollar in the next few days.
	   Trading on the major interbank market was suspended last week as
banks feared doing business with each other. The smaller, Central
Bank-controlled MICEX exchange opened for trading for just 35
minutes Wednesday, with the ruble ending at 6.99 to the dollar.
	   In a move to curb the currency speculation, the Central Bank
also ordered that any exchange offices whose rates for buying and
selling foreign currency are more than 15 percent apart will face
swift punishment.
	   Yegorov attributed the current shortage of dollars at local bank
branches to the increased demand for foreign currency. He said the
Central Bank has agreed to sell commercial banks more dollars to
cope with the higher demand.
	   He also called on the government to approve legislation that
would reassure the Russians who keep an estimated dlrs 80 billion
in savings under their mattresses. Only about 30 percent of
Russians' savings are deposited in banks, one reason lines at most
banks remained at usual length despite the crisis.
	   In other developments Wednesday:
	   _ The Russian economy continues to contract at a rapid rate. GDP
fell by 4.5 percent in July compared to last year _ the sharpest
monthly drop since September 1996, according to the State
Statistics Committee.
	   The overall GDP drop in the first seven months of the year was
1.1 percent compared with the same period in 1997.
	   Meanwhile, industrial output in July fell by as much as 9.4
percent compared to 1997, the sharpest fall since December 1994.
	   _ In a reaction to the financial crisis, the government
announced it was postponing the sale of a 5 percent stake in the
state natural gas giant Gazprom _ one of a number of privatizations
designed to raise cash.
	   _ The government postponed announcement of a controversial debt
restructuring plan in an apparent sign that it is reconsidering
terms that would have been especially painful for foreign
investors.
	   The government said it wasn't able to meet payments on the
treasury notes, and would force investors to accept longer-term
paper. Foreign investors have sharply criticized informal drafts of
the plan, which they feared would give Russian banks preferential
treatment.
	   _ Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75.8
billion rubles (around dlrs 11 billion) as of the beginning of this
month, the State Statistics Committee said. Restructuring of debt
on treasuries along with the ruble devaluation are expected to
allow the government fulfill its long-time pledge to pay out wage
debts.
	   _ Real income of Russians dropped 8.9 percent in the first seven
months of the year.

Sudan declares `general mobilization' after opposition meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's ruling party has declared a
``general mobilization'' and called on Egypt to hand over Sudanese
terrorists following a meeting by Sudanese opposition groups in
Cairo.
	   The National Congress announced the mobilization ``to face the
challenges confronting the nation and the open provocations from
within Egyptian territories by the remnants of rebellion and the
mercenaries who ... work against Sudan's Islamic orientation.''
	   The congress made the announcement in a statement Tuesday, and
it was carried Wednesday in Sudanese newspapers. A ``general
mobilization'' calls on citizens to be ready to support the
government in event of danger.
	   The statement followed a three-day meeting in Cairo by the
National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group of Sudanese
opposition parties.
	   The alliance issued a statement Tuesday rejecting Sudan's new
constitution, which is based on Islamic law. It also vowed to keep
up the struggle against the Khartoum government.
	   On Wednesday, the Sudanese Workers Trade Federation issued a
statement denouncing the convening of an opposition conference in
Egypt.
	   Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Sudan's first vice president, also
commented on the Cairo meeting in a speech to military trainees
Tuesday. ``We are saying in your name to the enemies of Sudan who
gathered in Cairo, your alliance will end up in ashes,'' he said.
	   The National Congress statement said Egypt's hosting of the
meeting amounted to interference in Sudan's internal affairs. It
said Egypt should hand over Sudanese terrorists if it wanted to
improve relations.
	   Earlier this year, the two countries began patching up ties that
plummeted after an unsuccessful attack on President Hosni Mubarak
in Ethiopia in 1995. Egypt accused Sudan of harboring the
attackers, but it denied the men were in the country.
	   Sudan's National Congress specifically asked Egypt to hand more
men accused in a bomb plot. Among those is former Prime Minister
Sadiq el-Mahdi, who attended Cairo meeting.
	   Also attending were Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, head of the
opposition alliance, and John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army which has been fighting the government since 1983.

OAU backs Kabila in Congo's fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Organization of African Unity
has backed Congolese President Laurent Kabila and urged the rebels
to immediately lay down their weapons.
	   In a communique Tuesday, the OAU also ``condemned all external
intervention in the internal affairs of that country under any
pretext whatsover.''
	   It was issued by the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention and Resolution.
	   An OAU official, speaking on condition he not be named, said the
communique did not identify countries allegedly interfering in
Congo.
	   The communique said the OAU remains committed to Congo's
``unity, cohesion, and sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
republic and inviolability of its national boundaries.''
	   It asked OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim to work with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to end the conflict in Congo.
	   Kabila's government has accused Uganda and Rwanda, which helped
him oust the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year, of backing
the rebels.
	   The OAU panel endorsed the initiative to end the conflict
launched by defense ministers from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia at a meeting in Zimbabwe last week.
	   The countries, which form a commission investigating Kabila's
claim, are convinced Congo has been invaded.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi said on local radio that it had become clear that Congo had
been invaded.
	   ``It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both material and manpower, is given to
(Congo) in order to restore peace and stability,'' Mahachi said.
	   Zimbabwe said it will send troops to back Kabila's efforts to
hold off the advancing rebels. Zambia, Namibia and Angola also said
they would support Kabila.
	   It was not known what support Angola, locked in its own civil
war, and Zambia planned to offer Kabila.
	   On Tuesday, Namibia's largest daily reported that Namibian
defense troops loaded 21 tons of arms and ammunition into two
Boeing aircraft bearing registration marks of an Angolan air
charter outfit.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Kurdish man suspected of several
armed robberies in Istanbul in 1996 was arrested by Romanian
authorities, police said Wednesday.
	   Engin Cakmak was arrested Tuesday and Turkish authorities
immediately asked for his extradition, said Col. Haralmbie Neda by
telephone.
	   The suspect is now in jail in the northeast city of Botosani,
where he lives, awaiting a court decision on his extradition.
	   Turkish prosecutors have been looking for Cakmak since the
attacks in which several people were killed. He was tracked by
Interpol.
	   Neda said Cakmak belonged to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)
which is seeking self-determination for Kurds in Turkey.
	   Two years ago, Cakmak asked for political asylum in Romania but
his request was rejected. He lived ever since in Botosani, 400
kilometers (250 miles) north of Bucharest.

Israeli report: U.S. failed to warn Israel of missile launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. intelligence officials failed to inform
Israel in advance about Iran's intention to launch a long-range
missile last month, the Haaretz newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Quoting an unnamed intelligence source, the paper said there had
been a ``loss of intimacy'' between Israeli and U.S. officials and
that the United States apparently feared Israel would try to
disrupt the Iranian launch.
	   The missile was launched July 22 from an Iranian test site about
100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Tehran. The newspaper quoted
foreign sources as saying Israeli intelligence lacks the ability to
match the material on Iran that the United States possesses.
	   Uzi Arad, foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and a former Mossad intelligence agency official,
declined to comment on the specifics of the report.
	   He said Israel had expected the Iranians to test fire the Shahab
III missile, which has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) and
could reach all areas of Israel, sometime this year or early 1999.
	   ``The exact timing I don't think we were aware of,'' he said.
``But it was within the ballpark of the time frame.''
	   Arad disputed the claim that intelligence cooperation had
eroded, either at the top level or at the working level.
	   Haaretz attributed the decline to tensions between President
Bill Clinton and Netanyahu over the stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``Much to the contrary,'' said Arad. ``The dialogue taking place
at the highest levels has its own rhythm and pace and needs. There
has been a dialogue there in the form of talks and letters and
exchanges. There is no cut in that.''
	   He said there was a ``high degree of intimacy'' at the working
level, where contacts were ``happening quite intensively all the
time irrespective of the zigs and zags of the political process.''

Palestinians despair of Lewinsky's sway over Middle East peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Since she first splashed onto the world's
television screens seven months ago, Monica Lewinsky has wielded a
curious sway over the course of Middle East peacemaking.
	   It was at Yasser Arafat's Oval Office news conference with
President Clinton, back on Jan. 22, that the U.S. president first
fielded questions about his relationship with the former White
House intern.
	   Palestinians had hoped Clinton would use the opportunity to
castigate Israel for failing to break a deadlock in the peace talks
and agree to a double-digit troop pullback from the West Bank.
	   Instead, with Arafat watching bemusedly from his side as
reporters peppered Clinton with questions about whether he had had
sex with the 24-year-old Lewinsky.
	   Seven months later, Clinton's admission that he had a
relationship with Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate'' has left
the Palestinians despairing that he will ever return to a position
of enough strength to pressure Israel to make concessions.
	   ``Since this story surfaced, the American administration has
been paralyzed, unable to react to Israeli intransigence,'' the Al
Quds newspaper lamented Wednesday.
	   The paper's editorial cartoon showed a grinning Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thinking ``Inappropriate Behavior!'' as
Clinton tries to put pressure on him.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Amr said Clinton's new
admissions mean that ``Neither he nor his administration can
influence the Israelis.
	   ``This means a weakening of the already almost-absent American
role, and an increase in Israeli intransigence,'' Abu Amr told the
Voice of Palestine radio station on Wednesday. ``We should not
expect any active American role in the peace process.''
	   Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political figure, said
the Palestinians have been ``paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process.''
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' she said Tuesday.
	   Palestinian officials, however, gave no credence to rumors _
wildly popular on the Palestinian street _ that Lewinsky, who is
Jewish, was an Israeli agent sent to weaken Clinton.
	   Yasser Arafat, asked Tuesday if Clinton's admission would impede
American efforts to advance the peace process, said only: ``We hope
not.''

Unnamed Australian athlete reportedly tests positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An unnamed Australian athlete has
returned an abnormal testosterone test, Olympic official Craig
McLatchey confirmed Tuesday.
	   The news came on the eve of an International Olympic Committee
meeting in Lausanne where Australian IOC official Kevan Gosper was
to present a proposal to toughen anti-doping measures.
	   McLatchey, the secretary-general of the Australian Olympic
Committee, would not name the athlete involved or their sport.
	   The Australian newspaper reported that the athlete was from an
Olympic sport _ but there was no suggestion the athlete had
competed at a games or was of Olympic standard now.

OAU backs Kabila in Congo's fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Angola situation, graf 13. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Organization of African Unity
has backed Congolese President Laurent Kabila and urged the rebels
to immediately lay down their weapons.
	   In a communique Tuesday, the OAU also ``condemned all external
intervention in the internal affairs of that country under any
pretext whatsover.''
	   It was issued by the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention and Resolution.
	   An OAU official, speaking on condition he not be named, said the
communique did not identify countries allegedly interfering in
Congo.
	   The communique said the OAU remains committed to Congo's
``unity, cohesion, and sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
republic and inviolability of its national boundaries.''
	   It asked OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim to work with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to end the conflict in Congo.
	   Kabila's government has accused Uganda and Rwanda, which helped
him oust the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year, of backing
the rebels.
	   The OAU panel endorsed the initiative to end the conflict
launched by defense ministers from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia at a meeting in Zimbabwe last week.
	   The countries, which form a commission investigating Kabila's
claim, are convinced Congo has been invaded.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi said on local radio that it had become clear that Congo had
been invaded.
	   ``It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both material and manpower, is given to
(Congo) in order to restore peace and stability,'' Mahachi said.
	   Zimbabwe said it will send troops to back Kabila's efforts to
hold off the advancing rebels. Zambia, Namibia and Angola also said
they would support Kabila.
	   It was not known what support Angola, troubled by its own
insurgents, and Zambia planned to offer Kabila.
	   On Tuesday, Namibia's largest daily reported that Namibian
defense troops loaded 21 tons of arms and ammunition into two
Boeing aircraft bearing registration marks of an Angolan air
charter outfit.

Palestinians: Israel's claim it accepted pullback is a ruse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A claim by a powerful Israeli Cabinet minister
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed in principle to
hand over 14 percent of the West Bank is a ruse aimed at deflecting
U.S. pressure, a Palestinian negotiator said Wednesday.
	   Ariel Sharon, a hawk in Netanyahu's Cabinet, said Tuesday that
the Israel government has quietly accepted a U.S. proposal to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank now and hand over an
additional 1 percent in a later pullback.
	   Sharon opposes the U.S. plan, saying it would endanger Israel's
security. It is believed Sharon made the claim to embarrass
Netanyahu and invite new pressure from Cabinet hardliners.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said Wednesday that Israel
has indeed offered to withdraw from 13 percent, but on condition
that 3 percent of that area be declared a ``nature reserve'' in
which the Palestinians would have virtually no say over land use.
	   ``So what Mr. Sharon is saying is nothing but an act of
deception,'' Shaath said, noting that the Palestinians already
rejected the idea when it was first raised last month.
	   A 1 percent pullback in a later stage also falls far short of
minimal Palestinian demands, Shaath said.
	   Sharon charged Tuesday that the Palestinians had raised new
difficulties _ such as claims that Israel was not allocating enough
water to the West Bank _ in order to invite U.S. pressure and
squeeze more concessions from Israel.
	   Shaath countered that Sharon was trying to shift blame from
Israel to the Palestinians for the prolonged deadlock in the
negotiations.
	   The Israeli offer, as portrayed by Sharon, would leave Israel
still in control of 60 percent of the West Bank, Shaath said. ``He
(Sharon) knows we will reject this and hopes that this would get
the blame off Israel and on us,'' he said.
	   In other developments Wednesday, Israeli troops demolished a
Palestinian home near the West Bank town of Hebron because it was
built without a permit.
	   The six-member family living in the home scuffled with soldiers,
and two women were taken to a nearby hospital with bruises.
	   ``This is terrorism, and I say it in front of everyone that I
will be the next (suicide) bomber in Israel because I have nothing
to lose,'' said the homeowner, Atta Jaber, 33.
	   Since the start of the year, Israel has demolished 112 homes in
the West Bank and 14 in Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.
Israel says it is merely enforcing building regulations. The
Palestinians claim Israel is trying to limit population growth in
disputed areas where it wants to cement its control.
	   The United States has called on Israel to refrain from
demolishing homes and expanding Jewish West Bank settlements.

Canadian woman freed; three tourists still held by Hutu rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Canadian tourist kidnapped by Rwandan
rebels last week as she was viewing rare mountain gorillas has been
freed but three companions remain in captivity, the daily New
Vision said Wednesday.
	   Joan Donaldo, 54, was freed Tuesday together with a statement
the Hutu rebels sid they wanted read over Uganda radio, the
government-owned newspaper said, citing Swedish sources.
	   On Tuesday, the Swedish news agency TT quoted Anders Kaellberg
of the Stockholm-based Far Out travel agency saying the two Swedes
and a New Zealander who remained in captivity were ``in reasonably
good shape.''
	   Donaldo went missing with the other three on Aug. 11 after they
had cross from Uganda into Virunga National Park in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
	   She was reportedly in Uganda, but her whereabouts were not
known.
	   Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman Annika Toernberg said
Wednesday that someone from the Swedish embassy in Kampala had gone
to where Donaldo was released to try to obtain more information.
	   The Hutu rebels, who are remnants of the former Rwandan Hutu
army, have camps in the forests on the volcanic mountain ranges
where the borders of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda converge.
	   Uganda police spokesman Bob Ngobi Tuesday identified the other
three tourists as Swedes Ann Charlotte Jonsson and Jens Olsson and
Douglas John of New Zealand.
	   He said New Zealanders Lauren Muir and Graeme Sunley managed to
escape when the group of six came under fire and reported the
incident to authorities.
	   Ngobi said two Ugandan park rangers, two Congolese drivers and
three Congolese porters were also abducted.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hellmut Andics, prominent Austrian
journalist, author and screenwriter, died of a heart attack late
Tuesday at age 75.
	   Andics, son of an Austrian military officer, was born in Vienna
in 1922.
	   After training as an engineer, he drifted into journalism,
writing for a number of Vienna newspapers including ``Die Presse''
and ``Kurier.''
	   He also authored a number of popular German-language histories,
including ``The State Nobody Wanted,'' ``The Austrian Century,''

well received in the German-speaking world.
	   Andics was also active in cultural projects in the eastern
Austrian province of Burgenland, where he lived for a number of

Letters purport South African, U.S., British agents killed U.N.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu said
Wednesday recently uncovered letters implicate South African, U.S.
and British intelligence agents in the 1961 death of U.N.
Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold.
	   However Tutu, the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, said the veracity of the letters have not been
determined.
	   Hammerskjold and 15 other people died when their plane exploded
just before landing in Ndola, Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. He had
been trying to mediate a peace agreement between Congo and the
breakaway province of Katanga.
	   Three independent commissions set up by Sweden, the United
Nations and Northern Rhodesia long ago concluded the Sept. 17,
1961, plane crash probably was caused by pilot error, although they
didn't exclude other possibilities.
	   The Truth Commission, which is probing apartheid-era crimes,
discovered the eight letters during an investigation into a
different matter and have given them to President Nelson Mandela
and Justice Minister Dullah Omar, who will decide what further
actions should be taken.
	   The letters describe meetings between America's Central
Intelligence Agency, Britain's MI5 and the South African Institute
for Maritime Research, believed to be a possible military front
company, Tutu said.
	   Hand-written or typed on paper with the logo of the SAIMR, the
letters are a correspondence between two SAIMR employees signing
themselves ``Captain'' and ``Commodore.''
	   Marked ``Top Secret,'' they contain orders to kill Hammerskjold
by planting a bomb on his plane. The purported mission was dubbed
``Operation Celeste.''
	   ``It is felt that Hammarskjold should be removed,'' one letter
states, after detailing an alleged meeting between British spies
and SAIMR employees.
	   The undated letter goes on to say: ``Allen Dulles agrees and has
promised
	   full cooperation from his people.''
	   Dulles was director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961.
	   One of the letters says TNT was to be planted in the plane's
wheel bay, which would explode as the wheels retracted after
take-off. Another letter says the bomb failed to go off as planned,
but detonated when the wheels came out for landing at Ndola, in
Northern Rhodesia.
	   Another letter contains a reference to a CIA contact known as
``Dwight.'' gives his hotel address in the capital of neighboring
Congo-Brazzaville, and
	   says he was staying there until Nov. 1, 1961.
	   According to that letter, on meeting the CIA contact, the
Captain was supposed to use the password ``How is Celeste these
days?'' Dwight would then reply ``She's recovering nicely apart
from the cough.''
	   No motive for the purported assassination plot is mentioned in
the letters.
	   Tutu stressed that the legitimacy of the letters has yet to be
studied. he said they were being released now to keep the
commission's work ``transparent.''
	   ``We want to emphasize that we have been unable to investigate
the veracity of these documents and allegations that South African
and other Western intelligence agents were involved in bringing
about the air crash,'' the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said.
	   Set up a year after 1994's all-race elections ended apartheid,
the Truth Commission is charged with uncovering apartheid
atrocities.
	   It has also probed the 1986 plane crash in South Africa that
killed Mozambique President Samora Machel. The commission recently
said it has evidence linking the apartheid-era South African
Defense Force to the crash.
	   An inquiry by the former apartheid government had concluded that
pilot error caused the crash that killed 34 people.

IRA dissidents `suspend' bombing as its victims are laid to rest

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sinn Fein chairman saying his party has asked
Real IRA to renounce violence entirely; edits to tighten &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army
dissidents who committed Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
atrocity pledged Wednesday to stop bombing, hours before most of
their victims were laid to rest.
	   The so-called ``Real IRA,'' until now committed to wrecking the
IRA cease-fire of July 1997, announced it had indefinitely
``suspended'' its efforts to bomb Northern Ireland towns ``as a
direct result of the Omagh tragedy.''
	   Although they denied trying to kill anybody, the dissidents' car
bomb Saturday in the religiously mixed town killed 28 civilians and
wounded 220, mostly women and children.
	   While some politicians greeted the announcement with relief,
Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern Ireland, Mo
Mowlam, called it ``an insult'' to the dead and maimed.
	   Noting the 13 funerals taking place Wednesday in and near Omagh
and three more in the Irish Republic seaside resort of Buncrana,
she said: ``The pain and grief are such that this is just a little
too late.''
	   In Buncrana, on Ireland's rugged northwest coast, an estimated
8,000 mourners bade an anguished farewell to the town's three lost
boys _ James Barker and Shaun McLaughlin, both 12, and Oran
Doherty, 8 _ who died after they accompanied Spanish exchange
students across the border to visit a historical park near Omagh.
	   ``We all feel responsible ... but there was supposed to be
peace,'' said the school principal, Sinead McLaughlin, whose
students formed a uniformed guard of honor alongside all three
coffins en route to St. Mary's Catholic Church. Shaun was an altar
boy at another local church.
	   James' parents, Donna and Victor Barker, who had moved to
Buncrana from their native England last year for a better quality
of life, looked like broken souls as they walked behind their son's
casket.
	   Oran's six siblings, from his 3-year-old brother Oisin to
20-year-old Amanda, linked arms behind his coffin, which was draped
in the green-and-white banner of the soccer team he loved, Glasgow
Celtic.
	   Two Spaniards _ 24-year-old teacher Rocia Ramos and 12-year-old
student Fernando Bacelga, who had been living with the Barker
family _ also died in the blast and were buried Tuesday in their
native Madrid.
	   In Buncrana, children led the congregation in special prayers
for their souls in English, Spanish and Gaelic.
	   Fernando's older brother and more than 30 Spanish students _
some bearing bandages from shrapnel wounds and perforated eardrums
_ and their relatives attended the Buncrana service. Ten Spanish
students remain hospitalized, including two girls with critical
head wounds.
	   The Rev. Shane Bradley, Buncrana's Omagh-born priest, noted that
more than 3,000 people had been killed in the past three decades of
conflict over Northern Ireland, but that this appeared to be ``our
saddest moment, our darkest hour.''
	   ``This wound runs too deep, and the scar will be on us all 'til
we go to our own graves,'' he said.
	   In the church were Irish President Mary McAleese and Jose Maria
Sanz-Pastor, Spain's ambassador for Ireland. Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, walked
closely behind the three boys' coffins.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant first
minister of Northern Ireland's new cross-community government
established by the agreement, also attended, before heading for
Omagh for the funerals of a 60-year-old man and his 27-year-old
son.
	   Trimble said he found the Real IRA's statement that it would
suspend violence ``pretty contemptible'' and untrustworthy, since
their misleading phoned warnings in Omagh had ``herded the people
directly to the car bomb like lambs to the slaughter.''
	   He said the continuing threat posed by dissidents underscored
his demand for IRA commanders to start handing over their hidden
weaponry to international arms inspectors, as April's agreement
calls for.
	   Trimble will meet Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin on
Wednesday evening to be briefed on plans by the Irish government to
suppress the Real IRA and imprison its commanders.
	   Speaking before the Irish Cabinet met in emergency session to
strategize with security chiefs, Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney
said she had ``no doubt that we will agree to the introduction of
what's necessary to destroy this organization. We are going to put
them down and it's as simple as that.''
	   Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin disclosed Wednesday that
his party had been in contact with the Real IRA through
intermediaries to press its demand that the dissident group
renounce violence completely.
	   ``We did make it known to the group that there was a need to
discuss this issue to try to recover the situation from the
disastrous consequences of Saturday,'' he told BBC Radio.
	   He said Sinn Fein also was attempting to persuade two other
anti-British gangs not participating in cease-fires _ the Irish
National Liberation Army and the Continuity IRA _ to drop their
campaigns of violence.

Airport may have to close for weeks because of noise rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The busiest Dutch airport may have
to close down for weeks at the end of this year if the government
doesn't relax noise pollution guidelines, a senior flight planner
warned Wednesday.
	   Speaking on Dutch radio, slot coordinator Hennie Wijkhuizen said
that closure was possible to prevent Amsterdam Schiphol Airport _
one of Europe's busiest airports _ from breaking noise pollution
limits this year.
	   Wijkhuizen, a government-appointed official who allocates
landing and takeoff spots to airlines using Schiphol, said it would
be ``a disaster'' if the government refuses to relax the limits.
	   An airport spokeswoman dismissed Wijkhuizen's comments as
``speculation or exaggeration.''
	   ``We do not know where he is getting his information,'' said
Schiphol's Ingrid Pouw.
	   Last year, the government and a local court agreed to tolerate
Schiphol breaking the noise pollution guidelines but said it would
not allow such infringements this year.
	   Schiphol, located just outside the Dutch capital, will handle a
total of 380,000 takeoffs and landings this year _ 20,000 more than
last year.
	   Environmental group Milieudefensie described Wijkhuizen's
suggestion that Schiphol may have to close as ``misleading
nonsense'' and said the airport should only have to scrap some
flights.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two men armed with a meat cleaver attacked a
fiery talk show host outside a radio station just before his
morning broadcast Wednesday, leaving him in serious condition with
deep cuts in his arms, legs and back.
	   Legislators _ often targets of Albert Cheng on his shows _
condemned the attack, and some said they believed it was triggered
by his commentaries.
	   ``This is a challenge to ... our freedom and the rule of law,''
James To, chairman of the legislature's security panel, told
Commercial Radio where Cheng worked.
	   The Hong Kong Journalists Association said that if Cheng was
attacked for his outspoken commentaries, it was a direct challenge
to freedom of speech.
	   The men, one carrying the cleaver, ambushed the flamboyant
52-year-old broadcaster as he walked from a carpark to the radio
station, said a police spokeswoman on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police said the assailants, both in their 30s, remained at
large. Although Cheng has alienated many people on his shows,
police said the motive of the attack was not immediately known.
	   A police unit that specializes in fighting organized crime is
investigating the case, but a spokeswoman refused to comment on
whether the case was related to triads, or Chinese gangs.
	   In a separate incident, three unidentified men attacked a
photographer of the Apple Daily _ a popular Hong Kong newspaper _
late Wednesday with an iron rod, said Joseph Cheng, a senior news
editor at the paper.
	   The photographer, whose car windshield was smashed, was told
``not to take pictures in Shenzhen,'' the freewheeling capitalist
city across the Chinese border, he said.
	   Joseph Cheng said he couldn't think of any recent story the
newspapers that would have triggered the attack, which did not
appear to be related to the attack on Albert Cheng.
	   Cania Wong, a hospital spokeswoman, said Albert Cheng was in
serious condition after eight hours of surgery to reconnect some
muscle, bone and nerve tissues. He sustained six cuts, Wong said.
	   Legislator Martin Lee, Cheng's friend and chairman of the
territory's largest party, the Democrats, said on official radio
the attack ``was a very shameful and cowardly act.''
	   Cheng is especially popular among blue-collar workers, many of
whom enjoy venting their anger at the government on air. Time
Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the
territory last year.
	   Lam Yuk-wah, who co-hosts the morning show, said he would keep
the program's style and format, but refused to speculate on the
motive for the assault.
	   Commercial Radio said in a statement it was shocked and angry at
the incident, and strongly condemned the violence. It also reported
that Shelley Lau, the territory's director of home affairs, visited
Cheng and said such violence would not be tolerated.
	   Famous for his liberal stance and outrageous attacks on
officials and government policies, Cheng hosts a popular morning
talk show, Teacup in a Storm, on weekdays on Commercial Radio. He
also hosted several TV programs.
	   Cheng recently lost a libel suit to another former radio talk
show host on a rival station. Earlier this year, he was embroiled
in a controversy with the manpower secretary, who demanded an
apology from a TV station for remarks Cheng made about him and his
policies.
	   ``Cheng always has his unique personal viewpoints,'' said Ann
Chow, a spokesman for Asia Television. ``He listens to the common
people's voices.''
	   He charged in an address to foreign reporters earlier this year
that the government was clamping down on the media, and said
government officials had become reluctant to appear on his
programs.
	   Several photojournalists have been attacked on assignment
recently, but violence against the media is not common here.
	   In 1996, a controversial magazine publisher had an arm hacked
off by assailants in his office. The case has not been solved, but
speculation focused on Chinese gangs, possibly trying to prevent
articles on their activities from appearing in the magazine.

Thai government to make police independent to reduce corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In an effort to fight corruption and
political interference, the Thai government will shift control of
the national police department from the interior ministry to the
prime minister's office.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters Wednesday that the
idea was initiated by the interior ministry, dismissing suggestions
the ministry fought the move.
	   But the change will sharply reduce the power of the interior
ministry, the most influential civilian official body. The police
department's budget and manpower is almost as big as the ministry's
other seven agencies combined.
	   Two circumstances set the stage for the move, approved at
Tuesday's meeting of the Cabinet. Chuan was able to get the
cooperation of the interior minister, Sanan Kachornprasart, a close
ally who is the top political troubleshooter for Chuan's Democrat
Party.
	   He was also able to take advantage of a climate of public
disgust with pervasive police corruption, which has become more
exposed in recent years by a more free and aggressive press.
Political infighting within the department also had become hard to
control.
	   Former Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa said Wednesday he
agreed with move and called on police to change their image.
	   The change is expected to take place in October after enabling
legislation is completed. The police department will become an
independent office reporting directly to the prime minister,
responsible for its own planning and budget.
	   ``This change will allow the police to be free from internal and
external influences,'' government spokesman Akapol Sorachart said
Wednesday. ``Police will be able to enforce the law more
effectively.''
	   Decentralization is also part of the plan, which should increase
the department's accountability.
	   A special committee comprising members of the public and retired
high-ranking officers will be set up in each province to monitor
local police performance and report wrongdoing to a national
committee chaired by the prime minister.

Challenging government ban, Taiwan activists sail to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Activists favoring reunification with
China openly challenged a ban on direct navigation links by sailing
to China's Fujian province on Wednesday, a newspaper reported.
	   The group, led by Taipei county official Kin Chieh-shou and
National Assemblyman Tsao Yuan-chang, departed from Keelung harbor
north of Taiwan late Wednesday and was scheduled to arrive
mid-morning Thursday on the southern Chinese province of Fujian,
the United Daily News said.
	   It quoted members of the group as saying the voyage, which would
take them about 200 kilometers (124 miles) across the Taiwan
Strait, was a protest against President Lee Teng-hui's program of
discouraging large-scale investment in China and maintenance of a
nearly 50-year old ban on direct transportation, communications and
business links.
	   Kin's office was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
	   Originally used to isolate China, the ban on direct links has
evolved into a way of staving off economic dependency on the
mainland and as a bargaining chip for use in future negotiations.
	   Taiwanese fishing boats and other vessels routinely violate the
direct navigation ban by smuggling goods and illegal aliens between
the sides. But Chung Ke, Keelung city's chief prosecutor, said his
office had never charged anyone simply for making the trip.
	   ``If you go through the proper legal channels entering and
exiting port, then we don't consider simply going to China a
criminal offense,'' Chung said.
	   Kin and Tsao belong to the minor opposition New Party, which
frequently criticizes the ban as inconvenient, costly, and intended
simply to prolong the division between the sides.
	   The party strongly favors Taiwan's reunification with China and
draws support mainly from mainland Chinese immigrants who fled here
with Chiang Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists in 1949.

Taiwan's Siew warns China's hostility impeding reunification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a call for pragmatism to steer
long-sidelined negotiations back on track, Premier Vincent Siew has
warned China its hardline policies only dampen hope for its goal of
reunifying with Taiwan.
	   China's unrelenting suppression of Taiwan's role in
international affairs deeply alienates people on the island, Siew
was quoted saying in an interview with the mass-circulation United
Daily News Wednesday.
	   ``I seriously doubt whether this method is helpful to
reunification,'' Siew said. China should call a ``diplomatic cease
fire,'' and take a realistic approach to the international
situation, he was quoted saying.
	   Siew criticized Beijing for not pushing ahead with preparations
for a proposed casual meeting between the two sides' top
negotiators in September or October, saying China did not appear to
be expecting it to yield subtantive results.
	   ``This (meeting) is a major focus of domestic and international
attention, they can't just not prepare,'' Siew was quoted saying.
	   ``If we want to have anything result from the meeting, we may
need to try to understand more about how the Chinese Communists
view its character.''
	   The two sides agreed this spring to a fall visit to China by the
head of Taiwan's semiofficial negotiating body, raising hopes for a
restoration of talks Beijing cut off in 1995 in retaliation for
Taiwan's efforts to raise its international profile.
	   But Taiwan was disappointed that China was unwilling to set an
agenda for Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu's trip
during a visit to Taiwan last month by Li Yafei, a vice secretary
general of the foundation's Chinese counterpart, the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.
	   Li mostly avoided foundation officials during his stay, fueling
speculation that China is attempting to steer around the SEF to
achieve its goal of leveraging Taiwan into direct talks about
reunification.
	   China broke off talks in June 1995 in anger over a visit to the
United States by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, and continues to
demand Taiwan agree to add political issues to their previous talks
on practical matters such as resolution of fishing disputes.
	   China still claims Taiwan as a breakaway province to be
reunified with by force if necessary. The rivals have been unified
for just four of the last 100 years, and split last in 1949, when
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled here ahead of the communist
takeover of mainland China.

Three months on the market and still not selling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The apartment where Princess Diana lived before
marrying Prince Charles has failed to attract a buyer after three
months on the market.
	   Hundreds have toured the three-bedroom apartment in the
expensive Knightsbridge area of west London, where Diana lived
until the night before her engagement was announced.
	   But no buyers for the flat have come forward, said Jonathan
Blaksley of real estate agents John Taylor.
	   The asking price for the property, which was an 18th birthday
present from Diana's parents in July 1979, is 450,000 pounds (dlrs
738,000) _ more than eight times what her family originally paid.
	   Diana, divorced in 1996 and killed in a car crash nearly a year
ago, once said her happiest days were spent in the apartment.
Describing it in Andrew Morton's book ``Diana, Her True Story,''
the princess said: ``I laughed my head off there.''
	   Before her engangement to Charles, Diana lived with friends in
the apartment and charged them 18 pounds (dlrs 29.50) a week in
rent. Diana's bedroom door was emblazoned with the words ``Chief
Chick,'' so no one would forget her landlady status.
	   The anonymous owners, an oil executive and his wife, have lived
in the flat with their two children for six years. When they
decided to sell, they expected interest to be so high that they
pledged to donate 10 percent of any price paid over 450,000 pounds
to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.
	   That offer _ and the asking price _ still stand.
	   ``There has been a lot of interest in it since it went on the
market but no one has decided to buy it yet,'' Blaksley said.
	   One of Diana's thousands of Christmas cards, however, found an
eager buyer on Wednesday.
	   A card signed by Diana and Charles and sent to the late Lord
Tonypandy sold for 950 pounds (dlrs 1,530) at an auction in Wales
of the politician's belongings, Phillips auctioneers said.
	   The anonymuos buyer, bidding by telephone, also bought a signed
photograph of the royal couple standing with Lord Tonypandy for
1,300 pounds (dlrs 2,100).

Swiss minister lined up to head 2006 Winter Olympics bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss sports and defense minister Adolf
Ogi has been cleared to lead Sion's bid for the 2006 Winter
Olympics, Swiss authorities said Wednesday.
	   Ogi will succeed new FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the post
when he steps down later this month.
	   His mandate will expire next June when the decision is taken in
Seoul on a venue for the 2006 Winter Games. The government ruled
that he can combine his ministerial role with the Sion presidency.
	   Blatter, elected in June to head soccer's world body, last month
announced his resignation from the Olympic bid.
	   Blatter said he didn't think holding the double role of head of
FIFA and the Winter Olympics bid is possible any longer.
	   However, he is one of the most prominent campaigners for the
Sion bid and has said he will continue to support it.

Inventor of the soft contact lense dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Otto Wichterle, prominent Czech
researcher and inventor of the contact lens has died, official
sources said Wednesday. He was 84.
	   Wichterle, a former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, died in
his sleep Tuesday in his summer home in the Moravian village of
Strazisko, Pavel Vales, the Academy's spokesman said.
	   ``He was one of the most important and internationally most
respected Czech scientists of the 20th century,'' said Rudolf
Zahradnik, president of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
	   Wichterle became famous through his ability to translate
scientific research into practical use. While employed by the Bata
shoe-manufacturing empire during World War II, he invented silon, a
polyamid fiber, frequently employed for industrial uses.
	   By far his greatest discovery, however, was the soft contact
lens, which he invented in 1956 during the research of hydrogels.
	   After siding with liberals during the failed 1968 reforms of
Alexander Dubcek, Czechoslovak Communist Party Leader, Wichterle
was stripped of his academic honors and spent the rest of his life
in a private lab at his home after 1969.
	   With the demise of communism and the peaceful establishment of
the Czech Republic in 1993, Wichterle was rehabilitated and elected
honorary chairman of the Academy of Sciences in 1993.

Algerian president to address nation; bomb injures two
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be updated after 1700 GMT speech &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Two people were injured Wednesday after
a bomb exploded at a market outside Algiers, hours before the
president was to address the nation in a rare televised speech.
	   The explosion rocked the marketplace at Bir Mandreis on the
southern outskirts of the capital, authorities said in a statement.
The victims were hospitalized, but their lives were not in danger.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but markets
frequently have been targeted by Islamic militants waging a
six-year insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to
win. An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence.
	   Algerian President Liamine Zeroual was scheduled to address the
nation in a televised speech _ his first since January 1997 _ at
1700 GMT on Wednesday.
	   There was no immediate indication what Zeroual would say in his
message.
	   Zeroual, 57, has made few public appearances since undergoing an
operation in Switzerland in March for arterial blockage in his
legs, fueling speculation about his health.
	   In his 1997 televised speech, Zeroual vowed to ``exterminate
terrorism.''
	   Since then, Islamic militants have been less active in central
and northern Algiers, focusing more on the west and south west of
the country.

Anti-car theft plan to make border with Palestinians a reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stung by an epidemic of car thefts, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has come up with an
ambitious plan to create an obstacle course of boulders, concrete
walls and electronic devices separating Israel and the West Bank.
	   But the plan has drawn an outcry from hard-line members of
Netanyahu's coalition, who say it will create a de facto border
between Israel and land it has not agreed to give up.
	   A recent police report showed that a car is stolen every 12
seconds in Israel, with most ending up in Palestinian areas of the
West Bank. In response, Israel's Cabinet voted this week to erect
barriers along about 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the 324
kilometer-long (200 mile) pre-1967 border between Israel and the
West Bank _ known as the Green Line.
	   Netanyahu's government had in the past strongly opposed a plan
by its dovish predecessors to set up a ``separation zone'' of
fences, watchtowers and electronic surveillance along the Green
Line.
	   Critics argued that the new plan could pre-empt the outcome of
negotiations on a final peace agreement with the Palestinians. The
Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, an idea opposed by Netanyahu's government.
	   ``We are throwing money away,'' said Deputy Education Minister
Moshe Peled. ``I am sure this intelligent country can think up
better ways to fight theft and terror than remaking a nonexistent
border.''
	   Peled said the Cabinet decision would give the Palestinians
false hope that Israel might one day return all of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War, getting rid of the barbed wire that marked the border and
building new roads and settlements across it.
	   Ephraim Sneh, a leading member of the opposition Labor Party,
said the government was only belatedly recognizing reality.
	   ``This is the actual border,'' he said Wednesday. ``At last they
are doing what we recommended when we were in power.''
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said police also want
the government to pay for an additional 2,000 troops along the
Green Line to prevent thieves from skirting checkpoints by using
back roads.
	   Other critics said the government's decision was hasty.
	   Uzi Landau, chairman of parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the government should formulate a new security
doctrine before deciding whether to set up a divider, however
temporary.
	   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the dovish opposition Meretz
Party, said the Cabinet decision was final proof that the hard-line
government had abandoned its claims to all of the West Bank.
	   ``It has again been proven that the viewpoint of the dovish camp
is the more sober and practical one,'' he told Israeli newspaper
Yediot Ahronot.

Annan's envoy says U.N.-Iraq dispute not yet at crisis point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 3rd graf that Shah did not specify when he would
brief Annan. Minor edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy leaving Baghdad said Wednesday
that relations with Iraq had not reached a crisis, despite his
failure to persuade the Iraqi government to allow U.N. arms
inspections.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, described his talks as ``friendly and cordial'' and said he
was ready to return for further negotiations with the Iraqis.
	   ``I will not say it is a crisis,'' he said. ``I still think that
a lot of discussion, negotiations and bilateral talks can take
place.''
	   Shah, who flew from Habbaniya air base outside Baghdad, said he
would arrive Thursday in New York and would later brief Annan on
his talks with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. He did not
say when the briefing would take place
	   Shah's departure comes one day after he announced that he had
failed to persuade Iraqi officials to back down on their refusal to
cooperate with the inspectors assigned to find Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, in effect blocking inspections.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah said Tuesday.
	   Iraq announced in early August that it would refuse to cooperate
with the inspectors because they were not really working toward the
lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq that prevent the free export of
oil, its most valuable commodity.
	   The U.N. Security Council declared the move unacceptable.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the inspectors must declare Iraq has
eliminated such weapons before the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be canceled.
	   Before leaving Wednesday, Shah said he still hoped a solution
could be found to resume arms inspections.
	   ``I think and I hope that the Security Council and Iraq would be
able to work this out,'' Shah said as he left the headquarters of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the weapons inspections.
	   Shah arrived Aug. 13 in Baghdad with a letter from Annan to Aziz
about the latest standoff.
	   The council also has sent letters to the U.N. agencies in charge
of arms and nuclear inspections backing their mandates to carry out
their work but giving no guidance on how to deal with Iraq's
defiance.
	   When asked why the council hadn't threatened Iraq if it fails to
reverse its policy, the council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia,
said the time wasn't right for such a strong message.
	   ``I don't think that anyone in the council has suggested that we
have reached a point at which consideration of severest
consequences would be necessary,'' he said.

Relative of Honduran president kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Three unidentified assailants have
kidnapped the 23-year-old second cousin of Honduran President
Carlos Flores Facusse, relatives reported.
	   Mario Facusse, the president's cousin, said his daughter Tania
was dragged from her car Tuesday by three women in a Tegucigalpa
suburb and taken away in other vehicle.
	   ``I am upset by these events ... and I have given orders to
find'' kidnap victim Tania Facusse, Flores Facusse told reporters.
	   Mario Facusse is a prominent businessman and a leader of the
country's main opposition group, the National Party, who last week
pledged to run for the presidency in 2002 elections.
	   Honduran police have warned recently about a growing wave of
common crime they blamed on gangs and escaped prisoners.

Hoechst profits up, but sales dip as it shifts away from bulk

 &UR; EDs: Style on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. uses ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ German chemical giant Hoechst AG reported mixed
results Wednesday, with quarterly profits up but revenues down
sharply as it shifts away from the bulk chemicals business to
become a ``life sciences'' group focusing on pharmaceuticals and
nutrition.
	   As part of that strategy, Hoechst announced an agreement in
principle to sell its paint and coatings subsidiary, Herberts GmbH,
Wuppertal, for 3 billion Deutsche marks (dlrs 1.67 billion) to U.S.
buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.
	   Hoechst said its net income for the three months ending June 30
rose 80 percent to 693 million marks (dlrs 385 million), compared
with profits of 384 million marks in the same period a year
earlier. Hoechst attributed the big increase to one-time gains from
sales of subsidiaries.
	   Sales fell 22 percent to 11.44 billion marks (dlrs 6.36
billion), from 14.73 billion marks. Hoechst said revenues were hurt
by the Asian economic crisis, as well as the disappearance of sales
from companies it has sold off.
	   Hoechst said that half-year net profits were up 42 percent at
1.05 billion marks (dlrs 585 million), compared with 743 million
marks a year earlier.
	   Revenues for the six-month period slipped to 22.73 billion marks
(dlrs 12.63 billion) this year, compared with 27.89 billion marks
in the same period of 1997.
	   The Hoechst chief executive, Juergen Dormann, acknowledged the
results had their ups and downs during what the company had
previously warned would ``be a difficult year.''
	   ``Additonally, we face challenges posed by the changes and
discontinuity _ acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs _ underlying
the ongoing transformation of Hoechst into a life sciences group,''
Dormann said in a statement released in London. ``However, at this
point in time we can say that the good news prevails. On a
comparable basis, operating profit improved slightly.''
	   Hoechst is shifting away from bulk chemicals _ an industry that
has traditionally fluctuated sharply along with the business cycle.

<TEXT>
	   HOSPITALET, Spain (AP) _ Three nightclub bouncers have been
charged with killing a man in a beating that reportedly began when
he walked into the ladies' room by mistake, police said Wednesday.
	   Juan Antonio Ferreira, 30, died Monday of head injuries suffered
the night before at a club called 'Yes and Yesterday' in this town
near Barcelona in northeast Spain.
	   The bouncers _ two of them aged 25, the other 29 _ were arrested
later Monday. They went before a judge Wednesday and were charged
with manslaughter, police said.
	   According to Ferreira's girlfriend, Lourdes Vargas, Ferreira had
gone into the ladies' room by mistake. A bouncer went in after him
and dragged him back out and into the men's room, roughing him up
along the way.
	   Ferreira returned to the dance floor and told his girlfriend
what had happened, she said. Then three bouncers came up, pulled
him outside through an emergency door and beat him.
	   Ferreira underwent emergency brain surgery but died in hospital.
	   The bouncers insisted that Ferreira had been drunk and abusive,
police said.

Germany grateful for Polish efforts to secure eastern border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's concerns over securing its
eastern border would soon become a European worry, German Interior
Minister Manfred Kanther said Wednesday.
	   On a trip to Warsaw for talks with Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek and Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski, Kanther praised
Poland's efforts to tighten the lengthy border with countries from
the former Soviet Union ahead of joining the European Union.
	   ``I am grateful that Poland has taken so much effort to increase
security and tighten the border,'' said Kanther, whose ministry
oversees immigration and security matters.
	   In December, Poland restricted entry for Russians and
Belorussians at the urging of Germany and other Western neighbors
seeking to halt illegal immigrants and organized crime from the
east.
	   Poland also promised to introduce visas for its eastern
neighbors, if demanded by the European Union.
	   Tomaszewski noted the number of illegal aliens sent back to
Poland from Germany had dropped by about two-thirds this year,
which he said showed the success of Poland's border controls.
	   Kanther acknowledged that introducing Western security standards
on Poland's eastern border was ``a huge and very expensive task for
Poland,'' but he called it ``our common European task.''
	   Once it joins the EU early next decade, Poland will have the
union's longest outer border _ more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) including the sea border.
	   Poland plans to build 19 new checkpoints on its eastern border,
making the distance between them no longer than 25 kilometers (15
miles), in line with European Union standards. It also plans to use
computers to detect false documents.
	   Germany has donated dlrs 20 million to Poland for special
equipment to secure its borders. Another dlrs 25.3 million in EU
money for the same purpose was donated for 1997-98.

ICC rejects extended role of third umpire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Cricket Council Wednesday
rejected speculation it was ready to extend the role of the third
umpire to adjudicate on bat-pad appeals in test matches.
	   ICC chief executive David Richards said comments by ICC
president Jaghohan Dalmiya on the Council's ``liberal'' use of TV
technology had been misinterpreted by the media.
	   ``There has been no change in the level of use of technology in
the game _ we have no plans to increase it,'' he said.
	   Richards said the ICC was concerned that it would be encouraging
umpires to make their own decisions and then force them to use
technology when they reached the highest level.
	   ``That is an effect we are wary about but obviously, if
technology will help us and the sport in general, we will look
closely at using it. I am sure our cricket committee will discuss
it again in the future,'' he said.
	   Speculation Wednesday centered around broadening the third
umpire's role to adjudicate on questionable leg-before wicket
appeals by using TV replays. A number of controversial umpiring
decisions hit the headlines during the recent test series between
England and South Africa.
	   Currently, the third umpire uses television replays to decide on
borderline run-outs and stumpings in test matches and limited-overs
internationals.

Nurses warned about using offensive jargon in patients' records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A regulatory body plans to send letters to about
640,000 nurses throughout the United Kingdom warning that they will
face disciplinary action if they use offensive jargon describing
patients in their notes.
	   Some nurses have been caught writing abbreviations such as FLK,
which stands for ``Funny Looking Kid,'' or BUNDY, shorthand for
``But Unfortunately Not Dead Yet,'' according to the United Kingdom
Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting.
	   Other examples include GOK, for ``God Only Knows,'' and PIN, for
``Pain In the Neck.''
	   ``It might be funny to you, but it's not very professional,''
said Su Smallman, of the Central Council's pediatric nursing
division.
	   Patients have had the right to see their written records since
1991.
	   Nurses also will be reminded to sign and date records, not to
lie about what they have done and to steer clear of using
abbreviations in general, the Central Council said.

Lease terminated for land where controversial cross stands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A local governing council on Wednesday
terminated the lease for the property where a controversial cross
stands near Auschwitz.
	   By ending the 30-year lease held by a group called the War
Victims' Association, the council opened the Polish government to a
legal challenge over who controls the property.
	   Mieczyslaw Janosz, the war victims' association president, has
said he would go to court if the government terminated the lease.
	   At issue is a huge cross in a field bordering Auschwitz that can
be seen from inside the former Nazi death camp now preserved as a
Holocaust museum.
	   Polish Catholics say the eight-meter (26-foot) cross
commemorates the spot where 152 Poles were killed by the Nazis in
1941. But Jewish groups say the cross disturbs the memory of the
more than 1 million Jews killed at Auschwitz and nearby Birkenau
during World War II.
	   In recent weeks, conservative Catholics who fear the cross will
be moved have erected more than 60 smaller crosses next to the
larger one.
	   The local council's move Wednesday followed an announcement
Tuesday by Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek that the government would
terminate the lease held by the war victims' group since 1993.
	   Buzek said the war victims' association violated a provision in
the lease that prohibited harming the church's authority.
	   His government seeks more leverage in forging a compromise over
the cross acceptable to Jewish groups and the Catholic church, a
major power in Polish society.
	   Both the church and Buzek's government want the large cross to
remain but call for the smaller crosses to be removed.
	   Jewish groups refused to sign a dlrs 93.5 million preservation
plan for Auschwitz this year because of the large cross, which was
used in a 1979 Mass by Pope John Paul II near Auschwitz and erected
in 1988 at a nunnery bordering Auschwitz.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish leaders and the Israeli
government-funded Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem
formally complained to Poland's government about the smaller
crosses recently put up at the site. They also want the papal cross
removed, but some Jewish figures say a smaller monument that
includes a cross would be acceptable.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp and other Polish church leaders have
criticized the smaller crosses near the papal cross as provocations
by irresponsible people. But they defend the papal cross as an
appropriate symbol honoring Polish martyrdom.
	   Church leaders will meet later this month to discuss the issue.

Investigators question hijacked ship's Indian captain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan investigators on Wednesday
detained the Indian captain of a ship and his first mate who said
they were hijacked last week by Tamil Tiger rebels, officials said.
	   Moments before they were to fly home to India, Captain B.N.
Karkera, of the ``Princess Kash,'' and Ramesh Singh were questioned
by investigators at Colombo's international airport, said the
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Police apparently suspected the officers had links with the
rebels.
	   The two were among 17 Indian crewmen released Tuesday to the Red
Cross by the Tamil Tiger rebels, four days after the guerrillas
seized their ship. The vessel was later bombed and destroyed in the
water by the Sri Lankan air force.
	   The remaining 15 Indian crewmen flew to the southern Indian city
of Madras Wednesday. It wasn't immediately known if the two
detained officers were subsequently released and allowed to leave.
	   The rebels kept four Sri Lankan crewmen in detention, but they
were allowed to meet Red Cross officials and write letters to their
families. There was no indication when they will be freed.
	   Karkera told reporters before he was stopped at the airport that
he was not in command of the ship when the Sri Lankan navy and air
force demanded by radio to know why the vessel had deviated from
the stipulated route.
	   Karkera said the rebels had kept him on the deck until moments
before air force warplanes sank the ship for ignoring orders to
stay 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the northeastern shore, as
required of all ships to avoid suspicion of unloading cargo to the
rebels.
	   The ship, carrying cement, automobiles and building material,
was taken over by the guerrillas near their Mullaittivu base on its
way to Point Pedro in the Jaffna Peninsula from the capital
Colombo.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland
in the north and east for the country's minority. They accuse the
majority Sinhalese of widespread discrimination in education and
jobs.

Sri Lankan gays want anti-homosexual law repealed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's only gay rights group
Wednesday called for the repeal of a 19th century law which makes
homosexuality a criminal offense.
	   ``Gay people don't even dare come out in the open while this law
is there, branding them as criminals,'' Sherman de Rose, a
spokesman for the group Companions On a Journey, told reporters.
	   The 130-year-old law, passed when the Indian Ocean island was a
British colony, makes homosexual acts punishable by up to 12 years
in prison.
	   No studies have been done on the number of gays in Sri Lanka,
where homosexual issues are rarely discussed in the open.
	   De Rose said gays are hopeful that their attempt would succeed.
A previous move in 1992 to repeal the law was approved by the
country's Cabinet, but was never presented to parliament.
	   De Rose said the law was even hampering AIDS and safe sex
education for gay people.
	   Sri Lanka has detected only 267 AIDS cases among its 18 million
population, but some research groups estimate that there may be up
to 8,000 infected cases who have not developed full blown AIDS.

Two Germans arrested for selling phony Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Two Germans hoping to cash in on demand
for the hot new impotency drug Viagra faced fraud charges instead
Wednesday after a customer realized the pills he bought were really
just peppermints dyed blue.
	   Two men, ages 40 and 41, began offering their pills in early
August on the Internet at four for 99 marks (dlrs 55), with
discounts for buying more. The real Viagra was introduced in the
United States only this year, where it sells for dlrs 10 a pill.
	   Hanover police said Wednesday they were alerted to the scam by a
customer, who realized afterward that what he'd bought was only
peppermint candy.
	   Police searched the apartment and confiscated peppermints, blue
dye, extensive papers and a computer. The two men face charges of
fraud and violating prescription drug laws.
	   Police said they didn't know how many men were taken in by the
pair.

Ecologists try to protect chameleons on Spanish roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Spanish chameleons living by highways are
being given hope for a longer life by the Association for the
Conservation of Vertebrates.
	   The association is building half-meter (20-inch) high plastic
barriers by roadsides in southern Spain to protect the creatures,
1,500 of which are run over each year.
	   The barriers are going up in August because it's the mating
season, when males climb down from trees to search for mates, often
wandering across roads.
	   The Association for the Conservation of Vertebrates has been
putting up barriers for the past three years. It says that in the
worst-hit areas they can find 20 dead chameleons on just a
200-meter (yard) stretch of road.
	   More than 10 million animals are killed on Spanish roads each
year, according to the Spanish Environmental Defense Organization.

Ukrainian government pledges to protect economy and currency

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government and the National
Bank pledged Wednesday to protect the country's economy and
currency, but said there were no immediate grounds for concern
following the ruble crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   ``There are no signals that Ukraine's banking system was
directly affected by the Russian crisis,'' said National Bank
chairman Viktor Yushchenko.
	   Ukrainian officials have voiced fears that the ruble's dramatic
plunge may undermine Ukraine's hryvna currency, which also fell
sharply this week following the Russian devaluation announcement.
	   Another concern is that more foreign investors will flee
Ukrainian markets, as they have left Russia.
	   Still, Yushchenko noted that non-residents now hold 18 percent
of government bonds, down from about 50 percent last year.
	   ``This is not a problematic share if we speak of investors
leaving the Ukrainian market,'' he told a Cabinet meeting,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The chief banker did express concern that Russia's financial
turmoil might hurt Ukrainian exports to Russia, which have been
falling this year but still account for 32 percent of the country's
total.
	   Ukrainian clients, who hold about dlrs 100 million in Russian
banks, also were likely to suffer, Yushchenko said.
	   In their statement, the government and the National Bank said
they were keeping the country's financial situation under control
and taking measures to ensure its stability. Their statement noted
that Ukraine's market conditions were ``significantly'' different
from those in Russia.
	   Despite the assurances and the optimistic tone adopted by the
government, Ukraine's hryvna fell to 2.225 to the U.S. dollar
Wednesday from 2.1435 last week. The central bank on Tuesday raised
a key interest rate by 10 percent.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year under strong
pressure from foreign investors, who have withdrawn an estimated
dlrs 2 billion from the country.
	   Efforts by the National Bank to defend the currency resulted in
a sharp fall in its reserves from dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of the year to dlrs 1.15 billion as of last week.

Iranian national team coach resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The coach of Iran's national soccer team has
resigned after federation officials refused to give him a free hand
in running the squad, an official close to the coach said
Wednesday.
	   Jalal Talebi resigned after soccer federation officials
repeatedly intervened in his work and refused to allow him to work
independently with the players, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Talebi led Iran in this year's World Cup finals and helped his
country score a historic 2-1 victory over the United States.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, however, quoted an
official as saying Talebi resigned for personal reasons.
	   ``Talebi has announced that he is unable to coach the national
team or any club or national team of other countries for the next
four or five months due to family engagements,'' IRNA quoted the
federation's press advisor, Khosrow Valizadeh, as saying Tuesday
evening.
	   It did not say when the coach resigned.
	   Talebi was not available for comment.
	   Talebi, who has lived in the United States, coached the
Indonesian Olympic soccer team last year and is reported to have
had a serious offer from the Canadian soccer federation.

Buffaloes edge BlueWave 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tuffy Rhodes smashed a two-run home run in the
ninth inning to lead the Pacific League's second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes to a 2-1 victory over the Orix BlueWave at Nagoya Dome
Wednesday.
	   The BlueWave took a 1-0 lead in the seventh on a home run by
Yasuo Fujii, but Rhodes slugged the winning homer after Norihiro
Nakamura singled in the ninth.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 15 homers and
Fujii has 23 homers.
	   The Buffaloes are now four games behind the front-running Nippon
Ham Fighters whose scheduled game with the Chiba Lotte Marines at
Sendai was rained out.
	   At Seibu Dome, Domingo Martinez hit a home run in the second
inning and Taisei Takagi singled home two runs in the eighth as the
Seibu Lions beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 4-2.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester, has 22 homers.
	   In the Central League, Tatsuya Shindo belted a three-run home
run in the fourth and Hisashi Tokano hurled a four-hitter over
eight innings as the front-running Yokohama BayStars blanked the
Yomiuri Giants 5-0 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Shindo has 12 homers and Tokano is 5-5.
	   The BayStars are four games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons who beat the Yakult Swallows 5-3 at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   The Dragons' Koichi Sekikawa tripled home three runs and Leo
Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, singled home a run in a
four-run seventh.
	   At Hiroshima, Tomochika Tsuboi tripled home three runs and
former Chicago Cub player Dave Hansen hit a two-run double in the
10th inning as the Hanshin Tigers beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 8-6.
	   The Tigers tied 2-2 in the top of the ninth on an RBI single by
Taiwanese Yasuaki Taiho or Cheng Tai-feng.

Belarus affected by devaluation of Russian ruble

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian currency fell this week
following a one-third devaluation of the Russian ruble, but
officials insisted Wednesday they are in control of the situation.
	   The Belarusian National Bank said it had predicted the Russian
financial crisis and taken steps to minimize its impact. But in
said in a statement that the ``fastest settlement of Russia's
financial crisis would have a positive impact on the economy.''
	   The Belarusian currency, also called the ruble, traded at 84,200
to the U.S. dollar on the interbank market last week. It plunged to
110,000 on Wednesday.
	   The artificial official rate set by the National Bank remained
almost unchanged at around 44,000 rubles.
	   Belarus must buy oil and natural gas from Russia and the bulk of
its exports go to its giant eastern neighbor. Unlike Russia, it has
been barely touched by free-market reforms, as President Alexander
Lukashenko's government has kept most of the economy in state hands
and exerted Soviet-era price controls.

Hoddle under fire over business link with faith healer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already under fire for publishing details of his
pre-World Cup bust-up with Paul Gascoigne in an autobiography,
England soccer coach Glenn Hoddle was accused Wednesday of making
money from a business venture with a faith healer.
	   Hoddle's revelations in ``Glenn Hoddle: My 1998 World Cup
Story'' has already led to calls for the Football Association to
fire him for allegedly breaching confidences.
	   Now the papers have continued the attack by suggesting that the
England coach would profit from a business link with faith healer
and long-time friend Eileen Drewery.
	   Through his agent, Hoddle said he stood to gain nothing.
	   Hoddle's use of the faith healer for his players before the
World Cup in France dominated headlines in the media and the
profile Drewery _ the mother of his former girlfriend _ increased
dramatically.
	   He has stood firm amid calls for him to step down as national
team coach for betraying the trust of his players, saying the
players didn't have a problem with him.
	   In a serialized publication of his book in the Sun newspaper,
Hoddle has criticized Gascoigne, midfielder David Beckham,
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and several other players.
	   He described in detail how Gascoigne, apparently drunk, kicked
over a chair and smashed a bedside lamp after being told he would
not play in the World Cup.
	   Hoddle also mentioned Drewery on 14 pages of the book and
defended her therapeutic use with the England players during the
World Cup buildup.
	   Hoddle told a media conference Tuesday his biggest regret at the
World Cup was not taking Drewery to the championship in France. He
also said she would continue to help in the future.
	   Hoddle denied the pair would be cashing-in on the exposure her
business would get as a result of her work with the England team or
that his involvement in the business was a conflict of interest.
	   Drewery, a former barmaid turned faith healer, and Hoddle
established The Lychgate Sanctuary Ltd in October 1997. In December
the company applied for registration as a charity _ usually a
15-day process _ but still has not been granted registration.
	   Hoddle's lawyer Peter Baines confirmed Wednesday that the
Lychgate Sanctuary was a ``charity set up with the object of
relieving physical and mental suffering and combating drug
dependency.''
	   ``Glenn Hoddle has agreed to lend his name to the project by
becoming a non-executive director and trustee,'' Baines said in a
statement.
	   ``And as such he is not permitted, nor has he sought, to receive
any benefit in money or in kind from the charity.''
	   Hoddle said Drewery, who has worked with him since he was 17,
could lift the performance of the England players by 20 percent.

Sawflies destroying two Spanish forests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An army of insects is munching its way
through two forests outside Madrid, threatening to destroy 1,000
hectares (2,500 acres) of pine trees, ecologists say.
	   The culprits, bugs known as pine sawflies, are feeding on pine
needles in the Navacerrada and Cercedilla areas, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) northwest of the capital.
	   The insects get their names from saw-like pincers with which
females bore into plant tissue to lay their eggs.
	   Environmentalists with the Madrid regional government say that
in the worst-hit spots, the insects have stripped trees bare.
	   So far officials have no plans to fumigate, hoping to rely
instead on the bugs' natural enemies, like birds, moles and fungus.
	   Sonia Villalba, a spokewoman for the environmental protection
department, blamed the freak infestation on the weather. She said
mild winters in the last two years had failed to kill off enough
sawflies to keep the bugs' population at normal levels.

Bangladesh appeals for international help for flood victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hit by the worst flooding in 10 years,
Bangladesh appealed to international donors Wednesday to help it
overcome a severe food shortage.
	   More than 450 people have been reported killed in the floods
that have submerged vast tracts of this low-lying delta for nearly
six weeks. Another 45 have died from waterborne diseases, the
Health Ministry said, and 83,000 people are ill.
	   The country now faces a grain shortage of nearly 2 million tons
because of a poor harvest and flood damage, Food Minister Motia
Choudhury told representatives of donor countries and aid agencies
in Dhaka.
	   She said the present food stock was about half a million tons
while the government was trying to buy another half a million tons.
That would still leave a shortage of a million tons of grain.
	   World Bank representative Pierre Landell-Mills suggested at the
meeting that funds from existing projects be diverted toward relief
work to meet the emergency.
	   At least 2 million Bangladeshis are still displaced by the
floods.
	   Shahiduzzaman, the director-general of the government weather
office, said the situation could worsen on the night of Aug. 22-23,
when the full moon could raise the sea level. He uses only one
name.
	   Flooded districts also face widespread shortage of drinking
water, fire wood and kerosene oil used by millions of poor people
for cooking.

Italian company willing to release details on policy holders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian insurance giant Assicurazioni Generali said
Wednesday it will continue to open its archives on World War II-era
policy holders to help heirs of Holocaust victims.
	   ``Once procedural matters are respected, there are no
restrictions at all,'' said Matteo Fabiani, a spokesman for the
Trieste-based company.
	   The Israeli government had complained that a letter sent to ask
for full disclosure of details on policy holders has gone
unanswered so far.
	   ``We have absolutely no problems'' Fabiani insisted. ``Access to
our files has been granted before.''
	   Earlier this year, Fabiani said, officials from an Israeli
institute of history went to Trieste and had full access to
Assicurazioni Generali's files. They were looking for information
on policy holders in Eastern European countries from 1920-1940.
	   Generali and several other European insurance companies face a
federal court lawsuit in New York charging them with failing to pay
out policies of Holocaust victims.
	   The settlement would effect tens of thousands of claims
worldwide, including about one-third of policies bought by Jews in
eastern Europe, where Generali was the largest seller of life
insurance and annuity policies before World War II.
	   Generali is currently negotiating a claims settlement in New
York of at least dlrs 65 million with survivors and Jewish groups.

IAAF confirms Mitchell's urine sample as positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The second part of sprinter Dennis
Mitchell's urine sample tested positive for excessive levels of
testosterone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation
confirmed Wednedsday.
	   The original _ or A sample _ exceeded the allowable limit for
the male hormone after an out-of-competition test April 1 at
Gainesville, Florida. IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Wednesday
that the B sample _ taken from the same urine and examined at a lab
in Montreal _ also was over the limit.
	   Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 meters and a
three-time Olympian, will be banned for two years unless he wins an
appeal before the three-member Doping Heard Board of USA Track and
Field.
	   If the panel decides he is not guilty, Mitchell would be free to
compete again.
	   Mitchell, a two-time bronze medalist at the World Championships
and a member of the two U.S. teams that share the world record in
the 400-meter relay, also is president of USATF's Athletes Advisory
Committee, the athletes' voice in the national governing body. The
committee has taken a hard stance against doping.

Date set for New Caledonia referendum on independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ New Caledonia will hold a referendum Nov. 8 on an
agreement that could lead to independence for the South Pacific
territory, French authorities announced Wednesday.
	   The so-called Noumea agreement, named after the French
territory's capital, provides for a 15- or 20-year transition
period toward independence.
	   The transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' would be
followed in 2018 by a second referendum on self-determination.
	   It comes after years of violence and negotiations over the
status of New Caledonia, which holds about 30 percent of the
world's nickel reserves.
	   In July, French deputies and senators voted overwhelmingly in
favor of the Noumea agreement which was signed in May by French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, officials from New Caledonia's main
pro-independence party, and French settlers who have opposed
self-rule.
	   France views New Caledonia as a strategic political and economic
asset in the Pacific, and has controlled it for almost 150 years.
	   It periodically has erupted in violence between pro-independence
natives and anti-independence settlers, originally from France.

Jewish leader says U.S. must answer for Holocaust property deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leader of the battle for the return of
Holocaust victims' Swiss bank accounts said Wednesday that he would
turn his attention to a questionable deal made by the U.S.
government on behalf of Holocaust survivors.
	   Avraham Burg, chairman of the Jewish Agency, said now that a
dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks has been struck, he
would call on the United States to answer for a 1992 agreement with
the German government that compensated American citizens for only a
fraction of the value of property the Nazis seized from their
families.
	   According to a report published in the Haaretz newspaper, which
Burg confirmed, Germany agreed to pay dlrs 160 million in
compensation to American citizens _ which is estimated to amount
only to 5 percent of the actual value of the property.
	   ``We have some questions,'' Burg told The Associated Press, ``I
have no doubt that the information we need will be given and
whatever corrections needed to be corrected will be corrected.''
	   Burg said the property was mostly in the former East Germany.
	   Larry Schwartz, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy, had no
immediate comment.
	   According to Haaretz, some 4,000 American citizens were listed
as eligible for such compensation as of 1981.
	   Burg said he did not know where the questions he was raising
would lead.
	   ``I opened the box, let's see what will come out of it,'' he
said.

Islamic militant coalition warns Americans of new attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A coalition of Islamic militant groups
warned in an Arabic newspaper Wednesday that ``strikes will
continue from everywhere'' against the United States.
	   The statement from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders, formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden in February, was printed Wednesday in the London-based daily
Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   The Jihad front is believed to be a coalition of six
fundamentalist groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its
statement was sent Tuesday to Al-Hayat's bureau in Cairo.
	   Al-Hayat said it came with three other statements from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the two deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7.
	   In one statement, the Holy Shrines group said it would
``continue shipping more American dead bodies to their unjust
government ... until we humiliate America's arrogance and roll its
dignity in the mud of defeat.''
	   The group had not been heard of before the explosions in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left 257 people
dead and more than 5,500 injured. Among the dead were 12 Americans.
	   The separate statement from the Jihad coalition tied the motive
for the embassy attacks to U.S. involvement in Somalia in the early
1990s.
	   ``The two embassies, which the Islamic Army for the Liberation
of Holy Shrines bombed, have supervised the killings of at least
13,000 Somali civilians in the treacherous attack led by America
against this Muslim country,'' it said.
	   A U.N. peacekeeping mission dominated by the United States
landed in Somalia in late 1992 and provided protection for food
distribution to help end a famine in the east African country.
	   But the U.N. force became bogged down in Somalia's factional
fighting, and 18 U.S. soldiers were killed before the force
withdrew in 1995 without solving the political problems.
	   The statement from the Jihad coalition said when the Holy
Shrines group claimed responsibility for the bombings ``it became
clear to everyone, including the American people, that we were not
lying when we warned them.''
	   The group had issued a warning of attacks, printed in Al-Hayat,
several days before the embassy bombings.
	   Al-Hayat said the three other statements of the Holy Shrines
group were titled ``Open Letter to the Kenyan people,''
``Congratulations'' and ``A Communique to People.''
	   The first statement said that the Nairobi's bombing ``was
targeting the American presence only ... and the Islamic Army's
intention was not to hurt Kenyan people.''
	   The second was to congratulate Muslims ``for taking revenge from
the American Crusader criminal gang.''
	   The third warned of more attacks and asked Muslims ``not to get
close to anything American ... so that they won't be hit by the
fire of the soldiers of God'' by mistake.

free hand in running the squad, an official close to the coach said
Wednesday.
	   Talebi quit after federation officials repeatedly interfered
with the team and refused to allow him to work independently with
the players, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Talebi coached Iran in this year's World Cup finals, taking over
the team less than a month before the start of France 98, where it
beat the United States 2-1 but was eliminated after the first
round.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, however, quoted an
official as saying Talebi resigned for personal reasons.
	   ``Talebi has announced that he is unable to coach the national
team or any club or national team of other countries for the next
four or five months due to family engagements,'' IRNA quoted the
federation's press advisor, Khosrow Valizadeh, as saying Tuesday
evening.
	   It did not say when the coach resigned. Talebi was not available
for comment.
	   Talebi, who has lived in the United States, coached the
Indonesian Olympic team last year and is reported to have had a
serious offer from the Canadian federation.

6th World Checkers Championship opens in ... Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ What's being called the world checkers
championship opened Wednesday in an airport VIP lounge in Chechnya,
part of the only building that remains intact following the
region's independence war against Russia.
	   About 40 competitors from 19 countries, including Israel,
Australia, and Germany, gathered in the heavily guarded hall
festooned with flowers and banners welcoming them to Chechyna for
the first round of the two-week tournament.
	   The participants will stay at the airport hotel in the capital
city and no spectators will be allowed at the event, both for
security reasons, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The sixth annual tournament will be guarded by troops from the
Chechen Security Service and the presidential anti-terrorist
center, Interfax said.
	   It was unclear why checkers officials wanted to hold the event
in Chechnya, where gunmen regularly take foreigners hostage and
demand hefty ransoms.
	   But checkers is a popular sport in Chechnya, Roman Klimashov,
the president of the International Federation of Russian Checkers,
told the Moscow Times newspaper. And the government pledged to put
up dlrs 100,000 for tournament expenses.
	   ``I am grateful to those who came to this championship, which is
held in a region believed to be unfavorable for a number of
reasons,'' said tournament organizer and former prime minister
Shamil Basayev.
	   Basayev, who led a fierce raid against Russia during the 1994-96
war that killed about 140 people, is said to be an avid checkers
player.
	   Despite its international name, the tournament is open only for
players from the former Soviet Union, including those who
emigrated, the Moscow Times said.
	   Because Checkers guidelines vary around the world, there is no
single championship that could include all countries. The Grozny
tournament will use modified European rules.
	   ``I'm intrigued by it, actually,'' said Ian Caws, chairman of
the English Draughts (Checkers) Association. ``To my knowledge no
one in Britain plays the European game. It's all a bit of a
mystery.
	   ``But (the European) version is very popular. I believe the
Dutch have something like 10,000 members,'' he said.

Palestinians: Israel's claim it accepted pullback is a ruse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A claim by a powerful Israeli Cabinet minister
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed in principle to
hand over 14 percent of the West Bank is a ruse aimed at deflecting
U.S. pressure, a Palestinian negotiator said Wednesday.
	   Ariel Sharon, a hawk in Netanyahu's Cabinet, said Tuesday that
the Israel government has quietly accepted a U.S. proposal to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank now and hand over an
additional 1 percent in a later pullback.
	   Sharon opposes the U.S. plan, saying it would endanger Israel's
security. It is believed Sharon made the claim to embarrass
Netanyahu and invite new pressure from Cabinet hard-liners.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said Wednesday that Israel
has indeed offered to withdraw from 13 percent, but on condition
that 3 percent of that area be declared a ``nature reserve'' in
which the Palestinians would have virtually no say over land use.
	   ``So what Mr. Sharon is saying is nothing but an act of
deception,'' Shaath said, noting that the Palestinians already
rejected the idea when it was first raised last month.
	   A 1 percent pullback in a later stage also falls far short of
minimal Palestinian demands, Shaath said.
	   Sharon charged Tuesday that the Palestinians had raised new
difficulties _ such as claims that Israel was not allocating enough
water to the West Bank _ in order to invite U.S. pressure and
squeeze more concessions from Israel.
	   Shaath countered that Sharon was trying to shift blame from
Israel to the Palestinians for the prolonged deadlock in the
negotiations.
	   The Israeli offer, as portrayed by Sharon, would leave Israel
still in control of 60 percent of the West Bank, Shaath said. ``He
(Sharon) knows we will reject this and hopes that this would get
the blame off Israel and on us,'' he said.
	   In other developments Wednesday, Israeli troops demolished a
Palestinian home near the West Bank town of Hebron because it was
built without a permit.
	   The six-member family living in the home scuffled with soldiers,
and two women were taken to a nearby hospital with bruises.
	   ``This is terrorism, and I say it in front of everyone that I
will be the next (suicide) bomber in Israel because I have nothing
to lose,'' said the homeowner, Atta Jaber, 33.
	   Since the start of the year, Israel has demolished 112 homes in
the West Bank and 14 in Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.
Israel says it is merely enforcing building regulations. The
Palestinians claim Israel is trying to limit population growth in
disputed areas where it wants to cement its control.
	   The United States has asked Israel to refrain from demolishing
homes and expanding Jewish West Bank settlements.

Report: Long-Term Credit Bank may qualify for public funds to aid
</HEADLINE>
merger

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Regulators have found that the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan passes a basic measure of financial health,
paving the way for the use of public money to aid a merger with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Kyodo news reported Wednesday.
	   Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency has determined that the
bank has enough capital and retained profits to cover its losses,
Kyodo reported citing a source in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
	   Under a government plan to resolve the bad loan problem, a bank
must meet that requirement to qualify for a bailout using public
money.
	   LTCB's share price sank to an all-time low of 37 yen earlier
this month amid rumors that it might collapse under the weight of
bad real estate loans. Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on
LTCB's debt to ``speculative grade,'' identifying it as one of the
biggest danger points in the financial system.
	   The bank has repeatedly denied that it has serious financial
problems. But in what was widely seen as a rescue, the smaller
Sumitomo Trust bank announced in June that it was negotiating to
absorb LTCB. Sumitomo said it would not take over LTCB's bad loans.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, asked in parliament about
reports the government might provide public funds to the bank,
replied that LTCB hadn't asked for support.
	   ``I didn't receive a request for a bailout from the LTCB
president,'' Miyazawa said.
	   The government's handling of the troubled bank is seen as a
crucial test of its ability to stabilize its shaky banking system
and prevent the financial instability from spreading around the
world.
	   The LTCB is the first among the nation's top 19 banks to be
inspected by the financial agency since its creation in June as the
nation's new financial watchdog.

Taxi driver arrested for allegedly overcharging Australian tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police arrested a taxi driver Wednesday
for allegedly charging an Australian tourist more than 25 times the
normal price for a ride from the airport, authorities said.
	   Giorgos Mitsis, 40, confessed to charging 23-year-old Kelly Jane
Smith 38,500 drachmas (dlrs 127) for a trip that should have cost
no more than 1,500 drachmas (dlrs 5) for the 1,600-meter (one-mile)
ride, police said.
	   Smith paid the amount demanded by Mitsis, but became suspicious
and reported the incident to police.
	   She identified Mitsis from a file containing the photographs of
taxi drivers working at the airport. He was arrested after
returning to the airport and later confessed, police said.
	   If convicted, Mitsis faces a fine and the suspension of his taxi
license for about five months.
	   Cases of Greek taxi drivers overcharging customers are common,
particularly targeting tourists taking rides from airports and
ferry ports.
	   At least two other taxi drivers were arrested during the past
few months accused of grossly inflating the amount shown on their
taxi meters by using remote control devices.

U.S. envoy denies bringing no-flight proposal for Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. envoy, in Turkey to avert a new
Greek-Turkish conflict over Cyprus, denied that Washington was
pressing Turkey to agree to a no-fly zone over the divided island.
	   ``I am not aware of any proposals of a moratorium,'' Thomas
Miller, U.S. State Department special coordinator for Cyprus, told
reporters after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
	   ``Look at my hands,'' he said, raising his empty hands. ``Do you
see any proposals?''
	   Miller arrived Tuesday to push for a peaceful end to a
Greek-Turkish dispute over the planned deployment of Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles on Greek Cypriots' side of the island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since Turkish troops invaded the northern third in 1974 following a
failed, Greek-backed coup. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the
north.
	   The missile deployment is set for November. Turkey says it will
block the missiles by force if necessary; Greece says that would
mean war between the two NATO partners.
	   ``We have had a useful set of discussions on a whole range of
issues,'' Miller said, without elaborating.
	   Greece and Greek Cypriots have backed creation of a no-fly zone
over Cyprus to ease tensions. They suggested this week they would
call off the deployment entirely if Turkish Cypriots agree to talks
on reunification and military reductions.
	   Turkey has made clear it would reject any tradeoffs over the
missiles.

Sierra Leone rebel leader faces trial amid massacre threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ One of Sierra Leone's most feared
warlords will stand trial for crimes against humanity despite rebel
threats of a mass killing campaign unless he is released from
custody, officials said Wednesday.
	   Foday Sankoh, who triggered Sierra Leone's descent into civil
war in 1991, will appear in court to face charges of ``crimes
against humanity and the people of Sierra Leone,'' according to a
government broadcast on state-controlled radio.
	   The statement follows a warning by Revolutionary United Front
leader Eldred Collins that rebels will launch a campaign known as
``Operation Spare No One'' aimed at ``killing all Sierra Leoneans''
unless Sankoh is released.
	   Collins, who made the threat on Monday in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corporation, is himself being sought by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government for war-related crimes.
	   ``Orders have been given to the security forces to chase and
capture the RUF's Eldred Collins,'' the government statement said.
``His statements are regarded as a threat to all Sierra Leoneans
for the sake of one man.''
	   Sankoh was arrested last year in Nigeria on gun-running charges
and returned in handcuffs to Sierra Leone last month. If convicted,
he faces death by hanging or firing squad.
	   The rebels, along with members of a junta force ousted in
February, have reportedly killed, maimed and kidnapped thousands of
villagers in the interior of the West African country in recent
months. The junta was ousted in a military operation by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force that paved the way for
Kabbah's return from exile in March.

Syria says no peace talks without full commitment to withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's peace talks with Israel cannot
resume without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, a government newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The comment in the daily Tishrin came a day after Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai urged resuming negotiations,
saying Israel had a new formula for the Golan but making clear it
did not involve a full pullback.
	   ``The road of peace is clear to whoever wants peace. Without a
full commitment to the principle of a full pullout from the Golan
and the establishment of just and equal security arrangements, the
peace negotiations will not see light once again,'' Tishrin said in
an editorial.
	   The comment echoed Syria's long-standing position on the Golan,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later
declared annexed. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than two
years ago.
	   Syria and the previous Israeli government reached an informal
agreement on a full withdrawal from Golan, but the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected that agreement,
saying it was never completed.
	   Other Syrian government-run newspapers also responded to
Mordechai's comments. The daily Al-Thawra said Israeli statements
are no longer of concern to Syria.
	   ``What really concern us is a binding and responsible stand, a
thing which the Israeli leaders lack,'' it said.
	   The English-language Syria Time said: ``Syria is not in a hurry
to achieve an unjust peace. Unjust peace is tantamount to war ...
It's rejected.''

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's ultranationalist vice
premier said the government is ``in no hurry'' to negotiate
Kosovo's future with pro-independence ethnic Albanians, independent
media reported Wednesday.
	   ``We are in no hurry to conclude the dialogue. Why would we be
in a hurry when international circumstances are not in our favor
now?'' Seselj said in an interview with private TV station late
Tuesday, carried by independent Beta news agency.
	   ``The government ... has shown great patience not to make any
rash moves that would provoke a NATO operation in Kosovo, but
managed to conclude operations and suppress terrorism,'' Seselj
said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill has been shuttling between the
sides, trying to bring both Serb and ethnic Albanian negotiators to
the table to agree on a plan worked out by leading foreign powers.
Seselj sharply criticized the plan as lacking a
``take-it-or-leave-it in the text.''
	   ``The Americans and Germans have decided to reduce Serbia to a
territory as small as possible,'' he said.
	   Seselj also blasted Hill as ``mentor and instructor for the
Albanian negotiating team and, as long as this government is in
office, Hill will not be sitting at the table for dialogue.''
	   On Wednesday, Milosevic's top fellow Socialist, Zivorad Igic,
also criticized the Albanians for agreeing to talks only on the
condition that Serb security forces halt their attacks on the
province.
	   ``That is insincere,'' Igic said, ``he violence is consequence
of Albanian separatism and terrorism.''

Swiss minister lined up to head 2006 Winter Olympics bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss sports and defense minister Adolf
Ogi has been cleared to lead Sion's bid for the 2006 Winter
Olympics, Swiss authorities said Wednesday.
	   Ogi will succeed FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the post when he
steps down later this month.
	   His position will expire in June when the vote is taken in
Seoul, South Korea, on a venue for the 2006 Winter Games. The
government ruled that he can combine his ministerial role with the
Sion bid presidency.
	   Blatter, elected in June to head FIFA, last month announced his
resignation from the Olympic bid panel.
	   Blatter said he didn't think holding the double role as head of
FIFA and the Winter Olympics bid is possible any longer.
	   However, he is one of the most prominent campaigners for the
Sion bid and has said he will continue to support it.

Ukrainian Cabinet discusses 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details new 3rd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet discussed Wednesday the
1999 budget draft that it wants to submit to parliament next month.
	   The initial version presented by Finance Ministry officials
provided for combined state and regional budget revenues of 26.2
billion hryvna (dlrs 12.5 billion at the present exchange rate) and
spending of 27.9 billion hryvna (dlrs 13.3 billion).
	   The planned 1999 deficit would constitute 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product, down from 2.5 percent slated for this year. The
draft provides for an annual consumer price increase of 9.6
percent.
	   The draft also included an estimated 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 3
billion) to service the mounting state debt in 1999, a significant
increase from the 3.6 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.7 billion) this year.
	   The government ordered all ministries to submit budget proposals
by Aug. 25, and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said he wants
to submit the draft to parliament by Sept. 10.

plans to set up a chain of spas in Jordan and Egypt, a Cabinet
official said Wednesday.
	   Tourism Minister Aqel Biltaji said the consortium, known as
Safa, will set up its first resort on the Dead Sea. The firm will
extract salt and mud for the sea for skin treatment at the spa.
	   The Dead Sea, which is the lowest point on earth, is 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Amman.
	   Biltaji said Safa has allocated dlrs 20 million for the project,
which also includes building another spa near the mineral springs
of Himma, 120 kilometers (70 miles) north of Amman and one at
Egypt's Red Sea resort of Hurghada.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese and Syrian businessmen are
planning to establish a joint shareholding company with a dlrs 10
million capital, An-Nahar newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The company would implement joint economic projects between the
two countries.
	   It said a proposal for such a company as well as other projects
will be discussed by the Lebanese-Syrian Businessmen Council when
it meets Thursday in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The council
includes private sector businessmen from both countries.
	   The proposal for a shareholding company will be submitted by
Lebanese businessmen and its capital will be divided equally
between the two sides, An-Nahar said.
	   It added that Lebanese businessmen are expected to stress the
significance of removing financial and economic obstacles as a main
condition for launching the proposed company.
	   Lebanon's free enterprise system is in sharp contrast with
Syria's government-controlled economy. Syria, however, has sought
in the past few years to introduce reforms in a bid to lure foreign
investment.
	   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, where it maintains
about 30,000 soldiers ostensibly as peacekeepers to prevent the
1975-90 civil from being rekindled.
	   Since the war ended, the two countries have signed accords aimed
at boosting economic and trade relations.
	   About one million Syrians are working, mainly in construction,
in Lebanon, which has a population estimated at 3.2 million.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police have arrested a
leader of the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, his family
said Wednesday.
	   Abdullah Shami, head of Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, was
taken from his home for questioning at midnight Tuesday, his family
said.
	   Family members said they did not know why Shami had been
arrested now. No confirmation of the arrest or other details were
immediately available from Palestinian authorities.
	   Shami was arrested and detained for four days in April during a
Palestinian Authority crackdown on Islamic movements.
	   Islamic Jihad and its larger sister group, Hamas, oppose the
Israel-Palestinian peace process, and have claimed responsibility
for attacks that have killed scores of Israelis since the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords in 1993.

<TEXT>
	   HOSPITALET, Spain (AP) _ Three Spanish nightclub bouncers have
been charged with beating to death a man who reportedly walked into
the ladies' room by mistake, police said Wednesday.
	   Juan Antonio Ferreira, 30, died Monday of head injuries suffered
the night before at a club called 'Yes and Yesterday' in
Hospitalet, a northeastern town outside Barcelona.
	   The bouncers, aged 25 to 29, were arrested Monday and were
charged Wednesday with manslaughter, police said.
	   According to Ferreira's girlfriend, Lourdes Vargas, Ferreira had
gone into the ladies' room by mistake. A bouncer went in after him
and dragged him back out and into the men's room, roughing him up
along the way.
	   Ferreira returned to the dance floor and told his girlfriend
what had happened, she said. Then three bouncers came up, pulled
him outside through an emergency door and beat him.
	   Ferreira underwent emergency brain surgery but died in the
hospital.
	   The bouncers said Ferreira was drunk and abusive, police said.

More than 1,000 Iranians demonstrate outside U.N. building
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 students demonstrated
outside the U.N. offices in downtown Tehran Wednesday, calling on
the world body to secure the release of Iranians held in
Afghanistan.
	   Dozens of riot police ringed the building as the protesters
chanted ``Death to Taliban'' and ``Death to America.''
	   Iran has accused the Taliban, a leading force in Afghanistan's
civil war, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. Tehran has also accused the
United States and Pakistan of supporting the Taliban.
	   The students unfurled banners reading ``We demand the immediate
release of our loved ones,'' and ``We condemn the political and
military interference of Pakistan in Afghanistan.''
	   In a statement, the protesters said the United Nations had done
nothing to obtain the Iranians' release and called on their
government to ``carry out a military rescue operation.''
	   The demonstration followed a smaller protest on Tuesday when
some two dozen relatives of the detainees stood outside the U.N.
offices.
	   Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who now heads a
government advisory council, warned Tuesday that Iran might resort
to force to free the Iranians, who include 11 diplomats, one
journalist and 35 drivers for an international transport company.
	   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said
Tuesday that an Iranian official had met the truck drivers in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Sunday.
	   Boroujerdi, who is responsible for Afghan affairs, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health, but the Taliban
did not allow him to meet the diplomats and correspondent, Iran's
state television reported.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the detainees'
safety.
	   Islamabad is widely believed to provide arms and other support
to the Taliban. Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the
northern-based opposition to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.

Umpire incident prompts cricket security review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Edgbaston official in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English cricket will undergo a security review
after umpire John Holder was knocked to the ground by an
over-zealous fan following a limited-overs between England and
South Africa at Edgbaston.
	   An English Cricket Board spokesman Wednesday said the incident
would be reviewed by the ground management working committee in the
lead-up to next year's cricket World Cup in England.
	   Holder was walking towards the pavilion after South Africa's
14-run win Tuesday when a member of the 20,000-strong crowd tried
to grab a stump from him. The stump contained a miniature camera
and was worth 10,000 pounds (dlrs 162,500).
	   The 53-year-old umpire, a former English county cricket fast
bowler, said it was a shock to be knocked to the ground.
	   Stewards restrained the fan and he was later taken into custody
by police but released.
	   ``I'm alright, but it's not something I want to happen again,''
Holder said.
	   ``I think he (the fan) wanted a stump. I'm not going to make a
complaint about it. The stewards dealt with it.''
	   Edgbatson chief executive Dennis Amiss said ground security at
Edgbatson would be bolstered in future, although MCC officials at
Lord's had no plans to increase security for the final between
England and Sri Lanka on Thursday.
	   ``I was pleased he was not trying to have a go at the umpire but
it's obviously a matter for concern and we must find ways of
protecting the players and the umpires and get them off the field
safely,'' Amiss said.
	   Amiss said the offender, reportedly a ``football supporter'' and
a member of the England Football Supporters' Club, will be banned
from future matches at Edgbaston.
	   ``He has been told in no uncertain terms that he will not be
welcome at Edgbaston again.''
	   England advanced to Thursday's limited-overs series final
despite losing to South Africa at Edgbaston. South Africa scored
244 and needed to beat England by 47 runs to earn a place in the
final. England was all out for 230 in reply.
	   South African captain Hanse Cronje said his team was looking
forward to returning home for a short break after playing 16 tests
and 27 limited-overs internationals since October.

Taiwan party warns of fallout from Chinese floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's pro-independence opposition party
on Wednesday warned against the possible economic and social
effects of China's massive summer flooding.
	   Taiwan's major opposition Democratic Progressive Party said it
``felt deep sorrow for the Chinese people,'' but added that
Taiwan's government must take immediate steps to avoid a public
health crisis from spilling over into the island.
	   The party urged Taiwan's government to prepare for possible
price adjustments of agricultural products and other ill-effects of
the heavy flooding that may compromise Taiwan's economic growth or
social order.
	   More than 2,000 people have died and millions have been left
homeless in the worst flooding in China since 1954.
	   ``Government organs must strengthen measures
against...smuggling, illegal immigration and other problems to
prevent Taiwan's national security being affected,'' the party
said.
	   The party also called for financial assistance to Taiwanese
businesses damaged in the flooding, and expressed opposition to
flood taxes levied by China's local governmnets on Taiwanese
investments.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province since Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island in 1949. The DPP
advocates formal independence from the mainland despite counsel
from Beijing that force would be used if necessary to prevent an
independent Taiwan.

 &UR; Viagra bust: Alpine restaurant raided for contraband sauce
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, background, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN PERILHON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ How to get around Europe's ban on Viagra? A
chef in the French Alps thought he found a way, and like a lot of
other French cuisine, the secret is in the sauce.
	   But hotel chef Jean-Louis Galland just can't keep a secret about
using the new virility drug, especially when he and other
restaurateurs are fighting for business during the hot August
doldrums in the Alpine region of Savoie.
	   Even though government agents raided his Hotel de la
Restauration on Tuesday and Viagra's makers are after him, he's
defiantly served his fare laced with the impotence-fighting pill.
	   ``I don't understand it,'' Galland said in a telephone interview
from Thonon-les-Bains near the Swiss border. ``They make medicine
to make love better and they want to make war with me!''
	   For 180 francs (dlrs 33), Galland has been offering a
three-course ``Viagra Menu'' since last weekend. After a
langoustine salad entree, the piece de resistance is ``beef piccata
in Viagra sauce with fig vinegar and fine herbs.''
	   And don't miss the aphrodisiac desert: nougat ice cream with
berry and ginger sauce, topped with fresh mint.
	   Never mind if Galland uses only one 50 milligram Viagra pill to
make sauce for five, a symbolic attention-getter unless you go back
for several helpings.
	   Galland, who buys the pills in nearby Switzerland, says it was a
great investment, reporting business is up sharply.
	   The drug company Pfizer, awaiting approval from the 15-nation
European Union to sell Viagra in the EU, was not amused. ``The
objective of a medication is not to be in a sauce,'' the company's
Paris office dryly said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The same day, inspectors from the French Bureau of Consumerism
and the Repression of Fraud descended on the restaurant and seized
Galland's supply. But Galland obtained a new stock of the drug and
again offered the fixed menu Wednesday.
	   Police cited Galland for importing and using a banned drug. A
prosecutor in Thonon was to decide whether to proceed with legal
action against Galland.
	   ``I hope the justice system won't be too harsh,'' Galland said.
	   But Pfizer said Wednesday that Galland had to be stopped.
	   ``This is an illegal act. We were are in contact with the
Ministry of Public Health,'' said company spokesman Dr. Sylvia
Cukier. ``It's not a joke, you can't give this to just anyone.''

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - U.S. and Albanian agents have launched a
nationwide search for suspected members of an international
terrorist cell believed to have been planning to blow up the
American embassy, an Albanian interior ministry official said
Wednesday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Albanian
security police and Central Intelligence Agency operatives launched
the manhunt after the CIA uncovered ``serious evidence'' of a
bombing plot last week.
	   On Sunday, about 150 heavily armed U.S. Marines and Navy
commandos rushed to the U.S. diplomatic compound at Rilindja Ridge
on the edge of the city, where the embassy is temporarily operating
while the main building undergoes renovation.
	   In a letter Tuesday to the U.S. Congress, President Clinton said
the troops were deployed after U.S. officials received ``credible
information'' of a possible attack on the embassy.

German opposition proposes super ministry tying economics with
</HEADLINE>
high-tech &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats will combine
economics, research and technology in one super-ministry if they
win next month's election, chancellor hopeful Gerhard Schroeder
said Wednesday.
	   The economics ministry will then ``finally be linked to an
applications-oriented field,'' Schroeder said at a campaign
appearance with the maverick computer entrepreneur he has tapped
for the job, Jost Stollmann.
	   The announcement comes two days after Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
trailing Schroeder in his bid for a record fifth term, presented
his own advisory group on ``future and innovation,'' to be chaired
by a former political adversary, Lothar Spaeth.
	   Like Stollmann, Spaeth has been outspoken about the need to
reform Germany's social welfare state to better compete in a global
marketplace.
	   But in Berlin Wednesday, Schroeder stressed his reforms would be
linked to social justice, accusing Kohl's government of trying to
solve mass unemployment by cutting the basic standard of living for
workers.
	   He singled out a law passed by Kohl's government allowing
employers to scale back sick pay to 80 percent of a worker's
regular earnings, promising to repeal it if elected.
	   In Bonn, though, Kohl's spokesman asserted that reversing that
and other limited reforms achieved by Kohl would be ``suicide for
Germany as a business location.''
	   The Social Democrats' plan for their first 100 days, reported
piecemeal over the past week by German media, would kill jobs, hurt
business and lead to higher taxes, Kohl spokesman Otto Hauser said.
	   ``The economic upswing in Germany would be severely harmed,'' he
said.
	   Stollmann, who graduated from Harvard Business School and worked
in Chicago in the 1980s, founded his own computer systems
integration firm in 1984. He has no party affiliation.
	   Spaeth, a former governor of the western state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, moved east in 1991 and has transformed the
crumbling Carl Zeiss Jena group into a highly successful high-tech
and telecommunications firm, Jenoptik.

President of Turkmenistan to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan will
visit China from Aug. 31 to Sept. 4, the Interfax news agency said
Wednesday.
	   Niyazov first visited China in November 1992, the year after his
Central Asian country gained independence in the break-up of the
Soviet Union.
	   The two sides are expected to discuss a project to build a gas
pipeline from Turkmenistan to China and Japan, Interfax said. They
are also expected to sign agreements on communications, technology,
education and tourism.

Annan's envoy says U.N.-Iraq dispute not yet at crisis point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 13th graf to CORRECT that Shah was bringing Annan message
sted letter.
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. envoy Prakash Shah left Baghdad on
Wednesday, saying Iraq-U.N. relations had not reached a crisis
despite his failure to persuade the government to allow the
resumption of U.N. arms inspections.
	   Shah, the special envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
went to Habbaniya air base outside the capital where he later left
on a flight to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus en route to New
York.
	   He said he would arrive in New York on Thursday and would later
brief Annan on his talks with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz. He did not say when the briefing would be.
	   His departure came a day after he announced he had failed to
persuade Iraqi officials to back down from the cut-off of relations
with the inspectors assigned to find Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, in effect blocking inspections.
	   ``There was no change in their policy,'' Shah told reporters
Tuesday.
	   Iraq announced in early August it would refuse cooperation with
the inspectors, saying they were not really working toward the
lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq that prevent the free export of
oil, its most valuable commodity.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the inspectors must declare Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weapons before the sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be canceled.
	   Before leaving Wednesday, Shah said he still hoped a solution
could be found to allow the resumption of arms inspections.
	   ``I will not say it is a crisis,'' he said. ``I still think that
a lot of discussion, negotiations and bilateral talks can take
place.
	   ``I think and I hope that the Security Council and Iraq would be
able to work this out,'' Shah said as he left the headquarters of
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the weapons inspections.
	   Shah described his talks with Aziz as ``friendly and cordial''
and said he was ready to return for further negotiations with the
Iraqis.
	   ``I will be going to New York, and if the council wishes further
discussions, I will be prepared,'' he said.
	   Shah arrived last Thursday with a message from Annan to Aziz
about the latest stand-off.

Kuchma refuses to sign controversial oil law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma refused
to sign a law banning the creation of a single state oil and gas
company and proposed that parliament cancel it, the president's
press service said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma said the legislation would hurt the economy and would bar
the government from implementing its rights regarding state
property.
	   The law, adopted by parliament last month, barred the government
from transferring its stakes in gas and oil companies to the new
company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, and banned government agencies from
turning enterprises in the gas and oil sector into shareholding
companies.
	   Kuchma created Naftogaz Ukrainy earlier this year. The company
was to be formed by uniting state-owned companies, and transferring
to it the stakes the government holds in other partially privatized
gas and oil enterprises.
	   Naftogaz Ukrainy was to take charge of the national gas and oil
pipeline network, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
	   The creation of Naftogaz Ukrainy was seen as an attempt to find
a way to privatize Ukraine's gas and oil companies, most of which
parliament banned from privatization in 1995. The government was
said to be planning a future privatization of Naftogaz itself.
	   A number of Western firms have expressed interest in Ukraine's
gas and oil sector but have run into opposition from parliament,
which has a large share of Communist and other hard-line lawmakers.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu said
Wednesday recently uncovered letters implicate South African, U.S.
and British intelligence agents in the 1961 death of U.N.
Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold.
	   However Tutu, the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, said the veracity of the letters have not been
determined.
	   Hammarskjold and 15 other people died when their plane exploded
just before landing in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. He had been
trying to mediate a peace agreement between Congo and the breakaway
province of Katanga.
	   Three independent commissions set up by Sweden, the United
Nations and Northern Rhodesia concluded long ago the Sept. 17,
1961, plane crash probably was caused by pilot error, but didn't
exclude other possibilities.
	   The Truth Commission, which is probing apartheid-era crimes,
discovered the eight letters during an investigation into a
different matter. They have been turned over to President Nelson
Mandela and Justice Minister Dullah Omar, who will decide what
further actions should be taken.
	   The letters describe meetings between America's Central
Intelligence Agency, Britain's MI5 and the South African Institute
for Maritime Research, believed to be a possible military front
company, Tutu said.
	   Hand-written or typed on paper with the logo of the SAIMR, the
letters are a correspondence between two SAIMR employees signing
themselves ``Captain'' and ``Commodore.''
	   Marked ``Top Secret,'' they describe a mission dubbed
``Operation Celeste'' to kill Hammerskjold.
	   ``It is felt that Hammarskjold should be removed,'' one letter
states, after detailing an alleged meeting between British spies
and SAIMR employees.
	   The undated letter says: ``Allen Dulles agrees and has promised
full cooperation from his people.''
	   Dulles was director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961.
	   One of the letters says TNT was to be planted in the plane's
wheel bay, which would explode as the wheels retracted after
take-off. Another letter says the bomb failed to go off as planned
and detonated when the wheels came down for landing.
	   Another letter contains a reference to a CIA contact known as
``Dwight.''
	   According to that letter, on meeting the CIA contact, the
Captain was supposed to use the password ``How is Celeste these
days?'' Dwight would then reply ``She's recovering nicely apart
from the cough.''
	   No motive for the purported assassination plot is mentioned in
the letters.
	   Tutu told a news conference he did not know if the letters were
genuine or fake. He said they had not been made public before and
were being released now to keep his commission's work
``transparent.''
	   Conspiracy theories about Hammarskjold's death began emerging
days after the crash. Some newspapers alleged Britain was
supporting rebel leader Moise Tshombe, was opposed to U.N. policy
and had plotted against Hammarskjold.
	   The DC-6B crashed during a mission by the Swedish U.N. chief to
negotiate with Tshombe.
	   In 1992, two former U.N. officials said mercenaries shot down
Hammarskjold's plane.
	   The mercenaries were hired by Belgian, American and British
mining companies that feared their business would be hurt by
Hammarskjold's attempt to mediate a dispute in copper-rich Katanga,
former U.N. officials George Ivan Smith and Conor Cruise O'Brien
alleged in a letter published in The Guardian newspaper of London.
	   The mercenaries were hired to intercept the U.N. chief, but
accidentally shot down his plane, said Smith and O'Brien, who were
U.N. representatives in Congo in the 1960s.
	   Investigations have made no suggestion the plane was shot down.

German woman protests forced virginity test in Turkish prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish prosecutors have refused to let an
imprisoned German woman sue prison officials for subjecting her to
a virginity test, her lawyer said Wednesday.
	   Turkish prisons often force the tests on female prisoners,
saying the exams reduce allegations of rape by guards. Human rights
groups say the tests are a way of harassing female political
prisoners.
	   Eva Junckhe was arrested in October 1997 on charges of belonging
to an outlawed Kurdish rebel group, PKK. She has been locked up in
a prison in southeastern Turkey pending a verdict in her trial.
	   Junckhe claims to have been forcibly examined by doctors two
weeks after her arrest.
	   Lawyer Eren Keskin said the chief state security court
prosecutor for the southeastern city of Van rejected an application
for a lawsuit. If a renewed application is denied, Junckhe will
take her protest to the European Court of Human Rights, Keskin
said.

Zeman's cabinet survives vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The center-left cabinet of Premier
Milos Zeman survived a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday
after some opposition deputies walked out.
	   A total of 73 deputies voted in favor of the cabinet, with 39
against and 24 abstentions. A simple majority of 69 of the 136
deputies present was needed to carry the motion in the 200-seat
legislature.
	   The one-party minority cabinet was appointed by President Vaclav
Havel on July 22.
	   According to the Czech constitution, the new government has to
undergo a vote of confidence in parliament to show it has enough
political power to implement its program.
	   The survival of the government was ensured by a toleration pact
signed last month with the strongest opposition group, the Civic
Democratic Party led by former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Under the pact, the Civic Democratic Party allowed the Social
Democrats to win by pulling out all of its 63 deputies during the
vote.
	   Zeman's cabinet is the first center-left government since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   A three-party coalition government led by Klaus collapsed last
November and was replaced by an interim government designed to lead
the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   The Social Democrats emerged as the winners of the ballot,
gaining 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature. Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party came in a close second.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, which
hold a total of 39 seats in parliament, voted against the cabinet,
citing disagreement with the government's policies.
	   The Communists, with 24 deputies, abstained from the vote.

Bosnian Croat delegation presses for action on anti-Croat
</HEADLINE>
atrocities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A high-level Bosnian Croat
delegation Wednesday pressed Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
prosecutors to indict those responsible for a string of anti-Croat
atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   The delegation, led by Bosnian Federation Vice President
Vladimir Soljic, spoke to the U.N. court's president and chief
prosecutor and handed them a list of alleged massacres of Bosnian
Croats by Serb and Muslim forces.
	   The meetings came as the trial of six Bosnian Croats accused of
involvement in a notorious 1993 massacre of Muslim civilians
entered its third day.
	   Officials at the court declined comment on the visit.
Prosecutors routinely refuse to comment on what they describe as
``operational matters'' including ongoing investigations and
possible indictments.
	   Soljic presented a list of 14 massacres alleged to have taken
place between May 1992 and January 1994 in which Bosnian Croats
were the victims. The alleged massacres included one killing spree
in which 74 people were slain.
	   Details of the killings have been handed to prosecutors at the
tribunal but no public indictments have been issued in connection
with the allegations.
	   Four of the six trials currently under way at the U.N. court
involve alleged atrocities committed by Bosnian Croats.
	   Croats in Bosnia often complain that they are being unfairly
picked on by tribunal prosecutors who should also focus on Muslim
war crimes. So far, only three Muslims have been indicted out of a
total of more than 50 named suspects. The majority of suspects are
ethnic Serbs.

Top EU humanitarian official stopped by Kosovo rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The European Union's top human
rights official was stopped by ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
Wednesday, who refused to allow her convoy with journalists to
reach a disputed village in the restive province.
	   Emma Bonino, the human rights commissioner for the EU was
traveling in southern Serb province to assess the situation of tens
of thousands of people who were displaced by the fighting between
rebel Albanians and Serb-led government security forces.
	   Bonino's convoy was stopped at a checkpoint just outside
Malisevo, a former stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
which fell under police control earlier this month, an Associated
Press Television crew traveling with Bonino said.
	   The KLA fighters told Bonino that she could proceed to the
village, but only without journalists. Bonino refused and the
convoy turned back, instead visiting the village of Cirez.
	   Bonino expressed concern that severe food shortages could result
if refugees could not return to their homes in time for the
harvest.
	   Bonino also met with ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim
Rugova in Pristina.

Taliban won't hand over possible bombing suspect

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban leaders declared
Wednesday they would not hand over an anti-American dissident in
their country, even if there were proof he was behind U.S. Embassy
bombings in East Africa that killed 257 people.
	   Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Hasan said he was
convinced Osama bin Laden had nothing to do with the bombings, but
if the United States proved otherwise, ``we will punish him here.
It is not right to give a Muslim to an infidel country.''
	   U.S. officials have made indirect appeals to the Taliban
religious army, which controls most of Afghanistan, to expel bin
Laden. He is believed to have several homes in Afghanistan,
including in the southern city of Kandahar that is the Taliban's
base.
	   The U.S. State Department has described bin Laden as one of the
world's most significant sponsors of militant Islamic activities
all over the world. Two years ago, bin Laden issued a call from
Afghanistan for ``holy war'' against the U.S. military he says
desecrate Islamic holy places with their presence in his native
Saudi Arabia.
	   In a statement in Wednesday's Al Hayat, a respected London-based
Arabic newspaper, bin Laden's World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders issued a warning that ``strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   A suspect arrested in neighboring Pakistan in the African
bombings reportedly told investigators he was a member of bin
Laden's group. Pakistan handed over the suspect, identified as by
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, to U.S. and Kenyan investigators in Nairobi.
	   In the Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, about 100 supporters
of a small, conservative Islamic party demonstrated Wednesday
against Odeh's handover. The protesters chanted anti-U.S. slogans.

Polish clubs end boycott of top division matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's first division soccer teams
decided Wednesday to end a boycott of league matches and instead
hold a brief protest against the soccer federation president before
games.
	   The nation's first and second division teams voted 36-1 for the
first division sides to resume playing matches boycotted for the
past two weekends.
	   Despite the boycott, clubs and players continued to participate
in international matches, including Poland's 2-0 victory over
Israel on Tuesday night.
	   The boycott was to demand the resignation of Polish Soccer
Federation president Marian Dziurowicz for alleged mismanagement
and corruption. Dziurowicz has refused to step down but called a
special federation meeting for Nov. 12 to discuss the crisis in
Polish soccer.
	   At Wednesday's meeting, players decided to delay the start of
each game to read a statement demanding Dziurowicz's resignation.
	   Dziurowicz angered them even more by refusing to sign an
agreement to create a new Autonomous Polish League that would give
first and second division clubs more control of their affairs.
	   According to the agreement between the federation and clubs, the
new league would handle contracts with sponsors, broadcast right,
scheduling and overseeing referees and players _ duties now handled
by the federation.
	   But Dziurowicz refused to sign Wednesday, saying the agreement
needed changes to satisfy legal questions.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended the entire federation
leadership _ including Dziurowicz _ in May for refusing to allow an
investigation into alleged mismanagement. The federation leaders
claimed they were independent of the government review.
	   World soccer's governing body, FIFA, then threatened to ban
Polish teams from international competition unless the government
and the Polish federation ended their dispute.
	   Debski reinstated the federation leaders on Aug. 8 to avoid a
FIFA suspension, but only after the federation agreed to let state
controllers examine its books and records.
	   Poland's national team has failed to qualify for the World Cup
since 1982. Debski blames soccer officials for the general decline
of the sports.

Iranians extradited from Turkmenistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thirty-eight Iranians arrested or convicted of
crimes in Turkmenistan have been deported from the Central Asian
country, the Interfax news agency said Wednesday.
	   Most of them are women sentenced to long prison terms for drug
smuggling, said Bairam Annamuradov, head of the Turkmen Foreign
Ministry's consular section. Some had been sentenced to death.
	   No reason for the extraditions, ordered by Turkmen President
Saparmurad Niyazov, were given.
	   Nearly 50 people were extradited to Iran in December, Interfax
said.

Inventor of the soft contact lens dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Otto Wichterle, a Czech researcher
who invented the soft contact lens, has died, officials said
Wednesday. He was 84.
	   Wichterle, a former chairman of the Czech Academy of Sciences,
died in his sleep Tuesday in his summer home in the Moravian
village of Strazisko, said academy spokesman Pavel Vales.
	   ``He was one of the most important and internationally most
respected Czech scientists of the 20th century,'' said Rudolf
Zahradnik, the academy's president.
	   Wichterle gained prominence through his ability to translate
scientific research into practical uses. While employed by the Bata
shoe-manufacturing company during World War II, he invented a nylon
fiber frequently employed for industrial uses.
	   By far his greatest discovery, however, was the soft contact
lens, which he invented in 1956.
	   After siding with liberals during the failed 1968 reforms of
Alexander Dubcek's government, Wichterle was stripped of his
academic honors.
	   With the demise of communism and the peaceful establishment of
the Czech Republic in 1993, he was rehabilitated and elected
honorary chairman of the Academy of Sciences.

Swiss judge recommends Pakistan indict Ms. Bhutto

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge said Wednesday he is asking Pakistan
officials to indict former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
on charges of money laundering.
	   Daniel Devaud, an investigating magistrate in Geneva, said he
had enough evidence to charge Ms. Bhutto in Switzerland, but that
it is at the moment impossible to bring her to Geneva to face
charges.
	   Devaud said he has formally asked Swiss federal authorities to
relay his recommendation to the Pakistan government that it indict
her in her home country. He said he has passed to Pakistan bank
documents backing the charges.
	   Pakistan authorities have blocked Ms. Bhutto from leaving the
country because of her legal problems there.
	   Even if Devaud were to indict her himself, she would be under no
obligation to face charges in Switzerland, noted her Geneva
attorney, Dominique Poncet.
	   The judge said he is asking for the indictment over Ms. Bhutto's
dealings with two Swiss firms, Societe Generale de Surveillance and
its former subsidiary Cotecna Inspection SA.
	   Last month, Devaud indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali
Zardari, on similar charges.
	   Pakistani officials have said they gave Devaud numerous
documents that showed Zardari and Ms. Bhutto had used Swiss
connections to receive kickbacks on Pakistan government contracts
with the firms.
	   Ms. Bhutto has rejected the allegations as being concocted by
her political adversaries.
	   Cotecna has denied any of its employees had violated
international or national laws in the case. SGS has launched an
internal investigation.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in November 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule, which she also disputes as being
manufactured by opponents.
	   In Islamabad, Farhatulla Babar, spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party, said proceedings against her abroad are
based on false evidence supplied by the Pakistani government.
	   Officials at Switzerland's Office of Police Affairs in Bern said
they were unable to say whether Devaud's recommendation had been
relayed to Pakistan.
	   Pakistani Ambassador S.M. Inamullah said in Bern that he would
be informed of any recommendation only after the Swiss Embassy in
Islamabad had passed it on to his government.
	   Devaud said last month when he charged Zardari that he was
trying to determine whether Ms. Bhutto could claim diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity before deciding whether to charge her in
Switzerland.
	   Ms. Bhutto has challenged the legality of correspondence of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government with Swiss authorities.
	   The country's Supreme Court has ruled that the Pakistani
government cannot pass on any more materials until a ruling is made
on her legal challenge on this point.
	   The Pakistan government maintains kickbacks from Pakistani
government contracts flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   In June, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ a former senior
executive of SGS, the managing director of Cotecna and a lawyer who
served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Cotecna and SGS lost their contracts to inspect imports and
exports from Pakistan after Bhutto was ousted.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family frozen in seven Geneva banks.

Charges expected against former Bremer Vulkan shipyard chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ The former chairman of the bankrupt
shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan AG will be charged with fraud for
allegedly diverting hundreds of millions of marks in European Union
subsidies to the company's western shipyards instead of those it
had acquired in the former communist east, judicial sources said
Wednesday.
	   Friedrich Hennemann, 62, was arrested in June 1996 as the
investigation began to prevent him from fleeing or destroying
evidence, but was released seven weeks later on 6 million marks
(dlrs 4 million) bail.
	   Judicial sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
charges would be brought against him and six other ex-managers,
including some former board members. A news conference was planned
for Friday.
	   Hennemann, head of what was Germany's largest shipbuilder, and
other ex-managers were being investigated for the 1993 diversion of
850 million marks (dlrs 574.3 million) in EU subsidies to the
company's western shipyards. The money had been earmarked for its
yards in former East Germany.
	   The company had chalked up huge losses in the early 1990s
because of stiff competition and the strong mark, which makes
German vessels more expensive to buy abroad.
	   The company began bankruptcy proceedings in April 1996 and spun
off its eastern shipyards again before shutting down last year.

US Marines hunker down to guard US compound after terrorist threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ U.S. and Albanian agents have launched a
nationwide search for suspected members of an international
terrorist cell who may have been planning to blow up the American
Embassy in Tirana, an Albanian official said Wednesday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Albanian
security police and Central Intelligence Agency operatives launched
the search after the CIA uncovered ``serious evidence'' of a
bombing plot last week.
	   On Sunday, 150 heavily armed U.S. Marines and Navy commandos
rushed to the U.S. diplomatic compound at Rilindja Ridge on the
edge of the city, where the embassy is temporarily operating while
the main building undergoes renovation.
	   In a letter Tuesday to Congress, President Bill Clinton said the
troops were deployed after U.S. officials received ``credible
information'' of a possible attack on the embassy.
	   A source at the Albania's Interior Ministry said an Albanian
caller threatened several times last week to drive a car bomb into
the U.S. Embassy. He spoke only briefly.
	   U.S. and Albanian officials suspect the threat was linked to the
arrests of several Egyptians suspected of being involved in
terrorist attacks in their homeland.
	   Concern over security of U.S. installations overseas has
increased since the bombings this month at American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in which 257 people were killed and 5,500 were
injured.
	   The day before the Africa bombings, an Arabic language newspaper
in London, al-Hayat, published a letter from an Islamic group
vowing revenge against the United States for the arrests of several
of its members in Albania.
	   On Saturday, the Albanian source said, U.S. Ambassador Marisa
Lino met with Albania's deputy prime minister, Bashkim Fino, and
told him of ``solid evidence'' to attack the embassy.
	   U.S. authorities then ordered about 150 Marines and Navy
commandoes to secure the compound. The troops were in the area to
take part in a NATO exercise to show the Alliance's commitment to
contain the fighting in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   The U.S. State Department also ordered nonessential embassy
employees as well as diplomatic families to leave the country. It
also warned other Americans against travel to Albania.
	   About 120 heavily armed Marines remained hunkered down around
the compound Wednesday after installing 10-foot (3-meter) iron
barricades around it.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said. ``Have we
made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think twice before
tackling it. This is robust security.''

More than 1,000 Iranians demonstrate outside U.N. building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 students demonstrated
Wednesday outside the U.N. offices in downtown Tehran, urging the
world body to secure the release of Iranians held in Afghanistan.
	   Dozens of riot police ringed the building as the protesters
chanted ``Death to Taliban'' and ``Death to America.''
	   Iran has accused the Taliban, a leading force in Afghanistan's
civil war, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. Tehran has also accused the
United States and Pakistan of supporting the Taliban.
	   The students unfurled banners reading ``We demand the immediate
release of our loved ones,'' and ``We condemn the political and
military interference of Pakistan in Afghanistan.''
	   In a statement, the protesters said the United Nations had done
nothing to obtain the Iranians' release and called on their
government to ``carry out a military rescue operation.''
	   The demonstration followed a smaller protest on Tuesday when
some two dozen relatives of the detainees stood outside the U.N.
offices.
	   Iran's former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who now heads a
government advisory council, warned Tuesday that Iran might resort
to force to free the Iranians, who include 11 diplomats, one
journalist and 35 drivers for an international transport company.
	   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said
Tuesday that an Iranian official had met the truck drivers in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Sunday.
	   Boroujerdi, who is responsible for Afghan affairs, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health, but the Taliban
did not allow him to meet the diplomats and correspondent, Iran's
state television reported.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the detainees'
safety.
	   Islamabad is widely believed to provide arms and other support
to the Taliban. Iran itself is widely suspected of backing the
northern-based opposition to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.

Banking group reports six-month profit of dlrs 910 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ MeritaNordbanken, one of northern
Europe's largest banking groups, had a half-year operating profit
of 4.91 billion markkaa (dlrs 910 million), the bank said
Wednesday.
	   That represented an increase of 31 percent compared to the same
period in 1997, when the two banks were independent, the group
reported.
	   Last October, Merita -- Finland's largest commercial bank -- and
Nordbanken, Sweden's third-largest banking group, announced they
would join forces to save money and strengthen their positions in
the European Union.
	   A large part of the group's first-half operating profit came
from the sale of shares in Sampo, a Finnish insurance company,
MeritaNordbanken said.
	   Higher demand for credit in both Sweden and Finland and strong
development in savings products also raised profits.
	   Excluding one-time items such as the Sampo deal, the operating
profit was up 25 percent from the 1997 January-to-June figure.
	   The bank repeated its forecast that the merger between Sweden's
Nordbanken and Finnish Merita will result in gains of 700 million
markkaa (dlrs 130 million) per year before 2001.
	   Last year, Merita doubled its profit to 4 billion markkaa (dlrs
740 million), compared to 1996. Nordbanken's profit fell to 6
billion kronor (dlrs 745 million) in 1997, from 7.4 billion kronor
the previous year.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army
dissidents who committed Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
atrocity pledged Wednesday to stop bombing, hours before most of
their victims were laid to rest.
	   Unimpressed, the Irish government announced it would recall
Parliament to pass tougher anti-terrorism laws, including one that
would allow a suspect's silence to weigh against him.
	   The so-called ``Real IRA,'' until now committed to wrecking the
IRA cease-fire of July 1997, announced it had indefinitely
``suspended'' its efforts to bomb Northern Ireland towns ``as a
direct result of the Omagh tragedy.''
	   Although they denied trying to kill anybody, the dissidents' car
bomb Saturday in the religiously mixed town killed 28 civilians and
wounded 220, mostly women and children.
	   While some politicians greeted the announcement with relief,
Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern Ireland, Mo
Mowlam, called it ``an insult'' to the dead and maimed.
	   Noting the 13 funerals taking place Wednesday in and near Omagh
and three more in the Irish Republic seaside resort of Buncrana,
she said: ``The pain and grief are such that this is just a little
too late.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced his country would
beef up security at its border with Northern Ireland and pass
several laws _ including one that would allow ``inferences'' to be
drawn from a suspect's failure to answer police questions.
	   Several new offenses also would be created, Ahern said _
directing an unlawful organization, ``possessing items'' for
purposes connected with firearms and explosives offenses,
withholding information, and training people to use firearms or
explosives.
	   Also Wednesday, Bernadette Sands, the companion of Michael
McKevitt, the man reputed to lead the Real IRA, called a radio
program to condemn the Omagh bombing and applaud the group's
announcement it was suspending its military operations.
	   ``The loss of innocent lives cannot be justified,'' she said,
adding she did not know why she and McKevitt were being singled out
in the wake of the bombing.
	   The couple reportedly have moved out of their house in the Irish
Republic town of Dundalk because of fears for the safety of their
children.
	   In Buncrana, on Ireland's rugged northwest coast, an estimated
8,000 mourners bade an anguished farewell to the town's three lost
boys _ James Barker and Shaun McLaughlin, both 12, and Oran
Doherty, 8 _ who died after they accompanied Spanish exchange
students across the border to visit a historical park near Omagh.
	   ``We all feel responsible ... but there was supposed to be
peace,'' said the school principal, Sinead McLaughlin, whose
students formed a uniformed guard of honor alongside all three
coffins en route to St. Mary's Catholic Church. Shaun was an altar
boy at another local church.
	   James' parents, Donna and Victor Barker, who had moved to
Buncrana from their native England last year for a better quality
of life, looked like broken souls as they walked behind their son's
casket.
	   Oran's six siblings, from his 3-year-old brother Oisin to
20-year-old Amanda, linked arms behind his coffin, which was draped
in the green-and-white banner of the soccer team he loved, Glasgow
Celtic.
	   Two Spaniards _ 24-year-old teacher Rocia Ramos and 12-year-old
student Fernando Bacelga, who had been living with the Barker
family _ also died in the blast and were buried Tuesday in their
native Madrid.
	   In Buncrana, children led the congregation in special prayers
for their souls in English, Spanish and Gaelic.
	   Fernando's older brother and more than 30 Spanish students _
some bearing bandages from shrapnel wounds and perforated eardrums
_ and their relatives attended the Buncrana service.
	   The Rev. Shane Bradley, Buncrana's Omagh-born priest, noted that
more than 3,000 people had been killed in the past three decades of
conflict over Northern Ireland, but that this appeared to be ``our
saddest moment, our darkest hour.''
	   ``This wound runs too deep, and the scar will be on us all 'til
we go to our own graves,'' he said.
	   In the church were Irish President Mary McAleese and Jose Maria
Sanz-Pastor, Spain's ambassador for Ireland. Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, walked
closely behind the three boys' coffins.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant first
minister of Northern Ireland's new cross-community government
established by the agreement, also attended.
	   Trimble said he found the Real IRA's statement that it would
suspend violence ``pretty contemptible'' and untrustworthy, since
the group's misleading phoned warnings in Omagh had ``herded the
people directly to the car bomb like lambs to the slaughter.''
	   He said the continuing threat posed by dissidents underscored
his demand for IRA commanders to start handing over their hidden
weaponry to international arms inspectors, as April's peace
agreement calls for.
	   Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin disclosed Wednesday that
his party had been in contact with the Real IRA through
intermediaries to press its demand that the dissident group
renounce violence completely.

Yugoslav trade minister meets Iraqi vice president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
met Yugoslav Trade Minister Borislav Vukovic on Wednesday to
discuss ways of boosting trade, Iraq's official news agency
reported.
	   Vukovic said his visit would result in the signing of several
agreements, INA reported without elaborating.
	   In the 1980s, Iraq had strong relations with former Yugoslavia,
which built many of this Gulf state's factories.
	   Yugoslavia sold Iraq nearly dlrs 373,000 worth of medicines and
other items since an oil-for-food deal began in 1996. The agreement
with the United Nations allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil
to buy food and medicine.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Dikes, dam burst as flooding threatens northeast China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with footage showing soldiers
baling waters, repairing oil wells, more rains in central China. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Chinese soldiers baled flood waters that
seeped through dikes protecting the industrial city Harbin on
Wednesday, while workers wearing life jackets in China's largest
oil field tried to keep functioning partly submerged wells pumping.
	   With the Songhua and other northeast rivers at record highs and
expected to rise for two more days and with torrential rains
falling on central China's rain-swollen Yangtze River, Xinhua said
flood-fighting has reached ``a crucial moment.''
	   The raging Songhua punched through two 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) dikes in Harbin, cutting highway traffic on a
bridge in the northeast provincial capital of 9 million people, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   After local officials unsuccessfully tried to plug the gaps with
trucks, flood waters forced people protecting the dikes to flee,
Xinhua said.
	   A dam burst, 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside of the city,
flooded land near the airport, but a city spokesman said the
airport remained secure.
	   Soldiers guarded a 1.5-meter-high (5-foot-high) restraining wall
of metal rods and wood planks built atop a 26-kilometer (15-mile)
levee protecting the city. State television showed soldiers using
shovels and wash basins to bale water leaking through dikes piled
with sandbags.
	   Unusually heavy seasonal rains have brought the worst flooding
in 44 years on the Yangtze and potentially the worst in 50 years in
the northeast. More than 2,000 people have died nationwide, and
economic losses total at least 200 billion yuan (dlrs 24.1
billion).
	   More than 2 million soldiers, paramilitary police and reservists
have been sent to reinforce levees and rescue civilians. Gen. Zhang
Wannian called it ``the largest military deployment'' along the
Yangtze since the 1945-49 civil war that brought the communists to
power, Xinhua reported.
	   Military commanders sent 13,500 troops to help 30,000 soldiers
shore up weakened dikes around three cities in the hard-hit
Dongting Lake area, Xinhua said.
	   Although the sixth flood crest since early July passed through
the region with no reported troubles, the waters have receded
slowly and are likely to rise again. Xinhua said as much as 10
centimeters (4 inches) of rain hit cities upstream in Sichuan
province on Wednesday.
	   Flooding in the northeast poses one of the severest economic
risks. The Nen River threatens to overwhelm the Daqing oil field,
which accounts for at least a third of the country's production.
	   More than 270,000 soldiers, oil workers and other civilians have
worked round-the-clock to keep the Nen back. Worried about breaches
to a reservoir, the government ordered soldiers to build a new dike
to protect the field's No. 7 oil production base, Xinhua said.
	   Local officials interviewed by China Central Television said
wells were continuing to pump. CCTV footage showed oil workers
dressed in blaze orange life vests using boats to repair and check
wells.
	   A 15-kilometer-long (9-mile-long) dike, the last defense
protecting Daqing city's 2.3 million people, was completed on
Tuesday.
	   Flooding also was severe in neighboring Jilin province. Floods
drove nearly half of the 2 million people of Baicheng city out of
their homes this summer, and nearly half of Zhenlai County's 17
townships are under water, Xinhua reported.
	   The central government issued an urgent order Tuesday demanding
that local governments stabilize prices of necessities and be on
the alert to punish any hoarding and speculation during the floods.
	   It said provincial governments could impose price ceilings on
food and materials for flood control and rebuilding.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ An American who faces charges of fraud and
money-laundering in New York was arrested in Germany and ordered
held Wednesday pending a decision on extradition.
	   The 64-year-old man, whose name was not immediately available,
was arrested Tuesday afternoon in an apartment in Goettingen based
on a 1995 warrant from the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.
	   Police said he and two accomplices sought to buy more than dlrs
1 million in computer parts they thought were stolen from a company
that actually was set up as a sting by the FBI.
	   The man apparently arrived in Germany from eastern Europe,
police said. He was brought before a judge Wednesday and ordered
held pending a further court ruling.

Palestinians despair of Lewinsky scandal's effect on Middle East
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede. ADDS Israeli comment &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's admission that he
had an inappropriate relationship with a former White House intern
has left Palestinians despairing that the Americans will be able to
break the deadlock in the Mideast peace talks.
	   Clinton's revelations mean that ``Neither he nor his
administration can influence the Israelis,'' Palestinian legislator
Ziad Abu Amr said Wednesday on the Voice of Palestine radio
station.
	   ``This means a weakening of the already almost-absent American
role, and an increase in Israeli intransigence. We should not
expect any active American role in the peace process.''
	   A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
however, said Clinton's domestic troubles had no bearing on the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
	   ``The peace process has not been interrupted by the problem that
the president has had, and we expect it not to be interrupted in
the near future either,'' David Bar-Illan said.
	   The Monica Lewinsky scandal has seemed intertwined with Middle
East peacemaking from the start.
	   It was at Yasser Arafat's Oval Office news conference with
Clinton on Jan. 22 that the U.S. president first fielded questions
about his relationship with Lewinsky.
	   Palestinians had hoped Clinton would use the opportunity to
castigate Israel for failing to agree to a double-digit troop
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Instead, with Arafat watching bemusedly from his side, reporters
peppered Clinton with questions about whether he had had sex with
the 24-year-old Lewinsky.
	   ``Since this story surfaced, the American administration has
been paralyzed, unable to react to Israeli intransigence,'' the Al
Quds newspaper lamented Wednesday.
	   The paper's editorial cartoon showed a grinning Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thinking ``Inappropriate Behavior!'' as
Clinton tries to put pressure on him.
	   Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political figure, said
the Palestinians have been ``paying the price of a besieged
administration incapable of taking bold positions in the peace
process.''
	   ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention,'' she said Tuesday.
	   Arafat, asked if Clinton's admission would impede American
efforts to advance the peace process, said only: ``We hope not.''
	   Israeli political analysts said the affair has distracted
Clinton and kept him from dealing with important foreign policy
issues.
	   ``The greatest power in the world is not acting as a great
power,'' analyst Shlomo Avineri said.
	   Commentator Hami Shalev wrote in the Maariv newspaper that
Clinton's preoccupation with the scandal had paralyzed him.
	   ``The president of the United States, the defender of the free
world, has simply stopped functioning,'' Shalev wrote.

Security deteriorates in Somalia's capital, Sharia law emerging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Murder and banditry are soaring in and
around Somalia's crime-riddled capital, prompting a crackdown this
month by Islamic Sharia courts and a security force established by
businessmen.
	   A sweep by the new security force has resulted in the arrests of
at least 13 suspected bandits and looters at the main Bakara market
in the last two weeks.
	   The business committee which launched it warned that all those
caught in the operation will be dealt with severely.
	   Those apprehended have been turned over to the Islamic courts of
Hararyalle and Shirkole and will be tried under Sharia _ Islam's
strict legal code as spelled out in the Koran.
	   Despite the crackdown, random killings in Mogadishu continue. On
Monday, gunmen killed three people and wounded six others at a
stronghold controlled by faction leader Osman Ali Atto.
	   The move against crime is part of the effort by three Islamic
courts to unite efforts to propagate Sharia laws throughout the
Mogadishu area.
	   The courts' three chairmen _ Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohammed of North
Mogadishu, Sheikh Hassan Ali Aynte of Hararyallee and Sheikh Omar
Moallim Nur of Shirkole _ any law other than those of Islam is
unacceptable and Somalis should reject any court based on penal
codes.
	   Efforts to establish Somalia's first central government are
proceeding but have been delayed in part by territorial disputes
among clans.

Diagana eliminated in 400 hurdles, Arron sets championship record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Stephane Diagana of France, the world
champion, tripped over a hurdle and failed to qualify for the final
of the men's 400-meter hurdles at the European Championship on
Wednesday.
	   But there was better news for France when Christine Arron set a
championship record in winning her 100-meter semifinal heat in
10.81 seconds, her fastest time year and No. 1 in Europe. Only
Marion Jones of the United States has run faster this year than
Arron.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a hamstring injury.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, a former champion with a drug-tainted
past, led all qualifiers in the women's 400 meters.
	   Breuer won the title in 1990 when she was still a junior and an
East German. She resumed competing in August 1995, after serving a
three-year drug ban.
	   An Olympic bronze medalist at age 16 with the East German
1,600-meter relay team, Breuer ran an astonishing anchor leg to
help Germany win the gold at last year's World Championship.
	   Breuer, who won the event recently at the prestigious Zurich
meet, clocked a time of 51.60 seconds to advance to the semifinals
of the one-lap race. Helena Fuchsova of the Czech Republic won her
heat in 51.61, while Olga Kotlyarova of Russia took hers in 51.62
as the favorites advanced.
	   In the men's 400, the three British sprinters who are tops in
Europe this season all advanced without problems.
	   Mark Richardson, the fastest in Europe this year at 44.37, won
his group in 46.05, the third fastest of all heat winners. Iwan
Thomas and Solomon Wariso also advanced to keep alive British hopes
of a medal sweep.
	   In the men's pole vault, reigning Olympic champion Jean Galfione
easily cleared 5.60 meters to win one of the two heats and advance
to the final. Maksim Tarasov of Russia, the 1992 Olympic champion,
also cleared 5.60 to advance.
	   Dragutin Topic of Yugoslavia, the 1990 European high jump
champion, won his heat as all favorites cleared 2.24 to advance to
the final.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday had six: the women's javelin, men's long jump,
hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and the women's
10,000.
	   Stefano Tilli of Italy, one of the 100-meter semifinalists, was
reinstated by the Jury of Appeal. Tilli had been disqualified for
verbally abusing a referee who did not let the Italian run a lap of
honor after qualifying Tuesday.
	   Tilli apologized and was reinstated.
	   The jury also ruled that Alksandr Bagach of Ukraine can keep his
shot put gold medal.
	   The jury said the weighted ankle attachments worn by Bagach were
within the rules. The weights give better rotation to an athlete
just before he makes the throw.
	   Bagach is no stranger to controversy.
	   He was stripped of the gold medal at the World Championship in
Athens last year after testing positive for the stimulant
ephedrine. He was also disqualified for drug use as far back as
1989.
	   Bagach's winning distance Tuesday was 21.17 meters.
	   Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany won the silver at 20.98, while the
bronze went to another Ukrainian, Yuriy Belonog, at 20.92.
	   Another winner Tuesday, Antonio Pinto of Portugal, seems to have
an unusual formula for athletic success: drink your home-grown
wine.
	   Pinto, 32, who owns a vineyard and says he drinks 4-5 bottles a
wine every week, added a gold medal that has been missing in his
career when he won the men's 10,000 meters.
	   Twice a winner of the London Marathon, Pinto was lacking a major
championship title.
	   ``I didn't want to end my career without a medal of some kind,''
Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.
	   With about 4 1/2 laps left, Pinto switched into a higher gear
and pulled away from two Germans to win in 27 minutes, 48.62
seconds.
	   Dieter Baumann, a former Olympic 5,000 champion, took the silver
in 27:56.75 and Stephane Franke clinched the bronze in 27:59.90.

Zeman's cabinet survives vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The center-left cabinet of Premier
Milos Zeman survived a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday
after some opposition deputies walked out.
	   A total of 73 deputies voted in favor of the cabinet, with 39
against and 24 abstentions. A simple majority of 69 of the 136
deputies present was needed to carry the motion in the 200-seat
legislature.
	   ``Let me say that the Parliament expressed its confidence in the
new cabinet,'' said Petra Buzkova who chaired the legislature's
vote.
	   The one-party minority cabinet was appointed by President Vaclav
Havel on July 22.
	   According to the Czech constitution, the new government has to
undergo a vote of confidence in parliament to show it has enough
political power to implement its program.
	   The survival of the government was ensured by a toleration pact
signed last month with the strongest opposition group, the Civic
Democratic Party led by former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Under the pact, the Civic Democratic Party allowed the Social
Democrats to win by pulling out all of its 63 deputies during the
vote.
	   Zeman's cabinet is the first center-left government since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   ``I hope this Parliament will produce good laws and in a few
years nobody will know who drafted them, because it will not be
important,'' said Zeman, calling for other parties to cooperate.
	   ``We're serious about this program,'' Zeman told CTK agency
Wednesday, after the opposition criticized his program as
unrealistic.
	   In foreign policy, Zeman's priorities do not differ from those
of previous governments, stressing integration with NATO and the
European Union.
	   His economic priorities are more controversial, such as
restarting economic growth through support to local industry.
Critics suspect him of lavish spending in favor of big companies
and giving too much power to trade unions, while privatization is
slowed down.
	   A three-party coalition government led by Klaus collapsed last
November and was replaced by an interim government designed to lead
the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   The Social Democrats emerged as the winners of the ballot,
gaining 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature. Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party came in a close second.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, which
hold a total of 39 seats in parliament, voted against the cabinet,
citing disagreement with the government's policies.
	   The Communists, with 24 deputies, abstained from the vote.

U.N. commission: `abundant evidence' of Myanmar forced labor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A commission appointed by the U.N. labor agency on
Wednesday roundly condemned Myanmar for widespread and systematic
use of forced labor.
	   The inquiry noted ``the impunity with which government
officials, in particular the military, treat the civilian
population as an unlimited pool of unpaid forced laborers and
servants at their disposal,'' the International Labor Organization
said in a statement summarizing its report.
	   The three-member commission of inquiry was appointed by the
ILO's governing body in March 1997, following a complaint lodged by
delegates at its annual conference in 1996.
	   It heard evidence from some 250 witnesses and received more than
6,000 pages of documents.
	   Denouncing the government's ``flagrant and persistent failure to
comply'' with an international convention against forced labor, the
panel called on Myanmar to thoroughly investigate the practice,
strictly enforcing penalties for those found guilty.
	   Myanmar should bring its laws into line with the convention at
the latest by May 1999, it said.
	   In its conclusions, the commission said there is ``abundant
evidence ... showing the pervasive use of forced labor ... for
portering, the construction, maintenance and service of military
camps, other work in support of the military'' and uses including
logging and railroad construction.
	   Forced labor is often carried out by children, the elderly and
others who are unfit to work, the commission said. It also noted
extortion threats and physical abuse against those unwilling or
unable to comply.
	   Porters are often sent into situations such as suspected
minefields and rarely receive any medical treatment, even being
left behind in the jungle, it said.
	   Myanmar's government didn't allow the commission to visit the
country and rejected an invitation to take part in proceedings, the
ILO said. It claimed that a visit ``would interfere in the
(country's) internal affairs.''
	   Authorities denounced ``biased and specious allegations made by
expatriates living outside Myanmar.''
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Alleged human rights abuses by the government last year led to a
U.S. ban on new investment in Myanmar.
	   Independent human rights group Amnesty International welcomed
the commission's findings.
	   ``Companies and governments investing in the country _ many in
projects with the army as partners _ can no longer claim ignorance
of the situation on the ground,'' it said in a statement.

Branson launches Virgin clothing amid turmoil at subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LON102 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After putting his Virgin brand name on everything
from jumbo jets to cola cans, tycoon Richard Branson is about to
see how well it fits on a new line of sportswear.
	   Branson may be off to a bumpy start as he launches the first
autumn-winter collection of Virgin Clothing on Thursday.
	   The debut of the upscale fashion line comes amid severe
turbulence at Virgin's clothing and cosmetics subsidiary, Victory
Corp. PLC, which saw its shares nosedive early this week following
a profit warning and a boardroom shakeup.
	   And at least one prominent critic wonders whether Virgin is
aiming a little too high in the market.
	   ``It's in step with what's happening in fashion,'' said Mimi
Spencer, fashion editor at London's Evening Standard newspaper.
``But it may be out of step with what one perceives is happening
with the Virgin brands.''
	   Many shoppers identify the Virgin brand name with rock music and
cola, but the Virgin Clothing line is targeting a more affluent
audience than the youngish customers who are likely to buy those
Virgin products, Spencer said.
	   The Virgin clothes are ``altogether better than we anticipated,
and more expensive _ and that may be a problem,'' she said.
	   Virgin spokesman Will Whitehorn took issue with Spencer's
characterization of Virgin brands as ``young, fun and frivolous.''
	   Whitehorn pointed to Branson's successful international airline,
Virgin Atlantic Airways, and the Virgin Direct financial services
business. ``You tell me that Virgin Atlantic is a young and
frivolous airline,'' he said.
	   It has not been an easy week for Victory Corp.
	   Two founders, Rory and Tim McCarthy, stepped down as directors
Monday to make room for managers appointed by Virgin after it
recently increased its minority stake and took control of the
company.
	   The vast bulk of Branson's Virgin empire is privately held and
immune to the daily ups and downs of the stock market, but Victory
Corp. is listed on London's small-issue stock exchange, the
Alternative Investment Market, where things have been anything but
smooth.
	   After a long price slide, Victory lost half of its remaining
value on Monday, slipping to 9.5 pence (15 cents) per share. The
shares crawled back to 11 pence (18 cents) by late Wednesday _
little consolation for investors who bought in nearly two years ago
at 58 pence (94 cents).
	   Whitehorn suggested the previous directors had acted too hastily
in putting their company on the market before it had established
its business. With Virgin in control, the business outlook is
better, he said.
	   The Virgin Clothing line will be launched Thursday at London's
fabled Selfridge's department store, then rolled out to 200 more
retailers around Britain, he said.
	   Meanwhile, the cosmetics operation has opened a handful of
Virgin Vie stores, including one in London's prime Oxford Street
retailing area, while selling its goods through 1,500 more dealers.
	   ``We feel it's going to go well,'' Whitehorn said.
	   Victory rattled investors Monday by warning it will lose 19
million pounds (dlrs 31 million) for the year ending March 31, 1999
_ compared with a forecast of 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.5 milion) in
losses that the company's stockbrokers estimated just two months
ago.
	   Victory also pushed back its forecasts for achieving
profitability to 2001, from previous estimates that it could make
money by 2000.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents and Kenyan detectives raided a
downtown hotel in search of evidence leading to the bombers of the
U.S. Embassy, and an Islamic coalition warned Wednesday of further
attacks against American interests.
	   The World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,
formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, issued its
warning in the London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   Al-Hayat said the statement came along with three others from
the Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   The Holy Shrines group said it would ``continue shipping more
American dead bodies to their unjust government ... until we
humiliate America's arrogance and roll its dignity in the mud of
defeat.''
	   In a joint statement in Nairobi, the FBI and Kenyan police said
``searches were conducted'' at the Hilltop Hotel on Tuesday. They
declined to elaborate, saying only: ``The investigation is
proceeding in a logical manner and no further comment will be made
at this time.''
	   The U.S. embassy said the FBI might hold a news conference
Thursday.
	   In a front-page story Wednesday, the independent Daily Nation
said 15 FBI agents and six Kenyan detectives, acting on a tip from
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who is Kenyan police custody for the Aug. 7
bombing, spent more than two hours Tuesday searching several rooms
in the four-story hotel.
	   Kishor Raghwami, a contractor who is renovating some of the
hotel's 34 rooms, said FBI agents returned Wednesday to take video
and still pictures of the hotel.
	   It is located in River Road neighborhood, a seedy section of
downtown Nairobi about a kilometer ( half-mile) east of the site
where a powerful bomb ripped through the embassy, resulting in the
deaths of 247 people, 12 of them Americans at the mission.
	   An almost simultaneous bombing at the U.S. mission in
neighboring Tanzania killed 10 people, all of them Africans.
	   In other important developments Wednesday, a Pakistani newspaper
reported that Odeh gave a detailed account of worldwide
anti-American operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group
based in Afghanistan.
	   And a border official in Pakistan said a Saudi and a Sudanese
were detained at the Afghan border and were being questioned about
the bombings.
	   The New York Times said Odeh had named the men as accomplices.
	   Bin Laden is reported to be living in Afghanistan
	   In Islamabad, The News said Odeh, a 34-year-old Palestinian
engineer, revealed during a week of questioning by Pakistani
intelligence officials that he is a member of a secretive guerrilla
group led by bin Laden.
	   The developments appeared to indicate that 11 days after the
blast, investigators may have made major breakthroughs in tracking
down the bombers.
	   The Daily Nation report said a bomb containing 800 kilograms
(1,760 pounds) of TNT was assembled over several days in the
Hilltop Hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   Previous reports have mentioned ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel
and the plastic explosive Semtex as possible components of the
bomb.
	   Hotel supervisor Abdulrahman Mohamed Said, whose father Mohamed
Said owns the hotel, said police took manager James Nganga in for
questioning and seized the hotel's guest register and copies of
bills.
	   The newspaper said rooms 102 and 107, where the bomb was
allegedly assembled, were occupied from Aug. 3-7 by four foreigners
_ two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi.
	   But hotel porter David Kioko said he carried several bags for
three of the men who left the hotel Aug. 6 in a taxi.
	   ``They were just like any other guests. We cleaned their rooms
every day, and they never tried to stop us from entering,'' he
said.
	   The Daily Nation said Odeh checked into the hotel Aug. 4 and
that the bomb was assembled there until Aug. 6, when it was taken
away in a small truck and completed elsewhere.
	   The agents were acting on information provided by Odeh, who was
arrested Aug. 7 in Karachi, Pakistan and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan
authorities investigating the blast, according to the paper.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the Daily Nation said Odeh flew to
Karachi the night of Aug. 6, after ensuring final preparations were
in place. It said two of the men who planned the attack and who
were with him in the hotel are at large.
	   The paper also said in addition to Odeh, police were holding
three other people in connection with the attack.
	   Contractor Raghwami said the hotel's clientele was mainly Kenyan
Arab and other Arabs who are Muslims as well.
	   The hotel was closed and locked later Wednesday.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian police seized 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds)
of hashish being smuggled in containers of diapers and sanitary
napkins, the ANSA news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The shipment was confiscated Tuesday at a warehouse near
Perugia, about 80 miles north of Rome. The hashish had come in from
Morocco via Spain for distribution in central Italy, ANSA said.
	   Authorities detained five people found at the import-export
warehouse, the alleged base of a drug-smuggling operation. All five
were Italian residents.

Tourist fined for driving jet ski recklessly, injuring two women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - A court fined a British tourist 500
pounds (dlrs 1,100) and gave him a suspended three-month jail
sentence Wednesday for driving a jet ski recklessly and injuring
two teen-age British women tourists.
	   David Whitworth, 22, of Barnsley, pleaded guilty to the offense.
	   Last Monday, Riding drove a jet ski off the tourist resort of
Ayia Napa into a ``banana boat'' - an inflatable raft towed by a
speedboat. Two of the passengers on the raft, Michelle Margaret
Brandon and Lauren Sarah Schneider, both 19-year-old Londoners,
were seriously injured.

 &UR; EU reiterates concern about human rights violations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union expressed concern
Wednesday about reports of human rights abuses in Congo whose
government is struggling to stay in power.
	   ``These reports credibly allege rounding up, detention, beating,
torture, ethnic propaganda ... and in some cases summary execution
of Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnic groups'' by both
sides, the 15 EU governments said in a statement.
	   They urged ``all parties to the conflict to take the necessary
measures to prevent such violations by security forces under their
command'' and refrain ``from recruiting child soldiers.''
	   The statement was issued by the government of Austria which
currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
	   It did not unveil any EU initiative to resolve the critis in
Congo but repeated the concern, first issued in a declaration on
August 11, `for peaceful solutions to the current problems so that
the process of reconstruction and democratization can proceed.''
	   Ten East European nations and Cyprus, which are in line to join
the EU in the years ahead, aligned themselves with the EU
declaration.

Regional leaders to back Kabila, some with troops and arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with regional reaction throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL HARTNACK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Four southern African countries have
declared their support for Congo President Laurent Kabila, with
Zimbabwe's defense minister announcing Wednesday that his country
would send troops to the war-torn country.
	   Top defense officials from Namibia, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe
said Tuesday after meeting in Harare that they would support
Kabila's government against a rebel insurrection. But only Zimbabwe
announced it was sending troops.
	   ``There is preparedness ... in this region to give the support
in whatever manner that is within our capabilities and this should
be done soonest,'' President Robert Mugabe tol a press conference
late Tuesday.
	   Mugabe claimed the Southern African Development Community, a
14-nation regional organization, had unanimously decided to back
Kabila.
	   But South Africa, whose President Nelson Mandela chairs the
SADC, and Botswana said Wednesday they had only sent observers to
the meeting and did not support any decision to back Kabila.
	   ``The decision was taken without us,'' said Botswana's Permanent
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Ernest Mpofu. ``There was no way our
representative could have committed himself.''
	   South African officials said Tuesday they opposed a military
solution. South Africa's defense and foreign ministers were meeting
this week with the presidents of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Zimbabwe Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, in a radio interview,
said support for Kabila must come quickly.
	   ``We must, with urgency, make sure practical assistance, both
materiel and manpower, is given to (Congo) in order to restore
peace and stability,'' he said.
	   ``We are convinced that the rebel force is supported from Uganda
and Rwanda,'' he added.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement in the rebellion.
	   Mahachi did not say when Zimbabwe would send troops, or how
many. Zimbabwe has already sent military advisers to help Kabila.
	   Kabila has recently travelled from Cuba to southern Congo to
Angola, looking for friends to help hold off the rebels _ an army
of his former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the president's own military. Kabila says the rebels are
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ When Russia's last czar was buried
last month, it was without the official blessing of the Russian
Orthodox Church. Despite volumes of scientific evidence, including
extensive DNA testing, the church refused to accept the remains as
those of Nicholas II.
	   But when priests recently noticed drops of a honey-like
substance between the toes of some mummified remains, the church
quickly declared them to be those of a 16th century saint,
Alexander of Svira.
	   The head of the Orthodox church, Patriarch Alexy II, visited the
body Monday in a small church in St. Petersburg, calling the
phenomenon ``a verification of our faith.''
	   According to Orthodox tradition, the appearance of fragrant
liquids on relics is a miracle, which means they belong to a saint.
Priests have said the substance between the brown, mummified toes
of the remains is myrrh.
	   Thousands of Orthodox believers have thronged the church during
the past few weeks to see what they believe is a modern miracle.
	   On Monday afternoon a crowd of 300 people waited in pouring rain
outside the Church of Martyrs' Faith, Hope and Love to kiss the
glass case containing the body. The body was covered by a black
cloth except for the feet. Tiny droplets of a clear liquid were
visible between the toes.
	   ``These are very difficult times,'' said Natalya Khmilyova, who
works part time at the church. ``But all the same, God has not
abandoned us and now the relics of St. Alexander of Svira have
appeared. This is an amazing event that we have waited for a long
time, so glory be to God!''
	   In 1919, the relics were taken from the St. Alexander of Svira
Monastery by Russia's new Bolshevik leaders as part of their
repressive measures against the Orthodox church.
	   Last September, the hunt began for the relics, which were
unearthed in December in an unmarked cupboard in the Military
Medical Academy's Anatomical Museum in St. Petersburg, sharing a
wooden case with jars of preserved human organs.
	   Tests showed the body to be of Vep origin, the same Finno-Ugric
tribe to which St. Alexander belonged, and the face resembled that
portrayed in early icons. Also, the legs are crossed, a pose
described in the church chronicles of 1641 when the saint's remains
were exhumed.
	   But the church's position is not accepted by forensic
scientists, who say more tests are needed to establish the
identification of the body.
	   ``The church had doubts about the royal remains, when all of
science had proven their authenticity,'' said Olga Bykhovskaya,
deputy head of St. Petersburg's Forensic Examination Service. ``And
here they have no doubts when science has not proved it.''
	   For Mother Leonida Safonova, a nun with a Ph.D. in biology who
tracked down the remains, faith triumphs over science every time.
``No matter which technique we use, no matter at which scientific
level we prove it, the saint himself trumped all this when he
started to exude the myrrh,'' she said.

Umpire incident prompts cricket security review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Corrects Edgbaston in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English cricket will undergo a security review
after umpire John Holder was knocked to the ground by an
over-zealous fan following a limited-overs between England and
South Africa at Edgbaston.
	   An English Cricket Board spokesman Wednesday said the incident
would be reviewed by the ground management working committee in the
lead-up to next year's cricket World Cup in England.
	   Holder was walking towards the pavilion after South Africa's
14-run win Tuesday when a member of the 20,000-strong crowd tried
to grab a stump from him. The stump contained a miniature camera
and was worth 10,000 pounds (dlrs 162,500).
	   The 53-year-old umpire, a former English county cricket fast
bowler, said it was a shock to be knocked to the ground.
	   Stewards restrained the fan and he was later taken into custody
by police but released.
	   ``I'm alright, but it's not something I want to happen again,''
Holder said.
	   ``I think he (the fan) wanted a stump. I'm not going to make a
complaint about it. The stewards dealt with it.''
	   Edgbaston chief executive Dennis Amiss said ground security at
Edgbaston would be bolstered in future, although MCC officials at
Lord's had no plans to increase security for the final between
England and Sri Lanka on Thursday.
	   ``I was pleased he was not trying to have a go at the umpire but
it's obviously a matter for concern and we must find ways of
protecting the players and the umpires and get them off the field
safely,'' Amiss said.
	   Amiss said the offender, reportedly a ``football supporter'' and
a member of the England Football Supporters' Club, will be banned
from future matches at Edgbaston.
	   ``He has been told in no uncertain terms that he will not be
welcome at Edgbaston again.''
	   England advanced to Thursday's limited-overs series final
despite losing to South Africa at Edgbaston. South Africa scored
244 and needed to beat England by 47 runs to earn a place in the
final. England was all out for 230 in reply.
	   South African captain Hanse Cronje said his team was looking
forward to returning home for a short break after playing 16 tests
and 27 limited-overs internationals since October.

German Damaske wins javelin gold medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Germany's Damaske winning javelin gold &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a
throw of 69.10 meters in her first attempt and won the gold medal
in the women's javelin at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Damaske, 26, bronze medalist at last year's World Championship,
gave Germany its first gold medal of the European event. Her
winning distance was third in the world this year. She also has the
season's best of 70.10.
	   Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia took the silver medal at 66.92,
while Mikaela Ingberg clinched the bronze at 64.92, saving the day
for the powerful Finnish team.
	   Her Finnish compatriot, outgoing champion and world titlist
Trine Hattestad, had to settle for fourth place with a throw of
63.16, while Olympic champion Heli Rantanen, another Finn, was
fifth at 62.34.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the world champion, tripped over a
hurdle and failed to qualify for the final of the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   But there was better news for France when Christine Arron set a
championship record in winning her 100-meter semifinal heat in
10.81 seconds, her fastest time year and No. 1 in Europe. Only
Marion Jones of the United States has run faster this year than
Arron.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a leg injury.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, a former champion with a drug-tainted
past, led all qualifiers in the women's 400 meters.
	   Breuer won the title in 1990 when she was still a junior and an
East German. She resumed competing in August 1995, after serving a
three-year drug ban.
	   An Olympic bronze medalist at age 16 with the East German
1,600-meter relay team, Breuer ran an astonishing anchor leg to
help Germany win the gold at last year's World Championship.
	   Breuer, who won the event recently at the prestigious Zurich
meet, clocked a time of 51.60 seconds to advance to the semifinals
of the one-lap race. Helena Fuchsova of the Czech Republic won her
heat in 51.61, while Olga Kotlyarova of Russia took hers in 51.62
as the favorites advanced.
	   In the men's 400, the three British sprinters who are tops in
Europe this season all advanced without problems.
	   Mark Richardson, the fastest in Europe this year at 44.37, won
his group in 46.05, the third fastest of all heat winners. Iwan
Thomas and Solomon Wariso also advanced to keep alive British hopes
of a medal sweep.
	   In the men's pole vault, reigning Olympic champion Jean Galfione
easily cleared 5.60 meters to win one of the two heats and advance
to the final. Maksim Tarasov of Russia, the 1992 Olympic champion,
also cleared 5.60 to advance.
	   Dragutin Topic of Yugoslavia, the 1990 European high jump
champion, won his heat as all favorites cleared 2.24 to advance to
the final.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday had six: the women's javelin, men's long jump,
hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and the women's
10,000.
	   Stefano Tilli of Italy, one of the 100-meter semifinalists, was
reinstated by the Jury of Appeal. Tilli had been disqualified for
verbally abusing a referee who did not let the Italian run a lap of
honor after qualifying Tuesday.
	   Tilli apologized and was reinstated.
	   The jury also ruled that Alksandr Bagach of Ukraine can keep his
shot put gold medal.
	   The jury said the weighted ankle attachments worn by Bagach were
within the rules. The weights give better rotation to an athlete
just before he makes the throw.
	   Bagach is no stranger to controversy.
	   He was stripped of the gold medal at the World Championship in
Athens last year after testing positive for the stimulant
ephedrine. He was also disqualified for drug use as far back as
1989.
	   Bagach's winning distance Tuesday was 21.17 meters.
	   Antonio Pinto of Portugal was another winner Tuesday, finally
getting a gold medal late in his career when he captured the
10,000.
	   Pinto, 32, who owns a vineyard and says he drinks 4-5 bottles a
wine every week, said, ``I didn't want to end my career without a
medal of some kind,'' Pinto said. ``Gold is all the better.

Monk contends 13th-century pope was murdered with nail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ For centuries some scholars have suspected that
Celestine V, a 13th-century pope, was murdered. Now a monk claims
he has proof someone drove a nail into Celestine's skull.
	   Several Italian dailies on Wednesday quoted the Rev. Quirino
Salomone as saying a CT scan was performed on Celestine's mummified
remains 10 years ago, showing a 1-centimeter (0.4 inch) hole in the
left temple.
	   ``I hope to clarify for good the mystery of the pope's death,''
Salomone said.
	   None of the press accounts explained who ordered the medical
test nor why the results were not revealed for a decade.
	   The monk said he is writing a book based on ``scientific and
photographic material'' backing his thesis.
	   Both his office in the central mountain town of L'Aquila and the
monastery where he lives said he was out on Wednesday when called
for comment.
	   According to Salomone, the CT scan was performed in spring 1988.
That was shortly after the return of the remains, which had been
missing a week after they were stolen from L'Aquila's cathedral,
110 kilometers (70 miles) northeast of Rome.
	   A number of biographers, as far back as the 1500s, have hinted
that the pope was murdered, but no conclusive evidence has ever
been produced.
	   Celestine V died in 1296, officially of natural causes, two
years after he said he was unfit to be pope and resigned. He was
declared a saint in 1313.
	   According to press reports, experts have suggested that Pope
Boniface VIII, who confined Celestine V to a fortress when he
succeeded him, might have had a hand in the death.
	   Boniface was known to have opposed a degree by Celestine which
granted indulgences to those passing through a special cathedral
door which was opened only one day a year.
	   Admirers of Celestine still perform the tradition each summer.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- As heavily armed U.S. Marines guarded
the American diplomatic compound, Albanian and American agents
searched nationwide Wednesday for suspected members of a terrorist
group which planned to blow up the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``It's a very intensive search by the CIA and the Albanians,''
said an official of the Albanian police official who asked not to
be named. ``The (Albanian) secret service and the CIA are compiling
lists of suspects and sending police to arrest them.''
	   The official said the nationwide search was launched after U.S.
officials last week uncovered ``serious evidence'' of plans to bomb
the U.S. Embassy. He said the plot was apparently linked to the
recent arrests of several Egyptians believed linked to terrorist
attacks in Egypt, including last November's massacre of 62 tourists
and others at a temple in the southern city of Luxor.
	   He said the Albanians believe the plot against the embassy was
aimed at undermining a wide-ranging anti-terrorist investigation
which has been secretly underway for months with the cooperation of
Egyptian authorities.
	   The plot may also be linked to the bombings this month of the
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 257 people were
killed. On Friday, the State Department said it was evacuating
non-essential staff and family members from its embassy here and
warned Americans against travel to Albania.
	   The next day, the official said, U.S. Ambassador Marisa Lino met
with Albanian authorities and told them she had ``solid evidence''
of a plan to drive a car bomb into the embassy, located in a
diplomatic compound on the edge of this Balkan capital.
	   On Sunday, 150 Marines and Navy commandos, who were in the area
to participate in a NATO exercise, secured the U.S. compound,
erecting huge concrete barriers and a 3 meter (10-foot) metal
fence.
	   President Clinton told Congress on Tuesday that the measures
were taken ``after receiving credible information of a possible
attack'' against the embassy here ``similar to attacks against our
missions'' in East Africa.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said Wednesday.
``Have we made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think
twice before tackling it. This is robust security.''
	   Since June, at least five Egyptians have been arrested here in
connection with the Luxor massacre and the 1993 assassination
attempt against Egypt's prime minister, Atef Sedki. Both attacks
were blamed on Islamic extremists.
	   The Albanian official said the five carried false Egyptian
passports and were believed members of the Islamic Jihad movement.
He said all five were deported to Egypt with help from American
authorities.
	   On Aug. 6 -- one day before the Africa bombings -- an Arabic
language newspaper in London, al-Hayat, published a letter
purportedly from Islamic Jihad vowing revenge against the United
States for the arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   The Albanian source said the search was underway in several
cities and towns in Albania for other suspected Jihad members still
at large. He also said Albanian embassies in France, Italy, Germany
and other countries have receive bomb threats in recent weeks,
apparently in reprisal for Albania's role in the operation.
	   The editor of Albania's largest circulation newspaper, Shekulli,
said he received telephone threats Wednesday from a caller who
claimed to be a member of Islamic Jihad.
	   The editor, Alfred Peza, said his newspaper has extensively
reported on the anti-terrorism operation. He said the caller told
him he was free to continue reporting the story but Jihad ``has
other means'' of expressing its contrary opinion.
	   The newspaper called for police protection of its journalists in
a story published Wednesday.

Small airplane disappears between Haiti and Jamaica

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Rescuers are searching for a
single-engine airplane that disappeared between Haiti and Jamaica,
the U.S. Coast Guard reported Wednesday.
	   The rented Piper aircraft was on its way from Matthewtown,
Bahamas to Kingston, Jamaica on Tuesday. Its British pilot, Paul
Baxter, contacted the control tower at Port-au-Prince, Haiti as he
passed about 15 miles (25 kilometers) west of Haiti's southwestern
tip, the Coast Guard said.
	   Port-au-Prince later told Baxter to contact air traffic
controllers in Kingston. The airplane disappeared soon afterward.
	   Two Coast Guard search planes and a cutter are searching for the
aircraft.

U.N. refugee agency officials warns of catastrophe in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deputy head of the U.N. refugee
agency Wednesday warned of a catastrophe in Kosovo unless there is
an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a political
settlement.
	   Soeren Jessen Petersen, a deputy to U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said in Pristina the current crisis ``would become a
catastrophe during winter'' without a halt in fighting and a
subsequent peace deal.
	   Without such a settlement, the displacement of people will
continue and in fact increase, he said,
	   ``We have more than 200,000 (displaced Kosovars) now, but we
would have many, many people dying during the coming winter,''
Petersen said, adding it was up to the politicians ``to stop
that.''
	   Meanwhile, Emma Bonino, the human rights commissioner for the
European Union, Wednesday was stopped by ethnic Albanian rebels,
who refused to allow her convoy with journalists to reach a
disputed village, Cirez, in the restive southern Serbian province.
	   Bonino was en route to assess the situation of refugees
displaced by the armed conflict between the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for Independence for Kosovo and Serb-led
government forces.
	   Bonino's convoy was stopped at a checkpoint just outside
Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold, an Associated Press Television
crew traveling with Bonino said. She was told she could proceed
without the reporters, but she refused.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government sought an urgent meeting
with Yugoslav authorities after Serb mortars exploded across the
border.
	   The shelling, which the Albanians said lasted for two hours
Tuesday, prompted local officials on the Albanian side of the
frontier to evacuate children and the elderly from border
communities.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, an Interior Ministry official
told The Associated Press that 15 mortars exploded about 1.5
kilometers (nearly a mile) inside Albanian territory. There were no
casualties, he said.
	   But the incident fueled fears that the conflict in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence, could spread
throughout the southern Balkans.
	   On the diplomatic front, U.S. envoys are pressing efforts to
arrange direct talks between the Serb government and a Kosovo
Albanian delegation formed last week to bring the conflict to an
end and chart the future of the province, which is part of Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   On Tuesday, the Kosovo Albanians spurned an offer by the Serbs
to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must cease and tens
of thousands of Albanian civilians must be allowed to return to
their homes.
	   But Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier Vojislav Seselj aid
the government is ``in no hurry'' to negotiate Kosovo's future with
pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Why would we be in a hurry when international circumstances
are not in our favor now?'' Seselj said in an interview with a
private TV station late Tuesday, carried by independent Beta news
agency.
	   ``The government ... has shown great patience not to make any
rash moves that would provoke a NATO operation in Kosovo, but
managed to conclude operations and suppress terrorism,'' Seselj
said.
	   On Tuesday, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been
meeting with Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders, reiterated that
neither side should count on achieving anything by force and should
keep working at negotiations.
	   Complicating the diplomacy is the fact that the leading ethnic
Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, faces opposition within the
Albanian community because of his pacifist tactics for resolving
the crisis.

Canada braces for historic Supreme Court ruling on Quebec
</HEADLINE>
secession &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Forced to arbitrate in the nation's most
explosive political debate, the Supreme Court of Canada issues a
momentous ruling Thursday on whether Quebec has the right to secede
without the federal government's permission.
	   The separatist government of the mostly French-speaking province
insists Quebeckers have the right to decide for themselves in a
referendum whether to secede. The court ruling, no matter what its
conclusions, is likely to provide ammunition for the separatists
when they campaign for re-election either late this year or next
spring.
	   The high court never sought to intrude in the long-running
debate about Quebec, but its hand was forced when the federal court
last year asked it to rule on three questions: Can Quebec legally
declare unilateral independence under Canadian law? Can it secede
under international law? If there is a conflict, which law
prevails?
	   The federal government argued before the court that Quebec could
secede only after negotiations with federal authorities and the
other nine provinces. Federal lawyers said virtually every new
country to gain admittance to the United Nations since World War II
did so with the consent of its parent state.
	   The Quebec government refused to participate in the court
proceedings, though the judges appointed a separatist lawyer to
argue that side of the case.
	   Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, is in a strong
position politically. If the court surprises legal analysts by
ruling that Quebec does have a right to secede unilaterally,
Bouchard can claim victory. If it rules otherwise, as expected, he
can run an election campaign claiming that Quebeckers' right to
decide their own destiny is under siege.
	   ``There is solid public opinion in Quebec that it's not up to
the Supreme Court to decide or limit in any way the right of the
Quebec people to choose their future,'' he said last week.
	   Bouchard was the charismatic leader of the separatist side in a
1995 referendum on secession. The separatists barely lost,
receiving 49.4 percent of the votes, and anti-separatists began
searching for new strategies that eventually included the Supreme
Court case.
	   They hope a court ruling rejecting Quebec's right to unilateral
secession will convince middle-ground voters in the province that
any attempt at a breakaway would be complicated and possibly
tumultuous.
	   The anti-separatist Liberal Party in Quebec was buoyed earlier
this year when one of Canada's most popular politicians, Jean
Charest, left the federal Parliament to become its leader. The
latest polls show Charest's initial edge over Bouchard to be
shrinking, and the next provincial election is expected to be quite
close.
	   If Bouchard wins, he has pledged to call another referendum on
secession, though he has been vague about the timing.

Kohl party criticizes Turkish premier's election appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party criticized
Turkish premier Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday for reportedly urging
Turks in Germany to vote against Kohl in Sept. 27 elections.
	   Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman in parliament for Kohl's
Christian Democrats, called Yilmaz's remarks emotional, ``very
unwise'' and contrary to diplomatic custom, according to an
interview for Thursday's edition of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily.
	   The Turkish newspaper Milliyet this week quoted a thinly veiled
appeal by Yilmaz for Turkish voters in Germany to cast a ballot
against Kohl because relations between the two leaders had broken
down.
	   Yilmaz blames Kohl, Europe's senior statesman, for spearheading
the European Union's refusal to open membership talks with Turkey
as it has with several former communist countries.
	   Turkey, a secular Muslim country, charges that the EU wants to
stay a Christian club.
	   Only about 150,000 of the 2 million Turks in Germany are
eligible to vote.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed nine people and
injured 18 in Yemen, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Four people were killed and 11 others injured Wednesday in the
southern city of Damar while on Tuesday, three people were killed
in the southern province of Abyan and two others were seriously
injured, the official said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Two people were killed and five others seriously injured in the
northern Sada province Tuesday after a four-story building they
were staying in was destroyed by floods.
	   Last week, 18 people were killed in floods in Yemen.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new Independent National
Electoral Commission began meeting Wednesday with about 20
political groups interested in registering for civilian elections
planned for early next year.
	   ``I hope the meeting will launch Nigeria on the road to real
participatory democracy,'' said Tom Bagu, a spokesman for one of
the new groups known as the Democratic Alternative. ``We hope this
will be a permanent feature of the process whereby political groups
are constantly consulted.''
	   The electoral commission was sworn in last week by the country's
new military leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has promised a
transition to civilian rule by May 31, 1999.
	   The commission, which is in charge of organizing elections
planned for early next year, has been given until next week to
publish final guidelines for political parties wishing to register.
	   Nigeria has been ruled for all but 10 of the 38 years since
independence by military regimes.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Focus Martin Gwede, former head of
intelligence for Malawi's late ``life president'' Hastings Kamuzu
Banda, has filed a dlrs 240,000 law suit for property seized from
him during his 17 years in prison as a suspected coup plotter.
	   Gwede, released by Banda in 1993 on the eve of Malawi's first
democratic elections, had been condemned to death for high treason.
Fellow accused Albert Muwalo, once secretary general of Banda's
Malawi Congress party, was hanged in 1977, when Gwede's sentence
was commuted to life imprisonment.
	   Gwede has demanded compensation for two houses, two cars and
household effects forfeited to the state after his secret trial.
	   ------
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Russia and Angola reached broad agreement
on a plan to create joint companies which will repair and maintain
Soviet-made military equipment of southern African countries.
	   Details of the agreement will be discussed by Russian and
Angolan officials in Moscow in November, Angola's Defense Minister
Pedro Sebastiao told a news conference late Tuesday.
	   Sebastiao said the two countries will invest millions of dollars
in the companies, which will be based in Angola.
	   He announced the plan at the end of a two-day visit by Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev to discuss bilateral military
cooperation.
	   ``Angola has no plans to acquire new arms. At the moment we are
focusing on repairing and maintaining the weaponry we have,''
Sebastiao said.
	   Sergeyev headed a delegation of 33 government officials and
military officers.
	   ------
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government and rebels
met Wednesday for a third round of talks since a July 26 cease-fire
halted their fighting in the West African country, according to
reports.
	   The talks were brokered by diplomats from the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or CPLP, in the Cape Verde islands,
about 700 kilometers (430 miles) off the coast of Senegal, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   The conflict between President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government
and a breakaway military faction erupted June 7 when Ansumane Mane
was dismissed as military chief. The rebels accused Vieira of
corruption and demanded that he step down.
	   The Economic Community of West African Countries, or ECOWAS,
also talked to both sides Tuesday in the capital Bissau, according
to Lusa.
	   The CPLP and ECOWAS had met two weeks ago to coordinate their
negotiating efforts, although controversy over who should head the
talks postponed a joint attempt.
	   Guinea-Bissau is a former Portuguese colony.

Suspect pleads guilty to killing Mexico City society reporter,

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A man suspected of killing a Mexico City
society reporter and her butler has pleaded guilty to the double
murder during a preliminary court hearing.
	   Pedro Saucedo Avendano, 23, told a judge Tuesday he stabbed
Sally-Sue Hulse on Aug. 3 after arguing with and beating to death
her servant, Alberto Chavez, Mexico City media reported Wednesday.
	   The court must now decide whether to issue a formal detention
order against Saucedo.
	   Police arrested Saucedo on Saturday as he was about to board a
train to the southern state of Chiapas.
	   Saucedo said he had had a personal relationship with Chavez and
became angered when the 62-year-old butler tried to break it off,
according to police. At Hulse's apartment near the popular Zona
Rosa district, Saucedo attacked Chavez with a hammer, killing him.
	   While Saucedo was trying to cover up the killing, Hulse returned
home, police said. The two struggled and Saucedo stabbed Hulse 14
times.
	   Hulse, who was born to British parents in Belize, had lived in
Mexico for 47 years. Her column, ``Pulse by Hulse,'' in the
English-language Mexico City Times described social events in
Mexico City's large foreign community.

Pro-democracy supporters rally on anniversary of failed coup

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A few dozen people gathered Wednesday at the sight
of the 1991 showdown between pro-democracy protesters and Soviet
forces to mark the anniversary of the failed coup against Mikhail
Gorbachev.
	   Most of the demonstrators had been among the tens of thousands
of people who rallied outside the Russian parliament building, the
White House, during the dramatic events of Aug. 18-21, 1991.
	   Some 50 demonstrators, waving tri-color Russian flags and
sporting badges with portraits of President Boris Yeltsin, listened
to harmonica music and exchanged congratulations on the defeat of
the coup.
	   ``There are few of us here now, but if trouble were to strike,
people would be here again to support democracy,'' said 70-year-old
Galina Svergun.
	   Two key figures in the 1991 events _ Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the
last Soviet leader _ made no public statements acknowledging the
anniversary.
	   Meanwhile, a few dozen coal miners who have been camping outside
the building for months to demand unpaid wages countered the
demonstration by chanting anti-Yeltsin slogans and banging their
helmets on the pavement.
	   A few communists who passed by shouted fiery accusations at the
demonstrators, and lambasted Yeltsin's government for failing to
pay workers' wages and pensions on time.
	   The demonstrators were equally adamant.
	   ``Throughout their rule, Communists have been killing their own
people,'' Svergun said. ``We are not getting our pensions either,
but no matter how difficult it gets, we are for democracy, and for
Yeltsin.''
	   The coup began Aug. 18, 1991, when several senior Soviet
officials _ including the vice president and the heads of the KGB
and army _ set up an emergency committee to govern the country,
bypassing Gorbachev, who was held under house arrest in the Crimea.
	   Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, rallied tens of
thousands of people outside the parliament building to oppose them.
	   Three pro-democracy protesters were killed. The coup collapsed
Aug. 21, hastening the end of Soviet rule.

Myanmar anti-government activists return to fold from Japan

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Three former members of a Myanmar
opposition group returned Wednesday from exile in Japan, having
abandoned the struggle against their military government.
	   All over the world, exiles from Myanmar _ also known as Burma _
have been involved in high-profile protests against the military
regime that was installed in 1988 and has since stifled dissent
within the country.
	   State radio and television on Wednesday night reported the
return of the president of the Burmese Association in Japan, Dr.
Mya Mya Win, Vice President Maung Pan Hmwe, and member Dr. Win
Naing.
	   ``Realizing the sincerity of the government, (they) relinquished
their political asylum and returned to Myanmar to cooperate with
the government,'' the radio report said.
	   State television showed the group, which also included Mya Mya
Win's son, being welcomed at Yangon airport by family members and
Deputy Director of Defense Services Intelligence Brig. Kyaw Win.
	   ``While human rights are important, the prosperity of the
Myanmar people is also important,'' Japan's Kyodo News Service
quoted Win Naing saying before leaving Japan. ``From now on, I want
to help bring technology and capital from Japan to Myanmar.''
	   It said Win Naing, now 39, came to Japan in 1980 to study
television imaging technology, and helped found the dissident group
after the violent military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in 1988.
	   In 1992 he became one of the first Myanmar nationals in Japan to
be granted political asylum by the Justice Ministry, Kyodo
reported.

Taxi driver arrested for allegedly overcharging Australian tourist

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police arrested a taxi driver Wednesday
for allegedly charging an Australian tourist more than 25 times the
normal price for a ride from the airport, authorities said.
	   Giorgos Mitsis, 40, confessed to charging 23-year-old Kelly Jane
Smith 38,500 drachmas (dlrs 127) for a trip that should have cost
no more than 1,500 drachmas (dlrs 5) for the 1,600-meter (one-mile)
ride, police said.
	   Smith paid the amount demanded by Mitsis, but a travel agent
where she had gone to pick up an airline ticket called police when
told how much the taxi driver had charged.
	   Police drove Smith to the airport, where she identified Mitsis
when he returned. He was arrested and later confessed, police said.
	   If convicted, Mitsis faces a fine and the suspension of his taxi
license for about five months.
	   Cases of Greek taxi drivers overcharging customers are common,
particularly targeting tourists taking rides from airports and
ferry ports.
	   At least two other taxi drivers were arrested during the past
few months accused of grossly inflating the amount shown on their
taxi meters by using remote control devices.

Sudan declares `general mobilization' after opposition meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Sudanese opposition leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's ruling party has declared a
``general mobilization'' and called on Egypt to hand over Sudanese
terrorists following a meeting by Sudanese opposition groups in
Cairo.
	   The National Congress announced the mobilization ``to face the
challenges confronting the nation and the open provocations from
within Egyptian territories by the remnants of rebellion and the
mercenaries who ... work against Sudan's Islamic orientation.''
	   The congress made the announcement in a statement Tuesday, and
it was carried Wednesday in Sudanese newspapers. A ``general
mobilization'' calls on citizens to be ready to support the
government in event of danger.
	   The statement followed a three-day meeting in Cairo by the
National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group of Sudanese
opposition parties.
	   The alliance issued a statement Tuesday rejecting Sudan's new
constitution, which is based on Islamic law. It also vowed to keep
up the struggle against the Khartoum government.
	   On Wednesday, the Sudanese Workers Trade Federation issued a
statement denouncing the convening of an opposition conference in
Egypt.
	   Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Sudan's first vice president, also
commented on the Cairo meeting in a speech to military trainees
Tuesday. ``We are saying in your name to the enemies of Sudan who
gathered in Cairo, your alliance will end up in ashes,'' he said.
	   The National Congress statement said Egypt's hosting of the
meeting amounted to interference in Sudan's internal affairs. It
said Egypt should hand over Sudanese terrorists if it wanted to
improve relations.
	   Meanwhile, in Cairo Wednesday, NDA chairman Mubarak el-Fadel
el-Mahdi defended Egypt's decision to hold the meeting, saying
Cairo had the right to exhaust all diplomatic means to help end the
civil war.
	   ``Egypt has entered the arena because it has interests'' in
Sudan, el-Mahdi said.
	   Egypt fears Sudan's breakup could threaten the flow of the Nile
River, its main source of water.
	   Earlier this year, the two countries began patching up ties that
plummeted after an unsuccessful attack on President Hosni Mubarak
in Ethiopia in 1995. Egypt accused Sudan of harboring the
attackers, but it denied the men were in the country.
	   Sudan's National Congress specifically asked Egypt to hand over
men accused in a bomb plot. Among those is former Prime Minister
Sadiq el-Mahdi, who attended Cairo meeting.
	   Also attending were Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, head of the
opposition alliance, and John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army which has been fighting the government since 1983.

Spanish Olympic Committee may seek De Merode's resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Olympics-IOC-Drugs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish Olympic Committee said
Wednesday it would demand the resignation of the International
Olympic Committee's anti-doping chief unless he retracts
accusations that the Spanish were lax in cracking down on drugs in
sport.
	   Spanish committee chief Carlos Ferrer Salat said the comments
made by Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical
commission, were ``astounding'' and unbecoming of a man in de
Merode's position.
	   In an interview this week with the French daily Le Figaro, de
Merode said many doctors in Spain ``have rejected the ethics of
their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said.
	   Ferrer said he spoke by telephone with de Merode on Wednesday
and that the IOC medical chief had claimed too much importance was
being placed on what were meant to be informal comments made during
the Le Figaro interview.
	   The Spanish Olympic Committee, in a statement Wednesday, pointed
out that Spain, Germany and the United States were the only three
countries to have two IOC-recognized dope testing clinics, most
countries having just one.
	   The statements added that the IOC has never expressed any
suspicion about Spain's anti-doping record or policies in the past
and pointed out that no Spanish athlete tested positive during the
last Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, 1996.
	   The tiff with de Merode's comes as IOC prepares to meet in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to begin plotting its future anti-doping
polices in the wake of the Tour de France debacle.

Israel approves expansion of four settlements in Golan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Wednesday approved the construction
of thousands of new homes in four settlements in the Golan Heights.
	   A ministerial committee headed by by Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon approved construction of 2,500 vacation units and
2,300 housing units in four settlements in the southern Golan,
overlooking the Sea of Galilee.
	   In a statement, Sharon said the approval of the construction was
important for strengthening and developing Israel's Golan
settlements.
	   ``Many people want to live in this beautiful part of the
country, and we are working to fulfill that need,'' Sharon
spokesman Raanan Gissin said.
	   Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Peace talks
between the two countries have been stalled since early 1996.

British Aerospace acknowledges contact with Libyan intermediary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A newspaper reported Wednesday that British
Aerospace PLC held secret talks about rebuilding Libya's civil
aviation industry, prompting shares to rally on speculation such a
deal might be lucrative.
	   British Aerospace complained that a British tabloid, The
Express, had ``created an issue which does not exist'' in a
front-page story suggesting the company stood to gain 6 billion
pounds (dlrs 9.7 billion) in business with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi.
	   But British Aerospace acknowledged it had been in touch with a
Libyan intermediary who inquired about whether the company might be
interested in aviation contracts with Libya.
	   Libya's airlines and airports have fallen into disrepair as a
result of U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   After Libya's middleman made contact with British Aerospace, the
company said it responded to his overture.
	   ``The nature of the response was about possible future talks
rather than any detailed discussions,'' British Aerospace said
without elaboration.
	   A company spokesman, Mike Peters, declined to field any
questions on the matter. British Aerospace stressed in its terse
statement that it could not hold any negotiations with the Libyans
as long as the sanctions are in place.
	   British Aerospace stock rallied Wednesday, closing up 4 percent
at 421 pence (dlrs 6.82) per share on the London Stock Exchange.
	   The Lockerbie bombing has never been solved, but Britain has
sought for years to try two Libyan intelligence agents whom the
British and U.S. governments believe were involved.
	   The Express reported that British Aerospace and Libya's
intermediaries had been in talks for more than 12 months, including
meetings in Geneva and the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   Internal British Aerospace discussions on the matter went as
high as the chief executive, Sir Richard Evans, the Express said.
	   The Express said that the managing director of British Aerospace
Consultancy Services, John Flinton, had met with Libyan
intermediaries and was instructed to draw up plans for a ``Libyan
Master Project.''
	   The deal would apparently involve delivery of Airbus Industrie
jets to Libya, plus spare parts, maintenance and training for
Libyan pilots, and mechanics and the modernization of Libya's
airports, the Express said.
	   The newspaper report cited memos and faxes it had obtained, as
well as sources whom did not identify.

Government postpones debt plan under international pressure

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Under pressure from international investors, the
Russian government postponed plans Wednesday to restructure its
debt _ a move that had been expected to shortchange foreigners.
	   The government's new deputy prime minister for economic policy,
Boris Fyodorov, said Russia wanted to avoid angering foreigners who
put their money into Russian treasury bills and who still could
face steep losses.
	   ``It's important not to make a mistake in this decision,'' said
Fyodorov, a former finance minister who was reappointed to the
Cabinet earlier this week. ``It will determine whether Russia can
return to world markets within six months, within a year, or within
five years.''
	   The announcement came on a day of generally gloomy economic news
in Russia, which effectively devalued the ruble on Monday in the
face of a mounting debt crisis.
	   The government said industrial output in July fell by as much as
9.4 percent from the year before, while overall output fell by 4.5
percent. The news was especially discouraging since Russian output
had just begun to grow at the end of last year following years of
steep decline.
	   Meanwhile, the government said its wage arrears rose by 15
percent between June and July.
	   The ruble's official value fell slightly Wednesday, and the
Central Bank said it would peg it at 6.99 rubles to the U.S. dollar
on Thursday. The government has said the ruble can go as low as 9.5
to the dollar, but is hoping it will stabilize at a higher rate
than that.
	   Since currency markets have been largely idle since last week,
it is hard to say where the ruble will wind up. It began the week
at 6.3 to the dollar, or about 16 U.S. cents, and is now worth a
little more than 14 cents.
	   Besides allowing the ruble's value to fall, the government had
intended to announce a restructuring of the debt it owes on
treasury bills. This was the announcement that was postponed until
next Monday to soothe foreign investors.
	   The investors had grown concerned after rumors swept the markets
that Russia was going to offer foreigners a much worse deal than it
was willing to give Russian banks _ as little as one-third as much.
	   However, late Tuesday, Fyodorov said he was asking officials
from Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan to advise the government in the
debt restructuring. Sometime later, he decided to postpone the
announcement.
	   The debt restructuring will be ``civilized,'' Deputy Finance
Minister Oleg Vyugin promised. However, he added, ``We can't give
investors too good terms.''
	   Although foreign investors will certainly be hurt by Russia's
economic stumble, economists say the ruble devaluation is not
likely to have a serious global impact, although it could add
weight to the downward pull exerted by ailing Asian economies.
	   ``Russia is not a big economy in global terms,'' noted Jonathan
Hoffman, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
``I think the impact is going to be more on the weaker, emerging
markets rather than the global economy as a whole.''
	   The leader of Russia's banking association called on the
government to prevent a panic by helping banks survive the ruble's
devaluation and market turmoil.
	   ``The main goal is to calm people and restore confidence in the
banking community,'' Sergei Yegorov said at a news conference. He
chairs the Association of Russian Banks and speaks for the entire
banking community.
	   He said the government should support banks by issuing emergency
loans and stabilizing the ruble by intervening at the currency
market.
	   Yegorov tried to sound upbeat, predicting that the majority of
Russia's 1,600 commercial banks would be able to overcome the
current crisis and only 200-250 are in the immediate danger. Other
estimates had it that more than one third of them may fail because
of over-dependence on their ruble assets and other problems.
	   Many customers didn't share Yegorov's optimism.
	   ``The banks are in danger and withdrawal is the only reasonable
thing now,'' said Semyon Shengelai, 51, a construction manager, who
tried to close his dollar account in the SBS-Agro, one of Russia's
largest banks.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Forced to arbitrate in the nation's most
explosive political debate, the Supreme Court of Canada issues a
momentous ruling Thursday on whether Quebec has the right to secede
without the federal government's permission.
	   The separatist government of the mostly French-speaking province
insists Quebeckers have the right to decide for themselves in a
referendum whether to secede. The court ruling, no matter what its
conclusions, is likely to provide ammunition for the separatists
when they campaign for re-election either late this year or next
spring.
	   The high court never sought to intrude in the long-running
debate about Quebec, but its hand was forced when the federal
government last year asked it to rule on three questions: Can
Quebec legally declare unilateral independence under Canadian law?
Can it secede under international law? If there is a conflict,
which law prevails?

 &UR; EU reiterates concern about human rights violations

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union expressed concern
Wednesday about reports of human rights abuses in Congo whose
government is struggling to stay in power.
	   ``These reports credibly allege rounding up, detention, beating,
torture, ethnic propaganda ... and in some cases summary execution
of Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnic groups'' by both
sides, the 15 EU governments said in a statement.
	   They urged ``all parties to the conflict to take the necessary
measures to prevent such violations by security forces under their
command'' and refrain ``from recruiting child soldiers.''
	   The statement was issued by the government of Austria which
currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
	   It did not unveil any EU initiative to resolve the critis in
Congo but repeated the concern, first issued in a declaration on
August 11, `for peaceful solutions to the current problems so that
the process of reconstruction and democratization can proceed.''
	   Ten East European nations and Cyprus, which are in line to join
the EU in the years ahead, aligned themselves with the EU
declaration.

Taliban criticize Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban leaders accused
Iran of picking a fight, as the war of words between the
neighboring countries escalated Wednesday.
	   Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Hasan told reporters in
Kabul that if Iranians were considering an attack, ``they can try
it,'' adding they would be defeated as Soviet invaders in
Afghanistan were in 1992.
	   Iranian officials have hinted they might use force to free
Iranians they claim were detained by Taliban troops earlier this
month in northern Afghanistan. Iran says the detainees include 11
diplomats, a correspondent of the official Islamic Republic News
Agency and 35 truck drivers who reportedly work for an
international transport company.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but they admit to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran is widely suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban in Afghanistan's civil war. The Taliban
have seized most of the country in the war.
	   Iran's Majlis, or parliament, warned the Taliban Tuesday that
Iran will do whatever was necessary to secure the release of its
citizens. Former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, who continues to
wield great influence in Iran, said force was not ruled out.
	   ``Those who have seen the power of Iran know that the Iranian
nation is strong enough to forcibly free its children from
captivity without any negative effect,'' Rafsanjani said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the
Taliban ``degenerate'' in a television statement Tuesday.

	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Chinese soldiers bailed flood waters that
seeped through dikes protecting the industrial city Harbin on
Wednesday, while workers wearing life jackets in China's largest
oil field tried to keep functioning partly submerged wells pumping.
	   With the Songhua and other northeast rivers at record highs and
expected to rise for two more days and with torrential rains
falling on central China's rain-swollen Yangtze River, Xinhua said
flood-fighting has reached ``a crucial moment.''
	   The raging Songhua punched through two 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) dikes in Harbin, cutting highway traffic on a
bridge in the northeast provincial capital of 9 million people, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   After local officials unsuccessfully tried to plug the gaps with
trucks, flood waters forced people protecting the dikes to flee,
Xinhua said.
	   A dam burst, 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside of the city,
flooded land near the airport, but a city spokesman said the
airport remained secure.
	   Soldiers guarded a 1.5-meter-high (5-foot-high) restraining wall
of metal rods and wood planks built atop a 26-kilometer (15-mile)
levee protecting the city. State television showed soldiers using
shovels and wash basins to bail water leaking through dikes piled
with sandbags.

UNSCOM plotting course on how to proceed after council acts

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Eckhard saying Annan has phoned Iraqi
authorities, met with Security Council. TRIMS outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken to
Iraqi authorities about the impasse over weapons inspections in
Iraq and has met with the Security Council to discuss the problem,
a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Fred Eckhard didn't give details about Annan's phone calls with
Baghdad, but word of his involvement comes as some members of the
council have asked for the U.N. chief's personal intervention to
try to break the standoff.
	   ``It's our view that the Iraqis repudiated the Memorandum of
Understanding,'' which Annan brokered in Febrary to give inspectors
access to presidential palaces, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said Wednesday.
	   ``And we believe that with (Annan's) skill and his diplomatic
efforts, they should be engaged again to resolve this crisis,'' he
said.
	   Annan has already met with council members in closed sessions to
discuss his view of the standoff, Eckhard said.
	   Inspectors have held off conducting any searches since Iraq
announced on Aug. 5 that it was freezing cooperation with the
United Nations.
	   The weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift harsh
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf War.
	   Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, announced Tuesday that he had
failed to negotiate a resumption of cooperation after two meetings
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He left Baghdad on
Wednesday and was expected to brief the council soon thereafter.
	   There were, however, serious questions about whether Annan's
intervention alone could persuade Iraq to back down on its decision
to freeze cooperation with inspectors.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.
	   Annan brokered a February accord that defused the last crisis
with Iraq _ over inspectors' access to presidential palaces. But at
the time, he had U.S. and British threats of force to back his
diplomatic efforts.
	   This time neither Washington nor London has made such clear
threats, though U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said
the United States reserved the right to use force if necessary.
	   Annan was vacationing in Mali and his native Ghana and wasn't
due back in New York until Sept. 4.
	   He has approved of the council's strategy so far, Eckhard said.
	   ``I think basically he's been pleased that the approach being
taken by the council is low-key rather than confrontational with
military threats,'' Eckhard said. ``On the other hand, he can't
exclude that the council would once again consider the military
option.
	   ``But for the moment the emphasis is on the diplomatic side,''
Eckhard said.

Swiss minister: bank settlement causes large tax loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss banks' settlement of Holocaust
survivors' claims may indirectly cost taxpayers some 400 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 270 million) because of deductions the banks
will take, Switzerland's finance minister indicated Wednesday.
	   The Swiss government opposes making a contribution to the
settlement. But Kaspar Villiger said his department estimates that
sum would be the total loss arising because the banks can deduct
the sum as an essential business expense.
	   Last week, the country's two biggest commercial banks, United
Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, agreed to pay dlrs 1.25
billion in an out-of-court settlement of the claims against them.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   UBS and Credit Suisse say they expect other Swiss companies and
institutions to help finance the sum.
	   The country's central bank, the Swiss National Bank, has called
a special board meeting for Friday to discuss the settlement. Its
board chairman, Jakob Schoenenberger, has said he and bank
president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution.
	   The idea is also opposed by Switzerland's main political
parties.
	   President Flavio Cotti told a news conference the ruling
seven-member coalition cabinet discussed the settlement at length
Wednesday.
	   He restated the government's position that the agreement creates
no obligations for it, and again ruled out use of taxpayers' money
to help finance the settlement.
	   Cotti added that the government fully understands the banks'
move to settle and protect their interests in the United States. He
expressed the hope that it will help calm the situation.
	   Ministers declined to comment on any SNB contribution ahead of
Friday's meeting, saying the decision is a matter for the bank
itself.

Brazil's Rai out six months after knee surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Sao Paulo midfielder Rai had surgery
Wednesday to repair torn knee ligaments and will be sidelined for
at least six months, his doctor said.
	   ``It went very well,'' Dr. Moises Cohen said. ``We did
everything we hoped to, and he should return with no problem.''
	   Rai, 33, was tackled from behind by Cruzeiro fullback Wilson
Gottardo and ruptured the cruciate ligament in his left knee during
a first-division game this month.
	   Many feared the injury could end Rai's career, but he said he
would be back next year.
	   Rai was a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup champion side and
transferred to Paris-Saint Germain after the tournament. He
returned to Sao Paulo this year and led the club to the Sao Paulo
state title.

without a ticket, the Baltic News Service reported Wednesday.
	   The 24-year-old victim, whose name was not given, was shot in
the leg, BNS said. His condition was not immediately known.
	   According to the report, driver Gintaras Dzengelevicius had

were immediately filed, BNS said.

Black set to become head of South African rugby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a first, a black is
virtually assured of becoming the next president of South African
rugby, a sport dominated by whites during apartheid.
	   Silas Nkanunu is the only nominee for president of the South
African Rugby Football Union, the sports body announced Tuesday
after the nominating period closed.
	   The post has been vacant since Louis Luyt resigned in May amid a
racially tinged clash that pitted the rugby union against the
government and the National Sports Council, which comprises all of
the sporting bodies in the country.
	   President Nelson Mandela last year assigned a judicial
commission to investigate allegations of corruption, racism and
mismanagement in the SARFU leadership. The union challenged the
move and forced Mandela to testify in court on why he appointed the
investigating commission.
	   That enraged the National Sports Council and others, who
believed SARFU had humiliated Mandela _ who had tried to make rugby
a symbol of national unity after taking power in 1994.
	   Luyt's resignation averted a threatened international boycott of
South African rugby.
	   SARFU will elect its new president, vice presidents and four
executive committee members on Sept. 1.
	   Nkanunu is a former SARFU vice president.

UN bringing in two oil industry experts to speed up contracts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Responding to Iraq's complaints that the
United Nations has been too slow to approve spare parts needed to
rebuild its oil industry, U.N. officials said Wednesday they were
bringing in two industry experts to speed up the processing of
contracts.
	   The Iraq Program Office will hire two experts from the Dutch
firm Saybolt to review contracts for spare pipeline parts and
provide information to the Iraq Sanctions Committee, a U.N. source
said.
	   Saybolt already monitors Iraqi oil exports for the United
Nations. The two experts were part of a U.N. team that visited
Iraqi refineries in March and reported on the ``lamentable'' state
of the oil industry and endorsed Baghdad's request for dlrs 300
million in spare parts, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely selling oil since U.N.
sanctions were imposed in 1990, following its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Under the so-called oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to
export up to dlrs 5.26 billion worth of oil over six months and use
the proceeds to buy badly needed food and medicine.
	   The Security Council has authorized the dlrs 300 million to buy
spare parts, but Iraq has complained that the sanctions committee
has been dragging its feet to approve new contracts.
	   As of last Friday, 38 contracts were submitted, five of which
have been placed on hold because the parts requested target the
refining sector, not export capability, sources said. Seven
contracts have been approved and 15 are pending approval.

Rescuers find survivors from landslide; scores feared killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new slide, throughout with quotes from
survivor, army official. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A third landslide in India's Himalayan
outback flattened a mountainous village Wednesday, killing 26
people. Nearby, army troops crawled across mud and fallen rocks
from another slide to rescue nine people in a remote Himalayan
valley.
	   There were no reports of survivors Wednesday in Monsuna village,
close to the Himalayan village of Malpa, where more than 200 people
were missing and feared killed in a landslide Tuesday and the
Ukhimutt region, where a mudslide killed at least 42 people last
Wednesday.
	   All 25 houses in Monsuna were destroyed as torrential rains
caused a mountain of mud and boulders to fall on the village, local
official Babulal Mina said by telephone from nearby Rudraprayag.
	   At Malpa, bad weather grounded rescue helicopters for the second
day and 75 soldiers picked their way across rain-soaked mountains
to reach a camp site for Hindu pilgrims that had become what one
official described as ``a valley of death.''
	   Rains toppled a mountain of mud and boulders into the valley
before dawn Tuesday. The rain and mud changed the course of the
Kali River, triggering a flash flood that swept away the pilgrims'
huts.
	   Rescuers have so far found nine bodies and 18 survivors, but
hopes of finding more survivors have almost ended. Army divers
camped on hillocks late today, waiting for the swirling waters to
recede.
	   Those rescued included villagers, pilgrims and porters
accompanying the pilgrims to a sacred shrine across the Chinese
border in Tibet.
	   ``The condition of the survivors is serious due to their
exposure to freezing wind and rain for more than 24 hours,'' said
Brigadier Avadesh Prakash, the local army commander. He said the
bodies of many other victims may have been swept away in the flood.
	   The army rescuers on Wednesday found nine survivors huddled
under boulders, he said. Nine other injured people were taken to
hospitals Tuesday.
	   Among the missing pilgrims was Protima Bedi, a noted Indian
dancer who was also the mother of Pooja Bedi, one of India's most
popular film actresses.
	   Also missing were 60 pilgrims, most of their 45 porters and
seven government officials accompanying them. The rest of the
victims were road workers and locals.
	   ``There is no trace of the others,'' said L.R. Yadav, the top
administrator of Pithoragarh, 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of
New Delhi.
	   ``According to the rescue workers, it resembles a valley of
death. Backpacks, gas stoves, food cans and other articles
belonging to the people are strewn all around. There is no trace of
the fiberglass huts or the dwellings of the villagers,'' Yadav said
in a telephone interview.
	   Limited rescue operations began Tuesday by a handful of soldiers
of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, some of whom had also been
injured in the mudslide, said Naresh Dayal, the interior minister
for the state of Uttar Pradesh.
	   The pilgrims reached the camp site Sunday, but bad weather
hampered them from setting out on their 120-mile (190-kilometer),
12-day trek to the Manasarowar Lake across the border. Hindus and
Buddhists revere the four-faced Himalayan peak, known as Kailasha,
or the abode of bliss.

Russia evacuates citizens from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian government plane evacuated 69 people,
mostly Russians, from the capital of Congo, news agencies reported
Wednesday.
	   The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry plane was taking the
evacuees from Kinshasa to Moscow, Interfax and ITAR-Tass reported.
	   In addition to the Russians, there are Italian, Swiss, Congolese
and Belgian citizens on the IL-6 plane, Interfax said.
	   Fighting raged in Kinshasa and rebel forces disenchanted with
President Laurent Kabila were about 150 kilometers (90 miles) away.

Markiza's director general is reinstated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Pavol Rusko, the director general of
Markiza Slovakia private TV station, said Wednesday he would
continue in office although he was physically prevented from
reaching it the day before.
	   ``After our negotiations with the new owner, I will continue to
act as director general, and the television (station) will work as
it used to in the past,'' Rusko said.
	   On Tuesday, new guards informed Rusko that a regional court in
Bratislava had prohibited him from acting as general director and
legal advisor to the company.
	   The move came four days after the court awarded the Gamatex
Group, run by Sylvia Volzova, who holds a 51 percent stake in the
company, to bail it out of debt. Rusko's CME Media Enterprises,
formerly the leading shareholder, hold the remaining 49 percent.

High-ranking cosmonaut says he likes life aboard Mir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former presidential adviser who became an
unlikely cosmonaut said Wednesday that he feels right at home
aboard the Mir space station and has no plans to leave.
	   However, he may have no choice.
	   Speaking to flight controllers from the orbiting space station,
49-year-old Yuri Baturin said he felt well and considers Mir to be
``a huge home,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Mir Commander Talgat Musabayev said he was ``pleasantly
surprised to see that a person who is on his first space mission
has completely adapted after the first day of flight.''
	   Baturin, a former national security adviser to President Boris
Yeltsin, was a surprise addition to the cosmonaut corps after being
fired from his post last year. Initially, reports that Baturin
would be blasting off to Mir were treated in the Russian media as a
joke.
	   Baturin is a space physicist by training, however, and he
apparently undertook a rigorous regimen of physical training to be
ready for the launch last Thursday.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, Baturin _ apparently joking _ told
flight controllers Wednesday that he had no plans to return to
Earth. He is scheduled to return home Aug. 25 with Mir's old crew,
the news agency said.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, four wounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel saying 4 soldiers wounded in attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday, less than two
hours after an Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded
in a guerrilla attack.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
of Mlita, a village in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a Hezbollah
stronghold just across from an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
the south, Lebanese officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (1.8 miles) further north from the village of Rihan
where an Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a
guerrilla ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   It was not known whether there were any casualties from the
10:30 a.m. (0730GMT) raid, the second in south Lebanon in three
days.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah antiaircraft guns fired at the
raiding jets, but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Military officials in Israel confirmed the air strike and said
that one soldier was killed and four wounded in the guerrilla
attack.
	   The air raid came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an armored
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   They said the guerrillas fired anti-tank Sagger missiles and set
off a roadside bomb as the patrol passed near Rihan, about 10
kilometers (6 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied border enclave.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired Sagger missiles and
detonated a ``powerful bomb'' near the Israeli patrol.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands facing the
occupied zone, the officials said. No casualties were reported from
the shelling.
	   On Monday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is used by Hezbollah as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied militiamen. No
casualties were reported in the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

US, Albanians launch nationwide search for terror suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with new details; background. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- As heavily armed U.S. Marines guarded
the American diplomatic compound, Albanian and American agents
searched nationwide Wednesday for suspected members of a terrorist
group which planned to blow up the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``It's a very intensive search by the CIA and the Albanians,''
said an official of the Albanian police official who asked not to
be named. ``The (Albanian) secret service and the CIA are compiling
lists of suspects and sending police to arrest them.''
	   The official said the nationwide search was launched after U.S.
officials last week uncovered ``serious evidence'' of plans to bomb
the U.S. Embassy. He said the plot was apparently linked to the
recent arrests of several Egyptians believed linked to terrorist
attacks in Egypt, including last November's massacre of 62 tourists
and others at a temple in the southern city of Luxor.
	   He said the Albanians believe the plot against the embassy was
aimed at undermining a wide-ranging anti-terrorist investigation
which has been secretly underway for months with the cooperation of
Egyptian authorities.
	   The plot may also be linked to the bombings this month of the
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 257 people were
killed. On Friday, the U.S. State Department said it was evacuating
nonessential staff and family members from its embassy here and
warned Americans against traveling to Albania.
	   The next day, the official said, U.S. Ambassador Marisa Lino met
with Albanian authorities and told them she had ``solid evidence''
of a plan to drive a car bomb into the embassy, located in a
diplomatic compound on the edge of this Balkan capital.
	   On Sunday, 150 Marines and Navy commandos, who were in the area
to participate in a NATO exercise, secured the U.S. compound,
erecting huge concrete barriers and a 3-meter (10-foot) metal
fence.
	   President Bill Clinton told Congress on Tuesday that the
measures were taken ``after receiving credible information of a
possible attack'' against the embassy here ``similar to attacks
against our missions'' in East Africa.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said Wednesday.
``Have we made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think
twice before tackling it. This is robust security.''
	   Since June, at least five Egyptians have been arrested here in
connection with the Luxor massacre and the 1993 assassination
attempt against Egypt's prime minister, Atef Sedki. Both attacks
were blamed on Islamic extremists.
	   The Albanian official said the five carried false Egyptian
passports and were believed members of the Islamic Jihad movement.
He said all five were deported to Egypt with help from American
authorities.
	   On Aug. 6 _ one day before the Africa bombings _ an Arabic
language newspaper in London, al-Hayat, published a letter
purportedly from Islamic Jihad vowing revenge against the United
States for the arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   The Albanian source said the search was underway in several
cities and towns in Albania for other suspected Jihad members still
at large. He also said Albanian embassies in France, Italy, Germany
and other countries have receive bomb threats in recent weeks,
apparently in reprisal for Albania's role in the operation.
	   The editor of Albania's largest circulation newspaper, Shekulli,
said he received telephone threats Wednesday from a caller who
claimed to be a member of Islamic Jihad.
	   The editor, Alfred Peza, said his newspaper has extensively
reported on the anti-terrorism operation. He said the caller told
him he was free to continue reporting the story but Jihad ``has
other means'' of expressing its contrary opinion.
	   The newspaper urged police protection of its journalists in a
story published Wednesday.

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron of France set a
European record of 10.73 seconds to win the gold medal in the
women's 100-meter dash at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Arron, 24, had already claimed a championship record of 10.81 in
the semifinals earlier in the day.
	   The Frenchwoman with the orange-colored hair trailed Irina
Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start. But with her powerful
stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the last 20 meters and
stripped the Russian of the title and the European record.
	   Privalova's record was 10.77 set July 6, 1994.
	   Privalova, coming off a hamstring injury, clocked 10.83 to win
the silver. Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87
despite a slow start.
	   The only woman to run faster this year is U.S. star Marion
Jones, who had twice clocked 10.71 and 10.72.
	   Zhanna Pantusevich of Ukraine, the world 200 champion, placed
fourth in 10.92, as four sprinters finished under 11 seconds.
	   Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a throw of 69.10 meters in
her first attempt to win the gold medal in the women's javelin.
	   Damaske, 26, bronze medalist at last year's World Championship,
gave Germany its first gold medal of the European event. Her
winning distance was third in the world this year. She also has the
season's best of 70.10.
	   Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia took the silver medal at 66.92,
while Mikaela Ingberg clinched the bronze at 64.92, saving the day
for the powerful Finnish team.
	   Her Finnish compatriot, outgoing champion and world titlist
Trine Hattestad, had to settle for fourth place with a throw of
63.16, while Olympic champion Heli Rantanen, another Finn, was
fifth at 62.34.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the world champion, tripped over a
hurdle and failed to qualify for the final of the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a leg injury.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, a former champion with a drug-tainted
past, led all qualifiers in the women's 400 meters.
	   Breuer won the title in 1990 when she was still a junior and an
East German. She resumed competing in August 1995, after serving a
three-year drug ban.
	   An Olympic bronze medalist at age 16 with the East German
1,600-meter relay team, Breuer ran an astonishing anchor leg to
help Germany win the gold at last year's World Championship.
	   Breuer, who won the event recently at the prestigious Zurich
meet, clocked a time of 51.60 seconds to advance to the semifinals
of the one-lap race. Helena Fuchsova of the Czech Republic won her
heat in 51.61, while Olga Kotlyarova of Russia took hers in 51.62
as the favorites advanced.
	   In the men's 400, the three British sprinters who are tops in
Europe this season all advanced without problems.
	   Mark Richardson, the fastest in Europe this year at 44.37, won
his group in 46.05, the third fastest of all heat winners. Iwan
Thomas and Solomon Wariso also advanced to keep alive British hopes
of a medal sweep.
	   In the men's pole vault, reigning Olympic champion Jean Galfione
easily cleared 5.60 meters to win one of the two heats and advance
to the final. Maksim Tarasov of Russia, the 1992 Olympic champion,
also cleared 5.60 to advance.
	   Dragutin Topic of Yugoslavia, the 1990 European high jump
champion, won his heat as all favorites cleared 2.24 to advance to
the final.
	   While there were only three finals on the opening day, the
second day Wednesday had six: the women's javelin, men's long jump,
hammer throw, the men's and women's 100 meters and the women's
10,000.

Israelis want to bring home bodies of Holocaust victims

<TEXT>
	   HOLON, Israel, (AP) _ The remains of 2,000 Jews killed by the
Nazis lie in unmarked graves beneath a green field spotted with
daisies in the Polish town of Kalushin. Seventy are Zvi Kamionka's
relatives.
	   ``My greatest fear is that nothing will be remembered of my
relatives,'' Kamionka said Wednesday, sitting in his
air-conditioned apartment in the Tel Aviv suburb Holon.
	   ``My mission is not finished as long as a memorial is not placed
there or all the bones are not brought back here to be buried.''
	   Kamionka, a gray-haired man with intense pale blue eyes, is one
of dozens of Polish Israelis who the bones of their family members
brought to Israel for burial _ a task suddenly made possible by the
agreement of Polish pathologists to help identify the remains of
Holocaust victims.
	   Dr. Yehuda Hiss, head of the Israel Institute of Forensic
Medicine, said in the past some families had remains brought to
Israel only to learn that they were not those of their relatives.
	   Hiss said the head of the Forensic Medicine Institute in Warsaw,
Dr. Aleksander Dobrzynski, had agreed to carry out the tests with
the participation of a rabbi, in what he called ``a major turning
point and a humanitarian act on the part of the Poles.''
	   After the agreement was reported on Israel radio Wednesday
morning, the Israeli institute was flooded with phone calls from
relatives of Holocaust victims.
	   One call came from Kamionka, a 66-year-old grandfather
originally from Kalushin, 80 kilometers (40 miles) east of Warsaw.
Kamionka's immediate family escaped to Russia in 1940, a few months
before thousands of Jewish residents of Kalushin _ including 70 of
his relatives _ were shot to death.
	   But despite his hopes, Kamionka knows finding the remains of his
relatives among the bones of 2,000 victims buried in that desolate
field may be an impossible task.
	   ``It's a good idea to bring the bones but it's not very
realistic,'' the retired electronics technician said Wednesday.
	   ``Hundreds of thousands of Jews were buried all over Poland and
to do DNA tests on them is an impossible task.''
	   For the relatives of most Holocaust victims, there are no
remains to bury. Most of the 6 million Jews who perished in the
Holocaust _ the majority of whom died in Poland _ were gassed and
cremated, and their ashes dumped.
	   ``Remains represent a very small number of those who died in the
Holocaust,'' said Jonathan Lemberger, the head of AMCHA, an
organization that helps Israeli Holocaust survivors.
	   Lemberger said he was concerned that the scientists' efforts
might only raise tragic memories for most survivors.
	   ``This is a reminder that they have no grave and that they had
no proper mourning process,'' he said. ``That is going to be very
difficult for most survivors.''
	   Kamionka hopes that all of the bones from the mass graves _
whether they can be identified or not _ will be brought to Israel,
for a dignified and permanent burial.
	   After speaking on the radio on Wednesday, Kamionka's telephone
began ringing off the hook with calls from other survivors.
	   ``I know of Jews from Kalushin living in Argentina, in New York
and in Israel,'' he said. ``I hope to get them organized, collect
money and set up a memorial so our relatives will never be
forgotten.''

U.N. refugee agency officials warns of catastrophe in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deputy head of the U.N. refugee
agency Wednesday warned of a catastrophe in Kosovo unless there is
an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a political
settlement.
	   Soeren Jessen Petersen, a deputy to U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said in Pristina the current crisis ``would become a
catastrophe during winter'' without a halt in fighting and a
subsequent peace deal.
	   Without such a settlement, the displacement of people will
continue and in fact increase, he said,
	   ``We have more than 200,000 (displaced Kosovars) now, but we
would have many, many people dying during the coming winter,''
Petersen said, adding it was up to the politicians ``to stop
that.''
	   He said, ``Humanitarian action must not once again, as it
happened in Bosnia for four or five years, become a substitute for
political action. We need four things, not to avert the crisis,
that's too late, but to try to minimize the impact of what we're
looking at.''
	   He cited a cessation of hostilities followed by a political
dialogue; more regular, better access and security; a return to
their homes of 170,000 people displaced inside Kosovo and 50,000
outside; and ``a better response to the (UNHCR) humanitarian
operation.''
	   Similarly, Emma Bonino, the human rights commissioner for the
European Union, said in Pristina that ``if there is no political
settlement we are moving very quickly from a humanitarian crisis to
a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   She said, ``The international community must face the reality.
There is no way we can avert a catastrophe on purely humanitarian
ground,'' meaning without a political solution.
	   In an apparent response to the rising international criticism of
the Serb-led government over the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,
the official Tanjug news agency on Wednesday accused the Albanian
rebels of preventing the return of refugees to their homes.
	   Tanjug, which is the government mouthpiece, said that after
their military defeat, ``the Albanian terrorists, as well as the
political representatives, have pulled another card - alleged
humanitarian catastrophe.'' It alleged that the KLA had been using
civilians as human shields while fighting government forces.

German opposition proposes super ministry tying economics with
</HEADLINE>
high-tech &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Stollmann &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats will combine
economics, research and technology in one super-ministry if they
win next month's election, chancellor hopeful Gerhard Schroeder
said Wednesday.
	   The economics ministry will then ``finally be linked to an
applications-oriented field,'' Schroeder said at a campaign
appearance with the maverick computer entrepreneur he has tapped
for the job, Jost Stollmann.
	   The announcement comes two days after Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
trailing Schroeder in his bid for a record fifth term, presented
his own advisory group on ``future and innovation,'' to be chaired
by a former political adversary, Lothar Spaeth.
	   Like Stollmann, Spaeth has been outspoken about the need to
reform Germany's social welfare state to better compete in a global
marketplace.
	   In Berlin Wednesday, Schroeder stressed his reforms would be
linked to social justice, accusing Kohl's government of trying to
solve mass unemployment by cutting the basic standard of living for
workers.
	   He singled out a law passed by Kohl's government allowing
employers to scale back sick pay to 80 percent of a worker's
regular earnings, promising to repeal it if elected.
	   In Bonn, though, Kohl's spokesman asserted that reversing that
and other limited reforms achieved by Kohl would be ``suicide for
Germany as a business location.''
	   The Social Democrats' plan for their first 100 days, reported
piecemeal over the past week by German media, would kill jobs, hurt
business and lead to higher taxes, Kohl spokesman Otto Hauser said.
	   ``The economic upswing in Germany would be severely harmed,'' he
said.
	   Stollmann, in his first speech since being invited to join
Schroeder's team, called for an ``injection of innovation'' from
``the best brains in Germany and abroad'' to create a new
entrepreneurial culture in Germany.
	   ``What could be better than replacing rules with
self-reliance?'' he said.
	   He sketched out an economic policy ``not left, not right, not
ideological, but pragmatic, which will bring prosperity through
efficient markets, with social justice.''
	   Stollmann, who graduated from Harvard Business School and worked
in Chicago in the 1980s, founded his own computer systems
integration firm in 1984.
	   He has no party affiliation and his liberal economic views have
grated with more traditional Social Democrats. It remains to be
seen how freely he would be allowed to enact his beliefs should
Schroeder beat Kohl Sept. 27.
	   Spaeth, a former governor of the western state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, moved east in 1991 and has transformed the
crumbling Carl Zeiss Jena group into a highly successful high-tech
and telecommunications firm, Jenoptik.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents and Kenyan detectives raided a
Nairobi hotel in search of evidence leading to the bombers of the
U.S. Embassy, and an Islamic coalition warned Wednesday of further
attacks against American interests.
	   The World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,
formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, issued its
warning in the London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   Al-Hayat said the statement came along with three others from
the Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   The Holy Shrines group said it would ``continue shipping more
American dead bodies to their unjust government ... until we
humiliate America's arrogance and roll its dignity in the mud of
defeat.''
	   In a joint statement in Nairobi, the FBI and Kenyan police said
``searches were conducted'' at the Hilltop Hotel on Tuesday. They
declined to elaborate, saying only: ``The investigation is
proceeding in a logical manner and no further comment will be made
at this time.''
	   The U.S. embassy said the FBI might hold a news conference
Thursday.
	   The independent Daily Nation reported Wednesday that 15 FBI
agents and six Kenyan detectives, acting on a tip from Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, who is in Kenyan police custody for the Aug. 7
bombing, spent more than two hours Tuesday searching several rooms
in the four-story hotel.
	   Kishor Raghwami, a contractor who is renovating some of the
hotel's 34 rooms, said FBI agents returned Wednesday to photograph
and videotape the hotel.
	   It is located in River Road neighborhood, a seedy section of
downtown Nairobi about a kilometer (half-mile) east of the site
where a powerful bomb ripped through the embassy, resulting in the
deaths of 247 people, 12 of them Americans at the mission.
	   An almost simultaneous bombing at the U.S. mission in
neighboring Tanzania killed 10 people, all of them African.
	   In other important developments Wednesday, a Pakistani newspaper
reported that Odeh gave a detailed account of worldwide
anti-American operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group
based in Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden is reported to be living in Afghanistan and
Afghanistan's Taliban leaders declared Wednesday they would not
hand over bin Laden, even if there were proof he was behind the
bombings.
	   And a border official in Pakistan said a Saudi and a Sudanese
were detained at the Afghan border, He said they were being
questioned about the bombings.
	   The New York Times said Odeh had named the men as accomplices.
	   In Islamabad, The News said Odeh, a 34-year-old Palestinian
engineer, revealed during a week of questioning by Pakistani
intelligence officials that he is a member of a secretive guerrilla
group led by bin Laden.
	   The developments appeared to indicate that _ 11 days after the
blast _ investigators may have made major breakthroughs in tracking
down the bombers.
	   The Daily Nation report said a bomb containing 800 kilograms
(1,760 pounds) of TNT was assembled over several days in the
Hilltop Hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   Previous reports have mentioned ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel
and the plastic explosive Semtex as possible components of the
bomb.
	   Hotel supervisor Abdulrahman Mohamed Said, whose father Mohamed
Said owns the hotel, said police took manager James Nganga in for
questioning and seized the hotel's guest register and copies of
bills.
	   The agents were acting on information provided by Odeh, who was
arrested Aug. 7 in Karachi, Pakistan and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan
authorities investigating the blast, according to the Daily Nation.
	   The newspaper said two rooms, where the bomb was allegedly
assembled, were occupied from Aug. 3-7 by four foreigners _ two
Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi.
	   The Daily Nation said Odeh checked into the hotel Aug. 4 and
that the bomb was assembled there until Aug. 6, when it was taken
away in a small truck and completed elsewhere.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the Daily Nation said Odeh flew to
Karachi the night of Aug. 6, after ensuring final preparations were
in place. It said two of the men who planned the attack and who
were with him in the hotel are at large.
	   The paper also said in addition to Odeh, police were holding
three other people in connection with the attack.
	   The hotel was closed and locked later Wednesday.

Political refugees jailed in Israel end 10-day hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ten political refugees jailed in Israel agreed
Wednesday to end a 10-day hunger strike after an Israeli legislator
promised to help find them asylum.
	   The six Iraqis, two Syrians and two Iranians have been jailed by
Israel for as long as five years for entering the country
illegally.
	   They have been granted political refugee status by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, but have been refused asylum by Israel.
	   Canada initially offered six of the refugees asylum, but
retracted the offer two weeks ago. It was unclear why the Canadians
had canceled the asylum offer.
	   ``They told me they have nothing to lose, and that if, in 30
days, a solution is not found, they will starve themselves to
death,'' Dedi Zucker, a legislator from the opposition Meretz
party, said Wednesday.
	   Zucker said he would do everything he could to find a country
willing to give the refugees asylum.
	   Israel, as a signatory of the United Nation convention on
refugees, cannot extradite or expel political refugees, but is not
compelled to give them asylum.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, four wounded

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel saying four soldiers wounded in attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, less than two
hours after an Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded
in a guerrilla attack.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
of Mlita, a Hezbollah stronghold just across from an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south, Lebanese officials
said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (two miles) further north from the village of Rihan
where an Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded earlier
Wednesday in a guerrilla ambush.
	   It was not known whether there were any casualties from the
10:30 a.m. (0730GMT) raid, the second in south Lebanon in three
days.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah anti-aircraft guns fired at the
raiding jets, but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Military officials in Israel confirmed the air strike on the
village in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province and said that one soldier
was killed and four wounded in the guerrilla attack.
	   The air raid came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an armored
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   They said the guerrillas fired antitank Sagger missiles and set
off a roadside bomb as the patrol passed near Rihan, about 10
kilometers (6 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied border enclave.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired Sagger missiles and
detonated a ``powerful bomb'' near the Israeli patrol.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 of the 155 mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands facing the
occupied zone, the officials said. No casualties were reported from
the shelling.
	   On Monday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is used by Hezbollah as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied militiamen. No
casualties were reported in the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu said
Wednesday recently uncovered letters implicate South African, U.S.
and British intelligence agents in the 1961 death of U.N.
Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold.
	   However Tutu, the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, said the veracity of the letters have not been
determined.
	   Hammarskjold and 15 other people died when their plane exploded
just before landing in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. He had been
trying to mediate a peace agreement between Congo and the breakaway
province of Katanga.
	   Three independent commissions set up by Sweden, the United
Nations and Northern Rhodesia concluded long ago the Sept. 17,
1961, plane crash probably was caused by pilot error, but didn't
exclude other possibilities.
	   The Truth Commission, which is probing apartheid-era crimes,
discovered the eight letters during an investigation into a
different matter. They have been turned over to President Nelson
Mandela and Justice Minister Dullah Omar, who will decide what
further actions should be taken.
	   The letters describe meetings between America's Central
Intelligence Agency, Britain's MI5 and the South African Institute
for Maritime Research, believed to be a possible military front
company, Tutu said.
	   Hand-written or typed on paper with the logo of the SAIMR, the
letters are a correspondence between two SAIMR employees signing
themselves ``Captain'' and ``Commodore.''
	   Marked ``Top Secret,'' they describe a mission dubbed
``Operation Celeste'' to kill the Swedish U.N. chief.
	   ``It is felt that Hammarskjold should be removed,'' one letter
states, after detailing an alleged meeting between British spies
and SAIMR employees.
	   The undated letter says: ``Allen Dulles agrees and has promised
full cooperation from his people.''
	   Dulles was director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961.
	   A British Foreign Office spokesman on Wednesday suggested the
letters were planted.
	   ``Intelligence agents of the United Kingdom do not go around
bumping people off,'' said the spokesman, on customary condition of
anonymity. ``At this time during the Cold War, Soviet
misinformation was quite rampant so (the letters) may have been put
out by them.''
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said: ``This matter,
for the moment anyway, rests with the South African authorities.''
He declined to comment further.
	   The Swedish foreign ministry said it would withhold comment
until it could get more information.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Abroad, President Laurent Kabila has won
key diplomatic and military support for his war against advancing
rebels, but at home in Congo's capital the government faces rising
unrest.
	   Gunfire rattled through Kinshasa's main prison Wednesday morning
as government troops fought to put down an uprising of inmates _
most them Kabila's political opponents _ who smuggled arms into the
facility.
	   Troops now patrol tense streets, where anger and fear blends
into a volatile mix.
	   In a show of support for Kabila, several hundred students
marched down the city's main June 30th Boulevard.
	   ``We will crush the aggressors,'' one protesters shouted. ``We
are behind President Kabila.''
	   Elsewhere, defense ministers from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and
Angola pledge to help Kabila _ a move that threatens to embroil
much of the region in Congo's two-week old rebel war.
	   The moves threatens to escalate the war and pit Congo's southern
neighbors against those in the east.
	   Zimbabwe is sending troops, but it was not known what support
Angola _ facing a possible resurgence of its own civil war _ and
Zambia plan to offer Kabila.
	   ``It was unanimously agreed that we must, with urgency, make
sure practical assistance, both materiel and manpower, is given
to'' Congo, said Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi.
	   On Tuesday, Namibia's largest daily reported that Namibian
defense troops loaded 21 tons of arms and ammunition into two
Boeing aircraft bearing registration marks of an Angolan air
charter outfit. The armaments were reportedly destined for Congo.
	   Kabila's government, emboldened by the offers, says it is
mounting counterstrikes against the rebels _ an army of ethnic
Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of
Kabila's military.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi also announced several
bombing runs on the western rebel stronghold of Kitona.
	   Kitona, near Congo's Atlantic coastline, was one of the first
towns captured by the rebels after they revolted against Kabila
earlier this month.
	   But a key political figure in the rebel movement dismissed the
government's claim of staging air strikes.
	   ``They are liars,'' said Bizima Karaha, Congo's former foreign
minister who fled Kinshasa earlier to join the rebellion.
	   The reported bombing raids and a planned drop of paratroopers
behind enemy lines came as rebel forces were moving to take
Mbanza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of staging the
rebellion and fighting alongside the rebels _ a charge both
countries deny.
	   It is widely believed, however, that both are providing support
to the rebellion.
	   In the east African country of Ethiopia, the Organization of
African Unity said it backed Kabila and urged the rebels to lay
down their weapons.
	   Taking a diplomatic tact, the OAU said it ``condemned all
external intervention in the internal affairs of that country under
any pretext whatsoever.''
	   In Kinshasa, gunfire echoed for hours Wednesday morning at the
Central Makala Prison, where armed inmates tried to revolt against
guards and military reinforcements.
	   Although the exact number of casualties was not immediately
available, witnesses said many people had been killed and many more
wounded. Dozens of soldiers were eventually needed to secure the
prison.
	   Soldiers turned away a team from the International Red Cross
that was dispatched to help the wounded. The prison is home to
several former government ministers _ including ousted Information
Minister Raphael Ghenda _ who were arrested in recent months after
a cabinet purge by Kabila.
	   Kabila, working from the southern city of Lubumbashi _ his
stronghold during his own rebellion just 15 months ago _ ordered
the government to regroup its military on Tuesday after a key
battalion defected to the rebel side.
	   The Zulu Battalion, one of the first units to march into
Kinshasa after Kabila's forces ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko last year, quit the government side recently and are now
holding the town of Inga _ home to one of Congo's primary
power-generating dams.
	   On Wednesday, Kinshasa remained without electricity, which was
cut off from Inga.
	   Hundreds of foreigners have fled the country in recent days, but
the job of evacuating people is becoming more difficult.
	   Belgium said chances were fading that Congo will let it organize
a sixth charter flight to complete the evacuation of some 1,000
foreigners from the nervous capital city.

Government expects dlrs 4.6 billion from privatization next year

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz said
Wednesday the government expected to raise 15 billion zlotys (dlrs
4.6 billion) next year from the sale of state-owned companies.
	   Wasacz told a news conference the money, most of it from the
planned sale of 70 companies, would help reduce the budget deficit,
pay public workers and reform the welfare system in Poland nine
years after the end of Soviet-dominated communist rule.
	   Poland is negotiating to enter the European Union at the start
of the next century, a step that requires completing the overhaul
of the once centrally controlled economy.
	   The overhaul includes selling off unprofitable,
government-subsidized industries to cement the shift to a market
economy. Such sales bring in revenue, but also mean the companies
will cut tens of thousands of jobs in an effort to become
profitable.
	   Wasacz said plans for 1998 included selling stock in the
telephone company and Grupa Pekao SA, the largest commercial bank.
	   Next year, he said, companies targeted for sale include the
national airline, LOT, and petrochemicals giant Petrochemia Plock
SA. The privatization plan also will focus on the electricity,
steel, alcohol and sugar industries, along with parts of the coal
industry, Wasacz said.
	   Poland's coal industry is more than dlrs 3.9 billion in debt. A
reform program, including quick privatization, calls for 105,000 of
the 237,000 miners to lose their jobs and production to drop by
about 15 percent.

Cars stolen when presidential drivers moonlighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 20 cars belonging to President Boris
Yeltsin's administration have been stolen while their drivers were
moonlighting as taxi drivers, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Wednesday.
	   Thieves posing as passengers had the drivers take them to
certain locations where accomplices stole the Audi cars at
gunpoint, said Dmitry Ryzhikov, head of the Investigation
Directorate of the Moscow Police Department.
	   Ryzhikov said 44,247 crimes were reported Moscow in the first
seven months of the year, 3.6 percent more than the same period
last year, including 1,709 robberies and 919 violent robberies.

Black set to become head of South African union

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African Rugby
Football Union, long associated with apartheid governments, is set
to get its first black president four months after the last chief
executive was forced from office in a racial uproar.
	   Former SARFU vice president Silas Nkanunu is the only nominee
for president, which will be elected on Sept. 1, the sports body
announced Tuesday after the nominating period closed.
	   The post has been vacant since Louis Luyt resigned in May amid
accusations of racism that pitted the union against the government
and the National Sports Council, an umbrella organization comprised
of all of the country's sports governing bodies.
	   President Nelson Mandela last year assigned a judicial
commission to investigate allegations of corruption, racism and
mismanagement in SARFU. The union challenged the move and forced
Mandela to testify in court on why he appointed the investigating
commission.
	   That enraged the National Sports Council and others, who
believed SARFU had humiliated Mandela _ who had tried to make rugby
a symbol of national unity after taking power in 1994.
	   Luyt's resignation averted a threatened call for an
international boycott of South African rugby.
	   SARFU will elect its vice presidents and four executive
committee members along with the office of president.
	   Nkanunu's powers will be significantly curtailed from his
predecessors following changes to the SARFU constitution negotiated
with the NSC.
	   The president cannot hold the presidency or chairmanships of a
provincial union and is limited to two, two-year terms.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron of France set a
European record of 10.73 seconds to win the gold medal in the
women's 100-meter dash at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Arron, 24, had already claimed a championship record of 10.81 in
the semifinals earlier in the afternoon.
	   The Frenchwoman with the orange-colored hair trailed Irina
Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start. But with her powerful
stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the last 20 meters and
stripped the Russian of the title and the European record.
	   ``After the semifinal I thought I had a good shot at the gold
medal with a good start,'' Arron said. ``Ironically, I got the gold
and the European record as well, even with a fairly poor start.''
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Arron benefited from a tail wind of 2 meters per second, the
legal limit.
	   Privalova's record was 10.77, set July 6, 1994.
	   Privalova, coming off a hamstring injury, clocked 10.83 to win
the silver in her fastest race this year.
	   ``After such a long injury and an operation, I really could not
have asked for more but this,'' Privalova said.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   The only woman to run faster this year is U.S. star Marion
Jones, who had twice clocked 10.71 and 10.72.
	   Arron, who was born in Guadeloupe, first caught attention when
she finished fourth in last year's worlds. She is the only
consistent sub-11 seconds European sprinter this year and looks the
only woman capable of challenging Jones, the world champion.
	   Zhanna Pantusevich of Ukraine, the world 200 champion, placed
fourth in 10.92, as four sprinters finished under 11 seconds.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, double world cross-country
champion, won the women's 10,000 meters with a powerful finish in
the last 200 meters.
	   O'Sullivan posted a time of 31 minutes, 29.33 seconds to beat
Olympic champion and defending titlist Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal, who took the silver in 31:32.42.
	   Lidia Simon of Romania captured the bronze in 31:32.64.
	   Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a throw of 69.10 meters in
her first attempt to win the gold medal in the women's javelin.
	   Damaske, 26, bronze medalist at last year's World Championship,
gave Germany its first gold medal of the European event. Her
winning distance was third in the world this year. She also has the
season's best of 70.10.
	   Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia took the silver medal at 66.92,
while Mikaela Ingberg clinched the bronze at 64.92, saving the day
for the powerful Finnish team.
	   Her Finnish compatriot, outgoing champion and world titlist
Trine Hattestad, had to settle for fourth place with a throw of
63.16, while Olympic champion Heli Rantanen, another Finn, was
fifth at 62.34.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the world champion, tripped over a
hurdle and failed to qualify for the final of the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a leg injury.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.

Spanish Olympic Committee may seek De Merode's resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Olympics-IOC-Drugs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish Olympic Committee said
Wednesday it would demand the resignation of the International
Olympic Committee's anti-doping chief unless he retracts
accusations that the Spanish were lax in their enforcement.
	   Spanish committee chief Carlos Ferrer Salat said the comments
made by Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical
commission, were ``astounding'' and unbecoming of a man in de
Merode's position.
	   In an interview this week with the French daily Le Figaro, de
Merode said many doctors in Spain ``have rejected the ethics of
their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said.
	   Ferrer said he spoke by telephone with de Merode on Wednesday
and that the IOC medical chief had claimed too much importance was
being placed on what were meant to be informal comments made during
the Le Figaro interview.
	   The Spanish Olympic Committee, in a statement Wednesday, pointed
out that Spain, Germany and the United States were the only three
countries to have two IOC-recognized doping test labs, most
countries having just one.
	   The statements added that the IOC has never expressed any
suspicion about Spain's anti-doping record or policies in the past
and pointed out that no Spanish athlete tested positive during the
last Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, 1996.
	   The tiff with de Merode's comes as IOC prepares to meet in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to begin plotting its future anti-doping
strategy in the wake of the Tour de France debacle.

Swiss judge recommends Pakistan indict Ms. Bhutto

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge said Wednesday he is asking Pakistan
officials to indict former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
on charges of money laundering.
	   Daniel Devaud, an investigating magistrate in Geneva, said he
had enough evidence to charge Ms. Bhutto in Switzerland, but that
it is at the moment impossible to bring her to Geneva to face
charges.
	   Devaud said he has formally asked Swiss federal authorities to
relay his recommendation to the Pakistan government that it indict
her in her home country. He said he has passed to Pakistan bank
documents backing the charges.
	   Pakistan authorities have blocked Ms. Bhutto from leaving the
country because of her legal problems there.
	   Even if Devaud were to indict her himself, she would be under no
obligation to face charges in Switzerland, noted her Geneva
attorney, Dominique Poncet.
	   The judge said he is asking for the indictment over Ms. Bhutto's
dealings with two Swiss firms, Societe Generale de Surveillance and
its former subsidiary Cotecna Inspection SA.
	   Last month, Devaud indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali
Zardari, on similar charges.
	   Pakistani officials have said they gave Devaud numerous
documents that showed Zardari and Ms. Bhutto had used Swiss
connections to receive kickbacks on Pakistan government contracts
with the firms.
	   Ms. Bhutto has rejected the allegations as being concocted by
her political adversaries.
	   Cotecna has denied any of its employees had violated
international or national laws in the case. SGS has launched an
internal investigation.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in November 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule, which she also disputes as being
manufactured by opponents.
	   In Islamabad, Farhatulla Babar, spokesman for Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party, said proceedings against her abroad are
based on false evidence supplied by the Pakistani government.
	   Officials at Switzerland's Office of Police Affairs in Bern said
they were unable to say whether Devaud's recommendation had been
relayed to Pakistan.
	   Pakistani Ambassador S.M. Inamullah said in Bern that he would
be informed of any recommendation only after the Swiss Embassy in
Islamabad had passed it on to his government.
	   Devaud said last month when he charged Zardari that he was
trying to determine whether Ms. Bhutto could claim diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity before deciding whether to charge her in
Switzerland.
	   Ms. Bhutto has challenged the legality of correspondence of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government with Swiss authorities.
	   Pakistan's Supreme Court has ruled that the Pakistani government
cannot pass on any more materials until a ruling is made on her
legal challenge on this point.
	   The Sharif government maintains kickbacks from Pakistani
government contracts flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   In June, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ a former senior
executive of SGS, the managing director of Cotecna and a lawyer who
served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Cotecna and SGS lost their contracts to inspect imports and
exports from Pakistan after Bhutto was ousted.
	   Swiss authorities say they have frozen about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family in seven Geneva banks.

Swiss minister: bank settlement causes large tax loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss banks settlement of Holocaust
survivors' claims may indirectly cost taxpayers some 400 million
francs (dlrs 270 million) because of deductions the banks will
take, an official indicated Wednesday.
	   The Swiss government opposes making a contribution to the
settlement. But finance minister Kaspar Villiger said his
department estimates that sum would be the total loss arising
because the banks can deduct the sum as an essential business
expense.
	   Last week, the country's two biggest commercial banks, United
Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, agreed to pay dlrs 1.25
billion in an out-of-court settlement of the claims against them.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   UBS and Credit Suisse say they expect other Swiss companies and
institutions to help finance the sum.
	   The country's central bank, the Swiss National Bank, has called
a special board meeting for Friday to discuss the settlement. Its
board chairman, Jakob Schoenenberger, has said he and bank
president Hans Meyer oppose making a contribution.
	   The idea is also opposed by Switzerland's main political
parties.
	   President Flavio Cotti told a news conference the ruling
seven-member coalition cabinet discussed the settlement at length
Wednesday.
	   He restated the government's position that the agreement creates
no obligations for it, and again ruled out use of taxpayers' money
to help finance the settlement.
	   Cotti added that the government fully understands the banks'
move to settle and protect their interests in the United States. He
expressed the hope that it will help calm the situation.

Report: German firms may be ready to compensate WWII slave
</HEADLINE>
laborers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Under pressure of possible lawsuits,
several big German companies are considering abandoning their
long-standing refusal to compensate former slave laborers who
worked for them during the Nazi era, a newspaper reported.
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau, in its Friday edition, said automaker
BMW, electronics giant Siemens and the Hochtief construction firm
were among those who have signaled a readiness to make some
payments.
	   It said the firms were moved to act after two Swiss banks agreed
last week to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of
the claims against them, and by Volkswagen's surprise announcement
in July that it would pay its World War II slave laborers.
	   More than 7 million people were forced to work in Nazi Germany,
and the newspaper quoted experts as saying at least 500,000 are
still alive.
	   The German government has paid billions to survivors for
imprisonment and health damage, but has refused to honor wage
claims, saying laborers worked for private companies.
	   Most of the companies involved, however, argue that the Nazi
regime was responsible for wartime slave labor, and that any claims
should be directed to the regime's successor _ the current German
government.
	   Just last October, Siemens chairman Heinrich von Pierer said he
saw no reason to reconsider his company's position.
	   But the newspaper said the firms were now interested in
contributing to a fund that would be set up and administered by the
government to compensate former slave laborers.
	   ``If the federal government creates an appropriate pot, BMW
would take part,'' the paper quoted a company spokesman as saying.
It said Hochtief and Siemens also did not rule out joining such an
effort.
	   ``Now there has to be a start signal,'' said Gert Weisskirchen,
a federal lawmaker with the opposition Social Democrats.

	   This was the first time the rebels _ ethnic Tutsis and
disgruntled Congolese soldiers _ have indicated they were willing
to talk with Kabila, a man they accuse of usurping power, promoting
corruption and tribalism.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden change in rebel tactics,
who have so far rejected any negotiations with Kinshasa.
	   The rebels took up arms Aug. 2 and swept through eastern Congo,
flew in troops to the Atlantic Ocean port of Kitona and were
approaching the capital Kinshasa in a pincer movement.

GOMA, Congo: pincer movement.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   On Wednesday, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Zambia declared
their support for Kabila against the rebels. Only Zimbabwe
announced it was sending troops, but gave no details.
	   But Karaha warned Zimbabwe against intervening in what he said
was Congolese affair.
	   ``Nobody can find a military solution to the Congolese
problem,'' Karaha said. ``Any foreign intervention in Congo will
have one and only consequence: to fight and resist.''
	   Karaha gave no details or timetable for any negotiations.
	   He said Kabila would first have to recognize the rebel movement
before any talks could begin.
	   ``Kabila doesn't even recognize that we exist. Maybe he'll
recognize that we exist once we'll be in Kinshasa,'' Karaha said.
``Whether Kabila should remain president or not is part of the
negotiations. He's a part of the problem so he should be part of
the solution too.''
	   Karaha said any country with interest in Congo was welcome to
mediate.
	   ``Anyone who has the interest of the people of Congo in their
hearts should be the mediator in the problem,'' he said.

Formula One to return to South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Formula One Grand Prix racing will
probably return to South Africa in 2001, Formula One Association
president Bernie Ecclestone said Wednesday.
	   The event had not been held in South Africa since the 1980s,
when the country came under an international sports ban because of
apartheid.
	   ``We have a contract to bring around the Formula One world
championship to South Africa, and as soon as we have a slot open on
the calendar that is what we are going to do,'' Ecclestone told
reporters after having lunch with President Nelson Mandela in
Pretoria. ``I think this is going to happen in the year 2001.
	   The event would likely be held at the Kyalami race track near
Johannesburg.

Cruzeiro seeks first Mercosur victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Two-time champion Cruzeiro will
seek its first victory in the Mercosur Cup when it faces Sao Paulo
Thursday night.
	   Cruzeiro lost 2-1 to Sao Lorenzo of Argentina in its opening
game and trails in Group A alongside Chile's Colo Colo.
	   Colo Colo has lost both of its games. Thursday's match is
Cruzeiro's second.
	   The team, which won the tournament twice in 1992 and 1993 when
it was known as the Supercopa, has been uneven in recent games.
	   After a strong start in the national championship, Cruzeiro
looked terrible last Sunday in a 2-0 loss at home to modest America
of Natal. The loss dropped the team into eighth place in the
24-club first division.
	   Sao Paulo, meanwhile, is struggling to find a replacement for
veteran Rai. The midfielder had surgery on Wednesday for torn knee
ligaments and will be out for at least six months.
	   Sao Paulo won its opener 1-0 against Colo Colo and can match
group leader San Lorenzo with a victory Thursday.

US, Albanians launch nationwide search for terror suspects

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As heavily armed U.S. Marines guarded the
American diplomatic compound on Wednesday, Albanian and American
agents searched for suspected members of a terrorist group that
planned to blow up the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``It's a very intensive search by the CIA and the Albanians,''
said an official of the Albanian Interior Ministry who spoke on
condition he not be identified. ``The (Albanian) secret service and
the CIA are compiling lists of suspects and sending police to
arrest them.''
	   The official said the nationwide search was launched after U.S.
officials last week uncovered ``serious evidence'' of plans to bomb
the U.S. Embassy. He said the plot was apparently linked to the
recent arrests of several Egyptians believed linked to terrorist
attacks in Egypt, including last November's massacre of 62 tourists
and others at a temple in the southern city of Luxor.
	   According to the official, the Albanians believe the plot
against the embassy was aimed at undermining a wide-ranging
anti-terrorist investigation which has been secretly underway for
months with the cooperation of Egyptian authorities.
	   The plot may also be linked to the bombings this month of the
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 257 people were
killed. On Friday, the State Department said it was evacuating
non-essential staff and family members from its embassy here and
warned Americans against travel to Albania.
	   The next day, the official said, U.S. Ambassador Marisa Lino met
with Albanian authorities and told them the Americans had ``solid
evidence'' of a plot against the embassy.
	   On Sunday, 150 Marines and Navy commandos, who were in the area
to participate in a NATO exercise, secured the U.S. compound.
	   President Bill Clinton told Congress on Tuesday that the
measures were taken ``after receiving credible information of a
possible attack'' against the embassy here ``similar to attacks
against our missions'' in East Africa.
	   ``This was a soft target,'' Col. Sam Helland said Wednesday.
``Have we made it a hard one? You bet! Anybody's going to think
twice before tackling it. This is robust security.''
	   Since June, at least five Egyptians have been arrested here in
connection with the Luxor massacre and the 1993 assassination
attempt against Egypt's prime minister, Atef Sedki. Both attacks
were blamed on Islamic extremists.
	   The Albanian official said the five carried false Egyptian
passports and were believed members of the Islamic Jihad movement.
He said all five were deported to Egypt with help from American
authorities.
	   On Aug. 6 _ one day before the Africa bombings _ an Arabic
language newspaper in London, al-Hayat, published a letter
purportedly from Islamic Jihad vowing revenge against the United
States for the arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   The Albanian source said the search was underway in several
cities and towns in Albania for other suspected Jihad members still
at large. He also said Albanian embassies in France, Italy, Germany
and other countries have receive bomb threats in recent weeks,
apparently in reprisal for Albania's role in the operation.
	   The editor of a leading Albanian newspaper, Shekulli, said he
received telephone threats Wednesday from a caller who claimed to
be a member of Islamic Jihad.
	   The editor, Alfred Peza, said his newspaper has extensively
reported on the anti-terrorism operation. He said the caller told
him he was free to continue reporting the story but Jihad ``has
other means'' of expressing its contrary opinion.
	   The newspaper called for police protection of its journalists in
a story published Wednesday.

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron of France set a
European record of 10.73 seconds to win the gold medal in the
women's 100-meter dash at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Arron, 24, had already claimed a championship record of 10.81 in
the semifinals earlier in the afternoon.
	   The Frenchwoman with the orange-colored hair trailed Irina
Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start. But with her powerful
stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the last 20 meters and
stripped the Russian of the title and the European record.
	   ``After the semifinal I thought I had a good shot at the gold
medal with a good start,'' Arron said. ``Ironically, I got the gold
and the European record as well, even with a fairly poor start.''
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Arron benefited from a tail wind of 2 meters per second, the
legal limit.
	   ``It was a difficult race for me because Privalova had a very
good start,'' Arron said.
	   Privalova's record was 10.77, set July 6, 1994.
	   Privalova, coming off a hamstring injury, clocked 10.83 to win
the silver in her fastest race this year.
	   ``After such a long injury and an operation, I really could not
have asked for more but this,'' Privalova said.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   The only woman to run faster this year is U.S. star Marion
Jones, who had twice clocked 10.71 and 10.72.
	   Arron, who was born in Guadeloupe, first caught attention when
she finished fourth in last year's worlds. She is the only
consistent sub-11 seconds European sprinter this year and looks the
only woman capable of challenging Jones, the world champion.
	   Zhanna Pantusevich of Ukraine, the world 200 champion, placed
fourth in 10.92, as four sprinters finished under 11 seconds.
	   Kiril Sosunov of Russia cleared 8.28 meters to win the gold
medal in the men's long jump. All three medalists cleared 8 meters.
Bogdan Tarus of Romania captured the silver at 8.21, while Petko
Dachev of Bulgaria won the bronze with a leap of 8.06.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, double world cross-country
champion, won the women's 10,000 meters with a powerful finish in
the last 200 meters.
	   ``I guess it's time for a Guiness or two now,'' O'Sullivan said.
She said she may go for a double and run the 5,000 as well.
	   O'Sullivan posted a time of 31 minutes, 29.33 seconds to beat
Olympic champion and defending titlist Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal, who took the silver in 31:32.42.
	   Lidia Simon of Romania captured the bronze in 31:32.64.
	   Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a throw of 69.10 meters in
her first attempt to win the gold medal in the women's javelin.
	   Damaske, 26, bronze medalist at last year's World Championship,
gave Germany its first gold medal of the European event. Her
winning distance was third in the world this year. She also has the
season's best of 70.10.
	   Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia took the silver medal at 66.92,
while Mikaela Ingberg clinched the bronze at 64.92, saving the day
for the powerful Finnish team.
	   Her Finnish compatriot, outgoing champion and world titlist
Trine Hattestad, had to settle for fourth place with a throw of
63.16, while Olympic champion Heli Rantanen, another Finn, was
fifth at 62.34.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the world champion, tripped over a
hurdle and failed to qualify for the final of the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a leg injury.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Hoping to get young voters to say ``yes
... oh, YES!'' to their party, the youth wing of the governing
Social Democrats sent out a video showing a passionate couple in
bed.
	   But some recipients are saying ``oh, no.''
	   ``I was really alarmed and wondered whether I should call the
police,'' recipient Therese Tagesson was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Smaalaenningen.
	   The video was sent to about 120,000 Swedes who will have their
first chance to vote in a national election on Sept. 20. The packet
containing the tape showed no return address.
	   After the opening scene of the couple in bed, a number of young
people appear in quick-cut music-video style, talking about their
''first time.'' Then Mona Sahlin, a top party figure, comes on to
talk about first-time voting.
	   The video's intent was to present politics ``with a glint in the
eye. ... Those who consider it pornographic must have awfully drab
lives,'' party youth wing chairman Niklas Nordstroem was quoted as
saying Wednesday by the Swedish news agency TT.

Palestinians: Israel's claim it accepted pullback is a ruse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prison escape in final grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A claim by a powerful Israeli Cabinet minister
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed in principle to
hand over 14 percent of the West Bank is a ruse aimed at deflecting
U.S. pressure, a Palestinian negotiator said Wednesday.
	   Ariel Sharon, a hawk in Netanyahu's Cabinet, said Tuesday that
the Israel government has quietly accepted a U.S. proposal to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank now and hand over an
additional 1 percent in a later pullback.
	   Sharon opposes the U.S. plan, saying it would endanger Israel's
security. It is believed Sharon made the claim to embarrass
Netanyahu and invite new pressure from Cabinet hardliners.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said Wednesday that Israel
has indeed offered to withdraw from 13 percent, but on condition
that 3 percent of that area be declared a ``nature reserve'' in
which the Palestinians would have virtually no say over land use.
	   ``So what Mr. Sharon is saying is nothing but an act of
deception,'' Shaath said, noting that the Palestinians already
rejected the idea when it was first raised last month.
	   A 1 percent pullback in a later stage also falls far short of
minimal Palestinian demands, Shaath said.
	   Sharon charged Tuesday that the Palestinians had raised new
difficulties _ such as claims that Israel was not allocating enough
water to the West Bank _ in order to invite U.S. pressure and
squeeze more concessions from Israel.
	   Shaath countered that Sharon was trying to shift blame from
Israel to the Palestinians for the prolonged deadlock in the
negotiations.
	   The Israeli offer, as portrayed by Sharon, would leave Israel
still in control of 60 percent of the West Bank, Shaath said. ``He
(Sharon) knows we will reject this and hopes that this would get
the blame off Israel and on us,'' he said.
	   In other developments Wednesday, Israeli troops demolished a
Palestinian home near the West Bank town of Hebron because it was
built without a permit.
	   The six-member family living in the home scuffled with soldiers,
and two women were taken to a nearby hospital with bruises.
	   ``This is terrorism, and I say it in front of everyone that I
will be the next (suicide) bomber in Israel because I have nothing
to lose,'' said the homeowner, Atta Jaber, 33.
	   Since the start of the year, Israel has demolished 112 homes in
the West Bank and 14 in Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.
Israel says it is merely enforcing building regulations. The
Palestinians claim Israel is trying to limit population growth in
disputed areas where it wants to cement its control.
	   The United States has called on Israel to refrain from
demolishing homes and expanding Jewish West Bank settlements.
	   Also Wednesday, two Palestinians escaped from a Palestinian
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho. Army radio reported that
one of the escaped prisoners was 17-year-old Iyad Mohammed Abu
Shabab, who is accused of killing an Israeli taxi driver and was
sentenced to 17 years with hard labor a year ago.
	   The escape comes a week after Hamas leader Imad Awadallah
escaped from a Jericho prison, prompting a massive manhunt during
which Palestinian police conducted house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.

Zeman's cabinet survives vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The center-left cabinet of Premier
Milos Zeman survived a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday
after some opposition deputies walked out.
	   A total of 73 deputies voted in favor of the cabinet, with 39
against and 24 abstentions. A simple majority of 69 of the 136
deputies present was needed to carry the motion in the 200-seat
legislature.
	   ``Let me say that the Parliament expressed its confidence in the
new cabinet,'' said Petra Buzkova who chaired the legislature's
vote.
	   The one-party minority cabinet was appointed by President Vaclav
Havel on July 22.
	   According to the Czech constitution, the new government has to
undergo a vote of confidence in parliament to show it has enough
political power to implement its program.
	   The survival of the government was ensured by a toleration pact
signed last month with the strongest opposition group, the Civic
Democratic Party, led by former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Under the pact, the Civic Democratic Party allowed the Social
Democrats to win by pulling out all of its 63 deputies during the
vote.
	   Zeman's cabinet is the first center-left government since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   In foreign policy, Zeman's priorities do not differ from those
of previous governments, stressing integration with NATO and the
European Union.
	   His economic priorities are more controversial, such as
restarting economic growth through support to local industry.
Critics suspect him of lavish spending in favor of big companies
and giving too much power to trade unions, while privatization is
slowed down.
	   A three-party coalition government led by Klaus collapsed last
November and was replaced by an interim government designed to lead
the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   The Social Democrats emerged as the winners of the ballot,
gaining 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature. Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party came in a close second.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, which
hold a total of 39 seats in parliament, voted against the cabinet,
citing disagreement with the government's policies.

Government launches awareness day for turn of century computer

problems &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ With 500 days left to the next
millennium, South Africa on Wednesday launched a national campaign
to warn the country of impending computer problems.
	   A special government center says South Africa ranks among the
world's top five countries in terms of preparedness for the
so-called Y2K problems, but it still has a long way to go, said
Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo
earlier this week.
	   The year 2000 problem affects many computers because they were
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year. Those
programs will be baffled when the year 2000 arrives.
	   ``Lack of resources is the most serious problem we have in South
Africa today with regard to the Y2K problem, '' Naidoo said.
	   The upgrading work could cost the South African economy up to 30
billion rand (dlrs 4.8 billion).
	   Only two national government departments are fully compliant:
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office and the Labor Department,
according to the government's Year 2000 National Support Center.
	   While larger companies in the financial sector are nearly
compliant, concern focuses on smaller and medium-sized enterprises,
where less than 10 percent of the country's 800,000 such businesses
are ready for Y2K.
	   Naidoo said the companies represent one third of South Africa's
gross domestic product.
	   Fuad Udemans, a top executive at the Y2K center, told The
Associated Press that South Africa would join with the United
States and England to set up an international coordinating team to
help other countries.
	   Udemans met last week with Y2K advisors for U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   With World Bank support, South Africa has invited 13 other
countries in the Southern African Development Community to attend a
special workshop on Thursday and Friday in Cape Town.
	   Following Tunisia's lead, South Africa is also considering
legislation to prevent the dumping of non compliant computer
equipment from abroad.

Germany's opposition puts intellectual spin on campaign
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Surrounded by some of Europe's cultural elite,
German opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder sought
Wednesday to put an intellectual spin on a campaign that so far has
focused almost exclusively on economic renewal.
	   The gathering reflected both Schroeder's desire for the solid
intellectual backing enjoyed by the Social Democrats during Willy
Brandt's 1972 campaign, as well as the hope of the assembled
artists that political change in Germany would promote a European
cultural identity.
	   Schroeder, arriving late after promoting a pragmatic economic
platform in an appearance with his economic minister-designate,
seized the mood.
	   ``There's a general feeling of lack of perspective, that
(Chancellor Helmut) Kohl's government is burned out, that it is
unable to pull together creative forces,'' Schroeder said.
	   Still, few of the dozens of artists, writers and intellectuals
present _ from British actor Ben Kingsley to Nobel laureate Elie
Wiesel _ expressed direct interest in the outcome of the German
election.
	   At most, the gathered elite's shared political vision was one of
change.
	   A manifesto adopted by the group representing 300 European
intellectuals sounded an optimistic note about the leftists' sweep
into power in Italy, Britain and France.
	   ``It is important that we also achieve in Germany a political
change to implement gradually in European cooperation the visions
of a democratic, social and lively cultural Europe,'' the manifesto
said.
	   Former French Culture Minister Jack Lang went the furthest to
promote Schroeder's candidacy, suggesting a Social Democratic
government would promote a coherent cultural agenda in Europe.
	   ``Perhaps it's a question of generations. Schroeder and (Social
Democratic chairman Oskar) Lafontaine could stand for renewal,''
said Lang, who was in office under Kohl's close personal friend and
ally, Francois Mitterrand.
	   ``We feel the moment has come, not only in Germany, to give new
youthfulness to the Europe that has been built up from the rubble
of the war, to build a new destiny of culture.''
	   Whether Schroeder's campaign will succeed in gaining the
enthusiastic backing of Germany's intellectual elite remains to be
seen.
	   When asked to describe his cultural politics, Schroeder says he
will promote dialogue between artists and politicians. The
strongest signal he has given about his commitment to the arts has
been to designate a culture czar, Michael Naumann.
	   Author Guenther Grass, who campaigned actively for Brandt in
1972, is backing the Social Democrats again, but only indirectly.
	   He did not participate in the event, and is campaigning for the
Greens to promote the likelihood of a Social Democratic-Greens
coalition after the Sept. 27 election.
	   Even one of the organizers, graphic artist Klaus Staeck, said
the event wasn't about getting Schroeder elected, but about ending
the conservative era.
	   ``We're fighting for a new politics,'' Staeck said.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Wednesday that they were ready to negotiate a
cease-fire with the embattled government.
	   This was the first time the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi
fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's
army _ have indicated they were willing to talk with Kabila, a man
they accuse of usurping power, promoting corruption and tribalism.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila, as long as Mr. Kabila recognizes there
is a fire,'' Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, told reporters in the
eastern town of Goma.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden change in rebel tactics,
who have so far rejected any negotiations with the government in
Congo, the former Zaire.
	   The rebels took up arms Aug. 2 and swept through eastern Congo,
flew in troops to the Atlantic Ocean port of Kitona and were
approaching the capital Kinshasa in a pincer movement.
	   Rebel forces were moving Wednesday to take Mbanza-Ngungu, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Also Wednesday, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Zambia declared
their support for Kabila against the rebels. Only Zimbabwe
announced it was sending troops, but gave no details.
	   But Karaha warned Zimbabwe against intervening in what he said
was Congolese affair.
	   ``Nobody can find a military solution to the Congolese
problem,'' Karaha said. ``Any foreign intervention in Congo will
have one and only consequence: to fight and resist.''
	   Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which both played
instrumental roles in helping Kabila topple the government of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, of staging the
rebellion and fighting alongside the rebels.
	   Relations have soured among the former allies since Kabila took
power, and it is widely believed that those countries are providing
some support to the new rebel movement. They have denied
involvement.
	   Karaha gave no details or timetable for any negotiations.
	   He said Kabila would first have to recognize the rebel movement
before any talks could begin.
	   ``Kabila doesn't even recognize that we exist. Maybe he'll
recognize that we exist once we'll be in Kinshasa,'' Karaha said.
``Whether Kabila should remain president or not is part of the
negotiations. He's a part of the problem so he should be part of
the solution too.''
	   Karaha said any country with interest in Congo was welcome to
mediate.
	   ``Anyone who has the interest of the people of Congo in their
hearts should be the mediator in the problem,'' he said.

Investigators ask Guatemalan president for information on bishop's
</HEADLINE>
death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Investigators have asked Guatemalan
President Alvaro Arzu to release a report on ``all that he knows''
about the April slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Chief prosecutor Otto Ardon said the president should explain
why he told reporters last week that ``there would be surprises''
in the case.
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death on April 26, two
days after he delivered a report critical of the army's human
rights record during Guatemala's 1960-96 civil war.
	   A priest who has been arrested in the slaying, the Rev. Mario
Orantes, maintains he is innocent.
	   Meanwhile, the church's Human Rights Office of the Archbishop
asked investigators to hear testimony from a ``key witness'' who
could show the crime was politically motivated. The witness, whose
name was not released, lives in San Jose, Costa Rica, the office
said.
	   The office also asked that Gerardi's body be exhumed to
determine whether marks on his body might be bite wounds from
Orantes' German shepherd, as Spanish researchers have suggested.

Racial motive alleged in dog killings in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Officials of the ruling
African National Congress said Wednesday that racism prompted white
farmers and police to kill 86 hunting dogs allegedly used by blacks
on disputed land.
	   ``They would not have killed the dogs if the owners had been
white,'' Dumisani Makhaye, an ANC official in KwaZulu-Natal
province, said in a telephone interview. ``In this country, people
take the law into their own hands.''
	   The dogs belonged to 56 blacks who were arrested on Sunday by
security forces for allegedly killing wild animals on land owned by
white farmers, the Natal Witness newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``We were under the impression that the farm had become state
property,'' one of the hunters, Bongani Dladla, was quoted as
saying.
	   White farmers said the dogs had been causing problems for years.
	   ``This operation comes at the end of 20 years of organized
poaching in the area, which has virtually destroyed game farming
here,'' said farmer Peter Gill.
	   He said the alleged poachers had eight to 10 game carcasses when
they were caught.
	   The Bellevue farm where the dog killings occurred is to be
transferred to 42 black families as part of the post-apartheid
government's efforts to redistribute land, Land Affairs planner
Peter Sapsford told the newspaper.

 &UR; Northern Ireland buries dead, as Dublin unveils new `draconian'
laws &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-NIreland-One Funeral
 &UR; Eds: NEW for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish government announced a
``draconian'' tightening of its anti-terrorist laws Wednesday, as
Catholics and Protestants united to lay to rest 16 victims of
Northern Ireland's deadliest terrorist strike.
	   Hearses followed by columns of grief-stricken residents snaked
their way slowly through the bomb-ravaged center of Omagh as
Northern Ireland suffered through the most funerals in one day in
its bloody history.
	   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced plans to wipe
out the Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted Saturday's car
bomb that killed 28 and wounded 220.
	   Ahern said he considered his government's initiatives
``extremely draconian,'' but that he was not prepared to risk more
attacks by the dissidents, dubbed the ``Real IRA.''
	   The group refuses to adhere to the IRA's July 1997 truce and
announced Wednesday only that it had ``suspended'' its bombing
campaign in light of the Omagh carnage, which it called
unintentional.
	   The proposals approved by an emergency session of Ahern's
Cabinet _ most of which already are in place in Northern Ireland _
included restricting the right to bail for suspected terrorists,
allowing judges to infer guilt if a suspect refuses to answer a
question, and extending the potential incarceration of suspects
without charge from 48 to 96 hours.
	   People also could be convicted of belonging to outlawed groups
if a senior detective testifies they are members.
	   Ahern said the measures would be made law within two weeks to
defend both Northern Ireland's peace agreement ``and the people of
both parts of this island from attack by groups who have no
legitimacy whatsoever.''
	   With a tone of controlled anger, he noted his visit Tuesday to
the Irish Republic town of Buncrana, where three bomb victims
ranging in age from 8 to 12 were buried Wednesday.
	   ``When you stand ... in a room with the body of a young boy, a
beautiful young boy, who should be out playing football on what was
a fine day, who should be looking forward to seeing his boyhood
dreams come true ... his life should not have been shattered by the
twisted ideology of faceless cowards,'' Ahern said. ``It brings
home to you what you're dealing with.''
	   Seeking to soften the threatened crackdown, the dissidents _ who
began planting car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in February in
hopes of poisoning the Belfast peace talks _ had announced the
suspension of what they called ``all military operations'' pending
internal debate on future strategy.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, common-law wife of Michael McKevitt,
the man reputed to lead the Real IRA, told Irish radio that she was
pleased with the group's announcement.
	   ``I have already condemned it and we could not condone it,'' she
said of the Omagh attack, which she added had nothing to do with
her or McKevitt.
	   Local reports said the couple had moved from their home in the
Irish Republic border town of Dundalk for fear of attacks.
	   Politicians on both sides heaped scorn on the Real IRA
statement.
	   ``It's too late for those who were massacred,'' said Pat
Doherty, vice president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   And Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant
first minister of Northern Ireland's new cross-community government
established by the agreement, called the statement ``pretty
contemptible'' and untrustworthy.
	   On Wednesday, soldiers erected a steel wall at the Market Street
crossroads where the 500-pound (225 kg) car bomb detonated.
	   That blocked the destruction from the view of the mile-long
funeral processions that passed silently through the town center en
route from churches to cemeteries.
	   Those businesses that weren't damaged by the bomb closed for the
day, pinning messages and floral tributes to their front doors.
	   And at every funeral, pews filled to overflowing and hundreds
stood outside in the rain as entire communities _ Protestant and
Catholic alike _ rallied behind the families.
	   ``In our terrible experience of the last 30 years, Omagh was the
worst atrocity of them all,'' said retired Catholic Bishop Edward
Daly.
	   ``Is it too much to ask or too much to hope that it will be the
last atrocity of all?'' he asked at the Requiem Mass for
21-month-old Breda Devine.
	   The oldest victim, 65-year-old Mary Grimes, was buried in her
village of Beragh, southeast of Omagh. Her daughter, Avril
Monaghan, and 18-month-old granddaughter Maura had been buried
Tuesday.
	   The remaining eight burials will take place Thursday.
	   ``The efforts made in recent days to offer an explanation show
that the bombers realize that something went terribly wrong. But
they need to go further,'' said Archbishop Sean Brady, who oversees
Ireland's 4 million Roman Catholics.
	   ``They need to realize that their whole campaign is utterly
wrong, totally evil, and completely devoid of justification,'' he
said. ``How could the murder of baby Maura, of baby Breda Devine,
of 8-year-old Oran Doherty, of nine teenagers, 12 adult women, four
adult men _ all of them innocent victims _ be other than something
very evil?''

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron of France set a
European record of 10.73 seconds to win the gold medal in the
women's 100-meter dash at the European Championship on Wednesday.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best. Dwain Chambers snatched the silver in 10.10, while
Charalambos Papadias of Greece took the bronze in 10.17.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles.
	   Arron, 24, had already claimed a championship record of 10.81 in
the semifinals earlier in the afternoon.
	   The Frenchwoman with the orange-colored hair trailed Irina
Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start. But with her powerful
stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the last 20 meters and
stripped the Russian of the title and the European record.
	   ``After the semifinal I thought I had a good shot at the gold
medal with a good start,'' Arron said. ``Ironically, I got the gold
and the European record as well, even with a fairly poor start.''
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Arron benefited from a tail wind of 2 meters per second, the
legal limit.
	   ``It was a difficult race for me because Privalova had a very
good start,'' Arron said.
	   Privalova's record was 10.77, set July 6, 1994.
	   Privalova, coming off a hamstring injury, clocked 10.83 to win
the silver in her fastest race this year.
	   ``After such a long injury and an operation, I really could not
have asked for more but this,'' Privalova said.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   The only woman to run faster this year is U.S. star Marion
Jones, who had twice clocked 10.71 and 10.72.
	   Arron, who was born in Guadeloupe, first caught attention when
she finished fourth in last year's worlds. She is the only
consistent sub-11 seconds European sprinter this year and looks the
only woman capable of challenging Jones, the world champion.
	   Zhanna Pantusevich of Ukraine, the world 200 champion, placed
fourth in 10.92, as four sprinters finished under 11 seconds.
	   Kiril Sosunov of Russia cleared 8.28 meters to win the gold
medal in the men's long jump. All three medalists cleared 8 meters.
Bogdan Tarus of Romania captured the silver at 8.21, while Petko
Dachev of Bulgaria won the bronze with a leap of 8.06.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, double world cross-country
champion, won the women's 10,000 meters with a powerful finish in
the last 200 meters.
	   ``I guess it's time for a Guiness or two now,'' O'Sullivan said.
She said she may go for a double and run the 5,000 as well.
	   O'Sullivan posted a time of 31 minutes, 29.33 seconds to beat
Olympic champion and defending titlist Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal, who took the silver in 31:32.42.
	   Lidia Simon of Romania captured the bronze in 31:32.64.
	   There was joy for the home crowd when Tibor Gescek led a 1-2
Hungarian finish in the men's hammer throw. Gescek, who came off a
two-year doping ban last year, captured the gold with a heave of
82.87 meters, the third longest in the world this year.
	   Olympic champion Balazs Kiss took the silver at 81.26. Karsten
Kobs of Germany won the bronze with a throw of 80.13.
	   Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a throw of 69.10 meters in
her first attempt to win the gold medal in the women's javelin.
	   Damaske, 26, bronze medalist at last year's World Championship,
gave Germany its first gold medal of the European event. Her
winning distance was third in the world this year. She also has the
season's best of 70.10.
	   Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia took the silver medal at 66.92,
while Mikaela Ingberg clinched the bronze at 64.92, saving the day
for the powerful Finnish team.
	   Stephane Diagana of France, the world champion, tripped over a
hurdle and failed to qualify for the final of the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Diagana knocked down the next-to-last hurdle and tumbled to the
ground while leading his semifinal heat. He got up, but was unable
to finish. The Frenchman has been nursing a leg injury.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.

Work begins on exhuming frozen graves in search of deadly virus

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ One by one, as gently as they could,
experts Wednesday removed six wooden crosses marking a frozen mass
grave that may contain the secret of one of the deadliest epidemics
of modern times.
	   It was the start of the four-nation team's effort to exhume the
bodies of six young coal miners who were among the 20 to 40 million
victims of a virus called the Spanish Flu. The virus spread death
in 1918 and 1919, and vanished.
	   The miners were buried in the permafrost of this Norwegian
Arctic outpost, and the researchers believe that depp-freeze burial
may have preserved samples of the mysterious virus.
	   The team hopes to build a genetic profile of the virus. Doing so
could help in developing flu vaccines.
	   Even though experts say there is virtually no chance of finding
a live virus in the old graves, they have decided to open the
graves under extremely tight precautions.
	   An inflatable tent will cover the pit, and the few experts
allowed in will enter through an air lock, like on a space ship.
	   Team members will wear isolation suits, have outside air
supplies and even take an experimental anti-viral drug.
	   Before the work started, team leader Kirsty Duncan, a
31-year-old medical geographer, called for a moment of silence and
a prayer for the victims.
	   ``We are gathered here to remember and honor these young men,''
Duncan said during brief ceremony. ``We are extremely grateful to
the families of these young men for allowing us to undertake our
work.''
	   Each wooden cross, plus one stone marker, from the row was
pulled from the sparse grass of the tundra. Each was carefully
wrapped in burlap, and labeled with the victims' names by workers
from the British Necropolis Company, which is doing the actual
exhumation for the team.
	   ``This a big day and a difficult day,'' said Duncan, who has
been working for five years on the riddle of the Spanish Flu. ``We
have to remember that these were people, and they had families. ...
We are only doing this in the hope of unraveling the mystery of the
1918 flu.
	   Exhuming the bodies, taking tissue samples and reburying them is
expected to take about three weeks. Analysis of the tissue samples
could take as much as 18 months.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what is now Ft. Riley,
Kansas in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread to Europe with
American troops sent to fight in World War I. From there, it spread
to much of the world.
	   At first, it was much like other viruses. But viruses change
rapidly and by the autumn of 1918 it had turned much more deadly,
with the death rate increasing sevenfold, according to Tom Bergan,
a Norwegian physician on the team. Victims suffered a sudden fever,
chills, headache, malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Duncan, a professor at the Universities of Windsor and Toronto
in Canada, read about the Spanish Flu in a book and started a
search for clues that eventually led her to Longyearbyen, a town of
1,200 people on the largely glacier-covered Svalbard Archipelago.
The islands are north of the Norwegian mainland and just 950
kilometers (500 miles) from the North Pole.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, four wounded

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Wednesday after an Israeli
soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla attack.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
of Mlita, a village in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a Hezbollah
stronghold just across from an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
the south, Lebanese officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (1.8 miles) further north from the village of Rihan
where an Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a
guerrilla ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   It was not known whether there were any casualties from the
10:30 a.m. (0730GMT) raid.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah antiaircraft guns fired at the
raiding jets, but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli warplane later fired a single air-to-surface missile
in a second raid on a base used by the radical Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but witnesses saw
three ambulances rushing to the base and quickly leaving with
sirens wailing.
	   The base at Naameh is 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut.
	   The group is a staunch opponent of Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreements and a close ally of Syria and Iran.
	   Military officials in Israel confirmed the first air strike and
said that one soldier was killed and four wounded in the guerrilla
attack.
	   That air raid came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an
armored Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security
officials said.

	   PONTA DELGADA, Azores Islands (AP) _ Two second-half goals in
the space of three minutes by Rui Costa gave Portugal a 2-1 win
over Mozambique in an exhibition game Wednesday.
	   After a ragged first-half performance during which it was
repeatedly pressured by Mozambique's counter-attacks, Portugal
emerged from the break looking more polished.
	   Costa, who plays with Italian club Fiorentina, opened the
scoring after 50 minutes, tapping in from close range following
Luis Figo's burst down the right flank.
	   Portugal shifted up a gear and Costa notched his second in a
goalmouth scramble.
	   As the home side eased off the pace, substitute Artur sneaked
unmarked into the Portuguese penalty area to meet a cross and
sidefoot the ball past goalie Vitor Baia after 77 minutes.

Hunting deadly sport in France, and not just for animals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Hunting can be a deadly sport in France _ and not
just for animals. Bikers, hikers and hunters themselves are falling
victim in greater numbers, figures from the National Hunting Office
show.
	   The office's latest report showed that 45 people were killed in
hunting accidents from July 1997 to February 1998, the biggest
number of deaths from hunting in the past 20 years.
	   Those figures covered the period from July 1997 to February
1998, said the National Hunting Office, which said it was
``extremely worried'' about the deadly trend.
	   About 90 percent of the victims were hunters themselves and 40
percent of those killed or wounded had injured themselves with
their own weapons, said the report, which was released this week.
	   Among the other victims were bikers and hikers who were mistaken
for quarry. Several children were among the victims.
	   France is a country of avid hunters, and 1.7 people are
officially registered shooters. This year's hunting season began
July 14 and will run through Feb. 28, 1999.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Abroad, President Laurent Kabila has won
key diplomatic and military support for his war against advancing
rebels, successes that were quickly followed Wednesday by a rebel
offer to negotiate a cease-fire.
	   Defense ministers from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Angola
pledged to help Kabila _ a move that threatens to embroil much of
the region in Congo's two-week old rebel war.
	   But the show of support for Congo's embattled government was
followed by a sign that the rebels may be willing to negotiate a
truce with their sworn enemies.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila, as long as Mr. Kabila recognizes there
is a fire,'' said Bizima Karaha, a former minister in the Congo
government who has turned rebel leader.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the rebels' apparent
change of heart _ they had earlier refused to negotiate with
Kabila, whom they accused of corruption and mismanagement.
	   At home in Kinshasa, the Congolese government faces rising
unrest.
	   Gunfire rattled through Kinshasa's main prison Wednesday morning
as government troops fought to put down an uprising of inmates _
most them Kabila's political opponents _ who smuggled arms into the
facility.
	   Troops now patrol tense streets, where anger and fear blends
into a volatile mix.
	   In a show of support for Kabila, several hundred students
marched down the city's main June 30th Boulevard.
	   ``We will crush the aggressors,'' one protesters shouted. ``We
are behind President Kabila.''

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Wednesday that they were ready to negotiate a
cease-fire with the embattled government.
	   This was the first time the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi
fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's
army _ have indicated they were willing to talk with Kabila, a man
they accuse of usurping power, promoting corruption and tribalism.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila, as long as Mr. Kabila recognizes there
is a fire,'' Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, told reporters in the
eastern town of Goma.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden change in rebel tactics,
who have so far rejected any negotiations with the government in
Congo, the former Zaire.
	   The rebels took up arms Aug. 2 and swept through eastern Congo,
flew in troops to the Atlantic Ocean port of Kitona and were
approaching the capital Kinshasa in a pincer movement.
	   Rebel forces were moving Wednesday to take Mbanza-Ngungu, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Also Wednesday, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Zambia declared
their support for Kabila against the rebels. Only Zimbabwe
announced it was sending troops, but gave no details.
	   But Karaha warned Zimbabwe against intervening in what he said
was Congolese affair.
	   ``Nobody can find a military solution to the Congolese
problem,'' Karaha said. ``Any foreign intervention in Congo will
have one and only consequence: to fight and resist.''
	   ``The more Zimbabwe tries to come in, the more Zimbabwe will put
this struggle in high gear. What will happen after that, people who
intervened will pay the consequences,'' Karaha said.
	   Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which both played
instrumental roles in helping Kabila topple the government of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, of staging the
rebellion and fighting alongside the rebels.
	   Relations have soured among the former allies since Kabila took
power, and it is widely believed that those countries are providing
some support to the new rebel movement. They have denied
involvement.
	   Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, heading a four-country
peace mission to Congo, held talks with the rebels in Goma on
Wednesday.
	   Karaha and Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said they were surprised by the
Zimbabwean decision to intervene in Kabila's support only day after
the talks agreed to pursue a political solution.
	   ``I don't believe any responsible government will come to help
the dictatorship,'' Karaha said. ``To do what? Against the will of
Congolese people?''

Council working to back Contact Group's efforts in Kosovo

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that violence in Kosovo between
Serbs and separatist Albanians could destabilize the area and
create a humanitarian disaster, the Security Council worked
Wednesday to back diplomatic efforts to bring the two sides
together for talks.
	   Council members were considering a draft statement that welcomed
the creation of an ethnic Albanian negotiating team that ``should
lead to the early commencement of a substantial dialogue with the
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   Consultations on the draft were expected to continue Thursday.
	   Hundreds have been killed since a Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists was launched in late February. The United
Nations now estimates that the fighting has created more than
231,000 refugees.
	   The Security Council has taken relatively little action on
Kosovo, preferring to let U.S. envoys, NATO and the Contact Group _
made up of the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy _ take the lead in resolving the conflict.
	   A council statement was intended to support their efforts,
diplomats said.
	   The ethnic Albanian negotiating team is headed by politician
Ibrahim Rugova, who favors pacifist tactics for resolving the
crisis.
	   The team doesn't include representatives of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been fighting for independence of the
Serbian province where Albanians account for 90 percent of the
population of 2 million.
	   On Tuesday, the ethnic Albanian delegation spurned an offer by
the Serbs to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must
first cease and tens of thousands of Albanian civilians must be
allowed to return to their homes.
	   In its draft statement, the council said it was ``gravely
concerned that given the increasing numbers of displaced persons,
coupled with the approaching winter, the situation in Kosovo has
the potential to become an even greater humanitarian disaster.''
	   The council calls for an immediate cease-fire and ``emphasizes
that the issue of Kosovo can have no military solution,'' the draft
said.
	   Council members said they feared that the ``continuation or
further escalation of the conflict in Kosovo has dangerous
implications for the stability of the region.''

Sierra Leone rebel leader faces trial amid massacre threats

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ One of Sierra Leone's most feared
warlords will stand trial for crimes against humanity despite rebel
threats of a mass killing campaign unless he is released from
custody, officials said Wednesday.
	   Foday Sankoh, who triggered Sierra Leone's descent into civil
war in 1991, will appear in court to face charges of ``crimes
against humanity and the people of Sierra Leone,'' according to a
government broadcast on state-controlled radio.
	   The statement follows a warning by Revolutionary United Front
leader Eldred Collins that rebels will launch a campaign known as
``Operation Spare No One'' aimed at ``killing all Sierra Leoneans''
unless Sankoh is released.
	   Collins, who made the threat on Monday in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corporation, is himself being sought by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government for war-related crimes.
	   ``Orders have been given to the security forces to chase and
capture the RUF's Eldred Collins,'' the government statement said.
``His statements are regarded as a threat to all Sierra Leoneans
for the sake of one man.''
	   Sankoh was arrested last year in Nigeria on gun-running charges
and returned in handcuffs to Sierra Leone last month. If convicted,
he faces death by hanging or firing squad.
	   The government has charged dozens of alleged junta collaborators
with treason. In the first such case against 18 prominent
civilians, a 12-member jury began deliberations on Wednesday to
decide on a verdict.
	   The rebels, along with members of a junta force ousted in
February, have reportedly killed, maimed and kidnapped thousands of
villagers in the interior of the West African country in recent
months.
	   The junta was ousted in a military operation by a Nigerian-led
West African intervention force that paved the way for Kabbah's
return from exile in March.
	   On Monday, the rebels launched an attack on the town of Njala
Nimikon in the eastern diamond-rich Kono district in which eight
civilians were killed and 12 others injured, authorities said.

Bus driver shoots ticketless passenger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A driver of one of the Lithuanian
capital's trolleybuses shot a passenger who was trying to ride
without a ticket, the Baltic News Service reported Wednesday.
	   The 24-year-old victim, whose name was not given, was shot in
the leg, BNS said. His condition was not immediately known.
	   According to the report, driver Gintaras Dzengelevicius had
stopped the bus to check passengers for tickets on Tuesday. When he
found the man riding without one, the two scuffled, then the
passenger fled and the driver pursued him on foot and shot him, BNS
said.
	   Dzengelevicius has a license to carry a weapon and no charges
were immediately filed, BNS said.

Islamic militant coalition warns Americans of new attacks

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A coalition of Islamic militant groups
warned in a statement published Wednesday that ``strikes will
continue from everywhere'' against the United States.
	   The communique from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders, formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden in February, was printed in the London-based daily Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate similar to that of the Soviet Union,'' the
statement said. ``Strikes will continue from everywhere, and
Islamic groups will appear one after the other to fight American
interests.''
	   The Jihad front is believed to be a coalition of six
fundamentalist groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its
statement was sent Tuesday to Al-Hayat's bureau in Cairo.
	   Al-Hayat said it came with three other statements from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the two deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7.
	   In one statement, the Holy Shrines group said it would
``continue shipping more American dead bodies to their unjust
government ... until we humiliate America's arrogance and roll its
dignity in the mud of defeat.''
	   The group had not been heard of before the explosions in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left 257 people
dead and more than 5,500 injured. Among the dead were 12 Americans.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said the
administration was unable to say whether the threats were credible.
	   ``Naturally, we'll be watching closely and taking prudent
security measures,'' he said.

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken to
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz about the impasse over
weapons inspections in Iraq and has met with the Security Council
to discuss the problem, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
	   Annan spoke to Aziz by phone from Lisbon, where the
secretary-general was visiting last week, the officials said,
speaking on condition they not be named. Word of his involvement
comes as some members of the council have asked for the U.N.
chief's personal intervention to try to break the standoff.
	   ``It's our view that the Iraqis repudiated the Memorandum of
Understanding,'' which Annan brokered in February to give
inspectors access to presidential palaces, U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson said Wednesday.
	   ``And we believe that with his skill and his diplomatic efforts,
they should be engaged again to resolve this crisis,'' he said.
	   U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday that Annan was now
willing to discuss a possible role for himself with the council
following his envoy's recent failed attempt to persuade Baghdad to
resume cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   The secretary-general is prepared to ``see what it is they want
him to do and whether he thinks it will make a difference,''
Eckhard said.
	   He has already met with council members in closed sessions to
discuss his view of the standoff, Eckhard said.
	   Inspectors have held off conducting any searches since Iraq
announced on Aug. 5 that it was freezing cooperation with the
United Nations.
	   The weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction before the council will lift harsh
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf War.
	   The council was to conduct its regular, 60-day review of Iraqi
sanctions on Thursday, but there wasn't expected to be any change
in the regime, council diplomats said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Sergei Rebrov scored two first-half goals
and paced Ukraine to a 4-0 victory over Georgia on Thursday in a
prep match for both sides for the upcoming European Championship
qualifying.
	   The Dynamo Kiev forward gave Ukraine the lead less than a minute
after kickoff and added a second three minutes before halftime.
Midfielder Sergei Skachenko increased the lead in 57th minute and
Sergei Kovalyov completed the rout in 75th minute.
	   Both sides are getting ready for their first matches in
qualifying for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Georgia faces Albania at home on Sept. 5, the same day Ukraine
hosts Russia.

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - A court fined a British tourist 500
pounds (dlrs 1,100) and gave him a suspended three-month jail
sentence Wednesday for driving a jet ski recklessly and injuring
two teen-age British women tourists.
	   David Whitworth, 22, of Barnsley, pleaded guilty to the offense.
	   Last Monday, Whitworth drove a jet ski off the tourist resort of
Ayia Napa into a ``banana boat'' - an inflatable raft towed by a
speedboat. Two of the passengers on the raft, Michelle Margaret
Brandon and Lauren Sarah Schneider, both 19-year-old Londoners,
were seriously injured.

Finland says Home Office homicide report incorrect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Finnish Embassy on Wednesday disputed a
British Home Office report saying Helsinki had the second-highest
homicide rate in Europe.
	   On Wednesday, the Home Office released figures that listed
Helsinki behind only Moscow, with a rate of 12.5 homicides per
100,000 population.
	   But Erja Tikka, the embassy's press officer, said the numbers
used for Helsinki were incorrect. He said the numbers supplied by
the Finnish government to the Home Office included not only
murders, but also attempted murders.
	   The accurate figure for homicide rates in Helsinki was 3.05 per
100,000 of population, Tikka said, which would make Helsinki safer
than Moscow, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Geneva, Copenhagen, Berlin and
Paris.

Three boys' funeral a focus for grief _ and shame _ of a nation

 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL;

	   BUNCRANA, Ireland (AP) _ The sight of three half-sized coffins,
and the three broken families behind them, produced a trail of
tears and anguished wails Wednesday never seen before in this
remote, peaceful corner of Ireland.
	   James Barker, 12, Oran Doherty, 8, and Shaun McLaughlin, 12 _
the three Irish Republic residents killed in Saturday's blast in
neighboring Northern Ireland _ were buried beside St. Mary's
Catholic Church after a ceremony attended by 8,000 citizens from
far and wide.
	   During Requiem Mass, prayers also were said in English, Gaelic
and Spanish for 12-year-old Fernando Bacelga and his 24-year-old
teacher Rocia Ramos, who died in the Omagh blast and whose remains
were flown home Tuesday to Madrid.
	   Tears flowed from the moment the coffins were carried
simultaneously from the homes of Shaun and Oran _ the latter's
draped in the green-and-white banner of Glasgow Celtic, the soccer
team he loved.
	   Four Celtic officials, including the coach and a player, flew
over from Scotland to help carry Oran's little casket.
	   Their procession linked up with mourners coming from the Barker
home, where the slain Fernando had been staying while attending a
summer-time English-language school.
	   James' parents had settled here last year from their native
England in search of a better lifestyle for their four children.
	   Victor Barker insisted he didn't want the bombers who killed his
son and 27 others caught and punished so long as they repented.
	   ``If only they see what they did was wrong, so wrong, and
promise never to do this again to any other children, that would
bring some peace of mind to my wife,'' he said.
	   Paying their condolences to the boys were Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, and David
Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and head of
Northern Ireland's new cross-community government.
	   Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon, also
attended, as did Irish President Mary McAleese and the ambassadors
of Britain and Spain.
	   In his sermon, Bishop Seamus Hegarty addressed Trimble and
Mallon personally, saying he knew getting British Protestants and
Irish Catholics to govern Northern Ireland together would not be
easy.
	   ``To Mr. Trimble, you are particularly welcome with your
entourage. We wish you well and a fair wind in all your
endeavours,'' Hegarty said, sparking applause from the
predominantly Catholic audience.
	   Buncrana's Omagh-born priest, the Rev. Shane Bradley, listed a
string of the worst terrorist attacks over the years, and said
Saturday's carnage eclipsed them as ``our saddest moment, our
darkest hour.''
	   Along with the sorrow ran an undercurrent of shame that Ireland
had proved so horrific for the country's Spanish guests.
	   About 40 Spaniards and local schoolkids had traveled to Omagh on
Saturday to tour a historical park and shop in the bustling town.
The bomb alert and evacuation, so pedestrian a feature of life to
Northern Ireland locals, proved a fatal attraction for the
tourists.
	   Only 16 escaped uninjured. Among the mourners Wednesday, several
Spanish students bore bandages over their shrapnel wounds and
perforated eardrums.
	   Referring to Ireland's tourist slogan of ``cead mile failte'' _
Gaelic for ``a hundred thousand welcomes'' _ the Rev. Donal McKeown
reflected: ``From the land of the welcomes, we have visited them
with our barbarity. God forgive us.''

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Formula One probably will return
to South Africa in 2001, Formula One Association president Bernie
Ecclestone said Wednesday.
	   The circuit has not staged in event in South Africa since 1993,
and has not regularly visited the country since the mid-1980s, when
the country came under an international sports ban because of
apartheid.
	   ``We have a contract to bring around the Formula One world
championship to South Africa, and as soon as we have a slot open on
the calendar that is what we are going to do,'' Ecclestone told
reporters after having lunch with President Nelson Mandela in
Pretoria. ``I think this is going to happen in the year 2001.''
	   The event would likely be held at the Kyalami track near
Johannesburg. Kyalami hosted 20 Grands Prix from 1967 to 1993.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The Zalgiris team, representing
Lithuania, beat the Belarus national team 3-0 on Wednesday in a
friendly international match.
	   The sides played evenly for most of the first half until the
Lithuanians mounted a fierce attack, with Andrey Orlovsky scoring
in the 41st minute. Three minutes later, teammate Vladimir Makovsky
drove in another goal.
	   Belarus regrouped in the second half and appeared poised to
score. But Maksim Romashenka put the game out of reach with a third
goal for Lithuania in the 78th minute.

Over 200 soccer fans injured, rioters set stadium gallery afire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Over 200 soccer fans were injured
Wednesday when the wooden gallery they had crammed at a stadium in
soccer-crazy Calcutta collapsed during the match, police said.
	   Over 130 people were admitted to city hospitals while the others
were given first aid on the grounds, senior police official Sujay
Chakravarty told reporters. Two people were serious, Chakravarty
said.
	   Soccer is Calcutta's favorite sport. Most of the country's top
soccer stars play for professional clubs in this eastern Indian
city.
	   Enraged fans tried to burn down the broken gallery and the press
box after the accident that occurred 20 minutes into the Tata Tea
Super League match between Mohammedan Sporting and Peerless,
eyewitnesses said.
	   Fire fighters quickly doused the fire and riot police
baton-charged the spectators, Chakravarty said.
	   The Indian Football Association has canceled all matches on the
Mohammedan Sporting Ground, where the match was being played.
Subhas Chakrabarty, sports minister of West Bengal state of which
Calcutta is the capital, ordered an inquiry into the accident,
officials said.
	   In 1975, a wooden gallery had collapsed on the same ground
during a match, killing a boy. In 1993, two men were permanently
disabled in a similar accident in the Mohan Bagan Grounds.

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Ganga Pandit dragged his wife and son
outside his small hut in the Himalayan village and started
clambering up the slopes. Across the valley, a furious river seemed
to have ripped open a mountain.
	   ``I saw a hill on the east of the village virtually bursting. It
was like a bomb exploding,'' said Pandit, the priest of the only
temple in Malpa village, which was ravaged early Tuesday morning by
a landslide in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
	   Torrents of muddy water and boulders rushed down the slopes and
the village was drowned within minutes. Villagers, who were a few
hours ago chatting with the pilgrims and posing for photographs,
were jolted from their sleep and rushed out of their houses
shrieking in panic.
	   ``I saw the water wipe out the entire pilgrim camp site and the
village,'' Pandit told The Associated Press by wireless phone from
a temporary center about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northeast of
Malpa.
	   ``Within minutes, the shouts and wails were drowned and all that
was heard was the gushing water,'' said Pandit, sobbing.
	   Officials said more than 200 people, including Hindu pilgrims
headed for the Kailash Manasarowar shrine in Tibet and villagers
were swept away by the landslide, which diverted the Kali River
that washed out the village.
	   The Kali normally passes over a ravine two kilometers (one mile)
from the village. But torrential rains sent it coursing through a
weak riverbank close to the village.

Study: Spermicide fails to protect against HIV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A study challenges the popular belief that
spermicides protect against AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
	   The research, conducted on prostitutes in Cameroon, found no
sign that combining the common spermicide nonoxynol 9 with condoms
worked any better than condoms alone.
	   The findings were first reported in Washington last year. They
are now being published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   The study was conducted on 1,292 HIV-negative prostitutes and
directed by Dr. Ronald E. Roddy of Family Health International of
Durham, North Carolina.
	   The women were given condoms and were randomly assigned to get
either a spermicide film or an inactive placebo film. They were
told to insert the film into their vaginas before intercourse and
to require their sex partners to use the condoms.
	   The study was conducted between March 1994 and December 1996.
Just under 7 percent of women in both groups became infected with
the AIDS virus during the course of the study. The spermicide also
did not reduce the risk of gonorrhea or chlamydia infection.
	   The research contradicts earlier work suggesting that nonoxynol
9 is moderately effective against gonorrhea and some other sexually
transmitted infections.
	   Tests in animals and test tubes have also shown signs that
spermicides can inactivate the AIDS virus, but studies in people
have produced conflicting results. A study of the contraceptive
sponge, conducted on prostitutes in Kenya, was stopped early
because users actually had a higher rate of AIDS infection.
	   Family Health International is a nonprofit research group that
focuses on improving reproductive health, primarily through
contraception and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deputy head of the U.N. refugee
agency Wednesday warned of a catastrophe in Kosovo unless there is
an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a political
settlement.
	   The current crisis ``would become a catastrophe during winter''
without such steps, said Soeren Jessen Petersen, a deputy to U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We have more than 200,000 (displaced Kosovars) now, but we
would have many, many people dying during the coming winter,''
Petersen said, adding it was up to the politicians ``to stop
that.''
	   ``Humanitarian action must not once again, as it happened in
Bosnia for four or five years, become a substitute for political
action,'' he said.
	   He cited a cessation of hostilities followed by a political
dialogue; more regular, better access and security; a return to
their homes of 170,000 people displaced inside Kosovo and 50,000
outside; and ``a better response to the (UNHCR) humanitarian
operation.''
	   Petersen's argument was supported by Emma Bonino, the human
rights commissioner for the European Union, who said, ``If there is
no political settlement we are moving very quickly from a
humanitarian crisis to a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   In an apparent response to the rising international criticism of
the Serb-led government over the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,
the official Tanjug news agency on Wednesday accused the Albanian
rebels of preventing the return of refugees to their homes.
	   Tanjug, which is the government mouthpiece, said that after
their military defeat, ``the Albanian terrorists, as well as the
political representatives, have pulled another card - alleged
humanitarian catastrophe.'' It alleged that the KLA had been using
civilians as human shields while fighting government forces.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Bonino was stopped by ethnic Albanian rebels,
who refused to allow her convoy to reach a disputed village, Cirez,
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Bonino's convoy was stopped at a checkpoint just outside
Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold, an Associated Press Television
crew traveling with Bonino said. She was told she could proceed
without the reporters, but she refused.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government sought an urgent meeting
with Yugoslav authorities after Serb mortars exploded across the
border.
	   The shelling, which the Albanians said lasted for two hours
Tuesday, prompted the evacuation of children and the elderly from
border communities.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, an Interior Ministry official
told The Associated Press that 15 mortars exploded about 1.5
kilometers (a mile) inside Albanian territory. There were no
casualties, he said.
	   The shelling fueled fears that the conflict in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence, could spread
throughout the southern Balkans.
	   U.S. envoys continue to try to arrange direct talks between the
Serb government and a Kosovo Albanian delegation formed last week
to bring the conflict to an end and chart the future of the
province.
	   On Tuesday, the Kosovo Albanians spurned an offer by the Serbs
to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must cease and tens
of thousands of Albanian civilians must be allowed to return to
their homes.
	   But Serbia's vice premier Vojislav Seselj said the government is
``in no hurry'' to negotiate Kosovo's future with pro-independence
ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Why would we be in a hurry when international circumstances
are not in our favor now?'' Seselj said in an interview with a
private TV station late Tuesday, carried by independent Beta news
agency.
	   ``The government ... has shown great patience not to make any
rash moves that would provoke a NATO operation in Kosovo, but
managed to conclude operations and suppress terrorism,'' Seselj
said.

	   TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) _ A car on Wednesday crashed through a
police barrier outside a hotel where Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is vacationing, police said.
	   Three policemen were lightly injured, said police spokesman Boaz
Goldberg. The car carrying three people got away and was chased by
police, Goldberg said, adding that the driver's motive was not
known.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, later put out a statement
saying the act was criminal-related, and not directed specifically
at the prime minister.
	   The police roadblock was erected to screen access to the hotel
in this northern Israeli resort where Netanyahu has been staying
with his wife, Sarah, and their children Yair and Avner.

Congolese rebels say ready to negotiate cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels battling to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Wednesday they are ready to negotiate a
cease-fire with the embattled government.
	   It was the first time the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi
fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's
army _ have showed willingness to talk with Kabila, whom they
accuse of corruption, power-grabbing and tribalism.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila, as long as Mr. Kabila recognizes there
is a fire,'' Bizima Karaha, a former government minister turned
rebel leader, told reporters in the eastern town of Goma.
	   ``We believe the solution to this problem is a political
solution,'' Karaha said, giving no details or timetable for
possible talks.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden rebel change of tactics,
although it followed a show of support for Kabila by several
southern African countries.
	   Since taking up arms on Aug. 2, the rebels have swept through
eastern Congo, flew in troops to the Atlantic coast and were
approaching the capital of Kinshasa in a pincer movement.
	   Rebel forces were moving Wednesday to take Mbanza-Ngungu, about
150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Zambia on Wednesday declared their
support for Kabila against the rebels. Only Zimbabwe announced it
was sending troops, but gave no details.
	   Karaha warned Zimbabwe against intervening, saying it would only
widen the rebellion.
	   ``Nobody can find a military solution to the Congolese
problem,'' Karaha said. ``Any foreign intervention in Congo will
have one and only consequence: to fight and resist.''
	   Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, heading a four-country
peace mission to Congo, held talks with the rebels in Goma a day
earlier on Tuesday.
	   Karaha and Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the president of the rebel
political movement, Congolese Democratic Coalition, expressed
surprise at Zimbabwe's decision.
	   ``The more Zimbabwe tries to come in, the more Zimbabwe will put
this struggle in high gear. What will happen after that, people who
intervened will pay the consequences,'' Karaha said.
	   Wamba predicted the Congolese people would continue to resist
``even if we have to fight those who are supporting the
dictatorship.''
	   ``I don't believe any responsible government will come to help
the dictatorship,'' Karaha said. ``To do what? Against the will of
Congolese people?''
	   Last week, the chief rebel military commander, Jean-Pierre
Ondekane, accused Zimbabwe of flying in weapons and ammunition to
the southern town of Lubumbashi in Kabila's home province of
Katanga.
	   Some rebel leaders speculated Zimbabwe may try to help Kabila
hold the copper-rich Katanga province, which would be his last
major stronghold if Kinshasa falls to the rebels.
	   Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which both played
key roles in helping Kabila topple the longtime Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, of staging the uprising and fighting alongside
the rebels.
	   Relations have soured between Kabila and the two countries, and
it is widely believed that they are providing some support to the
new rebel movement. They have denied involvement.
	   Karaha said talks could only follow recognition of the rebel
movement by the embattled Congolese president.
	   ``Kabila doesn't even recognize that we exist. Maybe he'll
recognize that we exist once we (arrive) in Kinshasa,'' Karaha
said. ``Whether Kabila should remain president or not is part of
the negotiations. He's a part of the problem so he should be part
of the solution too.''
	   Karaha said the rebels had no chosen mediator.
	   ``Anyone who has the interest of the people of Congo in their
hearts should be the mediator in the problem,'' he said.

Research shows memory can get stressed out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A team of researchers has come up with an
explanation for something many test takers, public speakers and
performers already know: Memory can fail under pressure.
	   The scientists at the University of California at Irvine showed
that an elevated level of a stress hormone hinders the ability of
rats to find their way back to a hidden target. The study was to be
published Thursday in the journal Nature.
	   ``This is the science of, `Oh, I've been so stressed lately, I
have trouble remembering,''' said Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford
University neuroscientist who has also studied how stress hormones
impair memory.
	   The UC researchers first taught rats to swim to a plastic
platform hidden just beneath the water's surface in a steel tank.
Then, they gave the rats a small electric shock and tested how well
they were able to swim back to the platform after two minutes, 30
minutes and four hours.
	   The rats were equally able after two minutes and four hours, but
at least 50 percent less successful after 30 minutes. The 30-minute
trial corresponded to a peak level of the stress hormone
corticosterone, which was secreted in response to the electric
shock.
	   The scientists also chemically blocked production of the hormone
and found that the rats had no memory trouble. Conversely,
injections of the hormone impeded memory just like an electric
shock.
	   The rat hormone corticosterone is similar to cortisol, which is
secreted under stress by the human adrenal gland, near the kidneys.
James L. McGaugh, who directs UC's Center for the Neurobiology of
Learning and Memory, said his research team is studying whether its
findings also apply to humans, and is confident they do.
	   He said the findings suggest that people should relax before
taking tests or performing other activities dependent on memory.
	   James W. Lane, a psychologist at a St. Louis drug rehabilitation
center who has researched memory trouble, said such studies may
ultimately help determine whether repressed memory actually exists.
	   He said that stress hormone floods a person's system during a
frightening experience, such as physical abuse, and maybe later
clouds recollection.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary defeated Slovenia 2-1 (0-0) in
a friendly match Wednesday, a last rehearsal for both teams prior
to before the European Championship qualification.
	   The narrow victory helped restore some pride of the Hungarian
squad, a rare occasion these days in Hungarian soccer, and allowed
coach Bertalan Bicskei to try out new players.
	   The first half was pretty uneventful, except for a flurry of
yellow cards.
	   Although the Hungarian forwards had many more chances, the
Slovenes' backfield stood tied, preventing them from scoring.
	   In the 69th minute, Hungary's Tibor Dombi, after a spectacular
solo scored from just outside the penalty area.
	   In the 80th minute, Slovenian goalkeeper Mladen Dabanovic could
only take the ball away from onrushing striker Tibor Dombi, for
which the referee sent him off the field, and the Hungarians were
awarded a penalty kick.
	   One of the Slovene players, Marinko Galic, donned the goalies'
jersey, but failed to ward off the ball fired by Vilmos Seboek.
	   The Hungarians were rejoicing and relaxed. In the 93rd minute,
the Slovene striker Milenko Acimovic scored, a second before the
referee's final whistle was blown.
	   The match was played in Zalaegerszeg, 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southwest of Budapest before 15,000 ecstatic fans.

Israeli jets raid Lebanon after soldier killed, four wounded

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon and near Beirut Wednesday after an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
attack.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the two raids,
which brought to three the number of Israeli air attacks in Lebanon
in as many days.
	   In the first strike at midmorning, two fighter jets fired two
air-to-surface missiles on the hills of Mlita, a village in Iqlim
al-Tuffah province, a stronghold of the Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrilla group just across from an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in the south, Lebanese officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (1.8 miles) north of the village of Rihan where an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   Two Israeli jets later flew in from the sea late Wednesday under
the cover of darkness and attacked a guerrilla base at the coastal
town of Naameh, 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Beirut, the
officials said.
	   The jets fired at least one missile at an entrance to a
steel-enforced concrete underground tunnel at the base, which is
used by the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but witnesses saw
three ambulances rushing to the base and quickly leaving with
sirens wailing.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the two attacks.
	   A spokesman for the Syrian-backed PFLP-GC confirmed the raid at
Naameh.
	   The PFLP-GC has opposed any peace talks with Israel but rarely
has participated in guerrilla attacks against Israeli soldiers in
southern Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's hostilities began when Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed
an Israeli patrol.
	   Military officials in Israel said that one soldier was killed
and four wounded in the attack.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the ambush.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired Sagger anti-tank
missiles and detonated a powerful bomb near the Israeli patrol.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Iqlim al-Tuffah highlands, the officials
said. No casualties were reported from the shelling.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 with the aim of protecting its
northern territory from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Ice cores show Antarctica may trigger climate change elsewhere
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Antarctica may be an important predictor of
climatic changes elsewhere on Earth thousands of years before they
appear, researchers say.
	   Analyzing ice cores drilled from deep within glaciers,
researchers found that small temperature increases in ancient
Antarctica preceded, by at least a millennium, extremely rapid,
substantial warming in Greenland.
	   The study, to be published Thursday in the journal Nature,
``contradicts the hypothesis that Antarctic warmings are responses
to events in the Northern Hemisphere,'' said Thomas Blunier of the
University of Bern in Switzerland.
	   By deciphering these frozen traces of events that occurred more
than 20,000 years ago, scientists could gain a better understanding
of Earth's climate and possible global warming events today.
	   Blunier's findings ``move us closer to the ultimate goal of
predicting future climate changes,'' said James W.C. White, a
climatologist at the University of Colorado who has drilled and
studied ice cores from both polar regions.
	   But he cautioned that a variety of uncertainties remain. For
one, findings from ice ages, when global climate was strongly
affected by Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, may not be relevant to
today's much balmier times.
	   In Blunier's study, a team of researchers from Switzerland,
France, Denmark and Iceland examined slices of ice drilled from a
glacier in central Greenland 650 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
They then compared them with samples drilled from two locations in
Antarctica.
	   Much like rings in a tree trunk, ice cores are thought to be a
calendar of climate variations since each year's snowfall is
deposited in a distinct layer. Atmospheric chemicals, dust and even
bubbles trapped in the ice enable scientists to reconstruct
climates of the past.
	   Blunier's group examined levels of methane, a heat-trapping gas,
and found that that temperature fluctuations in Antarctica started
1,000 to 2,500 years earlier than in Greenland.
	   The fluctuations in Antarctica began about 47,000 years ago and
lasted for 24,000 years. In Greenland, the temperature swings began
roughly 45,000 years ago, persisting for 9,000 years.
	   Researchers said they are not certain why the temperature swings
were not more closely synchronized, but suspect the lag is linked
to how the oceans slowly absorb and redistribute heat around the
globe.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech national team beat
Denmark 1-0 with an early goal from Karel Rada that decided a
friendly match played here Wednesday.
	   Rada scored in the 7th minute. The tall sweeper beat the Danish
defense in the air, scoring with a header on a corner kick from
Martin Cizek.
	   The Danes, quarterfinalists at the World Cup in France, arrived
without star strikers Brian and Michael Laudrup, who gave up
playing for the national team this year.
	   The Czechs, runners-up at the 1996 European Championships,
missed midfielders Patrik Berger of Liverpool and Radek Bejbl of
Atletico Madrid.
	   In the 16th minute, Denmark's Peter Moeller chipped the ball
over Czech goalie Pavel Postulka, but defender Jiri Nemec blocked
it on the goal line.
	   The referee disallowed a goal by Vratislav Lokvenc in the 23rd
minute, ruling it off-side.
	   Nine minutes later, Moeller failed to convert an inidirect kick
from within the six-yard box, hitting Rada with the ball.
	   Rada found himself in scoring position once again ten minutes
before half-time, but Danish goalie Peter Schmeichel caught his
header on a pass from Karel Poborsky.
	   The match lost its pace in the second half and despite frequent
substitutions none of the teams managed to produce solid scoring
opportunities.
	   The match, refereed by Poland's Ryzsard Wojczik, was played on a
warm evening in front of 6,000 spectators at the Letna stadium in
Prague.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Cabinet resigned Wednesday and
King Hussein appointed a close confidant to form a new government.
	   King Hussein, from his hospital bed in the United States,
appointed Fayez Tarawneh to form the new administration.
	   The move is expected to have no major impact on Jordan's foreign
policy, which is usually handled by King Hussein.
	   The change is widely seen as related to popular discontent over
the economic policies of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali's
24-member Cabinet, which also has been accused of negligence in
providing polluted drinking water to Amman.

	   In an urgent dispatch, the state-run Petra news agency said
Hussein accepted Majali's resignation late in the evening and
Tarawneh began forming his Cabinet.
	   Royal Palace officials said they expect the new government to be
announced within days.
	   On Monday, a consumer group filed a lawsuit against a former
minister and six other officials it accused of supplying Jordanians
with water ``unfit for human consumption.''
	   Experts have said that tap water in Amman's posh western suburbs
contains worms and worm larvae.
	   The government has denied that the water contains worms and King
Hussein has ordered a committee to investigate the allegations.
	   Hussein, 63, is undergoing cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic

	   Majali's Cabinet was formed in March 1997.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Finnish Embassy on Wednesday disputed a
British Home Office report saying Helsinki had the second-highest
homicide rate in Europe.
	   On Wednesday, the Home Office released figures that listed
Helsinki behind only Moscow, with a rate of 12.5 homicides per
100,000 population.
	   But Erja Tikka, the embassy's press officer, said the numbers
used for Helsinki were incorrect. She said the numbers supplied by
the Finnish government to the Home Office included not only
murders, but also attempted murders.
	   The accurate figure for homicide rates in Helsinki was 3.05 per
100,000 of population, Tikka said, which would make Helsinki safer
than Moscow, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Geneva, Copenhagen, Berlin and
Paris.

Arron's European 100 record serves notice on American Jones
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Marion Jones, watch out for Christine
Arron.
	   The 24-year-old Caribbean-born Frenchwoman with the orange-dyed,
short-cropped hair smashed the European 100 record Wednesday,
running 10.73 and boosting her claim as the No. 1 rival to the
American world champion.
	   Beaten out of the blocks by Irina Privalova, Arron overpowered
the Russian in the last 20 meters to steal her title and the
European record.
	   Arron's gold _ one of six Wednesday on the second day of the
European Championships _ overshadowed the 1-2 in the men's 100 by
Britons Darren Campbell (10.04) and Dwain Chambers (10.10), both
vying to succeed former Olympic and world champion Linford
Christie. Charalambos Padadias of Greece took bronze in 10.17.
	   Three of the other four golds went more or less to form. The
main upset was Sonia O'Sullivan's victory at 10,000 meters
(31:29.33) over former Olympic and world champion Fernanda Ribiero
(31:32.42) of Portugal.
	   In the other events, Kiril Sosunov of Russia cleared 8.28 meters
to take the men's long jump, and Hungary's Tibor Gecsek _ who
returned last year from a two-year drug ban _ took the hammer with
silver for countryman and Olympic champion Balazs Kiss.
	   In the women's javelin, Tanja Damaske of Germany unleashed a
throw of 69.10 meters in her first attempt to win the gold medal in
the women's javelin.
	   Arron, who ran 10.81 earlier in the afternoon, was fourth in
last year's worlds and earlier this year finished just .10 behind
Jones in a meet in Paris.
	   Her 10.73 _ run with the legal limit of a 2 meters per second
tailwind _ puts her even closer. Only Jones times' of 10.71 and
10.72 this season are faster.
	   It also means she's third fastest woman in history behind world
record-holder Florence Griffith-Joyner and Jones.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year in the worlds,'' said Arron, who was born in
Guadeloupe, also the birthplace of French double Olympic champion
Marie-Jose Perec.
	   ``After the semifinal I thought I had a good shot at the gold
medal with a good start,'' Arron said. ``Ironically, I got the gold
and the European record as well, even with a fairly poor start.''
	   ``I had quite a bit of difficulty. Privalova had a very good
start so it wasn't given to me.''
	   Privalova showed she's recovered from a severe hamstring injury,
running 10.83 for her top time this year.
	   ``After such a long injury and an operation, I really could not
have asked for more than this,'' she said.
	   On the men's side, Campbell _ coached by Christie _ quickly
started talking about tackling the Americans.
	   ``No. 1 in Europe now,'' he said. ``This is one of the stepping
stones that Linford (Christie) had I have planned so I can develop
to take on the Americans seriously.''
	   Several years ago Christie earmarked the 24-year-old as his
successor, and now he's beginning to come through.
	   ``Linford has prepared me brilliantly for this,'' he said. ``I
wasn't surprised I won and I wasn't nervous out there, in fact I
felt really cool.''
	   O'Sullivan, a two-time world cross-country champion and a former
5,000 world champion, won with a blistering kick from 200 meters in
a race she entered on a lark.
	   ``About a month ago in Nice (France) I ran a 3,000 and everyone
joked I should run the 10,000 in Budapest,'' she said.
	   ``I went to the track that night and I was joking with some
friends, and messing around with (Fernanda) Ribeiro and her coach.
I said I was going to run it and they said, `Oh sure you are'.''
	   By far the loudest ovation in Nep stadium was for Hungary's
Gecsek when he won the hammer, hitting 82.87 meters, the No. 3
throw in the world this season. Kiss took silver with 81.26 and
German Karsten Kobs got bronze (80.13)
	   Gecsek completed a two-year doping ban in '97 and apparently
used his time wisely.
	   ``I trained during those two years because I hoped to do well in
front of the home crowd,'' he said.
	   In the major upset of the day French world champion Stephane
Diagana tripped over the penultimate hurdle and failed to make the
finals in the 400 hurdles.
	   ``I thought as I came off the last bend that I had comfortably
qualified. This makes it doubly hard for me to take,'' Diagana
said.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A high-level Bosnian Croat
delegation Wednesday pressed Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
prosecutors to indict those responsible for a string of anti-Croat
atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   The delegation, led by Bosnian Federation Vice President
Vladimir Soljic, spoke to the U.N. court's president and chief
prosecutor and handed them a list of alleged massacres of Bosnian
Croats by Serb and Muslim forces.
	   The meetings came as the trial of six Bosnian Croats accused of
involvement in a notorious 1993 massacre of Muslim civilians
entered its third day.
	   Officials at the court declined comment on the visit.
	   Soljic presented a list of 14 massacres alleged to have taken
place between May 1992 and January 1994 in which Bosnian Croats
were the victims. The alleged massacres included one killing spree
in which 74 people were slain.
	   Details of the killings have been handed to prosecutors at the
tribunal but no public indictments have been issued in connection
with the allegations.

Four disabled people drown in boating accident, police say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKIPTON, England (AP) _ Four disabled passengers drowned
Wednesday when their canal boat sank in a lock, police said.
	   Three of the dead had been on the deck and one inside the 60
foot (18 meter) barge when the accident happened near Skipton, on a
rural section of the Leeds and Liverpool canal in northern England,
West Yorkshire Ambulance spokesman David Pitts said.
	   ``Four people have died. Medical crews tried to resuscitate
three people who were on the canal bank when they got there, but
they were unsuccessful,'' said Pitts. ``I believe one person was
trapped on the boat for a while.''
	   A 15-year-old boy and his father who were in a second barge in
the lock dived into the water several times and dragged three of
the four from the water, but could not resuscitate them.
	   ``They made a superhuman effort,'' said North Yorkshire
spokesman Margaret Kirk. Police said they did not yet know the
cause of the accident.
	   Police said that the four dead, who have not been named, were
accompanied by four able-bodied people who escaped unharmed. The
disabled boaters had come from a daycare center for adults with
special needs.
	   The local district council said it had launched an investigation
into the accident.

Paraguayan political upheaval after Oviedo release

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Paraguay's new president faced a power
struggle Wednesday as his own party withdrew its support in anger
over his decision to free from jail a former general who once
refused to relinquish control of the army.
	   President Raul Cubas Grau took office Saturday, becoming the
first civilian to succeed another as leader of the South American
nation. He pledged to bring economic stability by fighting
corruption and unemployment.
	   In his first act as president, Cubas freed former army Gen. Lino
Oviedo, overriding a 10-year sentence handed down by a military
tribunal earlier this year.
	   Cubas defended his decision Wednesday, saying he campaigned for
office on two pledges: to improve Paraguay's economic condition and
fight for Oviedo's release.
	   ``I've used the constitutional power given to presidents to
fulfill a campaign promise,'' Cubas said. ``What I legally decreed
yesterday does not differ from my campaign promise.''
	   Top officials of the ruling Colorado party, which has dominated
politics through both dictatorship and democracy since 1947, voted
to withdraw their support for the president. The effective break in
relations throws into question Cubas's ability to govern.
	   Bader Rachid, a top party official, presided over a Tuesday
night meeting of the party's executive committee, who agreed to
fight the president's decision to release Oviedo. He said some
members were considering ways to impeach Cubas.
	   Colorado Sen. Juan Carlos Galaverna called Cubas' action an
``abuse of power.''
	   ``Three days after taking the oath of office, Cubas said the
country needed to live in peace, but yesterday he freed the man
that could begin a diabolical plan to persecute everyone who he
thinks is not with him,'' he said.
	   A military court sentenced Oviedo to 10 years in jail on charges
he rebelled against Cubas' predecessor, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who
had ordered him to resign as army commander in 1996.
	   The 54-year-old Oviedo claimed before the May presidential
elections that he was ``a victim of persecution'' and said his
jailing was Wasmosy's way of keeping him from governing.
	   After the Supreme Court upheld Oviedo's sentence, an intra-party
feud ensued between supporters of Cubas, who assumed the candidacy
after Oviedo was jailed, and Wasmosy.
	   Throughout the brief campaign this spring, Cubas was quick to
acknowledge his close relationship with Oviedo, who is extremely
popular in Paraguay's countryside _ where key voters helped to keep
the Colorados in power.
	   Cubas has said he expects Oviedo to serve as ``a friend of the
government'' during his years in office.
	   Cubas's own brother was the first to resign from his Cabinet.
	   ``I present my resignation because I do not agree with the
process of how my brother freed Gen. Oviedo,'' Carlos Cubas Grau,
who was the minister of industry and business, said Wednesday.
``Oviedo's freedom runs the risk of being illegal.''

	   OREBRO, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden defeated Russia 1-0 in a friendly
prep match for the upcoming European Championship qualifying. An
early goal by striker Jorgen Pettersson sealed the match.
Pettersson succeeded in getting the ball just over the line after a
corner by midfielder Par Zetterberg.
	   Zetterberg was close to adding to the score in the second half
with a powerful free kick beautifully saved by Russian substitute
keeper Dmitry Kharin.
	   In the first half, both teams played a waiting game accompanied
by lots of technical errors. After the pause, both coaches threw in
a number on substitutes and quality improved.
	   In the 86th minute, Russian striker Alexander Mostovoi was close
to equalizing with a shot in the post.
	   For Sweden, this was the fourth consecutive match without
letting in any goals.

Cabinet resigns, King designates new prime minister

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Cabinet resigned Wednesday amid a
growing scandal over polluted drinking water in one of Amman's
wealthy suburbs and King Hussein immediately appointed a close
confidant to form a new government.
	   King Hussein, from his hospital bed in the United States,
appointed Fayez Tarawneh to form the new administration.
	   The move is expected to have no major impact on Jordan's foreign
policy, which is usually handled by Hussein.
	   The change is widely seen as related to popular discontent over
the policies of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali's 24-member
Cabinet, which has been accused of negligence in providing polluted
drinking water to Amman and of mismanaging the economy.
	   In an urgent dispatch, the state-run Petra news agency said
Hussein accepted Majali's resignation late in the evening and
Tarawneh began forming his Cabinet.
	   Royal Palace officials said the new government is expected to be
announced within days.
	   Tarawneh, like Majali, is an ardent supporter of King Hussein's
policy of peace with Israel.
	   Tarawneh, a former ambassador to the United States, negotiated
the 1994 treaty with Israel.
	   A main complaint against the government has been the poor
drinking water in Amman's wealthy western suburb.
	   Residents say the water has a foul odor and experts have said
the water contains worms and worm larvae.
	   On Monday, a consumer group filed a lawsuit against a former
minister and six other officials it accused of supplying Jordanians
with water ``unfit for human consumption.''
	   The government has denied that the water contains worms and
Hussein has ordered a committee to investigate the allegations.
	   It was only under pressure that Water and Irrigation Minister
Munther Haddadin resigned on Aug. 9, two days after Majali visited
Hussein in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where the
monarch is receiving treatment for lymphatic cancer.
	   Officials said an angry Hussein met with Majali for only a few
minutes and warned him that he will punish those who are
responsible for the contaminated water.
	   Hussein's Cabinet reshuffle came hours after Majali was handed a
report by a committee formed by Hussein to probe the water
pollution. It was not immediately clear if the resignation was
related to the committee's finding, which has not be released.
	   Majali's Cabinet has also been accused of mishandling the
economy.
	   Last month, it locked horns with Parliament over economic growth
rates, which the government set at 4 percent in 1997. The World
Bank, however, said the rate did not exceed 0.8 percent.
	   Before his designation as prime minister, Tarawneh served as the
chief of Hussein's Royal Court _ a position which is often a
stepping stone to the premiership.

U.N. refugee agency officials warns of catastrophe in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Tuesday to Wednesday in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The deputy head of the U.N. refugee
agency Wednesday warned of a catastrophe in Kosovo unless there is
an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a political
settlement.
	   The current crisis ``would become a catastrophe during winter''
without such steps, said Soeren Jessen Petersen, a deputy to U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We have more than 200,000 (displaced Kosovars) now, but we
would have many, many people dying during the coming winter,''
Petersen said, adding it was up to the politicians ``to stop
that.''
	   ``Humanitarian action must not once again, as it happened in
Bosnia for four or five years, become a substitute for political
action,'' he said.
	   He cited a cessation of hostilities followed by a political
dialogue; more regular, better access and security; a return to
their homes of 170,000 people displaced inside Kosovo and 50,000
outside; and ``a better response to the (UNHCR) humanitarian
operation.''
	   Petersen's argument was supported by Emma Bonino, the human
rights commissioner for the European Union, who said, ``If there is
no political settlement we are moving very quickly from a
humanitarian crisis to a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   In an apparent response to the rising international criticism of
the Serb-led government over the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,
the official Tanjug news agency on Wednesday accused the Albanian
rebels of preventing the return of refugees to their homes.
	   Tanjug, which is the government mouthpiece, said that after
their military defeat, ``the Albanian terrorists, as well as the
political representatives, have pulled another card - alleged
humanitarian catastrophe.'' It alleged that the KLA had been using
civilians as human shields while fighting government forces.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Bonino was stopped by ethnic Albanian rebels,
who refused to allow her convoy to reach a disputed village, Cirez,
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.

Algerian president urges vigilance against violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Zeroual speech &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
appealed to his countrymen Wednesday to be vigilant and face up to
``cowardly acts of terrorism'' in a nationwide TV broadcast.
	   In his 25-minute speech, Zeroual said the ``security situation
is constantly improving'' and that ``Algeria is recovering
progressively its tranquility and hope.''
	   A retired general, Zeroual, 57, has made few public appearances
since undergoing an operation in Switzerland in March for arterial
blockage in his legs.
	   Zeroual also said he wanted Algerian to ``recover its place on
the international scene'' and that a recent visit by a U.N.
delegation of observers showed Algeria was committed to allow the
world access to the North African country.
	   In the speech, which was also broadcast on official radio,
Zeroual called for a deepening of democratic culture and the
pursuit of economic reforms.
	   Zeroual said the reforms were necessary especially due to the
drop in world oil prices which has cut into revenues from one of
Algeria's must lucrative exports.
	   Algeria suffers from high unemployment, especially among young
people.
	   Addressing political issues, Zeroual assured his countrymen that
Algeria had a constitution that guaranteed ``democracy, the rule of
law, and freedom of expression.''
	   Without elaborating, he criticized a recent press campaign that
has questioned the authority of Mohammed Bechtine, the country's
chief security official.
	   Zeroual also defended a recent law making Arabic the only
official language in Algeria.
	   Other than his reference to fighting terrorism, Zeroual did not
spend much time to the issue of political violence that has
engulfed the country for the past six years.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to
win. An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence.
	   The U.N. delegation, led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares, wrapped up its visit to Algeria this month but its report
on its findings has yet to be made public.
	   Earlier in the day before Zeroual's speech, two people were
injured after a bomb exploded at a market outside Algiers.
	   The explosion rocked the marketplace at Bir Mandreis on the
southern outskirts of the capital, authorities said in a statement.
The victims were hospitalized, but their lives were not in danger.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but markets
frequently have been targeted by Islamic militants waging a
six-year insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels battling to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Wednesday they are ready to negotiate a
cease-fire with the embattled government.
	   It was the first time the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi
fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's
army _ have showed willingness to talk with Kabila, whom they
accuse of corruption, power-grabbing and tribalism.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila, as long as Mr. Kabila recognizes there
is a fire,'' Bizima Karaha, a former government minister turned
rebel leader, told reporters in the eastern town of Goma.
	   ``We believe the solution to this problem is a political
solution,'' Karaha said, giving no details or timetable for
possible talks.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden rebel change of tactics,
although it followed a show of support for Kabila by several
southern African countries.
	   Kabila's Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the government
had not discussed the new offer but he believed it would only sit
down with Uganda and Rwanda, which Congo accuses of masterminding
the rebellion.
	   ``We will not negotiate with the instruments of Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Mumengi said in Kinshasa.

Israel approves expansion of four settlements in Golan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Wednesday approved the construction
of thousands of new homes in four settlements in the Golan Heights.
	   A ministerial committee headed by by Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon approved construction of 2,500 vacation units and
2,300 housing units in four settlements in the southern Golan,
overlooking the Sea of Galilee.
	   ``Many people want to live in this beautiful part of the
country, and we are working to fulfill that need,'' Sharon
spokesman Raanan Gissin said.
	   Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Peace talks
between the two countries have been stalled since early 1996.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Underdog Austria held World champion
France to a 2-2 (1-1) draw in a friendly match Wednesday, the first
of the French national team after winning the world crown last
month.
	   To everybody's surprise, the Austrians did much better than
expected, but the French stars clearly did not go full throttle at
times. Still, their passing was mostly a sight for sore eyes.
	   The result bolstered the Austrians' self-confidence for the
first European Championship qualification match against Israel on
Sept. 5.
	   Zinedine Zidane, who scored two goals against Brazil in the
World Cup final, played only in the first half for the French side,
which included six World Cup players.
	   As expected, France opened the score in the 16th minute. Bixente
Lizarazu's free kick reached Lilian Laslandes, who headed the ball
in, unchecked by a stunned Austrian backfield.
	   Mario Haas evenend the score in the 44th minute, cheered by some
44,000 fans on what was a warm summer evening.
	   In the second half, the Austrians appeared to have shed some of
their respect for the French stars, whose teamwork enthused
Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who called it ``a
sight for sore eyes.''
	   The Austrians even went into the lead in the 76th minute when
Ivica Vastic converted a penalty. But the ``Grande Nation'' had
several more good chances, and in the 84th minute, Alain Boghossian
headed in the equalizer on a free kick by Youri Djorkaeff.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council urged Tajik
authorities Wednesday to speed up the investigation into the
slayings of four members of the U.N. military observer force in the
Central Asian country.
	   The council also expressed its condolences to the United States
following the death of an American security guard working for the
U.N. Military Observers in Tajikistan, said council president
Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   Local police found security guard Jore de Marco in his apartment
in the capital, Dushanbe, on Monday night with a single gunshot
wound to his head.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal, which ended five years of civil war in the
impoverished former Soviet republic.
	   In July, three U.N. military observers and their Tajik
translator were shot at point-blank range while on patrol in the
Pamir Mountains in eastern Tajikistan.
	   ``The Security Council stressed that the main responsibility for
the security of UNMOT lies with the Tajik sides themselves,'' Turk
said.
	   Government and opposition officials said Monday the government
had identified four suspects and was negotiating with the
opposition for their arrest.

Two Palestinian prisoners escape from West Bank jail

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two convicts escaped Wednesday from a
Palestinian prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian
officials said.
	   Army radio reported that one of the escaped prisoners was a
Palestinian accused in the killing of an Israeli taxi driver last
year. He had been sentenced to 17 years with hard labor.
	   The report further said that the Palestinian police had begun a
search for the fugitives, setting up road blocks around the Jericho
region.
	   The escape comes a week after Hamas leader Imad Awadallah
escaped from another Jericho prison, prompting a massive manhunt
during which Palestinian police conducted house-to-house searches
in Jericho and imposing a curfew.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police have arrested a
leader of the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, his family
said Wednesday.
	   Abdullah Shami, head of Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, was
taken from his home for questioning at midnight Tuesday, his family
said.
	   Family members said they did not know why Shami had been
arrested now. No confirmation of the arrest or other details were
immediately available from Palestinian authorities. Army radio,
meanwhile, reported the arrest came after a Shami published an

Bosnia wins 1-0 against Faeroe Islands in Euro qualification

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In the first European Soccer
Championship qualifier in its history, Bosnia on Wednesday narrowly
defeated the Faeroe Islands 1-0.
	   It took the Bosnian national team 18 corner kicks and numerous
chances to crack the islanders' tough defense.
	   The only goal was scored by Elvir Baljic in 66th minute from a
free kick. The ball shot from some 20 meters bounced off one of
Faeroe defenders and tricked the goalie, Jakub Mikkelsen.
	   Mikkelsen was one of the best players in the match dominated by
the Bosnian national team. But their constant attacks were mostly
fruitless.
	   The Faeroe Islands team made only a few excursions into the
Bosnian half of the field. Yet, the team with nine amateurs and
only two professionals showed great physical strength and some
technical sparkle.
	   The Bosnians, with a much greater potential, disappointed
somewhat, since all players, with the exception of Mirsad Dedic,
are currently playing in West European teams or in Turkey.
	   ``The most important thing is that we have won these three
points,'' Bosnian backfielder Sead Kapetanovic said after the
match. ``The play of our team was terrible, and we have a lot of
work to do,'' he added self-critically.
	   Wednesday's match was the first appearance of the Bosnian team
in the European soccer arena. Bosnia supplied good players for the
Yugoslav national team until it declared its independence in early
1992, a move that was followed by a bloody war that lasted for 3
1/2 years.
	   The match was held before more than 30,000 spectators at Kosevo
stadium, Sarajevo's biggest. It was heavily damaged during the war
as some of the front-lines were only a few hundred meters away.
	   Lineups:
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina: Mirsad Dedic, Sead Kapetanovic, Segej
Barbarez (Jasmin Mujdza, 77), Muhamed Konjic, Mirza Varesanovic,
Mirsad Hibic, Elvir Bolic, (Edin Mujcin, 67), Sejad Halilovic, Meho
Kodro, Hasan Salihamidzic (Nermin Sabic, 80), Elvir Baljic.
	   Faeroe Islands: Jakub Mikkelsen, Hans Frode Hansen, Jens
Kristian Hansen, Pol Thorsteinsson, Oli Johannesen, henning
Jarnskor, Samuel Joensen, Julian Johnsson, Allan Morkoere, Uni Arge
(Jakub a Borge, 78), John Petersen.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Jolted awake by a distant rumbling, Ganga
Pandit dragged his wife and son from their hut in a remote
Himalayan village and struggled up the slopes. Glancing back,
Pandit saw a river of water, mud and boulders hurtle through the
valley.
	   Hindu pilgrims camping nearby, specially selected for their
hiking ability and headed for a revered mountain known as the Abode
of Bliss, also awoke to the rumbling hills.
	   ``I saw a hill on the east of the village virtually bursting. It
was like a bomb exploding,'' said Pandit, priest of the only
village temple in the valley. ``Within minutes, the shouts and
wails were drowned and all that was heard was the gushing water.''
	   More than 200 people, including Hindu pilgrims headed to a
sacred shrine across the Chinese border in Tibet, were swept away
in Tuesday's flash flood. A sharp rise in the nearby Kali River led
to the flooding.
	   On Wednesday, three other landslides hit the area, killing 37
people and flattening the nearby village of Monsuna, where all 25
houses were wiped out. There were no reports of survivors in
Monsuna. Two weeks of downpours have triggered the slides, and more
were considered likely.
	   Near the site of Tuesday's slide, where more than 200 people
were feared dead, army troops and doctors waded through deep mud
with little hope of finding more survivors. By Wednesday, they had
found only nine bodies along with 18 survivors.
	   Rescue helicopters were grounded Wednesday because of worsening
weather, officials said.
	   ``It's raining very heavily and there are fierce winds,'' Lt.
Sunil Kumar, leader of the army rescue team, told The Associated
Press by army wireless. ``There is no way we can get into the
strong, neck-deep currents to search for bodies.''
	   Army divers made two attempts to cut through the furious
currents but were beaten back, said Himmat Singh, one of the
divers.
	   Soldiers earlier had slipped and crawled across mud and rocks on
rain-soaked mountains to rescue survivors from what Kumar called
``a valley of death. ...We believe many bodies have already been
washed away.''
	   They found six villagers alive along with three porters who had
been accompanying the pilgrims.
	   ``The condition of the survivors is serious due to their
exposure to freezing wind and rain for more than 24 hours,'' said
Brigadier Avadesh Prakash, the local army commander.
	   They left behind a valley strewn with backpacks, gas stoves,
food cans and other belongings, L.R. Yadav, the top administrator
of Pithoragarh, 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of New Delhi, said
in a telephone interview.
	   ``There is no trace of the fiber glass huts or the dwellings of
the villagers,'' Yadav said.
	   The pilgrims had reached the camp site Sunday. But bad weather
hampered them from setting out for the four-faced Himalayan peak,
known as Kailasha, revered by both Hindus and Buddhists.
	   Three other groups were inside Tibet. The government planned to
seek Chinese help in evacuating them back to India.
	   The pilgrims, many with mountaineering training, typically make
the 120-mile (190-kilometer), 12-day trek at this time of year.
Their numbers vary year to year. The government allows only the
strong to undertake the journey because of the rough terrain; about
960 were approved to go this year.
	   An Aug. 12 mudslide killed at least 42 people and hundreds of
animals in the same region, which also was devastated by an
earthquake in 1991 that killed 341 people. Geologists warned of
worse catastrophes if torrential monsoons continued.
	   Largescale deforestation and development on the Himalayan slopes
has loosened the soil loose and severely weakened the lower
Himalayan slopes.

Bosnians win in Euro Champs, France held by Austria in friendly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Elvir Baljic fired Bosnia's first goal in
international competition Wednesday and helped the team to a 1-0
victory over the Faeroe Islands in its first European Championship
qualifying game.
	   The historical Group Nine result before 20,000 fans in Sarajevo
came on the day World Cup holder France was held 2-2 by modest
Austria in its first exhibition game since its July 12 3-0 final
triumph over Brazil.
	   Alain Boghossian netted a French equalizer six minutes before
the end after Mario Haas und Ivica Vastic's penalty had wiped out
an early strike for the visitor by Lilian Laslandes.
	   The Austria-France game was one of several exhibition game as
countries prepare for upcoming European Championship games.
	   In Prague, sweeper Karel Rada scored the Czech Republic's early
goal in a 1-0 victory over Denmark.
	   The tall sweeper beat the Danish defense in the air, scoring
with a 7th minute header on a corner kick from Martin Cizek.
	   In his first game as the Norwegian national team coach, Nils
Johan Semb was unable to gain a win or even a goal in a 0-0 tie
with Romania. Semb took over in the summer from long-term coach
Egil Olsen.
	   Jorgen Pettersson gained Sweden a 1-0 victory over Russia in
Stockholm with a goal after only three minutes.
	   Pettersson succeeded in getting the ball just over the line
after a corner by midfielder Par Zetterberg as the Swedes completed
a fourth game in a row without conceding a goal.
	   Sergei Rebrov, who scored four times for Dynamo Kiev in his
club's 8-0 win over Welsh club Barry Town in the Champions Cup,
scored two first-half goals in Ukraine's 4-0 beating of Georgia in
Kiev.
	   Midfielder Sergei Skachenko increased the lead in the 57th
minute and Sergei Kovalyov completed the scoring in the 75th.
	   Hungary edged Slovenia 2-1 with goals by Tibor Dombi and Wilmos
Sebok in the last 20 minutes.
	   Two second-half goals in the space of three minutes by
Fiorentina's Rui Costa gave Portugal a 2-1 win over Mozambique.
	   Belarus beat Lithuania 3-0 with strikes by Andrey Orlovsky,
Vladimir Makovsky and Maksim Romashenka.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) - Some 400 U.S. soldiers arrived in Kuwait
Wednesday, the first part of a 1,500-member U.S. force that will
participate in routine desert war games with Kuwaiti troops.
	   The soldiers were flown in from Fort Stewart, Georgia. The
remaining U.S. soldiers are expected to arrive during the next
three days.
	   The games, code-named Intrinsic Action, are ``designed to
provide continued U.S. ground presence'' in Kuwait, the U.S.
Embassy said in a statement.
	   The force is deploying without equipment and will use arms
prepositioned in Kuwait, the embassy said.
	   Continuous military maneuvers are part of a 10-year defense pact
Kuwait signed with the United States shortly after the 1991 Gulf
War that ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of this oil-rich Gulf
state.

Work begins on exhuming frozen graves in search of deadly virus

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ One by one, experts gently removed
six wooden crosses Wednesday marking a frozen mass grave that may
contain secrets about one of the deadliest epidemics this century.
	   A four-nation team is exhuming the bodies of six young coal
miners who were among the victims of the Spanish Flu, which killed
20 to 40 million people in 1918 and 1919 before vanishing.
	   The miners were buried in the permafrost of this Norwegian
Arctic outpost, and researchers believe the frigid conditions may
have preserved samples of the mysterious virus sufficient to build
a genetic profile.
	   Although experts say there is virtually no chance of finding a
live virus, they have decided to open the graves under tight
precautions including erecting an inflatable tent over the pit.
	   The few experts allowed in must go through an air lock, like on
a space ship. Team members will wear isolation suits, have outside
air supplies and even take an experimental anti-viral drug.
	   Before the work started, team leader Kirsty Duncan, a
31-year-old medical geographer, called for a moment of silence and
a prayer for the victims.
	   ``We are gathered here to remember and honor these young men,''
Duncan said. ``We are extremely grateful to the families of these
young men for allowing us to undertake our work.''
	   Each wooden cross, plus one stone marker, was pulled from the
sparse tundra grass. Workers from the British Necropolis Company,
which is doing the actual exhumation for the team, wrapped each
item in burlap and labeled them with a victim's name.
	   ``This a big day and a difficult day,'' said Duncan, who has
been preparing for the project for five years. ``We have to
remember that these were people, and they had families. ... We are
only doing this in the hope of unraveling the mystery of the 1918
flu.''
	   Digging up the bodies, taking tissue samples and reburying them
is expected to take about three weeks. Analysis of the tissue
samples could take as long as 18 months.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what is now Ft. Riley,
Kansas, in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread to Europe with
American troops sent to fight in World War I. From there, it spread
to much of the rest of world.
	   At first, it was a lot like other viruses. But viruses change
rapidly, and by the autumn of 1918, the death rate had increased
sevenfold, according to Tom Bergan, a Norwegian physician on the
team that includes members from the United States and Britain.
	   Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache, malaise,
muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Duncan, a professor at the Universities of Windsor and Toronto
in Canada, read about the Spanish Flu in a book and started a
search for clues that eventually led her to Longyearbyen, a town of
1,200 people on the largely glacier-covered Svalbard Archipelago.
	   The islands are north of the Norwegian mainland and 500 miles
from the North Pole.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon and near Beirut on Wednesday after an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
attack.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the two raids,
which brought to three the number of Israeli air attacks in Lebanon
in as many days.
	   In the first strike Wednesday, two fighter jets fired two
air-to-surface missiles on the hills of Mlita, Lebanese officials
said. Mlita is a village in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a stronghold
of the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group just across from an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (2 miles) north of the village of Rihan, where an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   Two Israeli jets later flew in from the sea late Wednesday under
the cover of darkness and attacked a guerrilla base at the coastal
town of Naameh, 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Beirut, the
officials said.
	   The jets fired at least one missile at an entrance to a
steel-enforced concrete underground tunnel at the base, which is
used by the radical group Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but witnesses saw
three ambulances rushing to the base and quickly leaving with
sirens wailing.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the two attacks.
	   A spokesman for the Syrian-backed radical group confirmed the
raid at Naameh. The group has opposed any peace talks with Israel.
	   Wednesday's hostilities began when Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed
an Israeli patrol.
	   Military officials in Israel said that one soldier was killed
and four wounded in the attack.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the ambush.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts, the officials said. No casualties were reported
from the shelling.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 with the aim of protecting its
northern territory from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Egypt bans art magazine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has banned the first two issues of an
art magazine, a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said government
censors confiscated the first issue of Alf Lela, saying that the
magazine carried political articles in violation of a law which
prevents publications that are licensed in foreign countries and
printed in Egypt from carrying political articles.
	   They gave no reason for confiscating the second issue, the group
said.
	   The magazine is licensed in Cyprus.
	   The human rights group, in its statement, called the ban ``an
attack on freedom of the press and a violation of freedom of
opinion and expression.''
	   It said the first issue, which came out on August 12, and the
second issue, which came out on Wednesday, were both confiscated
from the printing house.
	   Alf Lela editor Ibrahim Issa said censors informed him that the
first issue was banned because of an article on a film about the
late President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the group said.
	   Government officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
	   In April, the government banned all publications in duty-free
zones, where some 40 magazines and newspapers were printed.
	   The government revoked the ban on non-political publications
under pressure from human rights groups and journalists.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon and near Beirut on Wednesday after an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
attack.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the two raids,
which brought to three the number of Israeli air attacks in Lebanon
in as many days.
	   In the first strike Wednesday, two fighter jets fired two
air-to-surface missiles on the hills of Mlita, Lebanese officials
said. Mlita is a village in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a stronghold
of the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group just across from an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from Mlita, about three
kilometers (2 miles) north of the village of Rihan, where an
Israeli soldier was killed and four others wounded in a guerrilla
ambush earlier Wednesday.
	   Two Israeli jets later flew in from the sea late Wednesday under
the cover of darkness and attacked a guerrilla base at the coastal
town of Naameh, 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Beirut, the
officials said.
	   The jets fired at least one missile at an entrance to a
steel-enforced concrete underground tunnel at the base, which is
used by the radical group Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but witnesses saw
three ambulances rushing to the base and quickly leaving with
sirens wailing.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the two attacks.
	   A spokesman for the Syrian-backed radical group confirmed the
raid at Naameh. The group has opposed any peace talks with Israel.
	   Wednesday's hostilities began when Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed
an Israeli patrol.
	   Military officials in Israel said that one soldier was killed
and four wounded in the attack.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the ambush.
	   Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen retaliated
by firing more than 100 155mm howitzer shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts, the officials said. No casualties were reported
from the shelling.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active of the
militant groups fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and
2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 with the aim of protecting its
northern territory from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Underdog Austria held World champion
France to a 2-2 (1-1) draw in a friendly match Wednesday, the first
of the French national team after winning the world crown last
month.
	   To everybody's surprise, the Austrians did much better than
expected, but the French stars clearly did not go full throttle at
times. Still, their technical prowess and fine combinations were
mostly a sight for sore eyes.
	   The result bolstered the Austrians' self-confidence for the
first European Championship qualification match against Israel on
Sept. 5.
	   Austrian team coach Herbert Prohaska said: ``There is quite some
potential in this team ... We can cope with having had to concede
the equalizer... We would have deserved to win with this
performace, but we can walk out with our heads raised high.''
	   Roger Lemerre, his French counterpart, said: ``The result is in
order. Two strong teams were in action. Austria played very well,
and I am satisfied with my team.
	   ``The newcomers played the way I wanted, and Austria, with such
a performance, should have no problem to qualify for the European
Championship.''
	   France's superstar Zinedine Zidane, who scored two goals against
Brazil in the World Cup final, played only in the first half for
the French side, which included six World Cup players.
	   As expected, France opened the score in the 16th minute. Lilian
Laslandes, on an ideal pass from Bixente Lizarazu, outsped the
Austrian backfield and headed the ball home from close range.
	   The opening goal was a bitter pill for goalkeeper Michael
Konsel, who ended his team career, as announced, after 20 minutes
with a record of 43 national team matches. He was replaced by Franz
Wohlfahrt.
	   Mario Haas evenend the score in the 44th minute, cheered by some
44,000 fans on what was a warm, pleasant summer evening.
	   But soon afterward Didier Deschamps missed the Austrian goal
only narrowly with a sharp volley from 17 meters.
	   In the second half, the Austrians appeared to have shed some of
their respect for the French stars, whose teamwork enthused
Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who called it ``a
feast for the eyes.''
	   The home side was more often in the attack than before and had
some good scoring chances, but the French, relying on their
superior technical skill and speed, thwarted their chances.
	   The Austrians even went into the lead in the 76th minute when
Ivica Vastic converted a penalty after Leboeuf had fouled newcomer
Christian Mayrleb.
	   But the ``Grande Nation'' had several more good chances, and in
the 84th minute, Alain Boghossian headed in the equalizer on a free
kick by Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria: Michael Konsel (Franz Wohlfahrt, 21st minute) Wolfgang
Feiersinger, Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer, Markus Schopp (
Dietmar Kuehbauer (Peter Stoeger, 46th) , Roman Maehlich, Hannes
Reinmayr (Heimo Pfeifenberger), Arnold Wetl (Guenther Neukircher),
Mario Haas (Christina Mayrleb, 73rd), Ivica Vastic.
	   France: Bernard Lama, Christian Karembeu, Lilian Thuram, Frank
Leboeuf (Alain Goma, 79th minute), Bixente Lizarazu (Vincent
Candela, 46th), Tony Vairelles, Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane
(Youri Djorkaeff, 46th), Alain Boghossian, Lilian Laslandes
(Florian Maurice, 82nd minute), Thierry Henry (Robert Pieres, 64th
minute).

Islamic militant coalition warns Americans of new attacks

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A coalition of Islamic militant groups
warned in an Arabic newspaper Wednesday that ``strikes will
continue from everywhere'' against the United States.
	   The statement from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders, formed by exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden in February, was printed Wednesday in the London-based daily
Al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   The Jihad front is believed to be a coalition of six
fundamentalist groups from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its
statement was sent Tuesday to Al-Hayat's bureau in Cairo.
	   Al-Hayat said it came with three other statements from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the two deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7.
	   In one statement, the Holy Shrines group said it would
``continue shipping more American dead bodies to their unjust
government ... until we humiliate America's arrogance and roll its
dignity in the mud of defeat.''
	   The group had not been heard of before the explosions in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left 257 people
dead and more than 5,500 injured. Among the dead were 12 Americans.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said the
administration was unable to say whether the threats were credible.
	   ``Naturally, we'll be watching closely and taking prudent
security measures,'' he said.

VW prepares to export New Beetles to Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUEBLA, Mexico (AP) _ After averting a strike with its largest
union, Volkswagen is set to start exports of its New Beetle to
Europe and other markets, company officials said Wednesday.
	   Volkswagen Mexico, which began exporting the New Beetle to the
United States and Canada earlier this year, will soon start exports
to Europe and South America, said Gerhard Rieder, the company's
financial director.
	   According to preliminary company estimates, sales of the New
Beetle could be even greater in Europe than in North America, said
company spokesman Michael Wijers.
	   ``Our expectations today are much greater because worldwide
demand appears to be bigger than we anticipated,'' he said.
	   Volkswagen's original estimate for North American Beetle exports
was 55,000 units a year; the figure is now closer to 70,000. Sales
in Europe could top 100,000 Beetles a year, Wijers said.
	   Last Monday, Volkswagen reached a deal with its largest union
just before a strike deadline. The Independent Union of Volkswagen
workers entered the talks seeking a 35 percent pay increase, but
settled for 21 percent and other non-wage benefits.
	   Europe's largest car maker employs 15,800 people at its Puebla
plant southeast of Mexico City, about 10,000 of whom belong to the
union.
	   Puebla is VW's only production site for the New Beetle. The
plant also manufactures Jettas and Golfs for the local and export
market as well as its old-fashioned Beetle for the domestic market.
	   Thanks to increased exports and a recovery in the domestic
market, Volkswagen's production has increased steadily from 260,000
vehicles in 1997 to an estimated 360,000 units this year, and could
top 400,000 in 1999, Rieder said.
	   A few months ago, Volkswagen regained the lead in domestic
market share in passenger cars, which it dominated for 25 years
before the 1994-95 economic crisis.
	   ``Right now, we're running neck-to-neck with General Motors, and
that helps us stay competitive,'' Wijers said.
	   Volkswagen began operations in Puebla, its only plant in North
America, 34 years ago. The location was chosen because of its
proximity to Mexico City and the port of Veracruz in the Gulf of
Mexico, from which the company can ship parts and vehicles between
Mexico and Europe.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In the first European Soccer
Championship qualifier in its history, Bosnia on Wednesday narrowly
defeated the Faeroe Islands 1-0.
	   It took the Bosnian national team 18 corner kicks and numerous
chances to crack the islanders' tough defense.
	   The only goal was scored by Elvir Baljic in 66th minute from a
free kick. The ball shot from some 20 meters bounced off one of
Faeroe defenders and tricked the goalie, Jakub Mikkelsen.
	   Mikkelsen was one of the best players in the match dominated by
the Bosnian national team. But their constant attacks were mostly
fruitless.
	   The Faeroe Islands team made only a few excursions into the
Bosnian half of the field. Yet, the team with nine amateurs and
only two professionals showed great physical strength and some
technical sparkle.
	   The Bosnians, with a much greater potential, disappointed
somewhat, since all players, with the exception of Mirsad Dedic,
are currently playing in West European teams or in Turkey.
	   ``The most important thing is that we have won these three
points,'' Bosnian backfielder Sead Kapetanovic said after the
match. ``The play of our team was terrible, and we have a lot of
work to do,'' he added self-critically.
	   Wednesday's match was the first appearance of the Bosnian team
in the European soccer arena. Bosnia supplied good players for the
Yugoslav national team until it declared its independence in early
1992, a move that was followed by a bloody war that lasted for 3
1/2 years.
	   The match was held before more than 30,000 spectators at Kosevo
stadium, Sarajevo's biggest. It was heavily damaged during the war
as some of the front-lines were only a few hundred meters away.
	   Lineups:
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina: Mirsad Dedic, Sead Kapetanovic, Segej
Barbarez (Jasmin Mujdza, 77), Muhamed Konjic, Mirza Varesanovic,
Mirsad Hibic, Elvir Bolic, (Edin Mujcin, 67), Sejad Halilovic, Meho
Kodro, Hasan Salihamidzic (Nermin Sabic, 80), Elvir Baljic.
	   Faeroe Islands: Jakub Mikkelsen, Hans Frode Hansen, Jens
Kristian Hansen, Pol Thorsteinsson, Oli Johannesen, henning
Jarnskor, Samuel Joensen, Julian Johnsson, Allan Morkoere, Uni Arge
(Jakub a Borge, 78), John Petersen.

Jordanian Cabinet resigns, King designates new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Cabinet resigned Wednesday amid a
growing scandal over polluted drinking water in one of Amman's
wealthy suburbs. King Hussein immediately appointed a close
confidant to form a new government.
	   Hussein, from his hospital bed in the United States, appointed
Fayez Tarawneh to form the new administration.
	   The move is expected to have no major impact on Jordan's foreign
policy, which is usually handled by Hussein.
	   The change is widely seen as related to popular discontent over
the policies of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali's 24-member
Cabinet, which has been accused of negligence in providing polluted
drinking water to Amman and of mismanaging the economy.
	   In an urgent dispatch, the state-run Petra news agency said
Hussein accepted Majali's resignation late in the evening and
Tarawneh began forming his Cabinet.
	   Royal Palace officials said the new government is expected to be
announced within days.
	   Tarawneh, like Majali, is an ardent supporter of King Hussein's
policy of peace with Israel. A former ambassador to the United
States, Tarawneh negotiated the 1994 treaty with Israel.
	   A main complaint against the government has been the poor
drinking water in Amman's wealthy western suburb.
	   Residents say the water has a foul odor and experts have said
the water contains worms and worm larvae.
	   Hussein's Cabinet reshuffle came hours after Majali was handed a
report by a committee formed by Hussein to probe the water
pollution. It was not immediately clear if the resignation was
related to the committee's finding, which has not be released.
	   Majali's Cabinet has also been accused of mishandling the
economy.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that violence in Kosovo between
Serbs and separatist Albanians could destabilize the area and
create a humanitarian disaster, the Security Council worked
Wednesday to back diplomatic efforts to bring the two sides
together for talks.
	   Council members were considering a draft statement that welcomed
the creation of an ethnic Albanian negotiating team that ``should
lead to the early commencement of a substantial dialogue with the
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   Consultations on the draft were expected to continue Thursday.
	   Hundreds have been killed since a Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists was launched in late February. The United
Nations now estimates that the fighting has created more than
231,000 refugees.
	   The Security Council has taken relatively little action on
Kosovo, preferring to let U.S. envoys, NATO and the Contact Group _
made up of the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy _ take the lead in resolving the conflict.
	   A council statement was intended to support their efforts,
diplomats said.
	   The ethnic Albanian negotiating team is headed by politician
Ibrahim Rugova, who favors pacifist tactics for resolving the
crisis.
	   The team doesn't include representatives of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been fighting for independence of the
Serbian province where Albanians account for 90 percent of the
population of 2 million.
	   On Tuesday, the ethnic Albanian delegation spurned an offer by
the Serbs to begin talks immediately, saying Serb attacks must
first cease and tens of thousands of Albanian civilians must be
allowed to return to their homes.
	   In its draft statement, the council said it was ``gravely
concerned that given the increasing numbers of displaced persons,
coupled with the approaching winter, the situation in Kosovo has
the potential to become an even greater humanitarian disaster.''
	   The council calls for an immediate cease-fire and ``emphasizes
that the issue of Kosovo can have no military solution,'' the draft
said.
	   Council members said they feared that the ``continuation or
further escalation of the conflict in Kosovo has dangerous
implications for the stability of the region.''

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In his first game as the Norwegian national
team coach, Nils Johan Semb and Norway tied Romania 0-0 in a
friendly soccer game Wednesday.
	   Semb will carry on Egil Olsen's hated long-ball soccer, but he
also wants a more varied attacking pattern with a more playing
midfield. Still, Semb agrees with Olsen when he believes that a
good defense is the key to a good offensive game.
	   Norway's new attacking weapon, defender Vegard Heggem, 23, of
Liverpool had several raids into Romania's defense from his back
position. Just a few weeks after Heggem signed on with Liverpool,
he has made the first team. Liverpool expects much from Heggem as a
modern offensive back.
	   Two minutes into the game he gave a beautiful ball to Havard
Flo, but Flo did not convert.
	   The home team had most chances in the game, but Romania's Viorel
Moldovan, Adrian Ilie and Catalin Munteanu caused problems in the
Norwegian defense. Moldovan had the greatest chance of the half
when Norwegian goal keeper Frode Grodas prevented on the goal line
in the 31st.
	   In the 79th Chelsea's Tore Andre Flo outmaneuvered Romanian
goalie Bogdan Stelea while his brother Jostein Flo was king of the
air. Tore Andre also could have settled the game in the last minute
of the game, but Stelea prevented.

Researchers find less mercury in Greenland snow than had been

 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A lot less mercury is polluting the snow in
Greenland than environmental researchers thought.
	   Mercury measurements made in the 1970s ``were plagued by major
contamination problems,'' scientists report in a paper scheduled
for the Sept. 1 edition of Geophysical Research Letters.
	   New measurements by American and French researchers using
ultraclean methods not available in the earlier studies found that
snow deposited on the arctic island between 1949 and 1989 contained
sharply lower amounts of mercury than had been reported.
	   Mercury is released into the atmosphere by waste incineration,
burning coal and industrial processes and can be poisonous when it
accumulates in the body. Environmentalists have been concerned
about mercury in the food chain and studies of remote areas like
Greenland were aimed at getting a sense of the amounts of the metal
being deposited from the atmosphere.
	   Mercury can accumulate in plankton in the ocean, which is eaten
by fish, which are eaten by larger fish, with the mercury
accumulating, explained Grace M. Vandal, formerly of the University
of Connecticut, who took part in the research.
	   The new studies found concentrations of mercury ranged from 0.05
to 2.0 parts per trillion in the snow samples, with most readings
below 1 part per trillion.
	   One part per trillion is equivalent to one drop of detergent in
enough dishwater to fill a string of railroad tank cars 10 miles
(16 kilometers) long.
	   In five earlier studies, just one had a reading as low as 2
parts per trillion and even that one included samples with up to 19
parts per trillion. In the other four studies the readings ranged
from 13 to 881 parts per trillion.
	   The study was done by Vandal, now with Pfizer Inc.; William F.
Fitzgerald of the University of Connecticut, and Claude F. Boutron
and Christophe P. Ferrari of the Environmental Glaciological and
Geophysical Laboratory in Saint Martin d'Heres, France.
	   Geophysical Research Letters is published by the American
Geophysical Union.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The senate on Wednesday unanimously voted
to abolish the legal holiday on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the
bloody 1973 military coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Pinochet, 82, now a senator-for-life joined his peers in the
Senate in voting to change the holiday for a ``national unity
day,'' which will be observed every year on the first Monday of
September.
	   ``The purpose is to promote national unity,'' Pinochet said
after agreeing to approve the government-sponsored bill.
	   Three previous attempts by the government to drop the holiday
had been turned down in recent years by the right-wing controlled
senate.
	   Pinochet seized power Sept. 11, 1973 and ruled until 1990. His
regime had made the date a legal holiday.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Federal police and soldiers were searching
for a group of armed men who attacked a police patrol in Guerrero
state this week, seriously injuring one officer, local media
reported Wednesday.
	   The attackers opened fire on three federal police officers who
were on an anti-narcotics patrol near Zirandaro, 135 miles (220
kilometers) southwest of Mexico City, late Monday night, the daily
Reforma reported.
	   Police officer Marcelino Paco Reyes, 33, was shot four times and
taken to a Mexico City military hospital. The other two men
suffered minor injuries, Reforma said.
	   Guerrero state is home to at least two leftist rebel groups.
Investigators said they did not suspect rebel involvement in the
ambush.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Three unidentified assailants have
kidnapped the 23-year-old second cousin of Honduran President
Carlos Flores Facusse, relatives reported.
	   Mario Facusse, the president's cousin, said his daughter Tania
was dragged from her car Tuesday by three women in a Tegucigalpa
suburb and taken away in another vehicle.
	   Facusse, a leader of the country's main opposition group, the
National Party, last week said he will run for the presidency in
2002.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A severe drought earlier this year has left
fir trees in Mexico's most important butterfly reserve vulnerable
to a voracious attack by bark-destroying beetles, according to a
report published Wednesday.
	   The forested reserve in the western state of Michoacan is the
winter home for millions of Monarch butterflies which migrate from
the central United States and Canada each year.
	   With the butterflies expected to begin arriving in October,
environmentalists are fighting to stop the scolytus mundus beetle
from spreading among the reserve's oyamel fir trees, the daily
Reforma reported.
	   Authorities have begun cutting down the worst-affected trees and
fumigating others.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany and Nicaragua have signed an
agreement to cancel up to 80 percent of the Central American
country's 111 million mark (dlrs 62 million) debt, the German
finance ministry said Wednesday.
	   Germany offered to forgo some of the money because Nicaragua is
one of the most indebted developing countries in the world, the
finance ministry said in a news release.
	   Of the 111 million marks, 86.6 million marks (dlrs 49 million)
are trade credits and 24.4 million marks (dlrs 14 million) are
development aid credits, the finance ministry said.
	   Nicaragua will receive debt relief of two thirds of the trade
credits, with a repayment period of up to 23 years for the
remaining third.
	   For the developing aid credits, both governments agreed on a
repayment period of up to 40 years. The developing aid credits will
be canceled once Nicaragua has invested 20 percent of the amount in
environmental, educational or poverty fighting programs.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Mexico's most famous singers, Gloria
Trevi, has appeared before prosecutors to deny charges that her
manager sexually abused young girls.
	   Responding to a judicial order, Trevi testified for two hours
Tuesday about the allegations against Sergio Andrade, the promoter
who oversaw her rise to fame.
	   She told reporters that she denied any wrongdoing by Andrade,
and also declined to answer some questions, citing Mexico's
constitutional rule that witnesses cannot be required to testify.
	   Andrade's former wife, Erika Aline Hernandez, co-authored a
best-selling book this year claiming that Andrade took advantage of
young girls studying at his performing arts school. She also filed
a criminal complaint against him.
	   Hernandez, a singer and actress whose professional name is
Aline, began to study under Andrade when she was 13. She claims
Trevi introduced her to Andrade and encouraged her to pose nude for
him.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities rejected a congressman's
petition for a referendum to repeal extradition for drug
traffickers after discovering more than 1 million bogus signatures
including those of the fictional characters Batman, Superman and
Homer Simpson.
	   The director of the National Registry, Colombia's top electoral
body, confirmed Wednesday that it had turned down the petition
filed in April by Rep. Carlos Alonso Lucio.
	   About two-thirds of the more than 2 million signatures failed to
match citizen identification records or were entered by another
person, said the official, Alfonso Portela.
	   He said the comic book and television characters' names were
apparently entered in jest by signatories, and not by the
petition's sponsors.
	   In December, Congress approved a constitutional amendment
permitting Colombia to extradite drug traffickers for crimes
committed after law's passage.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary defeated Slovenia 2-1 in a
friendly match Wednesday, a last rehearsal for both teams prior to
before the European Championship qualification.
	   The narrow victory helped restore some pride of the Hungarian
squad, a rare occasion these days in Hungarian soccer, and allowed
coach Bertalan Bicskei to try out new players.
	   The first half was pretty uneventful, except for a flurry of
yellow cards.
	   Although the Hungarian forwards had many more chances, the
Slovenes' backfield stood tied, preventing them from scoring.
	   In the 69th minute, Hungary's Tibor Dombi, after a spectacular
solo scored from just outside the penalty area.
	   In the 80th minute, Slovenian goalkeeper Mladen Dabanovic could
only take the ball away from onrushing striker Tibor Dombi, for
which the referee sent him off the field, and the Hungarians were
awarded a penalty kick.
	   One of the Slovene players, Marinko Galic, donned the goalies'
jersey, but failed to ward off the ball fired by Vilmos Seboek.
	   The Hungarians were rejoicing and relaxed. In the 93rd minute,
the Slovene striker Milenko Acimovic scored, a second before the
referee's final whistle was blown.
	   The match was played in Zalaegerszeg, 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southwest of Budapest before 15,000 fans.

Ecologists build barriers to protect chameleons on Spanish roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish chameleons living by highways are
being given hope for a longer life by the Association for the
Conservation of Vertebrates.
	   The association is building half-meter-high (20-inch-high)
plastic barriers by roadsides in southern Spain to protect the
creatures, 1,500 of which are run over each year.
	   The barriers are going up in August because it's the mating
season, when males climb down from trees to search for mates, often
wandering across roads.
	   The Association for the Conservation of Vertebrates has been
putting up barriers for the past three years. It says that in the
worst-hit areas they can find 20 dead chameleons on just a
200-meter (yard) stretch of road.
	   More than 10 million animals are killed on Spanish roads each
year, according to the Spanish Environmental Defense Organization.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ After going more than a week without a home run,
Mark McGwire hit Nos. 48 and 49 back-to-back Wednesday to give the
Cardinals an 8-6 victory over the Cubs in 10 innings.
	   Sosa hit his 48th homer in the fifth inning.
	   It was the 49th multi-homer game of McGwire's career, and his
sixth this season.
	   After tying the game at 6 in the eighth, McGwire homered to
center field in the 10th. Ray Lankford, batting after McGwire, hit
a solo home run to make it 8-6.
	   The Cubs blew a chance to win it in the bottom of the inning.
With two outs, Mark Grace singled, then moved to third on Henry
Rodriguez's double. Juan Acevedo intentionally walked Jose
Hernandez to load the bases, but Manny Alexander popped up to
McGwire to end the game.
	   Acevedo (6-2) gave up two hits and one intentional walk in two
innings. Terry Mulholland (3-4) gave up three hits and two runs _
both homers _ in 2 1-3 innings. He walked one and struck out three.
 &UR; Reds 8, Brewers 2
	   In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Pete Harnisch allowed five hits in 7
2-3 innings and Sean Casey had a homer and an RBI double as the
Cincinnati Reds beat the Brewers.
	   Harnisch (9-6) took a shutout into the eighth before allowing a
two-run homer to Fernando Vina. He struck out five and walked four.
	   Casey staked Cincinnati to a 1-0 lead in the first with his
third home run, a 425-shot over the Brewers' bullpen in right field
off Steve Woodard (9-8).
	   The Reds added six runs in the fourth on seven hits to knock out
Woodard and take a 7-0 lead. Barry Larkin opened the inning with a
single. One out later, Jeffrey Hammonds, Eddie Taubensee, Bret
Boone and Chris Stynes followed with successive singles to make it
5-0.
	   Reggie Sanders two-out RBI single made it 6-0, chasing Woodard.
Casey greeted reliever Bronswell Patrick with an RBI double.

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Rookie Blake Stein threw a two-hitter
for his first major league shutout and the Athletics continued
their home run barrage as Oakland defeated the Chicago White Sox
6-0 Wednesday.
	   Stein, obtained in last summer's deal that sent Mark McGwire to
St. Louis, allowed only a bunt single by Mike Caruso in the first
and a bloop triple by Magglio Ordonez in the second.
	   The triple fell between second baseman Scott Spiezio and right
fielder Jason McDonald, who accidentally was kneed in the face by
Spiezio as both tumbled.
	   McDonald, who spent more than two months on the disabled list
earlier this season with a concussion after an outfield collision
with teammate Rickey Henderson, momentarily appeared stunned but
stayed in the game.
	   Stein (5-7) struck out three and walked five in his 18th major
league start.

Three Australians return positive tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Three leading Australian triathletes
have returned positive tests to their asthma medication, according
to the sport's national president Bill Walker.
	   Walker said the three women, Loretta Harrop, Nici Andronicus and
Nicole Hackett, are all registered asthmatics whose medications are
approved for use by inhaler.
	   The three all failed tests taken by French-speaking authorities,
and Walker said it was because they wrote the Australian brand
names of their medication on their test forms, rather than the
generic names.
	   Walker said Triathlon Australia was in the process of notifying
the Australian Olympic Committee, International Triathlon Union and
Australian Sports Commission of the incident and sending the
appropriate medical certificates.
	   Goodwill Games champion Harrop and world junior champion Hackett
tested positive to salbutamol, commonly known as ventolin, while
Andronicus, ranked in the world's top 10 last year, tested positive
to terbutaline.
	   Australia's leading anti-doping authority Dr Ken Finch said
neither of the drugs were performance-enhancing if taken by
inhaler.
	   He said they were on the banned list only because they had an
anabolic effect of taken orally or by injection.

Favorites Sanchez, Kournikova advance in women's tennis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early play; will be lead after evening
matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Old favorite Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and the
spicy teen-ager Anna Kournikova both survived tough second-round
matches Wednesday at the dlrs 1.3 million du Maurier Canadian Open
tennis tournament.
	   Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, riding a
three-tournament winning streak, downed Russia's Elena Likhovtseva
7-5, 6-2 to run her consecutive match victory streak to 17.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland was scheduled to play
Austria's Silvia Plischke later Wednesday.
	   Sanchez, 26, of Spain, struggled with her serve on a windy
center court in a 0-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Karina Habsudova of
Slovakia.
	   Kournikova, 17, of Russia, emerged a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 winner over
Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir.
	   ``For the first 20 or 25 minutes, I didn't see the ball _ I just
saw her winners,'' the third-seeded Sanchez said of Habsudova, who
is ranked 61st in the world. ``I just tried to stay in the match,
keep the ball in the court and try to move her around. Obviously,
it worked.''
	   The three-time French Open champion caught a break when, leading
6-5 in the second set, a missed line call on set point helped her
avoid a tiebreaker.
	   Video replays showed Habsudova's shot landed squarely on the
line, but it was ruled to be out.
	   Sanchez won the du Maurier in 1992 and 1994 in Montreal and
reached the final the last time the women were at Jarry Stadium in
1996, losing to Monica Seles.
	   Autograph seekers lined up 10 deep to catch the attractive
Kournikova, the 15th seed, on her way to and from the court for
what turned out to be a spirited first meeting with the 38th-ranked
Dragomir.
	   ``I knew she was a good, whole-court player,'' said Kournikova,
who shot frequent glances at her ``good friend'' Sergei Fedorov,
the Detroit Red Wings center who watched from courtside. ``It was
windy and it was difficult to adjust. I think she handled the wind
well.''
	   Novotna, 29, who had a first-round bye, advanced to a
third-round meeting with Italy's Silvia Farina, who upset Mary Joe
Fernandez of the United States 7-5, 6-3.
	   Sanchez Vicario next plays France's Nathalie Tauziat, a 6-3, 6-3
winner over Kimberly Po, while Kournikova advanced to a meeting
with sixth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain.

	   According to the sources, who had seen the letter, Butler said
``I would appreciate receiving your government's confirmation that
Iraq is now prepared to extend the cooperation which is
necessary.''
	   ``Only a response from Iraq would enable the Commission to plan
the required steps,'' in carrying out inspections, the sources
said, quoting from the letter.
	   It asked that Iraq resume cooperation with inspections and
technical talks that have been frozen since Baghdad announced Aug.
5 that it was ceasing cooperation because Butler refused to certify
that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   The council was to conduct a regular review of sanctions on
Thursday, but there was widespread consensus that no movement was
expected considering the recent standoff.
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah was on
his way back to New York after failing to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with inspectors. Shah was tentatively scheduled to
brief the council on Monday.
	   The impasse, and Shah's failure to bring about a change of heart
from the Iraqi leadership, has prompted Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to agree to get more involved in the impasse, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   Annan spoke by telephone to Aziz from Lisbon, where he was
visiting last week, U.N. officials said, speaking on condition they
not be named.
	   Word of his involvement comes as some members of the council
have asked for the U.N. chief's personal intervention to try to
break the standoff.
	   ``It's our view that the Iraqis repudiated the Memorandum of
Understanding,'' which Annan brokered in February to give
inspectors access to presidential palaces, U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson said Wednesday.
	   ``And we believe that with his skill and his diplomatic efforts,
they should be engaged again to resolve this crisis,'' he said.
	   Annan brokered a February accord that defused the last crisis
with Iraq _ over inspectors' access to presidential palaces. But at
the time, he had U.S. and British threats of force to back his
diplomatic efforts.
	   This time neither Washington nor London has made such clear
threats, though U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said
the United States reserved the right to use force if necessary.
	   Annan was vacationing in West Africa and wasn't due back in New
York until Sept. 4.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.

Woods brings long game to Castle Pines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ An exhausted Tiger Woods played
Castle Pines Golf Club for the first time on Wednesday and
pronounced it perfect for his game, as advertised.
	   The much-awaited union of the long-hitting Woods and the
rarefied air of Castle Pines produced a 393-yard (357-meter) drive
off the elevated first tee in the Sprint International pro-am, with
the promise of more to come.
	   In fact, Woods should be even longer once he recoups from a
sleep-depriving schedule and once the fairways, softened by heavy
rain, begin to dry out.
	   The dlrs 2 million International, which pays the winner dlrs
360,000, gets under way on Thursday with a field that includes
other such notables as leading money-winner David Duval, PGA
champion Vijay Singh, defending champion Phil Mickelson, Jim Furyk,
Nick Price, Lee Janzen, Davis Love III, Ernie Els, Jesper Parnevik
and Billy Mayfair.
	   Mickelson, who fired a final-round 67 on Monday to win the
weather-delayed AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, is the
International's only multiple winner, having also prevailed in
1993.
	   Woods was a late entry, yielding to colleagues who insisted the
7,559-yard (6,879-meter) course _ and the modified Stableford
scoring system _ matched his game.
	   ``The course does set up well for my game,'' Woods said
Wednesday, ``but it's not as long as everyone says it is. It plays
very short at this altitude.
	   ``The course sets up well for a guy who hits the ball high and
long, and those are some of the hallmarks of my game. Phil
(Mickelson) hits it high and long, and he's done very well here.
Greg Norman has done well here.
	   ``I might hit more 3-woods than drivers here than people might
think. I've noticed that I actually hit my 3-wood almost as far as
my driver here. I hit my driver low. I hit my 3-wood high, and
because it stays in the air longer it carries farther.''
	   Woods did hit driver on the 644-yard (586-meter) first hole,
using a 3-iron to reach the green.
	   He had three birdies, one eagle and a bogey in his pro-am round.
The 4-under-par 68 translated into 10 Stableford points, with an
eagle counting 5 points, birdie 2 points, par zero, bogey minus-1
and double bogey or worse minus-3.
	   ``Guys who are making eagles are going to just leapfrog
everybody,'' he said. ``It's kind of neat that way. And I kind of
like not getting penalized too much for bogey, either.''
	   But Woods contended he planned to approach the tournament like
any other and ``not worry about birdies and bogeys and eagles and
stuff like that. If you take away the Stableford system and look at
the winning score in most tournaments, usually it's between 13- and
17-under. If you shoot that, you're going to be right there in the
hunt with a chance. I'll try to approach it like a normal
tournament and if I can get somewhere in that realm, I'll have a
good shot at winning.
	   ``You've got to play your game. If you get caught up in trying
to make birdies and eagles and get too aggressive, you're going to
make some bogeys and doubles. You have to be patient and keep
giving yourself chances.''
	   He said the thin air didn't bother him, noting, ``I'm exhausted
anyway. I haven't had a lot of sleep the last two days.''
	   After tying for 10th in the PGA Championship on Sunday, Woods
conducted a golf clinic for children and an auction for the Tiger
Woods Foundation on Monday in Portland, Ore. He left Portland at 4
a.m. Tuesday for a flight to Aspen, where he played golf and signed
autographs at the Glenn Frey Golf for Kids Tournament.
	   Woods was adamant that he is having a better year than 1997,
when he set a tour record with dlrs 2,066,833 in earnings and won
five events, including an international tournament in Thailand.
	   ``Last year I won five times, this year I've only won twice,''
he said. ``From a winning standpoint, it hasn't been as good a
year, but from a finishing standpoint it's so much better. My
stroke average is better. Overall, I've had more top-10 finishes.
My play in the majors is better. If you look at the whole package,
you can see I've performed a lot better than I did last year.''
	   He currently stands fourth on the money list with slightly more
than dlrs 1.5 million.

Report: BHP talks to jailed East Timor leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ BHP Co. Ltd.'s senior oil
representative in Indonesia made a secret visit to a Jakarta prison
for talks with the jailed East Timorese resistance leader Xanana
Gusmano, reports said Thursday.
	   According to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and on
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, the guerrilla leader, serving
time in Cipinang Prison for political reasons, is believed to have
assured BHP that an independent East Timor would honor during an
interim period the rights awarded to mining companies under the
controversial 1989 Timor Gap Treaty.
	   Under the treaty, Indonesia and Australia agreed to divide oil
tracts between East Timor and Australia into three sections, taking
one each and sharing revenues from the middle one.
	   The East Timorese rebels say the treaty is illegal. They would
like an independent East Timor to benefit from oil recovered off
its coast.
	   Diplomatic sources told the newspaper the meeting is believed to
have taken place last week. But a BHP spokesman told the paper that
the visit by Peter Cockroft wasn't BHP-sanctioned but rather a
``private visit.''
	   ``It doesn't really imply anything on what we think about the
treaty or any political statement at all,'' said the BHP spokesman,
who was not named.
	   Gusmao, leader of the Fretilin resistance group, was captured in
1992 and jailed for life for fighting against Indonesian control of
East Timor.

Defending champion Bjorkman unseated

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Greg Rusedski returned to the RCA
Championships in fine fashion Wednesday. Defending champion Jonas
Bjorkman did not.
	   Rusedski, playing for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury at Wimbledon in June, upheld his No. 3 seed by sweeping
Sweden's Magnus Larsson, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3.
	   Bjorkman, the No. 4 seed, lost his confidence and his
second-round match with Australia's Jason Stoltenberg 7-5, 6-3. His
ouster was the tournament's second major upset, following Thomas
Johansson's Tuesday elimination of second-seeded Carlos Moya, the
1997 runnerup.
	   Also on Wednesday, Albert Costa, Alberto Berasategui, Cedric
Pioline and Felix Mantilla, seeds seven through 10, respectively,
lost to unseeded opponents.
	   The hard-serving Rusedski recovered from a slow start to cruise
through the first-set tiebreaker, then broke Larsson in the fifth
game of the second set. En route, he served up three straight 132
mph aces, and notched a match-high 135 mph serve in the sixth game.
	   ``Today was the big server, shall we speak, coming out,'' said
Rusedski, owner of the fastest serve in ATP history at 149 mph. He
had 14 aces against Larsson in his first appearance at the
Indianapolis Tennis Center since 1995.
	   ``I thought I didn't serve as well as I could in the beginning,
but then I started to get my pop more in the second set, and I
started hitting a few more aces,'' he said. ``It's great that the
ankle held up. It's just great to be back.''
	   Stoltenberg ousted Bjorkman by winning a break-filled first set,
then broke service in the eighth game of the second set.
	   ``When I got that (second-set) break, Jonas got a little down,
and I don't think he played as well as he can,'' Stoltenberg said.
``But you know, I feel like I played pretty well.''
	   ``I'm not enjoying going out on the court, and I'm thinking
negative almost since I lost the first break,'' Bjorkman said.
``It's hard for me to start thinking positive. I'm just thinking
negative, and I actually don't even care if I win or lose.
	   ``I have a lot of questions to myself, but I have no answers.''
	   In Wednesday's other matches, sixth-seeded Alex Corretja of
Spain outlasted Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 7-5.
	   Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi was to play Michael Tebbutt in a night
match.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Pete Sampras, still haunted by a
3-day-old controversial call, allowed Lleyton Hewitt to break him
twice and force a tiebreaker before dismissing the young Australian
6-1, 7-6 (7-4) to advance to the third round of the Pilot Pen
International Wednesday.
	   Sampras, the No. 1 seed, dropped the first game of the match,
serving, and later said he was having trouble acclimating himself
to his first appearence in New Haven.
	   ``My tennis will get better. I certainly hope it will get
better,'' he said, after the 1 hour, 12 minute duel.
	   Sampras also said he was dwelling on Sunday's loss to Patrick
Rafter in the finals of the ATP Championship in Cincinnati, which
placed in jeopardy his goal to end the year at No. 1 in the world.
The match ended on a serve by Rafter that was first called out,
then ruled an ace by the umpire.
	   ``I don't like losing matches. I don't like losing, period,
especially that way,'' he said, adding that he most wants to play
Rafter this week.
	   Rafter, seeded second, was slated to play Jeff Tarango in a
night match. Rafter, ranked No. 3 in the world, and Sampras would
meet in the tournament finals.
	   Hewitt, whom Sampras called an up-and-coming player in need of a
big weapon, said he was overwhelmed by the Wimbledon champion's
serve. Sampras rocketed 12 aces, consistently serving faster than
120 mph.
	   Hewitt had beaten Andre Agassi earlier in the year to win the
Australian Hardcourt Championships. He had said his goal in playing
Sampras was to stay relaxed. But after falling behind 4-1 in the

UNSCOM asking Iraq to resume cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous; ADDS context in top 3 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector has sent
a letter to Iraq requesting that it resume cooperation with the
United Nations and that weapons experts be allowed to search for
banned weapons, council sources said Wednesday.
	   The letter from Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, made no warning that any searches were imminent, an
indication that Butler was seeking an unprovocative first step in
reestablishing cooperation with Baghdad that has been frozen since
Aug. 5.
	   The letter, sent to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister on Wednesday,
came after the Security Council earlier this week gave Butler only
general backing for trying to carry about his work and not the
clear instructions he had sought in the face of Baghdad's defiance.
	   According to the diplomatic sources, who had seen the letter,
Butler said ``I would appreciate receiving your government's
confirmation that Iraq is now prepared to extend the cooperation
which is necessary.''
	   ``Only a response from Iraq would enable the Commission to plan
the required steps,'' in carrying out inspections, the sources told
The Associated Press, quoting from the letter.
	   It asked that Iraq resume cooperation with inspections and
technical talks that have been frozen since Baghdad announced Aug.
5 that it was ceasing cooperation because Butler refused to certify
that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Inspectors must make that certification before the Security
Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990 after Baghdad invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   The council was to conduct a regular review of sanctions on
Thursday, but there was widespread consensus that no movement was
expected considering the recent standoff.
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah was on
his way back to New York after failing to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with inspectors. Shah was tentatively scheduled to
brief the council on Monday.
	   Butler's memo cited the letter he received from the council
earlier in the week encouraging inspectors to try to go about their
work, the sources said.
	   By advising Aziz of UNSCOM's desire to get back to inspections,
Butler ``is making it absolutely clear that UNSCOM is not in the
business of being provocative,'' said one diplomatic source.
	   ``It's a totally neutral letter, but it poses the question `do
you intend to cooperate,''' the source said.
	   The impasse, and Shah's failure to bring about a change of heart
from the Iraqi leadership, has prompted Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to agree to get more involved in the impasse, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   Annan spoke by telephone to Aziz from Lisbon, where he was
visiting last week, U.N. officials said, speaking on condition they
not be named.
	   Annan brokered a February accord that defused the last crisis
with Iraq _ over inspectors' access to presidential palaces. But at
the time, he had U.S. and British threats of force to back his
diplomatic efforts.
	   ``It's our view that the Iraqis repudiated the Memorandum of
Understanding,'' which Annan brokered in February, U.S. Ambassador
Bill Richardson said Wednesday.
	   ``And we believe that with his skill and his diplomatic efforts,
they should be engaged again to resolve this crisis,'' he said.
	   Annan was vacationing in West Africa and wasn't due back in New
York until Sept. 4.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.

Venezuela's president wants more power in fiscal crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's president will ask
Congress for increased power to alleviate a fiscal crisis caused by
falling international oil prices.
	   President Rafael Caldera wants the power to make into law
several bills that the government contends are bogged down in
Congress.
	   Officials said Wednesday the so-called enabling law would likely
be aimed at four pieces of economic legislation: a bill to
introduce a value-added tax; a refinancing bill to alleviate
foreign debt payments; a bill to reform the social security system;
and a bill to establish a macroeconomic stabilization fund, which
would provide revenue when oil prices are down.
	   Oil accounts for more than three-quarters of Venezuela's export
income and about 60 percent of all government revenue. Officials
have already slashed this year's budget by dlrs 1.6 billion as a
result of lower oil prices, which have fallen by more than 40
percent this year.
	   ``I think that it is probable that Congress will approve the
measure,'' said Congressman Francisco Gonzalez.
	   He said the enabling law already had the backing of Venezuela's
second largest party, Copei. However, Democratic Action, the
biggest congressional party, is still undecided, he said.
	   It wasn't immediately clear when the enabling law would be
submitted to Congress.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The stock market ended a sloppy, thin session on
a down note Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrials losing a
fight to extend a two-day rally that had repaired about a third of
the damage suffered in a month-long slide from record highs. The
Dow fell 21.37 points _ or 0.25 percent _ at 8,693.28, after
bouncing between negative and positive territory all day. The
broad-market indexes were mixed. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday after
a senior Japanese official warned anew that Japan's central bank
was close to intervening in global currency markets to bolster its
sagging currency. The dollar initially rose against the German mark
as a central bank official said interest rates in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe would remain steady. But the dollar fell once
the market decided there wasn't enough force behind the comments.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 143.93 yen, down
from 145.00 late Tuesday. It also was trading at 1.7975 marks, down
from 1.8015 marks. (US-DOLLAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Under pressure from international investors, the
Russian government postponed plans Wednesday to restructure its
debt _ a move that had been expected to shortchange foreigners. The
government's new deputy prime minister for economic policy, Boris
Fyodorov, said Russia wanted to avoid angering foreigners who put
their money into Russian treasury bills and who still could face
steep losses. The announcement came on a day of generally gloomy
economic news in Russia, which effectively devalued the ruble on
Monday in the face of a mounting debt crisis. The government said
industrial output in July fell by as much as 9.4 percent from the
year before, while overall output fell by 4.5 percent. The news was
especially discouraging since Russian output had just begun to grow
at the end of last year following years of steep decline.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ German chemical giant Hoechst AG reported mixed
results Wednesday, with quarterly profits up but revenues down
sharply as it shifts away from the bulk chemicals business to
become a ``life sciences'' group focusing on pharmaceuticals and
nutrition. As part of that strategy, Hoechst announced an agreement
in principle to sell its paint and coatings subsidiary, Herberts
GmbH, Wuppertal, for 3 billion Deutsche marks (dlrs 1.67 billion)
to U.S. buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. Hoechst
said its net income for the three months ending June 30 rose 80
percent to 693 million marks (dlrs 385 million), compared with
profits of 384 million marks in the same period a year earlier.
Hoechst attributed the big increase to one-time gains from sales of
subsidiaries. (GERMANY-EARNS-HOECHST)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's biggest commercial bank
announced Wednesday it was cutting its lending rates by half a
percentage point, as prime rates at the country's top banks fell
below 15.25 percent for the first time in nine months. Bangkok Bank
said that effective Tuesday it had lowered its prime rate, or
minimum lending rate, to 15.00 percent from 15.50 percent. The
country's second-largest bank, state-owned Krung Thai Bank, lowered
its prime rate 0.25 percentage point to 15.00 percent effective
Wednesday. Commercial bank prime rates have come down in response
to a relaxation of central bank monetary policy in mid-June,
following the stabilization of the baht in foreign exchange
markets. (THAILAND-INTEREST RATES)
	   LONDON (AP) _ A newspaper reported Wednesday that British
Aerospace PLC held secret talks about rebuilding Libya's civil
aviation industry, prompting shares to rally on speculation such a
deal might be lucrative. British Aerospace complained that a
British tabloid, The Express, had ``created an issue which does not
exist'' in a front-page story suggesting the company stood to gain
6 billion pounds (dlrs 9.7 billion) in business with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi. But British Aerospace acknowledged it had been in
touch with a Libyan intermediary who inquired about whether the
company might be interested in aviation contracts with Libya.
Libya's airlines and airports have fallen into disrepair as a
result of U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. (BRITISH AEROSPACE-LIBYA)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's apartment from before her
marriage to Prince Charles has failed to attract a buyer after
three months on the market.
	   Hundreds have toured the three-bedroom apartment in the
expensive Knightsbridge area of west London, where Diana lived
until the night before her engagement was announced.
	   But no buyers for the flat have come forward, said Jonathan
Blaksley of real estate agent John Taylor.
	   The asking price for the property, which was an 18th birthday
present from Diana's parents in July 1979, is 450,000 pounds (dlrs
738,000) _ more than eight times what her family originally paid.
	   Diana, divorced in 1996 and killed in a car crash nearly a year
ago, once said her happiest days were spent in the apartment.
Describing it in Andrew Morton's book ``Diana, Her True Story,''
the princess said: ``I laughed my head off there.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have made big
donations to a D-Day museum scheduled to open here in two years.
	   The museum's founder, historian and author Stephen Ambrose,
wouldn't provide exact amounts but said the donations are for
hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
	   The money will help the museum open on its target date of June
6, 2000 _ the 56th anniversary of the Normandy invasion.
	   ``I myself am giving dlrs 500,000 and these guys are in the
ballpark,'' Ambrose said.
	   Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' starring Hanks, brings home
the horror of the invasion in graphic detail. Ambrose, who wrote
the bestseller ``D-Day,'' was a consultant on the movie.
	   Spielberg was on vacation Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Hanks did
not return a faxed message.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Wesley Snipes says the new movie ``Blade'' is
his bid at creating a franchise black action hero.
	   ``I'm not as concerned about (being typecast as an action hero)
as I used to be,'' said Snipes, one of the producers.
	   ``There are only two cats who can do it. That's me and Mel
Gibson. And Kurt Russell can still do it. I think they have a few
years in them,'' he said in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times.
	   The movie opens Friday.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Hoping to get young voters to say ``yes
... oh, YES!'' to their party, the youth wing of the governing
Social Democrats sent out a video showing a passionate couple in
bed.
	   But some recipients are saying ``No, oh, no.''
	   ``I was really alarmed and at first thought that someone had
filmed a pal of mine in bed,'' Therese Tagesson, 21, was quoted as
saying Wednesday by the newspaper Expressen.
	   The video was sent with no return address to about 120,000
Swedes who have their first chance to vote in a national election
Sept. 20.
	   It shows a couple in bed and young people talking about their
``first time.'' Then Mona Sahlin, a top party figure, discusses
first-time voting.
	   The video presents politics ``with a glint in the eye,''
youth-wing chairman Niklas Nordstroem told the Swedish news agency
TT.
	   ``Those who consider it pornographic must have awfully drab
lives,'' he said.

	   WEST TISBURY, Massachusetts (AP) _ At least one person who
greeted President Bill Clinton as he began his vacation after his
disclosure in the Monica Lewinsky matter provided the chief
executive some solace.
	   A Parisian cardiologist, Jerard Premmereur, ran into the first
family at Martha's Vineyard Airport when his flight to Boston was
delayed by their arrival Tuesday.
	   ``He looked into my eyes and I said, 'Mr. President, I am French
(and) you are an inspiration to us all,''' Premmereur told the Cape
Cod Times.
	   ``He said, 'Thank you very much,' and shook my hand.''
	   Premmereur did not elaborate on what he meant by an
``inspiration,'' but he did note, in talking to a reporter, that
many people in his country view sexual dalliances as a sign of good
health.

Indonesian military struggles to shed Suharto-linked image
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JAK106 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Clustered outside an Indonesian
courthouse, students clapped when they heard a judge convict two
policemen in the killings of campus protesters. Seconds later, they
groaned in disappointment when the sentences were announced.
	   The Indonesian military judge sentenced the officers to four
years and 10 months in prison for failing to control troops accused
of gunning down four students at a pro-democracy rally in May. The
crowd called the punishment too soft.
	   In a flurry of internal trials and probes, Indonesia's military
_ the most stable institution in a fragile land _ has embarked on a
campaign to atone for abuses under its authoritarian boss, former
President Suharto.
	   Critics, however, say the investigations are cosmetic, focusing
largely on lower-ranking scapegoats in a bid to appease demands for
reform.
	   The military is counseling patience, saying those who allegedly
shot the student protesters earlier this year are under arrest and
will be punished harshly if convicted.
	   The 490,000-member military, which includes the police, is
harried by more than just a lousy image as Indonesia buckles under
economic hardship. Budget cuts are diminishing the ability of the
armed forces to keep order in this archipelago nation of 200
million people.
	   Yet the military is still widely viewed as the only force that
can preserve unity in a country ravaged by inflation and
joblessness.
	   In May, as many as 1,200 people were killed in riots in the
capital. Some of Jakarta's anti-riot units were hundreds of miles
(kilometers) away in the city of Medan, where street violence had
broken out earlier.
	   The unrest loosened Suharto's grasp on power and his successor,
B.J. Habibie, has ushered in an enthusiastic, if at times unruly,
experiment with democracy.
	   In Indonesia's new era of reform, the military is under scrutiny
as never before.
	   Anxious to shed a legacy of suppressing dissent, armed forces
chief Gen. Wiranto has launched two high-profile investigations:
	   _ With two already convicted, another 16 police officers face
trial in the shooting deaths of the student protesters at Jakarta's
Trisakti University.
	   _ Ten members of Indonesia's special forces have been arrested
for alleged involvement in the kidnapping and torture of more than
two dozen activists. Also under investigation is Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, son-in-law of Suharto and former head of the elite unit.
	   But government opponents fear other commanders possibly linked
to the kidnappings will not be targeted. And 14 activists remain
missing and are feared dead.
	   ``Prabowo, of course, did not do it by himself. There was some
networking by the army,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent opposition
figure who believes civilian prosecutors should investigate the
military's entire command structure.
	   ``This is only a political joke,'' he said.
	   The panel of military officers investigating the abductions,
known as the ``honor council,'' has barred the public from
hearings.
	   A host of other accusations taint the military, including
alleged arbitrary killings and torture in several provinces that
harbor small bands of separatist rebels.
	   In Aceh province, Wiranto publicly apologized for military
abuses and said he would pull out some troops, as he has done in
the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   The armed forces also faces calls to reduce its dominant role in
politics and give up authority over the police.
	   There has been little resistance within the military to
housecleaning by Wiranto, who over the last few months has demoted
or replaced rivals, including Prabowo.
	   But some rank-and-file soldiers are bewildered that punishment
is suddenly being meted out for actions condoned under Suharto.
	   At a recent meeting, a group of retired military officers told
Wiranto, once a personal adjutant to Suharto, that he was too slow
with reforms.
	   ``You must have patience. I cannot accomplish this overnight,''
Wiranto was quoted as saying repeatedly by Hasnan Habib, an ex-army
general and former ambassador to the United States.
	   Wiranto is respected as honest, but even he may end up a target.
Human rights activists say he should explain why security forces
reacted slowly to the May riots.
	   A government panel, including military officials, is
investigating whether elements in the armed forces incited the
riots.

Japan's trade surplus rises for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 56.8
percent in July for the 16th straight month of increase, the
government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.316 trillion yen (dlrs 9.14 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The increase in the surplus _ which is measured as goods pass
customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors _ was slightly
lower than economists had forecast.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, continued to climb, rising 59.7 percent to 669.72
billion yen (dlrs 4.7 billion). It was the 22nd straight month of
increase.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.

Mexico kidnappers arrested after victim writes note to pharmacist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City police arrested two kidnappers
Wednesday after their hostage passed a secret note to a pharmacist.
	   Alejandro Ramirez Juarez, a 20-year-old hardware store owner,
was kidnapped Tuesday night at a bar by two men who claimed to be
cousins of Daniel Arizmendi, a notorious kidnapper known for
cutting off his victims' ears.
	   While they held Ramirez overnight behind the bar, the men called
his family and demanded dlrs 150,000 in ransom, but never got any
response, Ramirez said. So they took him to a bank, where he
withdrew 25,000 pesos _ almost dlrs 3,000.
	   The kidnappers took Ramirez to lunch Wednesday while they
decided how to get more money out of him, he said. Ramirez then
began passing notes to waiters at the restaurant in a Mexico City
department store.
	   ``I was sending out little messages saying I was being
kidnapped, but they didn't understand me. They thought I was drunk
or something,'' he said.
	   Finally, Ramirez passed a note to a pharmacist working next to
the restaurant, who then called police.
	   Police said the kidnappers didn't appear to be related to
Arizmendi, who was arrested late Monday following a nine-month
manhunt.

Australia brings proposals to IOC doping meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: news conference scheduled for around 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Calling doping the biggest threat
to the Olympics since the political boycotts of the 1980s,
Australian officials offered a series of proposals Thursday to stem
the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Kicking drug-ridden sports out of the Olympics, imposing
financial penalties on drug cheats and setting up a special IOC
anti-doping agency were among the Australian recommendations.
	   The proposals were being submitted to the International Olympic
Committee executive board, which convened an emergency meeting to
address the spiraling drug problem and prepare for a worldwide
doping summit in January.
	   Both meetings were called by IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch after a summer of doping scandals which rocked the Tour
de France, track and field, swimming and other sports.
	   Samaranch fueled controversy himself by stating, in a Spanish
newspaper interview, that the list of banned drugs should be
slashed and only substances which are hazardous to an athlete's
health should be prohibited.
	   Samaranch's comment, which appeared to favor a relaxation in the
anti-drugs fight, stunned the Olympic world and put him in conflict
with some of his top aides.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, who as chairman of the IOC medical
commission has led the anti-doping campaign for 31 years, said he
was ``aghast'' at Samaranch's remarks.
	   ``People who want to reduce the (banned) list are the people who
want to let doping continue,'' de Merode told the French newspaper
Le Figaro.
	   In a startling allegation, de Merode said that Samaranch, who is
Spanish, was backing the philosophy of many doctors in Spain who
``have rejected the ethics of their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said.
	   The Spanish Olympic Committee said Tuesday it would demand de
Merode's resignation unless he retracted his accusations.
	   Though he is no longer on the IOC executive board, de Merode was
attending Thursday's meeting and was expected to clear the air with
Samaranch.
	   ``A lot of people are hoping (de Merode) might retire,''
Australian IOC member Phil Coles said. ``He's been there such a
long time. You never know what he's going to say.''
	   The doping issue is particularly prominent in Australia, which
will stage the next Olympics in Sydney in 2000.
	   ``This is the most serious cross-roads we have faced since the
political boycotts of the 1970s and 1980s,'' said Kevan Gosper,
Australia's IOC executive board member.
	   Gosper said he was presenting a 10-point plan for the summit,
including encouraging government law enforcement agencies to
prosecute drug producers and traffickers and putting pressure on
drug manufacturers to help control the spread of steroids and other
performance-enhancers.
	   Gosper also proposed that athletes caught using banned drugs
should face financial sanctions, including fines and loss of prize
money and sponsorships.
	   Gosper suggested that any sports federations which don't comply
with the IOC's anti-doping policies could be suspended from future
Olympics.
	   ``It's a matter of compliance or non-compliance,'' he said. ``If
sports are not complying, they have to face the possibility of
suspension.''
	   Five years ago, the IOC brokered an agreement committing all
Olympic sports federations to unify their anti-doping rules,
procedures and sanctions _ or risk the possibility of being kicked
out of the games. But the accord has achieved only limited success
and the IOC has backed off its threat of expulsion.
	   Gosper proposed that the IOC should consider creating its own
permanent agency to coordinate the fight against drugs for all
Olympic sports.
	   At present, the IOC is directly responsible for drug testing
only during the Olympic Games themselves, with sports federations
controlling the testing and sanctions the rest of the time.
	   But Gosper said the proposed IOC agency could handle
out-of-competition drug testing for a select number of elite
athletes, while leaving the rest of the doping controls to the
federations.
	   ``My idea is that the IOC has sufficient experience and
credibility to assume this role,'' Gosper said.

Arron likely to challenge American sprinting supremacy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be updated by 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The next challenge to the American
sprinting supremacy may come from a young French woman with
orange-dyed hair.
	   The color of her hair is not the only thing that distinguishes
Christine Arron. She also has tremendous acceleration.
	   The 24-year-old Guadeloupe native overcame a slow start to win
the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the European Championship,
setting a new continental record of 10.73 seconds.
	   That was just outside the 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by the U.S.
star and world champion Marion Jones. Jones has run each time twice
this year.
	   Both still have a lot to go before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner set in 1988.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year at the worlds,'' Arron said.
	   If Arron is closing in on Jones, the European men are still way
behind the North Americans.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles and the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   But Campbell was quick to issue a challenge.
	   ``I am No. 1 in Europe now. This is one of the stepping stones
that Linford and I have planned so that we can take on the
Americans seriously,'' the 24-year-old Briton said.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start.
But with her powerful stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the
last 20 meters and stole the title and the European record from the
Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   ``It was a difficult race for me because Privalova had a very
good start,'' Arron said.
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 record was 10.77.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   Arron's performance overshadowed the British triumph in the
men's dash.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   ``Linford has prepared me brilliantly for this,'' Campbell said.
``I knew I was going to win it. I wasn't surprised I won and I
wasn't nervous out there, in fact I felt really cool. I knew after
I was in contention at 60 meters the race would be mine.
	   ``My start was a little bit dodgy but I knew I would be strong
at the end.
	   ``I was really pleased Dwain was second. We said in the call-up
room it would be a one-two, but we didn't know who would win,''
Campbell said.
	   Other gold medals of the day went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 8.28 meters to win men's long jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 31:29.33;
Tibor Gescek of Hungary in the men's hammer throw with a heave of
82.87; and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at
69.10.

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Paraguay's minister of industry and
business, who is also the president's brother, has resigned _ one
day after the new head of state freed a former presidential
candidate.
	   Raul Cubas' first official act after taking office Saturday was
to release former army Gen. Lino Oviedo, who some in the ruling
Colorado Party feared would seek revenge against those who put him
in jail.
	   ``Cubas said the country needed to live in peace,'' said
legislator Juan Carlos Galaverna Wednesday. ``But yesterday, he
freed the man that could begin a diabolical plan to persecute
everyone who he thinks is not with him.''
	   Top officials of the Colorado Party, which has been in power
since 1947, voted to withdraw their support for Cubas.
	   ``I present my resignation because I do not agree with the
process of how my brother freed General Oviedo,'' Carlos Cubas
said. ``Oviedo's freedom could run the risk of being illegal.''
	   Bader Rachid, a top party official, said some members were
considering ways to impeach the president.
	   Oviedo, who took part in bringing Paraguay's 34-year military
dictatorship to an end, was the Colorado Party's original
presidential nominee.
	   Cubas assumed the candidacy after a military tribunal sentenced
Oviedo to 10 years in prison for refusing then-President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy's order to resign as commander of the army in 1996.
	   Raul Cubas has been quick to acknowledge his close relationship
with Oviedo, who is extremely popular in Paraguay's countryside,
where key voters helped keep the Colorado Party in power.
	   Raul Cubas defended his decision to release Oviedo, saying
Wednesday he campaigned on two pledges: to improve Paraguay's
serious financial crisis and fight for Oviedo's release.
	   He also said he consulted with national and international
judicial organizations who confirmed the legality of his decision.
	   ``I've used the constitutional power given to presidents to
fulfill a campaign promise,'' he said. ``What I legally decreed
yesterday does not differ from my campaign promise.''
	   The 54-year-old Oviedo claimed before the May presidential
elections that he was ``victim of persecution'' and said his
jailing was Wasmosy's way of keeping him from governing.
	   Raul Cubas has said he expects Oviedo to serve as ``a friend of
the government.''

On post-Cold War stage, Castro plays elderly Caribbean statesman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Half a century ago,
Fidel Castro tried to reach the Dominican Republic in a boat filled
with armed revolutionaries intent on ousting the military dictator
in Santo Domingo.
	   On Thursday, Castro arrives on his first trip to the Dominican
Republic since becoming Cuba's leader in 1959.
	   Playing elder statesman on a smaller stage than he sought during
the Cold War, Castro is championing the neglected causes of his
Caribbean neighbors at a 16-nation summit this week.
	   Coming off a triumphant Caribbean tour in which he railed
against the dangers unbridled capitalism poses to small island
states, Castro will get a warm reception. Shunning Washington's
isolation of the 72-year-old Castro, the Caribbean Community trade
bloc and the Dominican Republic say it's time to bring communist
Cuba back into the fold.
	   Many of the area's countries have recently renewed trade and
diplomatic ties with Cuba _ most recently the Dominican Republic,
which restored full relations in April after a 34-year lapse.
	   They want Cuba to help them bargain for aid and trade incentives
for their banana and sugar exports to the European Union.
	   Anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the United States are using the
occasion to condemn his human rights record _ and Caribbean
democracies for embracing him.
	   ``Once again we are raising our voice to repudiate the attitude
of democratic governments for inviting a dictator,'' declared the
Casa Jose Marti, a Puerto Rico-based exile group that said its
members would go protest in Santo Domingo.
	   On Wednesday, the organization asked Dominican authorities for
permission to fly a plane over Santo Domingo floating a banner
declaring, ``Fidel Castro: dictator and assassin.''
	   Dominican police last week said they arrested a man in a Castro
assassination plot, while The Miami Herald reported a similar
purported plot by Cuban exiles. The U.S. Embassy warned in July of
a plot to bomb an airliner serving Santo Domingo and Havana.
	   The tensions have led to increased security measures, including
bomb-sniffing Cuban dog squads and Dominican riot police.
	   Sergio Ramos, a Puerto Rico-based Cuban exile, accused the
Dominican and Cuban governments of fomenting a scare to depict
``every Cuban opposed to Castro's tyranny as a terrorist.''
	   Officials of the Caribbean Community, a dlrs 18 billion market,
hope to gently press Castro Friday and Saturday to enact political
reforms. The summit, said spokesman Leonard Robertson, follows
``our policy of dialogue and constructive engagement with Cuba.''
	   Castro is expected to steal the show during a five-day trip that
will also take him to northwestern Monte Cristi, where Cuban
patriot Jose Marti and Dominican Gen. Maximo Gomez signed an 1895
pact to seek Cuba's independence from Spain.
	   Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, who has worked closely
with Washington on trade, drug trafficking and money laundering,
has criticized the U.S. embargo of Cuba.
	   Fernandez's political party has long ties to Cuba; its founder,
former Dominican President Juan Bosch, was once exiled there and
led the failed 1947 expedition in which Castro took part. The boat
was stopped and the dissidents disbanded before they left Cuban
waters.
	   Caribbean nations once wary of Castro's revolutionary designs
now feel safe embracing him _ especially at a time when Washington
has slashed aid to the region.
	   Nowhere is the rapprochement more apparent than in the Dominican
Republic, which lies just 160 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of
Cuba and shares strong cultural and historical ties.
	   Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican Republic
after his ouster by Castro on Jan. 1, 1959. In June 1959, Castro
sponsored a small invasion against then-Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo, whose military annihilated the force of some 200
Dominican exiles and a few Cubans. Two months later, Trujillo
backed Cuban exiles in a frustrated attempt to overthrow Castro.

Cuba's Ana Fidelia Quirot surprises with poor showing in 800-meter
</HEADLINE>
run &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC NUNEZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela, (AP) - Cuba's Ana Fidelia Quirot finished
an unexpected fourth place in the 800-meter run Wednesday at the
Central American and Caribbean Games, the biggest surprise yet of
the two-week competition.
	   The winner of the 800 was Suriname's Letitia Vriesde who
finished at 2:00.24, beating Mexico's Ana Gabriela Guevara and
Jamaica's Mardrea Hyman.
	   Quirot, who lost to Vriesde at the Ponce Games in Puerto Rico
five years ago, finished fourth place with 2:02.46.
	   Mexico maintained its lead in the walks competitions with a
victory by Ignacio Zamudio in the 50-kilometer walk. Registering a
time of 3:58.15, he beat Guatemala's Hugo Lopez by some 2,000
meters.
	   It was Mexico's third gold medal in the walking competitions.
	   Also Wednesday, Mexico earned a gold medal in the 200-meter run
with a victory by Juan Pedro Toledo over Cuban Misael Ortiz.
	   Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica beat Andrea Balckett
of Barbados in the 400 meter with hurdles for women.
	   Jamaica also proved its supremacy in the sprinting competition
with a victory by Morgan Deinsdale in the 400 with hurdles for men
and a win by Beverly McDonald in the 200 for women.
	   Cuba's Norberto Tellez won the gold in the 800.
	   Cuba has already clinched the championship in the games with a
total of 135 medals, including 62 silver and 55 bronze medals.
	   Mexico is in second place with 49 medals and Venezuela, the host
country, is in third place with 43 medals.

Congolese rebels say they are ready to negotiate cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ The surprise offer by a rebel coalition to
negotiate a cease-fire with Congo's government is the first time
the rebels have indicated they are willing to deal with President
Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of corruption.
	   The rebels' surprise move Wednesday after two weeks of rapid
military advances in which they captured key towns in eastern Congo
and opened a second front in the west.
	   ``We believe the solution to this problem is a political
solution,'' Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, told reporters in Goma,
a main rebel base in eastern Congo. The rebels are a coalition of
ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disaffected members of
Kabila's army.
	   ``Our organization has decided that we want to even negotiate a
cease-fire with Mr. Kabila,'' said Karaha, who was Kabila's foreign
minister until shortly before the rebellion began Aug. 2.
	   Kabila's information minister, Didier Mumengi, said he had not
discussed the offer with the Congolese president, but he believed
the government would only negotiate with representatives of Uganda
and Rwanda, which Congo accuses of masterminding the rebellion.
	   ``We will not negotiate with the instruments of Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Mumengi said in Kinshasa.
	   It was not clear what caused the sudden rebel shift, although it
came shortly after four southern African countries announced
support for Kabila's government and Zimbabwe said it would send
troops to support Kabila _ moves that threatened to embroil the
region in war.
	   In Ethiopia, the Organization of African Unity also said it
backed Kabila and urged the rebels to lay down their weapons.
	   Kabila, who remains in the southern city of Lubumbashi, has
accused Uganda and Rwanda of sending troops, tanks and supplies to
aid the rebels. The two countries helped Kabila oust former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 15 months ago.
	   But both countries have become disillusioned with Kabila's
inability to bring stability to Congolese territory along their
common border. Although they deny backing the rebels, Uganda and
Rwanda are widely believed to be giving them support.
	   Karaha provided no details of the negotiation offer, but said
Kabila would have to ``recognize'' the rebel movement before talks
could begin.
	   ``Kabila doesn't even recognize that we exist. Maybe he'll
recognize that we exist once (we're) in Kinshasa,'' Karaha said,
adding that whether Kabila remains president also would be part of
the negotiations.
	   He also welcomed mediation by a third country.
	   Emboldened by the backing of its neighbors, Kabila's government
had said it was mounting counterstrikes against the rebels.
	   Mumengi announced several loyalist bombing runs on the western
rebel stronghold of Kitona. The rebels had earlier dismissed the
claim of air strikes.
	   The reported bombing raids and a planned drop of paratroopers
behind enemy lines came as rebel forces were moving to take
Mbanza-Ngungu, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Kinshasa.

Japan's trade surplus rises for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rising exports and falling imports pushed Japan's
trade surplus with the world 56.8 percent higher in July for the
16th straight month of increase, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.316 trillion yen (dlrs 9.14 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The increase in the surplus _ which is measured as goods pass
customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors _ was slightly
lower than economists had forecast.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, continued to climb, rising 59.7 percent to 669.72
billion yen (dlrs 4.7 billion). It was the 22nd straight month of
increase.
	   With the world, exports in July rose 6.6 percent, while imports
fell 5.7 percent. Imports from the United States managed a slim 0.9
percent increase, but were far outpaced by exports from Japan,
which rose 21.5 percent.
	   Exports to the European Union soared 174.5 percent, but
shipments to the crisis hit economies of Asia declined 36.2
percent.
	   Within Asia, exports to the countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, which have been most effected by the Asian
downturn, fell 63 percent in July.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has also come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   Repeating recent assertions, the ministry said that while the
trade surplus was expected to continue growing for now, the
long-term outlook was for the pace of growth to slow down.

New military chief faces fresh challenges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In Turkey, few institutions are as
unchanging as the powerful military, which has guided this country
since it was founded 75 years ago.
	   In any other Western-oriented state, changing the military guard
is often a routine political event. But in a country where the army
calls the shots, the military's appointment of a new armed forces
chief of staff often serves as a political barometer for where
Turkey will go during his four-year term.
	   Known as the ``diplomat pasha,'' Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, 64,
will take control of NATO's second largest army on Aug. 28 from the
hawkish Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
	   Pasha is a title of respect harking back to Ottoman times, and
Kivrikoglu is considered a diplomat for his years of foreign
experience. First as a major general serving at NATO's multi-ethnic
headquarters in Belgium, and then in the mid-1990's as head of the
alliance's land forces in southeastern Europe.
	   The tall, lanky Kivrikoglu seems the product of a
cradle-to-grave military system designed to create officers
fiercely loyal to the staunchly secular state founded by Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk in 1923.
	   ``People are saying that everything will be different under Gen.
Kivrikoglu. They will see that this will not happen. The policies
of the Turkish Armed Forces are not based on the personalities (of
its commanders). These policies are drawn up by the command line,''
Kivrikoglu was quoted by the daily Sabah as assuring fellow
officers.
	   But for all of Kivrikoglu's pledges, he may have to blur the
military's secular vision in order to face new challenges. He also
has a far more moderate reputation than his predecessor.
	   Turkey is straining to join the European Union, but large parts
of it _ especially those under emergency rule in the southeast _
remain bound to eastern traditions and efforts are needed to raise
living standards. In order to stem growing Islamic fundamentalism
in those areas and the rest of the country, the state may have to
show more religious tolerance.
	   Although the military insists on strict secularism, it realizes
it can't afford to alienate moderate Muslim swing voters.
	   By choosing the ``diplomat pasha,'' the military may be trying
to shore up the pro-secular Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his
Motherland Party to ensure that the Islamic Virtue Party does not
win next April's elections.
	   Virtue is the political and religious offspring of the banned
Welfare party and the Islamic-led government of former premier
Necmettin Erbakan, who was forced by the military to resign in June
1997.
	   Analysts say Yilmaz could have lost upcoming elections had the
military appointed another hawk as its leader.
	   After forcing Erbakan's resignation, the military prodded Yilmaz
into restricting religious schools and Koran courses and enforcing
a strict ban on wearing Islamic attire in public offices and
schools.
	   But Yilmaz worries a continuation of the military's hard-line
policies may cause widespread objections among the public and has
been reluctant to go any further.
	   The military is also fighting a war against Kurdish rebels in
the southeast. More than 37,000 people have been killed there since
1984.
	   Tensions are also high with Greece over the Aegean Sea and the
war-divided eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where Turkey
has threatened to use force to prevent deployment by Greek Cypriots
of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   A decision to strike will probably be taken by the military
alone, and Kivrikoglu will have to determine if the action is worth
a war with NATO ally Greece.
	   Kivrikoglu's tendency to keep a low profile during his army
command last year has led some to believe he will tone down the
military's staunchly secular position, even though a record number
of 120 officers purged this year for ties to Islamic groups came
from units under his command. The action apparently was aimed at
bolstering his conservative credentials.
	   Whatever the case, one thing is certain. No one will dare to
openly oppose whatever decisions are taken by Kivrikoglu and the
military.
	   ``The army's loyalty to these (secular) principles are an
assurance for Turkey,'' said President Suleyman Demirel. ``It is
wrong to regard this loyalty as interference in politics.''
	   Demirel should know. He had to twice step down as premier
because of military coups in 1971 and 1980, the year Kivrikoglu
rose to the rank of brigadier.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Thursday amid continued fear of possible intervention to support
the Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices fell moderately on
profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 143.80 yen in early trading, down 0.36 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 143.93 yen overnight.
	   Concern of possible yen-supportive intervention in foreign
exchange markets was keeping the dollar under pressure, dealers
said.
	   On Wednesday, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, warned that the
opportunity for yen-supportive intervention ``is getting near.''
	   Sakakibara, who arrived in the United States Wednesday to attend
a financial conference, is expected to meet with Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers.
	   The yen's strength also derived from a rise in the German mark
against the dollar Wednesday.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved lower as
investors took profits following a more than 600-point rise in the
main index over the past two days.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 141.26 points,
or 0.92 percent, to 15,265.08 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 342.55 points, or 2.27
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.29 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,178.42
points. The TOPIX closed up 16.99 points, or 1.46 percent, the day
before.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond stood at 1.195 percent,
unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its price was marginally lower
at 111.76 yen from 111.77 yen.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials are warning
that the ethnic violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo will
lead to many more deaths if allowed to continue into winter.
	   Hundreds have been killed since Serbs began a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in late February. The United
Nations estimates that more than 231,000 people have been uprooted
in the months since.
	   Without a peace settlement, the displacement of ethnic Albanians
will continue and probably increase, said Soeren Jessen Petersen, a
deputy to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, in Pristina on
Wednesday.
	   ``We would have many, many people dying during the coming
winter,'' Petersen said. ``Humanitarian action must not, once
again, as it happened in Bosnia for four or five years, become a
substitute for political action.''
	   Petersen said four things were needed to avert a major disaster:
a cessation of hostilities between Serb forces and separatist
rebels, followed by a political dialogue; better access to the area
by journalists and aid groups; allowing 170,000 people displaced
inside Kosovo and 50,000 forced outside the country to return home;
and more support for the U.N. aid operation.
	   Emma Bonino, the human rights commissioner for the European
Union, echoed those comments.
	   ``The international community must face the reality. There is no
way we can avert a catastrophe'' without a political solution, she
said Wednesday in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
	   In response to rising criticism of the Serb government offensive
in Kosovo, the official Tanjug news agency accused the Kosovo
Liberation Army on Wednesday of using civilians as human shields
while fighting government forces.
	   Earlier in the day, Bonino was stopped by ethnic Albanian
rebels, who refused to allow her convoy with journalists to reach
the disputed village of Cirez.
	   On the diplomatic front, U.S. envoys are pressing to arrange
direct talks between the Serb government and a Kosovo Albanian
delegation formed last week. But the leading ethnic Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, faces opposition because he does not
have the support of the rebels.
	   An aide to Rugova was in Switzerland on Wednesday seeking more
international help for the refugees. Alush Gashi estimated that at
least dlrs one million a day is needed to meet the basic needs of
the refugees.

Palestinians despair of Clinton scandal's effect on Middle East
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The controversy around U.S. President Bill
Clinton's admission of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky has left
Palestinians despairing that he will be politically powerless to
break the deadlock in the Mideast peace talks.
	   ``This means a weakening of the already almost-absent American
role,'' Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Amr said Wednesday on the
Voice of Palestine radio station. ``We should not expect any active
American role in the peace process.''
	   But a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Clinton's domestic troubles have no bearing on the negotiations.
	   ``The peace process has not been interrupted by the problem that
the president has had, and we expect it not to be interrupted in
the near future either,'' David Bar-Illan said.
	   The Palestinians have mostly blamed Netanyahu for the deadlock,
saying he is wasting time in hopes of wriggling out of his
commitment to hand over more land. The Palestinians have accepted a
U.S. plan for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent more of the West
Bank, but Netanyahu has rejected it, saying it endangers the
country's security.
	   The Lewinsky scandal, however, has seemed to intersect with
Middle East peacemaking from the start.
	   It was at an Oval Office news conference with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Jan. 22 that the president first fielded questions
about his relationship with Lewinsky.
	   Palestinians had hoped Clinton would use the opportunity to
castigate Israel for failing to agree to a larger troop pullback
from the West Bank.
	   Instead, with Arafat watching bemusedly, reporters peppered
Clinton with questions about whether he had had sex with the former
White House intern.
	   ``Since this story surfaced, the American administration has
been paralyzed, unable to react to Israeli intransigence,'' the
Palestinian newspaper Al Quds lamented Wednesday.
	   Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian political figure, said
Tuesday, ``The peace process has been paying the price of a shaken
president and the diversion of attention.''
	   Arafat, asked if Clinton's admission would impede American
efforts to advance the peace process, said only, ``We hope not.''
	   Some Israeli political analysts said the scandal has distracted
Clinton and kept him from dealing with important foreign policy
issues.
	   ``The greatest power in the world is not acting as a great
power,'' analyst Shlomo Avineri said.
	   Commentator Hami Shalev wrote in the Maariv newspaper that
Clinton has been preoccupied.
	   ``The president of the United States, the defender of the free
world, has simply stopped functioning,'' Shalev wrote.

	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) _ Pete Sampras, still haunted by a
3-day-old controversial call, allowed Lleyton Hewitt to break him
twice and force a tiebreaker before dismissing the young Australian
6-1, 7-6 (7-4) Wednesday and advancing to the third round of the
Pilot Pen International.
	   Sampras, the No. 1 seed, dropped the first game of the match,
serving, and later said he was having trouble acclimating himself
to his first appearance in New Haven.
	   ``My tennis will get better. I certainly hope it will get
better,'' he said, after the 72-minute duel.
	   Sampras also said he was still dwelling on Sunday's loss to
Patrick Rafter in the final of the ATP Championship in Cincinnati,
which placed in jeopardy his goal to end the year at No. 1 in the
world. The match ended on a serve by Rafter that was first called
out, then ruled an ace by the umpire.
	   ``I don't like losing matches. I don't like losing, period,
especially that way,'' he said, adding that he most wants to play
Rafter this week.
	   Rafter, seeded second, beat Jeff Tarango 6-2, 6-1 Wednesday
night to advance to the third round. Rafter, ranked No. 3 in the
world, and Sampras would meet in the tournament final.
	   Hewitt, whom Sampras called an up-and-coming player in need of a
big weapon, said he was overwhelmed by the Wimbledon champion's
serve. Sampras rocketed 12 aces, consistently serving faster than
120 mph.
	   Hewitt had beaten Andre Agassi earlier in the year to win the
Australian Hardcourt Championships. He had said his goal in playing
Sampras was to stay relaxed. But after falling behind 4-1 in the
first set and in the middle of dropping one of four service games,
the 17-year-old struck his racket on the court, breaking it.
	   ``I was a set down before I knew it,'' Hewitt said. ``At the
time you really don't know what to do.''
	   Also Wednesday, third-seeded Petr Korda defeated Andrei Medvedev
6-3, 2-6, 6-1. Korda, ranked No. 4 in the world, will face fellow
Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, seeded 13th.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champ, acknowledged he is the
favorite of the two.
	   ``I think he has nothing to lose. What I'm really looking for is
to play as well as I can before the U.S. Open,'' he said.
	   Defending Pilot Pen champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov demolished
Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-0, 6-3 in 48 minutes.
	   ``I never thought it would be so easy,'' he said.
	   Kafelnikov, the fifth-seed from Russia, advances to play No. 11
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who beat Alex O'Brien 6-3, 6-2.
	   In other matches, Davide Sanguinetti of Italy upset 12th-seeded
Fabrice Santoro of France 6-1, 6-7 (7-2), 7-5, and Britain's Tim
Henman, seeded sixth, advanced 6-2, 6-3 over Vincenzo Santopadre of
Italy.

Dive! Dive! Top-secret subs in northern Idaho!
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY368-NY371 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAYVIEW, Idaho (AP) _ Dave Pierce likes to play with model
boats.
	   Model submarines, actually _ up to 88 feet (26.8 meters) long.
	   A guy needs a very big bathtub for models on that scale, and the
Navy officer has just the place _ Lake Pend Oreille, which meanders
43 miles (70 kilometers) through the timbered slopes of the Selkirk
Mountains.
	   Pierce commands a submarine research base where, years after the
end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy is still perfecting the Hunt for
Red October.
	   Northern Idaho may seem an unlikely place for one of the
country's most advanced submarine test sites. But the Navy came for
the waters, said to be perfect for running silent and running deep.
	   The lake reaches depths of 1,100 feet (335 meters), with a
constant subsurface temperature of 39.5 degrees (4 C). Since
temperature affects the speed of sound, that steadiness is
important for taking consistent measurements of noise.
	   Because the government owns most of the land surrounding the
lake, there is little development along the forested shoreline. So
the area is ideal for testing submarine design. ``There is no lake
like this anywhere in the world,'' says Pierce, a lieutenant
commander.
	   And, despite the end of the Cold War, the Navy still has a job
to do, says Tom Warring, a spokesman for the Naval Surface Warfare
Center in Maryland.
	   ``The collapse of the Soviet Union doesn't mean subs are going
away,'' he says. ``Iranians own submarines. Indians own submarines.
There are a lot more submarine owners than there used to be.''
	   The Navy's acoustic research detachment plays a key role in the
quest for ever-quieter submarines. It's the only active-duty
remnant of the former Farragut Naval Training Center, established
during World War II to train 293,000 sailors.
	   The base covers just 22 acres (nine hectares) along the lake's
south end, near this resort community of 300 people. The fleet of
remote-controlled model submarines is housed in sheds built over
the lake.
	   Though model subs are deployed for weeks and tracked by
underwater microphones, they have almost no effect on recreational
boating. ``We test at night because there are fewer boats and the
winds die down,'' says Henry Netzer, the base's senior civilian
engineer.
	   Many tests are conducted in mid-lake, in 26 square miles (67
square kilometers) far from most people, he says. Occasionally
researchers ask boaters to leave if noise from their craft
threatens the tests.
	   ``By and large, the Navy here is real cooperative,'' says Kevin
Elmore, who works at a Bayview resort.
	   The Navy is good for business, says Ruby Tidwell, owner of the
Bayview Scenic Hotel. ``Navy personnel stay here. They can walk to
the motel.''
	   Over the years, the base's mission has sparked rumors and dark
fantasies. Some locals believe a secret underwater river provides
the gateway for full-sized subs from the Pacific Ocean, some 300
miles (480 kilometers) away. Another legend links the base and a
mythical underwater beast named Pondy.
	   Pierce, an acoustic engineer, had never heard of the base before
taking command about a year ago. But others knew that the site
plays a key role in developing future classes of submarines.
	   At a ceremony last year, Rear Adm. Edmund Giambastiani, director
of the Navy's submarine warfare division, called Pend Oreille the
submarine force's ``most important body of water.''
	   Testing models rather than full-sized subs has saved some dlrs 1
billion in development costs, he estimates.
	   Workers at the base operate unmanned models up to 88 feet (26.8
meters) long _ about one-quarter the length of a full-sized sub.
These days, they're testing the Navy's new nuclear attack submarine
class.
	   How quickly and quietly do these vessels go? How deep can they
dive?
	   That's classified, says Pierce, sole naval officer at a base
that employs about 130 civilians.
	   Submarines have always survived on stealth, and modern subs are
amazingly quiet. A decade ago, when models for the Seawolf class
were tested, one model was painted prior to the trials, Pierce
recalls.
	   When tests showed an unacceptably high noise level, researchers
blamed the paint job. ``A bristle of the paintbrush used to paint
the surface had been left on the dome,'' he says, describing the
front of the sub. ``One bristle had overcome the design.''
	   Work is under way on an dlrs 8 million structure to house five
submarine models, including the world's largest: a 120-foot
(36.5-meter) mini-version of a new attack submarine.
	   The dlrs 50 million model will be called Cutthroat, a name
selected by children at nearby Athol Elementary School to honor
local trout. Built jointly by Newport News Shipbuilding and
Electric Boat, the model will be assembled in the new building _
what Netzer calls a first for the base.
	   Besides being classified, the tests at Bayview are unobtrusive.
Models are not armed, and no weapons are fired. Though the base has
drawn anti-nuclear protesters, it has no nuclear facilities.
	   The base thrives on the calm and has never lost a model in the
lake's vast waters. ``That,'' Pierce says, ``would be a bad
thing.''

Lipinski, Kulik to join Stars on Ice tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Olympic figure skating champions Tara Lipinski
and Ilia Kulik will be joining the same professional tour, Scott
Hamilton's Stars on Ice, the skaters said Wednesday.
	   Kulik, however, will not surrender his Olympic eligibility,
which Lipinski did soon after winning at the Nagano Games.
	   By joining Stars on Ice, which enters its 13th season this year,
Kulik does not relinquish his eligibility. Only if he competes in
an event not sanctioned by the International Skating Union would
the Russian champion become ineligible for worlds and the Olympics.
	   ``I am choosing the pro-am way and will keep my options open,''
Kulik said. ``But I am off the world championships track for this
season. I will do the seven pro-ams that are available to keep
eligible.''
	   Kulik tentatively is scheduled to compete in the ISU-approved
Grand Slam of Figure Skating on Sept. 25-26 in Charleston, South
Carolina, then in the Nice 'n Easy Figure Skating Classic on Oct.
3-4 in Daytona Beach, Florida.
	   Lipinski competed in several unsanctioned events earlier this
year, losing her eligibility.
	   Lipinski and Kulik will join the tour headed by Hamilton, Kristi
Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Ekaterina Gordeeva next month for
rehearsals in Simsbury, Conn. The official announcement by
International Management Group, which owns the tour, is not
expected until next month.
	   ``I joined with Stars because it is a great opportunity waiting
for me,'' Lipinski said, ``and it's time for me to expand
artistically. And doing those group numbers will be so much fun.
I've watched the show for years and that has been my favorite
thing.''
	   Lipinski could have opted for the other major professional show,
Tom Collins' Champions on Ice, in which she has skated ever since
bursting onto the scene in 1995. That show tours after the
Olympic-eligible figure skating season, which ends in late March,
while Stars on Ice opens on Thanksgiving weekend and closes in the
spring.
	   But she has worked closely with Stars on Ice director Sandra
Bezic, who put together Lipinski's Olympic free skate, and
choreographer Lea Ann Miller.
	   ``Because I've worked with Lea Ann, and Sandra did the long
program for the Olympics, it makes me feel at home.''
	   Ever since her sensational victory at Nagano to become, at 15,
the youngest Olympic figure skating champion, Lipinski has been
raking in the endorsements. She currently has deals with CBS-TV,
Snapple, DKNY, DeBeers Company (diamonds) and Capezio. She is doing
promotional work for ESPN and collaborating on a third book, this
one an instructional book.
	   Her net worth has been estimated in the eight-figure range,
possibly as high as dlrs 12 million.
	   Kulik doesn't have nearly that kind of earnings or drawing
power. Joining Stars on Ice is the first major move he's made since
his powerful performance at Nagano.
	   ``I want to create a great show, that is basically the plan,''
Kulik said. ``There is a lot of opportunity in Stars on Ice. They
have a special lighting director and good choreographers and a
special costume designer and special music director.
	   ``In stars there are the greatest skaters ever in entertainment
and as athletes, and it will be great experience for me. That's
what really made my decision easy.''
	   With Kulik and Philippe Candeloro turning pro _ Candeloro has no
plans to compete on the Olympic level again _ and Elvis Stojko
vacillating on his future, the men's figure skating field has been
thinned considerably. That's hardly unusual after an Olympics.
	   Among the women, Lipinski and Lu Chen have become professionals,
leaving two-time world champion Michelle Kwan with virtually no
challengers.

Is proposed hand transplant medical breakthrough or ethical
</HEADLINE>
dilemma? &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE BAILEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ It sounds like something right out
of a campy, late-night horror film: eager doctors working to attach
the hand of a cadaver to the arm of a living person.
	   But a team of Louisville surgeons says the procedure could be
performed by year's end. Members of the team claimed that the
experimental surgery would be a medical breakthrough equal to the
world's first heart and liver transplants.
	   If successful, they said, the operation could initiate a new era
of transplantation with the potential to restore hope to thousands
of people with congenital defects and disfiguring injuries.
	   A historic achievement? Possibly. But some hand surgeons and
transplant experts were startled by the announcement last month,
concerned that science has yet to evolve to the point where the
projected rewards from such a project exceed the inherent risks.
	   ``I don't think the level of scientific research in this area in
small and large animals allows us to move into the realm of human
application,'' said Neil Jones, an orthopedic surgeon and director
of the UCLA Hand Center.
	   ``There are simply too many problems that haven't been solved in
the prevention of tissue rejection. I think the press conference
was more publicity than anything else and that they're jumping the
gun on this.''
	   Clinically, doctors say, microsurgical techniques are available
to transplant a human hand from a deceased donor to a living
recipient.
	   Ethically, however, the issue is more murky.
	   ``It's very, very risky and the ethical concerns are enormous,''
said Matthew Tomaino, chief of microsurgery for the University of
Pittsburgh's orthopedic surgery department. ``To this point, the
potential for death or serious complication have not warranted the
transplant of a nonvital organ.''
	   Following any transplant operation, the recipient must take
drugs that suppress the immune system. The anti-rejection drugs are
meant to keep the body from trying to destroy the foreign tissue,
but they also increase the risk of infection, cancer and even
death.
	   Unlike a patient needing a new heart or liver who would likely
die without a transplant and the anti-rejection drugs to sustain
it, an amputee does not lack a vital organ. However, the hand
patient still would be forced to take the potentially fatal drugs.
	   ``This situation certainly presents some interesting ethical
questions,'' said Linda Emanuel, head of the American Medical
Association's Institute on Ethics. ``The big question appears to be
quality of life versus quantity of life. Does the potential benefit
of having the procedure done justify the chance of death or serious
illness that comes with it?''
	   Members of the transplant team say animal research has shown
that giving a variety of different anti-rejection drugs at very low
doses can keep rejection complications to a minimum.
	   ``Any medical procedure _ any drug _ does carry risks, including
the risk of life,'' said Jon Jones, a University of Louisville
transplant surgeon. ``But people now do very well with
transplantations because we've learned a lot about how to handle
immunotherapy. ...
	   ``Based on the positive results of our animal research, we feel
we are now ready to do the first clinical case.''
	   Not all in the medical community believe the rejection problems
have been sufficiently addressed. For example, attempts to
transplant skin in animals have met with little success _ most have
been rejected within a year, Jones said.
	   Anne Ouellette, a hand surgeon and professor of orthopedic
surgery at the University of Miami, said skin rejection, along with
nerve regeneration to allow sensation, would be the key problems
facing the Louisville surgical team.
	   ``We talked about this 10 years ago, but I'm still not ready to
attempt this,'' Ouellette said. ``Until I hear we can keep the skin
from rejecting, shriveling up and dying, I'm ignoring any kind of
procedure of this nature. Once that happens, I'm back in the
game.''
	   Ouellette did not condemn the Louisville surgeons for attempting
an experimental procedure.
	   ``Somebody's got to make the leap, whether it's now or 10 years
from now,'' Ouellette said. ``The same kind of concerns were raised
when the first heart was done 30 years ago. The guys in Louisville
are superb and I don't blame them for trying.
	   ``But ... the risks are there. Significant risks. All of those
along with every detail of the procedure has to be discussed with
the patient up front. As long as everyone is up-front and honest
with each other from the very start, I don't necessarily think this
is a bad thing.''
	   Brandi Clark of San Andreas, California, is interested in the
progress made by the Louisville doctors. Her 6-month-old daughter,
Jara, was born without a hand.
	   ``If they start a waiting list, I want her on it,'' she said.
``If there are risks, she could make that decision when she's old
enough.''
	   Warren Breidenbach, a University of Louisville assistant
professor of surgery who will perform the actual hand transplant,
said technical and ethical concerns have been debated for nearly
two years as the group sought to have its research validated.
	   The University of Louisville School of Medicine Human Studies
Committee and Louisville's Jewish Hospital Institutional Review
Board granted their approval this summer for the procedure after
studying the team's data, which included the results of an
international symposium.
	   ``We've presented our information to several national and
international organizations, and I can tell you that the majority
have been in favor of what we're doing,'' Breidenbach said. ``We're
not rushing into anything.''

Special suit helps boy avoid pain from sunlight

 &UR; By ALIAH D. WRIGHT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLAIN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ William Robert ``Rob'' Lucas III is a
precocious 10-year-old with dark brown hair, blue-gray eyes and a
killer smile. He's bright, revels in teasing his two sisters, rides
his bike and plays soccer with his pals.
	   But, until recently, Rob could play outside only at night.
	   He was born with a rare metabolic disorder that causes his skin
to swell, blister and turn red whenever exposed to direct sunlight.
	   ``I just felt pain; like a thousand knives were going into me,''
he said in an interview recently at his home in the Tuscarora
Mountains some 30 miles (50 kms) west of Harrisburg.
	   What changed Rob's life was a new set of clothes _ a pair of
special suits, designed and tested by a team of NASA engineers and
a private company in California. The suits protect him while he
enjoys normal daytime activities with his friends.
	   The outer layer of each suit is a tightly woven cotton-Lycra
blend that blocks out 99.9 percent of ultraviolet light. He wears a
jacket, pants, gloves, masks and a pair of goggles and a life
preserver-like garment filled with a frozen gel that keeps him
cool. In the full ensemble, Rob resembles a space man.
	   His family, and their neighbors in Blain _ population 270 _
helped raise nearly dlrs 6,000 to pay for two suits.
	   No one knows how many people have Rob's disease, erythropoietic
protoporphyria or EPP. But Dr. Micheline Mathews-Roth, an associate
professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an EPP expert,
estimates that fewer than 20,000 Americans have the disorder.
	   Jane and Bill Lucas first noticed something was wrong with their
son when he was 3 years old. Thinking it was just a conventional
allergy, they changed his diet, laundry detergent and the soap they
bathed him in. But it was not until last year that he was diagnosed
with EPP.
	   The story of Rob's suits actually started more than a year ago,
when a British woman, Eleanor Richards, posed a simple question to
NASA: If it could develop clothing to protect astronauts from the
extreme temperatures of outer space, could it find a way to help
her two grandchildren lead normal lives?
	   The answer, after much research, was yes.
	   The Richards had been covering their windows with blankets and
using 25-watt light bulbs because Kyle, 5, and Ryan, 3, have a
similar disorder to Robs' _ polymorphic light eruption _ that made
exposure to any kind of light painful.
	   ``Before they never went out in daylight, they never played with
other kids, they never went shopping, they only played on the
swings in the winter in the dark,'' said Mrs. Richards said in a
telephone interview from her home in northern England.
	   Employing the same technology designed to protect astronauts
working in space, a team of NASA engineers, a doctor and Robert
Dotts, assistant director of technology transfer at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, helped make the pint-sized suits.
	   The team tested materials that came close to blocking out most
of the sun's rays but found only one company willing and able to
develop a material sturdy enough to resist ultraviolet light: the
Solar Protective Factory in Carmichael, California.
	   SPF's president, Terry Breese and the Richards met in Orlando,
Florida, to deliver the suits last year. NASA also contracted with
the HED Foundation to test and evaluate both prototypes as the boys
put them through their paces. James ``Mikey'' Walker, a 6-year-old
who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia, also received a prototype.
	   The result are the suits Rob now wears.
	   The HED Foundation, based in Hampton, Virginia, provides cooling
gear to children with hypochidrotic ectodrmal dysplasia, a medical
disorder characterized by a lack of sweat glands.
	   Sarah Moody of the HED Foundation said children with these
disorders are ``trapped in their bodies; they can't do what we can
do.'' With the suits, ``they can be more normal than what they were
before.''
	   Mikey's mother, Angela Walker, approached the foundation three
years ago to request its help in getting some cooling gear he could
wear under the layers of clothes that protected him from the sun.
	   Mrs. Richards calls the suits, ``brilliant, immensely''
brilliant. Before the boys got their suits, ``we couldn't let them
go out because they would break out in massive blisters,'' she
said.
	   Just like Rob.
	   Now, instead of surfing the Internet or whipping up dinner, he
can play outside with his buddies who have devised a special game
for their friend in the space-like type suit.
	   ``Star Wars,'' he says with a laugh.

	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ American adventurer Steve Fossett
will set foot on land for the first time in almost two weeks
Thursday after his rescue from a harrowing balloon crash into the
Coral Sea.
	   The New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour is steaming toward
Townsville in north Queensland with the 54-year-old millionaire
safely aboard after his high-technology balloon crashed into the
ocean on Monday.
	   Endeavour Cmdr. Kevin Corles said his ship was expected to berth
in Townsville early Thursday evening, when Fossett will hold a news
conference.
	   Corles said Fossett is in good health after his ordeal and
enjoying the novelty of cruising on a warship.
	   ``We have great conditions and we're making good time and
(Fossett) is just resting and reading and watching some videos,''
Corles said.
	   ``He's really enjoying the experience of life at sea on a ship
of this size. He's fine and he's really taking it all in.''
	   Fossett already had made arrangements to fly back to the United
States on Friday, Corles said.
	   The Chicago stockbroker was uninjured when a severe storm
ruptured his balloon and forced him down from a height of almost
29,000 feet (9,000 meters) into the Coral Sea, about 500 miles (800
km) off Australia's east coast.
	   Fossett was on the final leg of his fourth bid to become the
first balloonist to fly non-stop around the world after setting out
from Mendoza, Argentina, on Aug. 7.
	   The adventurer said he thought he was ``going to die'' in the
wild hailstorm that disabled his craft, the Solo Spirit.
	   He feared being suffocated after escaping from his burning
capsule into a life raft, only to have the balloon fall on him
repeatedly.
	   Fossett was spotted by a French military search and rescue
aircraft on Monday morning.
	   An Australian yacht, the Atlanta, picked him up before he was
transferred to the Endeavour.

World Wildlife Fund wants global fishing fleet slashed by
</HEADLINE>
two-thirds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTEREY, California (AP) _ Overfishing the planet's oceans is
far more serious than originally thought, and the world's fishing
fleet must be reduced by two-thirds to deal with the problem, the
World Wildlife Fund says.
	   A Fund report released Tuesday suggests that fishing boats
worldwide can catch 155 percent more fish than can be replaced
through normal reproduction.
	   ``The prospect of a crash is possible unless there is a drastic
attempt to reduce the worldwide fleet,'' said Gareth Porter, the
study's author. ``Without really radical surgery, the situation
gets worse and worse.''
	   Every fishing region faces overcapacity, including the United
States, the European Economic Union and China, Porter said.
	   Overfishing has long been recognized as a problem, with species
such as haddock and cod fished until they have almost disappeared.
	   But Porter's study says the situation is even worse than
previously thought. The latest United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization study estimates overcapacity at only 30 percent.
	   Porter's report comes before an October U.N. meeting of fishing
nations in Rome, where environmentalists hope to propose solutions
to overfishing.
	   Scott Burns, director of marine conservation for the World
Wildlife Fund, said, ``We're seeing an increasing recognition that
this is a problem that needs to be dealt with. As it is now,
fishermen have to fish harder and spend more money catching less
fish.''
	   One solution may be to issue each fishing company tradable
rights to a percentage of the catch. The rights could be leased or
sold.
	   ``If no one has the right to harvest any portion of a stock,
every fisherman must strive to capture as much of the catch as
possible because it is assumed that any fish in the water will be
taken by someone else,'' said Porter. He said the scheme has worked
in New Zealand, Australia and Iceland.
	   One problem is deciding how to fairly and evenly divide the
fishing rights. Porter also called for an end to government
subsidies to the fishing industry, which he estimates at dlrs 11
billion to dlrs 21 billion annually worldwide.
	   Subsidies can range from boat building grants to a minimum price
for fish. They make fishing more attractive to newcomers and prop
up ailing companies suffering from a lack of fish, Porter said.
	   Other solutions governments may consider are buying and
scrapping existing fishing boats and training workers for new jobs.
Now, as fish supplies shrink and demand rises, fishermen can
maintain their incomes while catching fewer fish.
	   The World Wildlife Fund introduced the study at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium as it kicked off an ecology campaign marking the last 500
days of the 20th century.

 &UR; Roundworm gene may hold clues to human aging, diseases
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Scientists have learned a little bit more
about a gene that contributes to aging in the humble roundworm and
might hold clues to human aging and disease.
	   They previously showed that when a worm with a mutation in the
gene called mev-1 is exposed to excess oxygen, it dies sooner.
	   While oxygen confers life-giving energy, its byproducts _
unstable chemicals called free radicals _ produce cellular rusting,
which brings cell damage and death.
	   In a study appearing in the Aug. 13 issue of the journal Nature,
Naoaki Ishii of Tokai University School of Medicine in Japan and
colleagues determined how mev-1 works.
	   The researchers found that the mev-1 gene creates the blueprint
for part of an enzyme that controls how mitochondria _ the
powerhouses of living cells _ produce energy through a series of
chemical reactions.
	   A mev-1 mutation creates a defect in the enzyme and allows too
many free radicals to be produced.

 &UR; Grant to help research ways to recover lost coal dust for fuel
	   CARBONDALE, Illinois (AP) _ Tiny particles of coal, some of them
invisible to the naked eye, are the subject of a new research
project at Southern Illinois University.
	   The U.S. Department of Energy has given SIU a grant worth up to
dlrs 1 million to research ways to recover the fine coal particles,
which make for high-quality fuel but now go to waste as a result of
the mining process.
	   The work will focus on ways to recover the fine coal powder that
is left behind in slurry ponds used to clean coal prior to
shipment.
	   The powder is a high-quality fuel that would provide much-needed
revenue for coal companies if they were able to recover and sell
it, said Rick Honaker, an associate professor at SIU who is in
charge of the project.
	   Recovering more of it would also help clean up active and
abandoned waste ponds, he said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Jean Rose Dalizu was, in the words of
those who loved her, ``anything you needed.'' Whether it was a
shared laugh in her sun-drenched greenhouse, logistics for visiting
dentists or M-and-M candies for a homesick fellow American, she
provided.
	   ``If you needed someone to talk to you, she would listen. If you
needed your stomach filled, she would fill it. If you needed a
shoulder to cry on, it was there. If you just needed to sit down
and laugh, OK,'' said Temina Dalizu, her 26-year-old daughter.
	   ``Just anything you needed.''
	   A terrorist bomb wrenched Jean Dalizu from her loved ones at age
60. She was the 12th American killed Aug. 7 in the U.S. Embassy
attack, the only one whose body stayed behind in Kenya, her home
for more than two decades.
	   But she was also with her slain compatriots at last week's
memorial service at Andrews Air Force Base _ in a framed portrait
her eldest daughter, Lori, clasped to her chest, gently heaving
with sobs.
	   As her husband of 35 years, Egambi Dalizu, prepared to bury his
wife on their beloved farm in western Kenya, friends flocked to the
family's Nairobi home for a Thursday memorial service.
	   Next to a book of condolences signed by dozens was a photograph
taken at an embassy ceremony 18 months ago. Jean stands proudly
with a smile so bright it almost outshines the sunlight flooding
her sanctuary _ a carport turned greenhouse.
	   Ferns and palms in clay pots fill the room. African sculptures
decorate the walls. Next to her favorite chair is a leather-bound
Bible, testament to her devout Christian faith.
	   ___
	   ``Clicky,'' as a great-uncle nicknamed her, was born in
Washington, D.C., the third of 11 children. She somersaulted and
back-flipped through childhood, performing as a ``Flying Nesbitt''
at halftime of Harlem Globetrotter basketball games. In later
years, ``she loved to roller-skate and dance _ the cha-cha, belly
dances, anything,'' said a sister, June Freeman.
	   Egambi called his wife ``a child of two worlds'' who blended the
best of America and Africa. She was open and welcoming in the
African way, commonly inviting 15 to 25 homesick U.S. students to
Thanksgiving dinner, but had a direct, efficient American streak.
	   ``In the Kenyan tradition, the house is open. If you're hungry,
eat. But the American came out in my Mom when she said, `You know
where the fridge is, go get your food,''' said Temina, who lives in
Adelphi, Maryland.
	   By the time the couple met in 1960 in Washington, where Egambi
was studying, ``she was part of a group of friends from the West
Indies, America and Africa,'' he recalled. ``She understood where
we were coming from, and she understood where we were going to.''
They married three years later.
	   The family _ including Jean's two children from a previous
marriage, Lori and Anthony, now 40 and 38_ moved to Southern
California for Egambi's graduate studies in political science. Jean
did secretarial work to support the family, which grew to four
children.
	   ``Struggle, yes, we did struggle _ working, going to school and
raising a family,'' he recalled.
	   All along, Jean understood her husband eventually wanted to
return to Kenya. The time came in 1974 when Egambi was recruited by
the University of Nairobi. But raising four kids on a professor's
salary was tough, and when Jean couldn't find work, she and the two
teen-agers returned to Washington. For seven years, with various
children in tow, she bounced between continents until settling in
Kenya for good in 1983.
	   To stay in touch, Egambi said, ``We wrote a lot.'' He still
keeps their love letters.
	   ___
	   In Kenya, life settled into a happy pattern. The family escaped
as often as possible to Egambi's home village, Migori, 175 miles
(280 kms) west of Nairobi.
	   There, the air is crisp, the land lush. Jean would rise with the
sun, to enjoy the first cackles of the chickens.
	   ``Dad built her a small quaint house. It was far enough from
Nairobi, family was there, and just being in the peace and quiet of
the countryside, she liked to do that,'' Temina said.
	   Jean was so proud of her animals that after her youngest went
off to college, ``she used to take pictures and send them to me in
the States,'' Temina said. ``Everyone was getting pictures of
babies, but I'm walking around saying, `Look what my Mom sent me!
Look it's a new cow! Look it's a calf! Look at the chicks!'''
	   Temina said her mother fretted over the risks of travel in Kenya
_ malarial mosquitoes, plane crashes, hostile locals _ but ``she
would overcome her timidness and go on safari. ... She did enjoy
and love this country.''
	   ___
	   The day the bomb went off, Jean boarded an embassy mini-van at
6:50 a.m. ``She always started work a few minutes before the
official time of 7:30,'' her husband said. ``She enjoyed every
moment of her work.''
	   As an executive secretary in the Kenya-United States Liaison
Office, part of the embassy defense attache's operations, Jean took
care of payrolls, travel arrangements for visiting VIPs and
evacuations of Americans from trouble spots.
	   She was ``genuinely a good person, and we leaned on that a
lot,'' said U.S. Army Col. Ron Roughead, KUSLO chief. ``If she saw
I was busy and couldn't get downstairs to cash a check, she'd say,
`I'm going that way.'''
	   Among her co-workers were two close friends _ Arlene Kirk of
South Bend, Indiana, and Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn
Olds of Panama City, Florida. The three women were alone in the
KUSLO office at 10:39 a.m. when the bomb exploded three stories
below their corner office. All died.
	   Egambi saw his wife's body at the funeral home three days later.
``I was prepared for the worst, and I was pleasantly surprised,''
he said. ``It was her. She still had her hair.''
	   ___
	   Son Mang'airu, 33, a swimming coach in Laurel, Maryland, said he
cherishes knowing his mother ``was proud of every day she lived.''
	   ``People think we're crazy because we're laughing and cracking
jokes so soon after our mother died, but that was Mom,'' he said.
	   Indeed, Mrs. Dalizu's vast circle of friends has helped leaven
spirits.
	   ``There is a huge outpouring of love. Dad has lost a wife, we
have lost our Mom,'' Temina said. ``But also, our friends have lost
someone. She reached out to everybody. I was in awe of the number
of people my Mom touched.
	   ``It is easier to carry the loss when it is shared by so many
people. It helps a lot.''

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The investigation into the twin bombings
of U.S. Embassys in East Africa continued on several fronts even as
an Islamic coalition warned of further attacks against American
interests.
	   In Pakistan, two more people were being questioned Wednesday in
the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people and wounded more than 5,500. They reportedly were named by a
suspect with alleged links to exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden, whom U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents returned Wednesday to take pictures of a
hotel in a seedy downtown section a mile (half-kilometer) from the
U.S. embassy. The hotel had been the scene of an FBI and Kenyan
detective raid the day before.
	   And in Washington, government sources said FBI Director Louis
Freeh will take top FBI agents to Africa to oversee bombing
inquiries already involving more than 250 FBI investigators.
	   U.S. officials were rebuffed Wednesday in their efforts to get
to bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan. The Taliban religious army,
which rules most of Afghanistan, said it would not hand him over
even if the United States had proof he was behind the bombings.
	   A group reportedly founded by bin Laden _ the World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders _ issued a defiant
warning Wednesday in the respected London-based Arabic newspaper
al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   Al-Hayat said that statement was accompanied by others from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the embassy bombings.
	   The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, reported that the FBI and
the Kenyan agents raided the Hilltop Hotel based on information
provided by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested in Pakistan on
the day of the bombings and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan authorities.
	   In Pakistan, a border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were
being questioned about the bombings after being detained Saturday
at the Afghan border. The New York Times reported that Odeh had
identified the two men as accomplices.
	   The Daily Nation said a bomb containing 1,760 pounds of TNT was
assembled over several days at the hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   It said two hotel rooms where the bomb was made were occupied
from Aug. 3-6 by four foreigners _ two Palestinians, an Egyptian
and a Saudi. It said the bomb was built there until Aug. 6, when it
was taken away in a small truck and completed elsewhere.
	   The paper also said police were holding three other people in
connection with the attack.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistan, The News newspaper reported Wednesday
that Odeh gave a detailed account of worldwide anti-American
operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group based in
Afghanistan. The 34-year-old engineer said the group was led by bin
Laden, The News reported.
	   In Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Hasan said he
was convinced bin Laden had nothing to do with the embassy
bombings, but if proven otherwise, bin Laden would be punished in
Afghanistan. ``It is not right to give a Muslim to an infidel
country,'' he said.
	   U.S. and Albanian agents, meanwhile, began a nationwide search
for suspected terrorists who may have been planning to blow up the
American Embassy in the Albanian capital of Tirana. Heavily armed
Marines guarded the American diplomatic compound in Tirana on
Wednesday.
	   The search began after the CIA uncovered ``serious evidence'' of
a bombing plot last week, according to an Albanian official at the
Interior Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Fusion downs Burn 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Second-half substitute Henry
Gutierrez scored in the 87th minute Wednesday night to give the
Miami Fusion a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Burn in Major League
Soccer.
	   Gutierrez's fourth goal of the season gave Miami (12-12) its
sixth victory in seven games and a five-point lead over Tampa Bay
for the fourth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
Miami has 26 points, 12 coming it last five games.
	   Dallas (12-13) remained fourth in the West, two points ahead of
Kansas City.
	   The Burn tied the match in the 84th minute on Chad Deering's
goal, his second since joining Dallas seven games ago.
	   Miami responded three minutes later when Diego Serna chipped
Nelson Vargas' pass to Gutierrez at the edge of the penalty area.
Gutierrez, who came on to start the second half, skimmed a low hard
shot past Dallas goalkeeper Mark Dodd.
	   Burn midfielder Jason Kreis hit the crossbar in the final
minute.
	   The Fusion took a 1-0 lead in the 50th minute on Carlos
Valderrama's penalty kick. Referee Refugio Ramirez awarded the
penalty when Dallas defender Jorge Rodriguez tripped Serna at the
edge of the 18-yard box. It was the third time in four games that
Serna has drawn a penalty kick.

Agassi's comeback continues with rout of Tebbutt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of night match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Andre Agassi continued his comeback from
tennis abyss in spectacular fashion Wednesday, routing Australia's
Michael Tebbutt 6-1, 6-0 in a second-round match at the RCA
Championships.
	   Agassi, the fifth seed, needed just 44 minutes to eliminate
Tebbutt. Agassi suffered through a tough season in 1997, but has
climbed from the ATP Tour's 122nd ranking at the start of the year
to eighth.
	   He displayed the form that has made him one of the game's
greats. Tebbutt was constantly handcuffed by Agassi's
lightning-quick service returns, and Agassi broke Tebbutt's serve
three times in each set.
	   Agassi meets Zimbabwe's Wayne Black in Thursday's round of 16.
The unseeded Black upset 12th-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria 6-3,
5-7, 6-4.
	   Greg Rusedski also advanced, but defending champion Jonas
Bjorkman did not.
	   Rusedski, playing for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury at Wimbledon in June, upheld his No. 3 seed by defeating
Sweden's Magnus Larsson 7-6 (7-2), 6-3.
	   Bjorkman, the No. 4 seed, lost his confidence and his
second-round match with Australia's Jason Stoltenberg 7-5, 6-3. His
ouster was the tournament's second major upset, following Thomas
Johansson's elimination Tuesday of second-seeded Carlos Moya, the
1997 runnerup.
	   In other matches, seventh-seeded Albert Costa, No. 8 Alberto
Berasategui, No. 9 Cedric Pioline and No. 10 Felix Mantilla all
lost to unseeded opponents.
	   The hard-serving Rusedski recovered from a slow start to cruise
through the first-set tiebreaker, then broke Larsson in the fifth
game of the second set. En route, he served up three straight 132
mph aces, and notched a match-high 135 mph serve in the sixth game.
	   ``Today was the big server, shall we speak, coming out,'' said
Rusedski, owner of the fastest serve in ATP Tour history at 149
mph. He had 14 aces against Larsson in his first appearance at the
Indianapolis Tennis Center since 1995.
	   ``I thought I didn't serve as well as I could in the beginning,
but then I started to get my pop more in the second set, and I
started hitting a few more aces,'' he said. ``It's great that the
ankle held up. It's just great to be back.''
	   Stoltenberg ousted Bjorkman by winning a break-filled first set,
then broke service in the eighth game of the second set.
	   ``When I got that (second-set) break, Jonas got a little down,
and I don't think he played as well as he can,'' Stoltenberg said.
``But you know, I feel like I played pretty well.''
	   ``I'm not enjoying going out on the court, and I'm thinking
negative almost since I lost the first break,'' Bjorkman said.
``It's hard for me to start thinking positive. I'm just thinking
negative, and I actually don't even care if I win or lose.
	   ``I have a lot of questions to myself, but I have no answers.''
	   In Wednesday's other singles match, sixth-seeded Alex Corretja
of Spain outlasted Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 7-5.

Express train to link Kuala Lumpur with new international airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An express train will soon link
Kuala Lumpur with a new international airport that many people have
complained is too far away, a news report said.
	   The rail link will be completed in 27 months, Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying on
Wednesday.
	   The journey from Kuala Lumpur Central Station to the airport
will take 28 minutes, Ling said. It currently takes between one to
two hours, depending on traffic, to travel by car to the airport,
about 70 kilometers (44 miles) away.
	   Passengers will also have the option of checking in for their
flights at the railroad station, he said.
	   The Kuala Lumpur International Airport was inaugurated on June
30. Malaysian officials claim it is the world's biggest airport.

Astronomers: Milky Way galaxy is cannibalizing its neighbors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Astronomers said Thursday our Milky
Way galaxy is cannibalizing two neighboring galaxies by ripping
hydrogen gas out of them.
	   Tides, not friction, are the culprit, astronomer Brad Gibson
said.
	   Gibson, from Canberra's Mount Stromlo Observatory, said the
mystery surrounding the gas emission from the galaxies, known as
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, had been debated for about
25 years.
	   It was only recently that images from a new multibeam instrument
on Australia's Parkes telescope had been able to settle the
question.
	   ``There's been this long mystery that theoreticians have raged
over for a long time _ whether it was dragging the gas out or
whether it was tides that was ripping it out,'' Gibson said.
	   ``Basically, it's a large scale equivalent to the Earth-Moon
tidal interaction.
	   ``It is only now that we have the capability of mapping in
exquisite detail across the sky, that we're able to see this long
thin piece of gas and it's so thin that it had been missed in
previous surveys.
	   ``It really is the definitive evidence that it's a tidal
interaction and not a drag interaction.''
	   Tidal interaction is mutual and happened to both the Moon and
Earth.
	   Similarly, something is going on between the Magellanic Clouds
and our galaxy, he said.
	   ``Because the galaxy is so much more massive than the Magellanic
Clouds, the effect that it has right at this moment in time on our
galaxy is not nearly as apparent as it has on the clouds.
	   ``You can see the clouds being ripped apart.
	   ``In the long term, the Magellanic Clouds will be ripped apart
and tumble their way into the plain of the galaxy and get absorbed
into our galaxy.
	   ``So they bring in gas and fuel from outside of our galaxy which
eventually gets eaten up by our galaxy and is turned into more
stars and our galaxy grows a bit more,'' he said.
	   Gibson has joined 60 of the world's leading astronomers at the
Third Stromlo Symposium at the Australian Academy of Science in
Canberra this week to debate the composition of dark matter
floating around our galaxy.

Qantas defies Asia turmoil with record profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Qantas Airways Ltd. has defied the
economic turmoil in Asia to post a record U.S. dlrs 182.8 million
(304.8 million Australian dollars) net profit for 1997-98, up 20.6
percent.
	   However, Qantas chairman Gary Pemberton warned Thursday that the
economic situation in Asia will affect future profitability and
said indications are it will be hard to match the record result in
1998-99.
	   Revenue for Qantas, which has responded to the Asian crisis by
focusing services away from the region, fell slightly to U.S. dlrs
4.8 billion (8.13 billion Australian dollars) from U.S. dlrs 5.28
billion (8.8 billion Australian dollars).
	   Pemberton described the result as an excellent achievement in
difficult trading conditions.
	   ``The timely rationalization of our Asian services together with
the reallocation of capacity to stronger routes has reduced the
adverse impact during the year,'' Pemberton said.
	   However, he warned the region would impact future profitability.
	   ``The reactions by other carriers in terms of prices and
capacity as a result of conditions in Asia have been well
documented and will lead to more volatility and uncertainty in
market conditions in 1998-99,'' he said.
	   Pemberton said the airline's response included the continuation
of planned investment in new product, services and aircraft and
entry into new markets in America and Europe.
	   Qantas chief executive James Strong said net passenger revenue
increased by 3 percent in 1997-98 and included a favorable impact
of movements in foreign exchange rates.
	   Passenger yield improved by 4 percent overall.

Chinese court rejects corrupt official's appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The most senior leader ensnared in a crackdown on
rampant official graft lost his appeal Thursday against a 16-year
prison sentence for his part in China's biggest corruption scandal.
	   The Supreme People's Court upheld the sentence handed down to
Chen Xitong, a former mayor and Communist Party chief of Beijing,
by a lower court on July 31 after a secret trial, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Appeals are rarely successful in China. Xinhua gave no details
about the Supreme Court's decision to affirm Chen's sentence.
	   Chen's former colleagues in the Communist Party are believed to
want to make an example of him to demonstrate their determination
to stamp out rampant official corruption that has undermined the
government's legitimacy in the eyes of many Chinese.
	   Chen, 68, was the highest ranked official caught in a
five-year-old government anti-corruption campaign in which hundreds
of thousands of officials have been investigated and many,
including Chen's son, have been jailed.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen was one of 20 members of the Communist
Party's elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. He
was the highest party official to face criminal prosecution since
the notorious Gang of Four were tried for political crimes
following the calamitous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
	   Chen was brought down in a massive graft scandal that may have
cost Beijing as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2
billion).
	   Some Chinese dissidents had called for Chen to be executed for
his crimes. Two dissidents who believed Chen got off lightly with a
16-year sentence also launched a signature drive to have him
retried in open, televised proceedings.

Report: Fatal crash of auto czar due to ``human error''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A helicopter crash which killed
Malaysia's leading industrialist was due to ``human error'' and not
sabotage, according to an aviation report.
	   Yahaya Ahmad, Malaysia's auto industry czar, was on his way to
eastern Malaysia to see his sick mother when his Italian-made
Augusta A-109E helicopter crashed in March of last year, the report
released Wednesday said.
	   His wife, Rohana Osman, and the helicopter's pilot, Azlizan
Abdul Manas, were also killed in the crash.
	   However, the Department of Civil Aviation report noted that
``there was a possibility that the owner handled the helicopter for
most of the flight.''
	   ``He was an influential man, and it seemed he normally made many
of the command decisions, except when the commander intervened,''
the report said, describing Yahaya as ``a student pilot'' who
usually wanted to handle the Augusta himself.
	   Yahaya, one of the richest men in the country, used to control
Heavy Industries Corp. of Malaysia, or HICOM, which owns Malaysia's
national car company, Proton. More than 60 percent of cars sold in
Malaysia are Protons.
	   Transport Minister Dr. Ling Liong Sik, who released the report
17 months after the mishap, ruled out the possibility of sabotage.
	   Blaming the crash on ``human error,'' Ling told reporters that
the helicopter had ascended to 10,900 feet (3,300 meters), a height
which could cause disorientation and altitude sickness.

now looking to go one up on the Walkman with a battery-operated
lollipop holder that plays music inside the mouths of sweet-toothed
kids.
	   The microphone-sized toy, called Silent Shout, transmits one of
four pre-selected tunes, such as ``Hip Hop DJ,'' by vibrating a
lollipop stuck into one end of the device, Bandai Co. spokesman
Masashi Umeda said Thursday.
	   ``One of the merits is that the sound won't annoy others, unlike
standard portable music players,'' he said.
	   The device works by conducting sounds through the teeth. Those
sounds then echo into the inner ear, so that only the person using
it can hear the music.
	   Bandai, which bought a license for the technology involved from
an American firm, expects to sell 1 million Silent Shout units by
next March. It goes on sale in Japan from next month at a retail
price of 1,480 yen (dlrs 10.28).
	   The company said it has no plans to sell the gadget in the
United States.

Report: Malaysian official criticizes U.N. report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A top Malaysian government
official has questioned the accuracy of a new United Nations report
on prostitution in Southeast Asia, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The 232-page International Labor Organization report on
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, said revenue
from prostitution accounts for two percent to 14 percent of gross
domestic product. The report was released in Geneva on Wednesday.
	   But there was no way of obtaining correct statistics on
prostitutes since even the government did not have them, Social
Development Minister Zaleha Ismail was quoted as saying by the Sun
newspaper.
	   The ILO report said commercial sex is crucial to the livelihoods
of millions of workers beyond prostitutes themselves and brings
billions of dollars into each nation.
	   The Sun quoted the report as estimating that there were between
43,000 to 142,000 prostitutes in Malaysia.
	   ``I am baffled as to how the organization managed to get this
figure,'' Zaleha told reporters. She said her ministry would
investigate the numbers.
	   But one women's group agreed with the ILO findings that
prostitution was growing in the region.
	   ``We know that more and more women and girls are being forced
into the industry,'' Aegile Fernandez of Tenaganita, a group that
helps sex workers, was quoted by the Sun as saying.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stocks fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday stocks, bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Thursday
morning amid continued fear of possible intervention to support the
Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices fell moderately on
profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 143.94 yen in late morning trading, down 0.22
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but almost unchanged from its late
New York rate of 143.93 yen overnight.
	   Worry about possible yen-supportive intervention in foreign
exchange markets by Japanese monetary authorities kept the dollar
under pressure following a recent rally to eight-year highs against
the yen, dealers said.
	   On Wednesday, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, warned that the
opportunity for yen-supportive intervention ``is getting near.''
	   Sakakibara, who arrived in the United States later Wednesday to
attend a financial conference, was expected to meet with U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
	   The meeting between Sakakibara and Summers has triggered
speculation that possible joint intervention to bolster the yen may
be under discussion, traders said.
	   The yen's strength also derived from a rise in the German mark
against the dollar Wednesday, they said.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved lower as
investors took profits following a more than 600-point rise in the
main index over the past two days.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 114.98 points,
or 0.75 percent, to 15,291.36 points as of midday. On Wednesday,
the average closed up 342.55 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 6.22 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,177.49. The
TOPIX closed up 16.99 points, or 1.46 percent, the day before.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond stood at 1.195 percent,
unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its price was marginally lower
at 111.76 yen from 111.77 yen.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The investigation into the twin bombings
of U.S. Embassies in East Africa continued on several fronts even
as a band of Islamic extremists warned of further attacks against
American interests.
	   In Pakistan, two more people were being questioned Wednesday in
the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people and wounded more than 5,500. They reportedly were named by a
suspect with alleged links to exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden, whom U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents returned Wednesday to take pictures of a
hotel in a seedy downtown section a mile (half-kilometer) from the
U.S. embassy. The hotel had been the scene of an FBI and Kenyan
detective raid the day before.
	   And in Washington, government sources said FBI Director Louis
Freeh will take top FBI agents to Africa to oversee bombing
inquiries already involving more than 250 FBI investigators.
	   U.S. officials were rebuffed Wednesday in their efforts to get
to bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan. The Taliban religious army,
which rules most of Afghanistan, said it would not hand him over
even if the United States had proof he was behind the bombings.
	   A group reportedly founded by bin Laden _ the World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders _ issued a defiant
warning Wednesday in the respected London-based Arabic newspaper
al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   Al-Hayat said that statement was accompanied by others from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the embassy bombings.
	   The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, reported that the FBI and
the Kenyan agents raided the Hilltop Hotel based on information
provided by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested in Pakistan on
the day of the bombings and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan authorities.
	   In Pakistan, a border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were
being questioned about the bombings after being detained Saturday
at the Afghan border. The New York Times reported that Odeh had
identified the two men as accomplices.
	   The Daily Nation said a bomb containing 1,760 pounds (800 kilos)
of TNT was assembled over several days at the hotel under Odeh's
direction.

Singapore prime minister sets deadline for opposition leader to
</HEADLINE>
apologize

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has
offered to waive damages from a defamation suit against opposition
leader Joshua Jeyaretnam if the veteran politician issues an
acceptable apology by Friday, according to local reports Thursday.
	   Pending a suitable statement of regret from the opposition
figure, Goh will waive 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 57,000) in
court-ordered damage payments, though not additional court costs of
about 150,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 86,000), The Straits Times
reported.
	   But a difference in opinion over the exact contents of an
apology appears to be delaying resolution of the case.
	   Lawyers for the prime minister were quoted by the newspaper as
saying in a statement issued Wednesday that ``Jeyaretnam is not
prepared to apologize in the manner requested by the PM.''
	   The opposition Worker's Party leader appeared to contradict that
assertion, however, by saying that he has offered a sincere
apology, the paper said.
	   A Singapore court ruled last year that Jeyaretnam had defamed
Goh at a 1996 election rally. The opposition figure had stated _
accurately _ that one of his fellow candidates had filed a police
report against the prime minister for criminal conspiracy and
lying.
	   Jeyaretnam is one of only three opposition members in
Singapore's 84-seat Parliament, which has been dominated by the
People's Action Party since independence in 1965. He has said he is
unable to pay the damages or court costs in one installment and
stands to lose his seat if he is declared a bankrupt.
	   Jeyaretnam's draft apology states that he accepts the court's
findings and apologizes unreservedly and sincerely, according to
the newspaper, which did not state what other concessions Goh's
lawyers are seeking in the apology.
	   The tangled defamation case was used as an example in this
year's U.S. State Department Human Rights Report of how the
Singapore government uses libel and defamation suits to stifle
freedom of speech and intimidate the political opposition.
	   The Singapore government has rejected the criticism, saying that
leaders of Goh's People's Action Party, in power for 38 years, must
sue for large damages to clear their names in order to maintain
credibility in this nation of 3.1 million people.

Report: 29 bankers suspected of corruption in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police have detained five
executives of nine liquidated banks and identified 24 others as
suspects in a corruption and embezzlement investigation, a local
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia quoted police spokesman Togar
Sianipar as saying the bankers were commissioners and directors of
banks declared insolvent and shut down by the government last
November.
	   The banks are PT Sejahtera Bank Umum, PT Bank Harapan Sentosa,
or BHS, PT South East Asia Bank, PT Bank Pacific, PT Bank Anrico,
PT Bank Kosagraha, PT Bank Pinaesaan, PT Bank Dwipa, and PT Bank
Citra.
	   Togar said Indonesian detectives had contacted Interpol to
arrest at least two bankers who had left the country.
	   He did not disclose details of the allegations against the
suspects.
	   Indonesia's banking and finance industry is in disarray as the
nation grapples with the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Reform of the ailing banking sector is a major part of a
multi-billion dollar economic bailout for Indonesia put together by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   President B.J. Habibie has also promised to stamp down on
corruption as part of a drive to restore economic confidence.

Two more scuba divers left stranded off Great Barrier Reef
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ In the second such incident in less
than a year, a pair of scuba divers were stranded off Australia's
Great Barrier Reef after being abandoned by a local dive boat
operator, officials said Thursday.
	   The two were left behind Wednesday on a reef near Gladstone in
Queensland, but were picked up soon afterwards by a nearby vessel,
Australian Transport Minister Steve Bredhauer said.
	   The matter has been reported to the Gladstone Harbor Master and
a full investigation was underway, he said.
	   The abandonment at sea follows the controversial disappearance
of Thomas and Eileen Lonergan, a couple from Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, on Jan. 25.
	   Lonergan, 33, and his 28-year old wife were last seen when they
went diving from a dive boat at St. Crispin Reef, 45 miles (72
kilometers) northeast of Port Douglas.
	   A coroner's inquiry into their fate will reopen in Cairns on
Sept. 7. It has already decided that they did not fake their deaths
or die in a murder-suicide, but were left behind and drowned.
	   Bredhauer said he understood the divers involved in Wednesday's
incident were only on the reef for a short period of time before
being rescued.

Last-ditch negotiations continue at strike-bound Hyundai Motor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By Y.J. AHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean government mediators
reported some progress Thursday in ongoing negotiations to end a
month-long strike at Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest
automaker.
	   ``We are making progress piece by piece. But it's too early to
say we have an agreement in our hands,'' said Rep. Cho Sung-joon, a
member of the government mediation team.
	   ``The rest of the world is watching. This is the first showcase
test on how South Korea will keep its promise to allow layoffs,''
he said.
	   Kim Kwang-shik, head of the Hyundai union, one of the nation's
most militant, said, ``It's rough sailing, but the talks have not
broken down yet.''
	   The creation of a more flexible labor market was a key part of
reforms South Korea promised last December in return for a dlrs 58
billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Hyundai is the first major South Korean conglomerate to begin
shedding redundant workers. The outcome will likely affect other
troubled businesses and South Korea's overall efforts to woo back
foreign investors.
	   ``Potential investors in Korea will decide their course of
action based on the development and outcome of the Hyundai labor
row,'' The Korea Times said in an editorial.
	   The government has 15,000 riot police standing by to break up
the strike if the negotiations fail. Some 5,000 workers and their
families have been encamped since July 20 inside Hyundai's plant at
Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul.
	   But the use of force could prove an embarrassment to President
Kim Dae-jung, a former opposition leader who routinely accused past
governments of police brutality in breaking up strikes.
	   Officials also fear that television images of helmeted riot
police throwing tear gas and swinging batons at workers armed with
metal pipes and firebombs could scare away foreign investors.
	   To avoid that, Kim's governing party dispatched a five-member
negotiating team that has held separate talks with Hyundai's
managers and union leaders since Tuesday.
	   The union wants the company to take back ``every single one'' of
the 1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling
domestic sales.
	   Local media reported government mediators were trying to
persuade management to put most of those workers on unpaid leave,
while urging the union to accept the dismissal of at least a few
hundred.
	   Both sides were reported to be resistant to compromise.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Chief presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said at a daily
briefing Thursday that ``a minimum level of layoffs'' at Hyundai is
inevitable.
	   In the midst of a deepening economic crisis, the number of
jobless people has doubled to 1.5 million and is expected to reach
2 million by year's end, a shock to South Korean workers long
accustomed to lifetime employment.
