<HEADLINE> Researchers Claim Viagra `Solution' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- For men who just can't wait an hour for  
their Viagra to take effect, two researchers think they have the 
answer: a nasal spray delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Dittert and Anwar Hussein of the University of Kentucky's  
College of Pharmacy say they've created the first soluble version 
of Viagra's active ingredient, sildenafil. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the spray could allow Viagra to be absorbed directly  
into the bloodstream, offering a quicker hit -- 10 to 15 minutes -- 
with a lower dose than the anti-impotency pills currently on the 
market. Those pills, whose active ingredient is not very 
water-soluble, can take up to an hour or more to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one catch: Dittert and Hussain cannot market their idea  
without permission from Pfizer Inc., which owns all rights to 
Viagra and sildenafil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to steal their compound,'' Dittert told the  
Lexington Herald-Leader in Thursday's editions. ``We want to help 
them make a better product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers would like to collaborate with Pfizer in  
marketing the spray, but Pfizer said it isn't interested, according 
to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> No Word on Possible Ford-Volvo Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Ford Motor Co. board completed its quarterly  
meeting Thursday with no word on the prospect of a linkup with 
Sweden's Volvo AB or any other automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials declined to comment on what the board discussed,  
other than its routine decision to authorize a first-quarter 
dividend. ``As a matter of company policy, we never comment on 
rumors and acquisition activities,'' spokesman John Spelich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sweden, Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg also declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo also has been reported to be in discussions with Italy's  
Fiat SpA and Germany's Volkswagen AG. Last week, there was a report 
that Volvo had hired a Wall Street investment bank to look into a 
possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no shortage of speculation lately about possible  
mergers and acquisitions in the auto industry, a result of last 
year's big merger of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also has been rumored to be looking at Japan's struggling  
Nissan Motor Co. and BMW AG. Nissan and DaimlerChrysler AG appear 
to have been talking as well; on Thursday, Nissan President 
Yoshikazu Hanawa said his company would consider a partnership with 
the German-American company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, the world's second largest automaker after General Motors  
Corp., has about $22 billion in cash reserves. It has made it clear 
in recent weeks that it's willing to look at any potential 
acquisition or joint ventures with smaller automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Maryann Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz said Ford  
likely will take its time reviewing Volvo to ensure it's a good 
fit. She noted that Volvo is a small player in the auto industry, 
producing under 500,000 vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford produced 836,629 of just one model last year: its F-series  
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Gary Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein said Volvo could be  
a good investment for Ford at the right price, but that some 
shareholders would rather see the automaker spend the money on 
dividends or share repurchasing. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending $2.5 billion to buy Jaguar in 1989 -- an  
investment that grew to around $6 billion after Jaguar's aged 
factories were upgraded -- Ford is wary about spending too much for 
another niche automaker. The investment in Jaguar has only recently 
begun to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo would add another potentially high-profit, premium brand  
to its worldwide lineup. But ``Volvo is a niche product and a niche 
brand,'' Keller said. ``It is a relatively high-cost producer and 
it has relatively inefficient factories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's board recently showed its financial discipline when it  
refused to pay a high price to buy out Korea's Kia Motors Corp., 
Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, it would have made more product sense for them  
than Volvo, because what's really missing in the Ford product line 
is a small, inexpensive car that can be sold in the developing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what Kia had. But when it got to the point where it was  
not economically justifiable for them, they walked away.''

<HEADLINE> Bribery Scandal Reaches USOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A senior U.S. Olympic Committee official  
resigned Thursday after his superiors learned he was the middleman 
for Salt Lake City bidders in a scheme to buy information about 
Latin American IOC members, Olympic sources told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredo La Mont, a senior director of international relations,  
is the first USOC official to be linked to the growing scandal 
involving alleged bribes of International Olympic Committee members 
in an attempt to win votes in Salt Lake's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a USOC statement, La Mont stepped down after  
informing the committee ``of a previously undisclosed business 
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic (Bid) Committee through the 
office of former SLOC president Tom Welch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded that Mr. La Mont's activities, which he indicated  
he pursued independent of his USOC responsibilities, nonetheless 
constituted a conflict of interest,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not provide details.  
</P>
<P>
	But sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said La  
Mont had ``passed money -- not a lot -- a couple of grand a month'' 
to third parties in return for ``intelligence information on IOC 
members in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont also sent food and dairy products, including the diet  
supplement Ensure, to contacts in Mexico, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach La Mont by telephone Thursday night were  
unsuccessful. He did not return telephone messages left on his 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages also were not returned by Welch, USOC president  
Bill Hybl and spokesman Mike Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz, contacted at his Colorado  
home, said he could not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC learned of the connection when La Mont went to Schultz  
earlier this month after being contacted by Welch, according to the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew everyone was being watched,'' one source said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the sources said that La Mont apparently did the  
work from his Colorado Springs, Colo., home, but that the committee 
was checking the hard drive of his office computer to see if any 
action was taken on USOC property. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said they did not know how long the operation had  
lasted, but believed it started in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has been with the USOC since the late 1980s. Salt Lake  
won the 2002 Games in 1995, on its fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Schultz said information on the La Mont-Welch  
relationship has been given to two panels investigating the bribery 
scandal -- the USOC Special Commission chaired by former Sen. George 
Mitchell and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those panels, as well as those representing the IOC and SLOC,  
are looking into possible influencing of IOC members in exchange 
for votes backing Salt Lake's candidacy for the 2002 Olympic Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont's alleged association with Welch is expected to become a  
part of the Justice Department investigation, according to the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members face possible expulsion for ``serious''  
offenses in the Salt Lake scandal and four others face minor 
charges, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Thursday in an 
interview with The Associated Press. Samaranch didn't identify the 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned in 1997 as head of the Salt Lake organizers  
amid allegations of spouse abuse, has said he used a privately 
funded program to pay for favors of IOC members. It was, he said, 
common practice in the Olympic bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, Welch's successor, resigned last week as the  
bribery scandal widened.

<HEADLINE> Smith Remembers Jordan's Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- The greatest player in the history of  
North Carolina basketball almost didn't play for the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Former UNC coach Dean Smith reminisced about recruiting Michael  
Jordan hours after the NBA superstar announced his retirement in 
Chicago on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really liked UCLA, but I guess they didn't call him,'' said  
Smith, who remains one of Jordan's closest friends. ``He wasn't the 
most highly recruited kid at that time, but we were delighted to 
have him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognized his determination, and we recognized he had  
great quickness and speed, but we had no idea about his basketball 
savvy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan went on to star for North Carolina, hitting the  
title-clinching shot as a freshman in the 1982 NCAA championship 
game. He left Chapel Hill after his junior season and was drafted 
by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest is history, and Smith, who retired in 1997 as college  
basketball's winningest coach, said Wednesday he was astonished by 
Jordan's list of achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the national player of the year in 1984, but we never  
dreamed here, 14 or 15 years later, he would accomplish what he's 
accomplished,'' said Smith, who remains one of Jordan's closest 
friends. ``I think it's remarkable that every year he improved. He 
really is special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him now. At this point, he's happy, his teams  
have won and what more could you want from anyone you care about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he wouldn't be surprised if Jordan returned to the  
sports spotlight in another form. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he attempts to be a senior golfer at 50, do not be  
surprised if he is successful,'' Smith said. ``He really got a bad 
rap when he tried baseball. More and more baseball people told me 
he could've done it. It was going to take time, but he was 
improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Black, who assisted on Jordan's NCAA title-winning shot in  
1982, said he had thought that James Worthy, another member of that 
team, had a better shot at basketball superstardom than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell (Jordan) would be good because of how hard he  
was willing to work, but no one could have imagined all this,'' 
Black told The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Doherty, another member of the 1982 championship team and  
now an assistant coach at Kansas, said he knew in May that Jordan 
would retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard he wasn't working in the offseason, it only  
confirmed things because Michael would never go into a season 
unprepared,'' Doherty said. ``He entertained us for many years and 
for that we should all thank him. The game will sorely miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Jordan's most remarkable characteristic is the way he  
handled what has become worldwide media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have so many great memories of him, I couldn't begin to  
start with one,'' Smith said. ``I'm still amazed at how he handled 
something that's impossible to do -- the adoration. It's amazing how 
he survives with so much attention given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit a clutch putt for me once. I'll remember that, too.''

<HEADLINE> Two Shot at Salt Lake TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman carrying a grocery bag filled with  
bullets entered a television studio lobby Thursday afternoon and 
opened fire with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were injured, one seriously, during the woman's  
four-floor shooting spree at the downtown office building housing 
KSL television and radio stations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities took De-Kieu Duy, 24, into custody in the  
fourth-floor offices of AT&AMP;T Wireless Services after company 
employees tackled and disarmed her. Police said Duy had targeted 
KSL but ended up in the AT&AMP;T offices, where her 9mm pistol jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe she has a long history of psychiatric problems,''  
said Sgt. Ken Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T employee Anne Sleater, 30, was shot in the head and was  
listed in extremely critical condition, LDS Hospital spokesman Jess 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	KSL building manager Brent Wightman was shot but not seriously  
hurt. He was under observation at another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Video West technical operator Dan Nestel said he saw a woman  
wearing a light-colored parka, a hat and shooting range ear 
protection enter the KSL lobby and demand to speak to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	When her request was denied, Nestel said, she began firing  
random shots in the lobby. KSL radio employee Mary Kammeyer entered 
the lobby after hearing shots and was confronted by the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying, `Newsroom, newsroom, where's the newsroom?'''  
Kammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City Police Chief Ruben Ortega said: ``She came in  
specifically with the intent of shooting someone at KSL 
Television,'' Ortega said. ``Her motives are not totally clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KSL is Salt Lake City's NBC affiliate and is owned by the Mormon  
Church.

<HEADLINE> Saturn-Bound Spacecraft Has Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's biggest and most complex  
interplanetary probe went into so-called safe mode this week when 
it detected a potential problem on its way to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
	The plutonium-powered Cassini spacecraft remained in contact  
with its operations team. The probe sensed the possible problem 
Monday, triggering a program designed to halt non-critical 
activity, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft began using minimum power and pointing its  
12-foot antenna toward the sun to shade the rest of the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Program Manager Bob Mitchell said engineering data from the  
spacecraft are being transmitted to Earth to help engineers 
pinpoint what caused Cassini to enter the safe mode. 
</P>
<P>
	JPL said engineers suspect that during a tracking maneuver,  
Cassini's star scanner may have viewed a patch of sky without the 
bright stars the spacecraft uses to orient itself in space. 
Software would have alerted the system when the scanner had spent 
sufficient time searching for but not spotting familiar stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he expects Cassini will be taken out of safe mode  
later this week after the problem has been identified and data 
thoroughly analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini was launched on Oct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral,  
Fla., over the objections of anti-nuclear protesters who feared 
what might happen if the rocket exploded while carrying Cassini and 
its 72 pounds of poisonous plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, on a $3.4 billion mission through the solar  
system, is expected to reach Saturn in July 2004. It passed Venus 
last year and this year will use Venus again and then swoop within 
500 miles of Earth, an encounter that also worries Cassini 
opponents.

<HEADLINE> Mogul Champion Mosely Begins Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Olympic and World Cup moguls  
champion Jonny Moseley faces his first major competition of the 
season this weekend as the freestyle World Cup tour visits 
Steamboat Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady snows since mid-December have created ideal conditions  
for the Sprint Shootout, which starts Friday night with acro 
skiing. Moseley, the popular champion from Tiburon, Calif., 
competes Saturday in dual moguls and Olympic champions Eric 
Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., and Nikki Stone of Westborough, Mass., 
headline the aerials contest Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup season was delayed a month when sponsor problems  
in Europe forced cancellation of the events in December. Moseley 
expected to be competing last weekend when the season opened in 
Mont Tremblant, Quebec, but after disappointing results in two 
exhibitions, he decided to spend another week training. 
</P>
<P>
	While Moseley is healthy but rusty after a summer of promotional  
appearances, 1994 Olympic moguls champion Jean-Luc Brassard of 
Canada is in good-and-getting-better ski form, but he's not so 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the opening moguls event in light snow at Mont  
Tremblant last Saturday, the three-time World Cup moguls king and 
two-time world champion was felled with the flu. He stayed home for 
a few extra days before arriving in Steamboat Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a Canadian coaching turnover, Brassard has gone back  
to his first moguls coach, Yves Therrien. Together, they stripped 
and rebuilt not only his skiing technique but what had been his 
bulletproof confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge win, a great start for my season. This takes  
away a big pressure,'' Brassard said last weekend. ``I feel so 
good, so much more confident now. ... My skiing still is not where 
I want it, but I am on the right course.''

<HEADLINE> Simpson Property To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The auction of O.J. Simpson's possessions  
could turn out to be a financial fizzle because collectors have 
been shunning the former football star's memorabilia since his 1994 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction firm of Butterfield and Butterfield plans to sell  
Simpson's Heisman Trophy, his No. 32 football jerseys, carpets, 
paintings and Tiffany-style lamps as well as a large collection of 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction is scheduled for Feb. 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds will come nowhere close to satisfying a $33.5 million  
judgment owed to the estate of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and the family of Ronald Goldman. The judgment comes from 
a civil wrongful death suit in which a jury found Simpson liable 
for the killings of Ms. Simpson and Goldman. Simpson was acquitted 
of murder in an earlier criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts testifying at Simpson's civil trial claimed his  
possessions would continue to be prized by collectors and would 
bring top dollar for the rest of his life. The testimony helped 
jurors set the damages figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will have 80 lots of property for sale. The most  
valuable piece is the Heisman Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 as 
college football's best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers in sports memorabilia said there will be a market for  
the trophy because it is so unique, but other items will be hard to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back at our records, we've had no inquiries or sales  
of Simpson stuff,'' said Brooke Tabak of Champion Sports 
Collectibles. ``We have some of his rookie cards and autographed 
lithos and photos, but nobody's calling for any of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson continues to live in Los Angeles with his two young  
children. He has appealed the civil trial verdict, but lawyers have 
said this doesn't prevent the auction from going forward.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Mulls Hall of Fame Changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The LPGA Tour is voting whether to change  
the requirements for election to its Hall of Fame, one of the 
toughest shrines to enter in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new criteria based on points, Amy Alcott and Beth  
Daniel would easily have enough to get into the hall. Former 
players like Judy Rankin and Donna Caponi would also have a chance 
to be elected through a veterans' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought for a while that we've needed to change our  
criteria,'' Daniel said Thursday afternoon. ``I think this is a 
step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA has been working on the change since 1985. A committee  
proposed the new criteria on Tuesday, and ballots from all LPGA 
members are due Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	JoAnne Carner said she and the other 13 members of the LPGA Hall  
of Fame support the new criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to retain the integrity of the Hall of Fame and not  
make it any easier to get in, but instead make it attainable by 
each era's best golfers,'' Carner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to qualify for the hall was Betsy King in 1995  
when she got her 30th career victory. Under the previous standards, 
there was some concern she might be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	Players had to have 30 victories and two major championships, 35  
victories and one major or 40 victories and no majors. That 
criteria had shut out players like Alcott, who counts five majors 
among her 29 LPGA victories. Only nine other players have won more 
majors, and all of them are in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, who has won 32 times including the LPGA Championship,  
would have to win three more tournaments to get in under the old 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player who starts her career in 1999, or even 1990, it  
would have been so difficult to get into the hall,'' Daniel said. 
``What it comes down to is, do you want your Hall of Fame to 
represent a few, absolutely outstanding individuals? Or a Hall of 
Fame that represents players who stood out in their era?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new criteria would require 27 points:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each LPGA tournament victory.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 2 points for each major.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each Vare Trophy, awarded to the player with  
lowest scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 point for each player of the year award.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcott would have 35 points under that system and Daniel would  
have 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee has done an excellent job in retooling the  
criteria, yet retaining the integrity of objective selection and 
making sure that those players that dominated their era and made an 
impact are recognized,'' LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the old system, players must have kept LPGA membership  
for 10 years. Annika Sorenstam is in her sixth year on the LPGA, 
although she already has won 16 times along with consecutive U.S. 
Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam would have 24 points, and could have enough points  
with another solid year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, I knew the Hall of Fame was way up here,'' she  
said, holding her hands high above her head. ``I thought I probably 
would never do it. But then they came out with this, and I started 
thinking that I have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised,'' she said. ``They lowered it much  
more than I thought they would.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore Exchange Drops on Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- A broker's typing error on a bank stock caused  
Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index to plunge 5.5 percent at 
Friday's opening before the trading house discovered its mistake 
and reported it to the Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Stock Exchange of Singapore would not  
reveal which broker or company made the error while typing in a 
transaction on a locally issued share in Oversea-Chinese Banking 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name, said  
the broker typed in a share price of 30 Singapore cents (18 cents) 
instead of 7.95 Singapore dollars (about $4.73). 
</P>
<P>
	When the computer, detecting a possible problem, asked, ``Would  
you like to continue?'' the broker typed, ``Yes,'' said the 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was forced through. That's how a mistake can occur,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a drastic change in the share price of one of Singapore's  
top banks forced the main index to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage house discovered its own error and reported it to  
the Stock Exchange, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying and selling parties then agreed to withdraw the sale  
and the index corrected itself, showing a .4 percent rise by the 
midday closing.

<HEADLINE> Carly Simon Opera Back in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six years after its debut, an opera written  
by Carly Simon is back in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Opera Company of North Carolina has chosen ``Romulus Hunt,''  
about how a young boy and his imaginary friend come to grips with 
divorced parents, to open its season tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It will mark the first time a professional company has performed  
the opera since its initial runs in New York and Washington in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the Opera Company had hoped to have Simon be a part  
of the casting and rehearsal process. But because of scheduling 
conflicts, she only had time to be part of several fund-raising 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was expected to be on hand for tonight's performance.

<HEADLINE> NBA Top Pick Fouls Out in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi is not having his way  
in European basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft fouled out with six minutes  
left in regulation Thursday and his Kinder Bologna lost to a 74-72 
double-overtime loss to cross-city rival TeamSystem in a Euro 
League playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, whose NBA rights are held by the Los Angeles  
Clippers, finished with six points and seven rebounds in 22 
minutes. He signed with the defending European club champions right 
before the NBA lockout was resolved, and has an escape clause that 
allows him to leave Kinder Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another player who went overseas because of the lockout, Vinny  
Del Negro, also struggled Thursday, scoring two points in 13 
minutes for TeamSystem. The San Antonio Spurs guard can return to 
the NBA after Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder Bologna is 1-2 since Olowokandi joined the team, and he's  
averaging 11.3 points and nine rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi went to the bench Thursday after picking up his  
fourth foul with 11:47 left. When coach Ettore Messina put the 
7-foot-1 center back on the floor five minutes later, Olowokandi 
was whistled for an offensive foul the first time he touched the 
ball and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	European pro games are 40 minutes, and players get five fouls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lithuanian Arturas Karnisovas, a Seton Hall product, led  
TeamSystem with 18 points, including the winning free throws with 
four seconds left in the second OT.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Gearing Up for Long Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Toni Kukoc knows just what to do with the  
Chicago Bulls now that the Airless Era is here. 
</P>
<P>
	Gut the team.  
</P>
<P>
	That might sound like strange answer coming from a guy with  
three championship rings and two years left on his contract, but 
Kukoc hates the thought of mediocrity even more than losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get the team with a few good guys that cannot reach the  
playoffs, they're always short of the playoffs,'' he said and then 
stopped, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Michael Jordan retired, the brutal reality of what  
the Bulls will be like without him is starting to sink in. Only 
four players -- Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are 
under contract, with Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Bulls say they want to bring back Scottie Pippen and  
the rest of the championship team, the prospects of that are 
looking less and less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, one of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for starting center Luc Longley, who appears headed for  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pippen and the rest of the gang do leave, the Bulls would  
have enough money to make some deals in the free-agent market, 
which includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse 
and Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Chicago could pick up a few big names, don't expect  
to be partying in Grant Park any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's certainly 
probably not going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. Regardless of what happens to  
the rest of the championship team, the Bulls still plan to run 
their trademark triangle offense. The system isn't complicated, but 
it's not easy to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable with 
it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other out on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As painful as it might be to watch, this is the best time to  
rebuild if the Bulls are going to do it, Kukoc said. The 
lockout-shortened season will last only three months, so at least 
the agony won't go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls end up with a high draft pick and make some big  
moves in free agency over the summer, they could be well on their 
way to rebuilding a good team by next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, this has been a long time coming, Kukoc said. It's  
better to just get it over with now and move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was not this year, we would be here next year talking  
about the same thing. Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings 
than six, but we would be here and talking about, `What do you 
think about rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that 
it's better to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.''

<HEADLINE> Big Movers in the Stock Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and American Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Eastman Kodak fell 8 3/16 to 70 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time charges, fourth-quarter earnings came in at  
$1.05 a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call had been 
expecting a $1.15 per share profit. 

</P>
<P>
 *Motorola fell 4 3/8 to 66 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The maker of telecommunications equipment, based in Schaumburg,  
Ill., reported net income of $159 million, or 26 cents a diluted 
share, compared with year-earlier net income of $321 million, or 53 
cents a diluted share after special charges. The results, announced 
late Wednesday, beat analysts' expected 23 cents a share. However, 
in a Thursday morning conference call with analysts, Motorola 
disclosed that Brazil's currency devaluation will lower 
first-quarter earnings by $15 million and could slow the 
electronics giant's sales growth in Latin America. 

</P>
<P>
 *Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 1/4 to 22 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The computer chip maker's fourth-quarter net earnings were 15  
cents per diluted share, compared to a year-ago loss of 9 cents, 
and analysts' consensus expectation of 19 cents. AMD said its 
production problems are behind it, but that it faces heightened 
competition from Intel Corp., which is bent on recovering share in 
low-cost PC chips. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities 
downgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``top pick,'' and Sutro &AMP; Co. 
cut it to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Planet Hollywood International Inc. rose 1/2 to 3 1/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The trendy restaurant company said it expects to record a  
fourth-quarter pretax charge of $130 million to $160 million, 
mainly for asset writedowns that are part of a plan to lower 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge, Planet Hollywood expects to report  
negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NASD    	
</P>
<P>
 *Apple Computer fell 5 1/8 to 41 3/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Wednesday that its first-quarter net profit  
more than tripled, boosted by strong sales of its new iMac 
computer. Apple earned 95 cents a share on a diluted basis, up from 
33 cents a year ago and easily beating Wall Street forecasts. 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities upgraded the stock to 
``buy'' from ``market perform,'' but Salomon Smith Barney 
downgraded it to ``neutral'' from ``buy,'' citing high inventories 
of iMac computers at the end of December. 

</P>
<P>
 *Sunglass Hut rose 1 3/4 to 9 1/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said it bought two e-commerce World Wide Web sites,  
shades.com and SwissArmyDepot.com, in a $4 million deal. Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter and Gruntal &AMP; Co. both upgraded the stock. 

</P>
<P>
 *Golden Books rose 1 7/32 to 1 31/32.    	
</P>
<P>
	Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co., said that  
Disney might be interested in acquiring the troubled children's 
publishing company, The New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden Books declined to comment on any pending sale, though it  
has hired the investment banker Allen &AMP; Co. to find an interested 
buyer.

<HEADLINE> Mogul Champion Mosely Begins Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Olympic and World Cup moguls  
champion Jonny Moseley faces his first major competition of the 
season this weekend as the freestyle World Cup tour visits 
Steamboat Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady snows since mid-December have created ideal conditions  
for the Sprint Shootout, which starts Friday night with acro 
skiing. Moseley, the popular champion from Tiburon, Calif., 
competes Saturday in dual moguls and Olympic champions Eric 
Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., and Nikki Stone of Westborough, Mass., 
headline the aerials contest Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup season was delayed a month when sponsor problems  
in Europe forced cancellation of the events in December. Moseley 
expected to be competing last weekend when the season opened in 
Mont Tremblant, Quebec, but after disappointing results in two 
exhibitions, he decided to spend another week training. 
</P>
<P>
	While Moseley is healthy but rusty after a summer of promotional  
appearances, 1994 Olympic moguls champion Jean-Luc Brassard of 
Canada is in good-and-getting-better ski form, but he's not so 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the opening moguls event in light snow at Mont  
Tremblant last Saturday, the three-time World Cup moguls king and 
two-time world champion was felled with the flu. He stayed home for 
a few extra days before arriving in Steamboat Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a Canadian coaching turnover, Brassard has gone back  
to his first moguls coach, Yves Therrien. Together, they stripped 
and rebuilt not only his skiing technique but what had been his 
bulletproof confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge win, a great start for my season. This takes  
away a big pressure,'' Brassard said last weekend. ``I feel so 
good, so much more confident now. ... My skiing still is not where 
I want it, but I am on the right course.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rally on Brazil Worries / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply for a second day  
Thursday as investors continued to shift money away from stocks 
amid the renewed economic uncertainty in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 5/32, or  
$11.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.05 percent from 5.13 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally came as stocks plunged on most Latin American  
exchanges and Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average 
slid 228.63 points to 9,120.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The main stock index in Brazil fell 10 percent on top of the 5  
percent loss suffered on Wednesday after the resignation of that 
nation's central bank chief and the decision by his successor to 
effectively devalue the Brazilian currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden outbreak of financial turmoil has eroded optimism  
that Latin America will avert a full-scale crisis like the one that 
has ravaged the Asian economy. U.S. Treasury bonds, considered one 
of the safest investments in the world, have repeatedly benefited 
from similar bouts of turmoil over the past 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond-friendly news, the Labor Department reported that  
consumer prices rose a scant 0.1 percent in December, bringing the 
inflation rate for all of 1998 to 1.6 percent, the lowest level 
since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Commerce Department reported separately that retail  
sales surged 5.1 percent in December, suggesting that inflationary 
pressures persist. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading Thursday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose between 7/32 point and 9/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities rose 7/16 point to 13/16 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 6.52 
points to 1,323.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.42 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.32 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.39 percent, as the discount fell 0.05 percentage 
point to 4.25 percent. One-year yields were 4.40 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.06 percentage point to 4.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 from 4.50 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 13/16 from 124 3/8. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Cigarette Tax Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who has been rolling out a  
series of spending initiatives, will propose paying for them with a 
new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax, an administration official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigarette tax, which will surely be opposed by Republicans  
in Congress, would raise some $8 billion for the domestic spending 
initiatives, according to the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also will insist that states turn  
over some of the money they will get from a giant settlement with 
tobacco companies, but not this year. Clinton's plan doesn't count 
on that money until 2001, meaning he does not need it for the 
fiscal 2000 budget he will submit to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Clinton has touted a number of new ideas but  
avoided discussing how he would pay for them. Still, he has 
promised his budget will be balanced without reaching into the 
budget surplus -- making it nearly impossible to pay for new 
spending without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On almost a daily basis, Clinton has put forward spending  
proposals, including more money for after-school programs, new 
defense spending, tax incentives for long-term care and money to 
help people with disabilities go to work. The plans announced 
Thursday were for more money to fight crime and to aid people with 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional Republicans have consistently warned Clinton  
against paying for his plans with increased taxes, including 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes has never been the answer to our nation's  
problems,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, wrote the president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Thursday Republicans are  
concerned that other tax increases may be in the offing: ``This 
(cigarette) tax hike is not enough to pay for all the president's 
new spending programs, not even close,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton proposed paying for new domestic spending  
with a massive fine on the tobacco industry, envisioned as part of 
sweeping tobacco legislation. But that legislation fell apart under 
criticism that it was too hard on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The states responded by settling lawsuits with tobacco companies  
on their own. Cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion 
over 25 years, raising prices by 45 cents a pack. That contributed 
to a 30 percent jump in cigarette prices in December, the 
government reported. Four other states previously had settled their 
suits independently. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers and governors are already debating how to spend  
the money, but the federal government has long held that it has a 
right to much of it. Many state lawsuits had sought to recover 
money spent by Medicaid on sick smokers, and the federal government 
pays for at least half of Medicaid costs in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed a deal was possible. Administration  
officials indicated they might let states keep the money if they 
agreed to spend it on certain public health, anti-smoking programs. 
But now Clinton envisions using some of the money for the federal 
budget, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House still wants federal legislation imposing new  
restrictions on the tobacco industry, while also giving the federal 
government a financial settlement of its own. But that requires 
congressional action. The administration hopes states will press 
Congress for such legislation if their settlement money is on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to create an environment and pressure for a  
bipartisan agreement on tobacco,'' an administration official 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The states aren't pleased. They argue that some of the suits  
were based on consumer fraud claims, not Medicaid. They say the 
federal government should file its own lawsuit if it wants money. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire was told  
about the administration's plans and spread the word to other 
states Wednesday night.	   ``The federal government didn't assist us in any way,'' Gregoire 
said Thursday. ``Our taxpayers took the risk. We assumed all of the 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Access Denied to Cable Crash Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Prosecutors won't get broad access to  
notes and unaired tapes from media interviews with the crew of a 
Marine jet that cut a ski gondola cable in Italy, killing 20 
people, a military judge said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine prosecutors had subpoenaed the material from CBS' ``60  
Minutes'' and Rolling Stone magazine. CBS plans to air a report 
Jan. 24, and Rolling Stone published a story on the tragedy last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, said he likely will either  
reject the subpoena outright, or permit a limited, ``in camera'' 
review of the notes and tapes. In the latter case, Nunley would 
review all the material himself first and decide which materials 
prosecutors could see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to give the government unfettered review of what  
you have,'' Nunley told attorneys for the two news organizations. 
``I do not intend to have you turn over to the government all of 
your raw product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Maj. Daniel Daugherty, the government prosecutor, argued  
against an ``in camera'' review of the tapes, saying it would limit 
prosecutors' ability to gather evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecution doesn't know what's in the tape, but certainly  
the context makes it relevant,'' he said, referring to the unaired 
CBS material. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty people died Feb. 3 when a EA-6B Prowler jet clipped a  
cable supporting a ski gondola at Cavalese, Italy. The plane was on 
temporary duty at the Aviano, Italy, air base and was on a training 
mission. Prosecutors blame the tragedy on reckless flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission  
Viejo, Calif., and the navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of 
Westbury, N.Y., face separate courts-martial proceedings on 
involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide charges. Each could 
be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of all charges.

<HEADLINE>  Armani Sets Casual Pace for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) - A soft jacket over a pullover, wide trousers  
and comfortable shoes: this is Giorgio Armani's style recipe as 
fashion enters the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to dare to change,'' the master of Milan elegance  
said after his Wednesday afternoon show, which closed the six-day 
Italian fall-winter 1999-2000 menswear presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Armani's view of change, however, does not include the shock  
fashion seen on some of the runways this week, from sequined 
dresses to corsets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about good taste,'' said Armani, noting that a kilt  
can be very fashionable in the right circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The most daring act of the Armani show was to put the tie and  
shirt in the back drawer. Except for a few cameo appearances, these 
staples of classic menswear were replaced by pullovers, from a 
close fitting V-neck to a cassock-length turtle neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from the rigidity of the uniform blazer, the latest Armani  
jacket is elongated, has Velcro or snaps in the place of buttons, 
and a minimalist lapel. At times it is so light that it can be worn 
with nothing underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Colors are strictly Armani from pewter to gray green. Only the  
younger Emporio line had spurts of bright red and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	His evening wear also dared to move ahead. Instead of the stiff  
tuxedo, he presented models in velvet pajama suits, whose at-home 
mood was underlined by the slippers on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armani collection -- applauded by front row celebrities  
Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver, and fellow 
designers Tom Ford and Jean Paul Gaultier -- underlined the casual 
feel that has marked this latest round of collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The next winter season offers outfits for rock climbing, snow  
boarding, motorcycling, disco dancing, home lounging, anything but 
that boring place called the office. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest town wear designers were Krizia, with her light wool  
suits worn with a proper shirt and velvet tie, Gianfranco Ferre 
with his knobby gray tweed suit without a lapel over a high 
collared pullover, and Fendi, with its traditional double breasted 
jacket over pressed pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fendi man does work for a living, he can also afford a  
long luxury coat either in mink, or in leather with a discreet mink 
lining. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular single item for next winter is the vest in  
fluffy angora or shaggy fur by day, and sparkling sequins by night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pullovers, too, play a major role in the new millennium fashion  
scene, sweeping the shirt and tie off the fashion stage. The 
favorite style is turtle neck or V-neck, usually in cable knit 
cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
	The look played right into Missoni's hands. The champions of the  
knitting needle showed ultra-soft knitwear in dreamy pastel colors, 
which would look great on her as well as him. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the Missoni pastels, and a few flashes of brightness,  
the collections continued Milan's traditional color dirge of black 
and gray. 
</P>
<P>
	On the whole, jackets tended to be longer and less structured,  
at times looking more like coats or sweaters than part of a suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trousers, too, were loose and often baggy with heavy duty  
pockets, like the cargo pants favored by the younger generation. 
Overcoats and hooded down jackets were in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoe department too, had little time for business-like  
oxfords -- opting instead for combat boots, elevated running shoes 
and thick rubber-soled loafers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eccentric side, many designers, lead by Donatella  
Versace, stiched sequins into their masculine wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	Armani dared not to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Santa Fe To Acquire Snyder Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Santa Fe Energy Resources plans to acquire Snyder  
Oil Corp. for about $450 million in stock, creating an exploration 
and production company with a market value of $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Houston-based Santa Fe would also assume $216  
million in Snyder's debt. The new company, Santa Fe Snyder Corp., 
would be based in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined operations will reduce costs by $20 million  
annually. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is 
expected to close by July. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to result in up to 125 job cuts, said  
Rodney L. Waller, Snyder vice president and treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, based in Fort Worth, currently employs 300 people,  
including 75 in its Fort Worth office who either would be relocated 
or laid off, Waller said. Santa Fe has about 400 employees 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Fe shareholders will own 60 percent of the outstanding  
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined production for 1999 is estimated at 110,000 barrels a  
day, with 55 percent gas and 70 percent domestic.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Statement To Open Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Opening statement Thursday of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the House  
Judiciary Committee chairman, at the Senate trial of President 
Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel for the president and  
senators. We are brought together on this solemn and historic 
occasion to perform important duties assigned to us by the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	We want you to know how much we respect you and this institution  
and how grateful we are for your guidance and your cooperation. 
With your permission, we, the managers of the House, are here to 
set forth the evidence in support of two articles of impeachment 
against President William Jefferson Clinton. You are seated in this 
historic chamber not to embark on some great legislative debate 
which these stately walls have so often witnessed but to listen to 
the evidence as those who must sit in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	To guide you in this grave duty, you've taken an oath of  
impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
	With the simple words -- ``I do'' -- you have pledged to put aside  
personal bias and partisan interest and to do impartial justice. 
Your willingness to take up this calling has once again reminded 
the world of the unique brilliance of America's constitutional 
system of government. 
</P>
<P>
	We are here, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished senators as  
advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice under the law, and 
for the sanctity of the oath. In many ways, the case you will 
consider in the coming days is about those two words -- ``I do.'' 
Pronounced at two presidential inaugurations by a person whose 
spoken words have singular importance to our nation and to the 
great globe itself. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 450 years ago, Sir Thomas More, former lord chancellor  
of England, was imprisoned in the Tower of London because he had in 
the name of conscience defied the absolute power of the king. As 
the playwright Robert Bolt tells it, More was visited by his 
family, who tried to persuade him to speak the words of the oath 
that would save his life, even while in his mind and heart he held 
firm to his conviction that the king was in error -- More refused. 
As he told his daughter Margaret, ``When a man takes an oath, Meg, 
he's holding his own self in his hands like water. And if he opens 
his fingers then, he needn't hope to find himself again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Thomas More, the most brilliant lawyer of his generation -- a  
scholar with an international reputation, the center of a warm and 
affectionate family life which he cherished -- went to his death 
rather than take an oath in vain. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Senate, what you do over the next few weeks will  
forever affect the meaning of those two words, ``I do.'' You are 
now stewards of the oath. Its significance in public service and 
our cherished system of justice will never be the same after this. 
Depending on what you decide, it will either be strengthened in its 
power to achieve justice, or it will go the way of so much of our 
moral infrastructure and become a mere convention -- full of sound 
and fury, signifying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives has named myself and 12 other  
members as managers of its case. I have the honor of introducing 
those distinguished members and explaining how we will make our 
initial presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	The gentleman from Wisconsin, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner will begin  
the presentation with an overview of the case. Representative 
Sensenbrenner is the ranking Republican member of the House 
Judiciary Committee and has served for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Representative Sensenbrenner was a House manager in the  
impeachment trial of Judge Walter L. Nixon, who was convicted on 
two articles of impeachment for making false and misleading 
statements before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Representative Sensenbrenner will be a team of  
managers who will make a presentation of the relevant facts of the 
case. From the very outset of this ordeal, there's been a great 
deal of speculation and misinformation about the facts. That has 
been unfortunate for everyone involved. We believe a full 
presentation of the facts and the law by House managers will be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant from Tennessee was a United States attorney from  
the Western District of Tennessee. As a captain in the Army, 
Representative Bryant served in the Judge Advocate General Corps 
and taught at the United States Military Academy at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative Bryant will explain the background of events that  
led to the illegal actions of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Representative Bryant, Rep. Asa Hutchinson from  
Arkansas will give a presentation of the factual basis for Article 
II, obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative Hutchinson is a former United States attorney for  
the Western District of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Next you will hear from Rep. Jim Rogan of California.  
Representative Rogan is a former California state judge and Los 
Angeles County deputy district attorney. Representative Rogan will 
give a presentation of the factual basis for Article I, grand jury 
perjury. This should conclude our presentation for today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomorrow, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida will tie all of the  
facts together and give a factual summation. Representative 
McCollum is chairman of the subcommittee on crime, a former Naval 
Reserve commander and member of the Judge Advocate General Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the presentation of the facts, a team of managers will  
present the law of perjury and the law of obstruction of justice 
and how it applies to the articles of impeachment before you today. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Senate has made it clear that a crime is not essential  
to impeachment and removal from office, these managers will explain 
how egregious and criminal the conduct alleged in the articles of 
impeachment is. 
</P>
<P>
	This team includes Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, Rep. Steve  
Chabot of Ohio, Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia and Rep. Chris Cannon of 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative Gekas is the chairman of the subcommittee on  
commercial and administrative law. And in 1989, he served as a 
manager of the impeachment trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, who the 
Senate convicted on eight articles for making false and misleading 
statements under oath, and one article of conspiracy to engage in 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative Gekas is a former assistant district attorney.  
Representative Chabot serves on the subcommittee on crime and has 
experience as a criminal defense lawyer. Representative Barr is a 
former United States attorney for the Northern District of Georgia 
where he specialized in public corruption. He also has experience 
as a criminal defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative Cannon has had experience as the deputy associate  
solicitor general of the Department of the Interior and as a 
practicing attorney. That should conclude our presentation for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, three managers will make a presentation on  
constitutional law as it relates to this case. There has been a 
great deal of argument about whether the conduct alleged in these 
articles rises to the level of removable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	This team's analysis of the precedents of the Senate and  
application of the facts of this case will make it clear that the 
Senate has established the conduct alleged in the articles to be 
removable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In this presentation, you will hear from Rep. Charles Canady of  
Florida, Rep. Steve Buyer of Indiana, and Rep. Lindsey Graham of 
South Carolina. Representative Canady is chairman of the 
subcommittee on the Constitution and one of the leading voices on 
constitutional law in the House. Representative Buyer served in the 
United States Army as a member of the Judge Advocate General Corps, 
where he was assigned as special assistant to the United States 
attorney in Virginia. He also served as a deputy to the Indiana 
attorney general. Representative Graham served in the Air Force as 
a member of the Judge Advocate General Corps and as a South 
Carolina assistant attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the presentation of the facts, the law of perjury and  
obstruction of justice, and Constitution law, Mr. Rogan and myself 
will give you a final summation and closing to our initial 
presentation.

<HEADLINE> Video Leads to Charges Vs. Nurse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERGENFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- A couple who installed a video camera  
so they could watch over their disabled 3-year-old daughter from 
their bedroom captured a nurse smacking, pinching and manhandling 
the child, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's parents watched the tape, then called police, who on  
Tuesday arrested Neonita Sabate, a 42-year-old registered nurse, on 
charges of assault and child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm traumatized,'' the girl's mother, whose name was not  
released, said in Thursday's Record of Hackensack. ``I don't trust 
anyone anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child has a rare chromosome disorder, and her breathing and  
heartbeat have to be monitored around the clock. The parents bought 
the video system so they could watch her on a monitor in their 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera was mounted in a corner and was not hidden, police  
said, but the nurse apparently did not realize it was there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't buy it to watch the nurses,'' the girl's mother said.  
``I trusted all of my nurses, especially this one, who had been 
with me more than a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tape also showed the nurse pulling the girl's hair and  
placing her hand and a washcloth over the child's mouth to stop her 
from crying. At one point, the girl's mother said, the tape shows 
the nurse picking the girl up and dropping her in the crib ``like a 
sack of potatoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Sabate on Thursday were unsuccessful. She has  
no listed home number.

<HEADLINE> Jack Nicklaus To Have Hip Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time in 40 years, the Masters will have to go on  
without Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of hoping that exercise would strengthen his  
degenerative left hip, Nicklaus has decided that the only way to 
play competitively again is to have hip replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I do feel stronger and in better condition, I am not  
strong enough to play the best golf I possibly can to start the 
year,'' Nicklaus, who turns 59 next week, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation, scheduled for Jan. 27, means Nicklaus will miss  
the Masters for the first time since 1959, when he failed to make 
the cut as a 19-year-old amateur. Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead hold 
the record for most consecutive Masters at 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus also withdrew from two Senior PGA Tour events this  
month, the MasterCard Championship and the Senior Skins Game. In 
addition to the Masters, he is expected to miss the first two 
majors on the senior circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I feel strong enough and able to play golf at a  
competitive level, I will continue to play tournament golf,'' said 
Nicklaus, the winner of 18 majors and two U.S. Amateur titles. ``If 
I want to play later this year and in the future, now is the time 
for surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, George Archer became the first player with an  
artificial hip to win a senior tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion, did not say when he might  
return, although later this year is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	With his youngest son getting married Feb. 20, wife Barbara told  
The Palm Beach Post, ``I expect to have him dancing by then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was hobbling so badly at times last year that he  
stopped his streak of 146 consecutive majors when he pulled out of 
the British Open. This will be the third straight major he has 
failed to play. 
</P>

	Nicklaus' record at Augusta goes beyond his six green jackets.  
He won his first Masters in 1963 and his last won 23 years later

and finished in the top 10 in every Masters in the 1970s. 
</P>

	Even at 58, he showed he could still compete with the best. He  
dazzled the gallery again in April by closing with a 68 and 
finishing just three strokes behind Mark O'Meara. His tie for sixth 
made him the oldest player in Masters history to finish in the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, captain of the U.S. team that was crushed in the  
Presidents Cup, has said he wants to be able to play all four 
majors in 2000, particularly because of their locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open will be at Pebble Beach, where Nicklaus won in  
1972. The British Open will be at St. Andrews, where he won two of 
his three claret jugs. The PGA will be at Valhalla outside 
Louisville, a course Nicklaus designed.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Not Worried About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon officials say all computer systems  
critical to U.S. national defense, including those linked to 
nuclear weapons, will be safe from program bugs before 1999 changes 
to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be 100 percent ready by the end of the year,'' Deputy  
Defense Secretary John Hamre said Thursday. As of Dec. 31, 1998 the 
Pentagon had certified that 81 percent of ``mission critical'' 
computer systems were ready for the arrival of 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had asked all government agencies to reach the  
100 percent ready mark by March 1999. The Defense Department will 
be at the 93 percent mark by then, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department ``went into hyperdrive'' with its Year  
2000, or Y2K, work after realizing last August that it was moving 
too slowly in preparing the approximately 2,300 crucial computer 
systems, Hamre said. In all, the Pentagon has about 10,000 computer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said minor glitches are likely to crop up on Jan. 1, 2000.  
``I think it's going to clearly be in a category of nuisance,'' he 
said. ``I'm very confident we won't have major problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem begins when computers try to add or subtract  
dates using only the last two digits of the year -- 00 in the case 
of 2000 -- which may confuse computers into reading the date as 
1900. Larger, older mainframe computers used by government and big 
corporations for many vital functions are particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill for fixing the Pentagon's computers and testing them  
will reach $2.5 billion, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Special attention is being given computer systems that affect  
the U.S. nuclear arsenal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said that in December the North American Aerospace Defense  
Command, or NORAD, ran a three-day series of about 30 simulated 
missile attacks to ensure that its Y2K-compliant computer systems 
would run properly in providing attack warning and assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every case the systems worked as designed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some individual nuclear systems, including Trident submarines  
carrying nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
already are certified as ready for 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, all other U.S. warfighting commands  
worldwide will run their own tests to evaluate the completeness of 
Pentagon computer fixes that affect them, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy defense secretary said U.S. officials are working  
with the Russian government on its 2000 preparations, but he 
indicated that Moscow has been moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre acknowledged ``some nervousness'' in Washington about  
potential computer problems in Russia. ``They don't seem to have 
the same level of urgency that we have had over it,'' he said, 
while adding that there is little worry about accidental Russian 
nuclear launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a Russian expert on the Y2K problem said Thursday  
that ``the problem with strategic weapons has been solved,'' but 
that questions remain about Russia's air defenses and early warning 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Terekov, director of a firm helping Russian companies  
with the Y2K transition, said it was unlikely Y2K would cause 
warheads to detonate or missiles to be fired by mistake.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Proposes $6B for More Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton, celebrating new data  
that show a record low number of serious violent crimes, today 
proposed a five-year, $6 billion package to raise the ante on his 
nearly fulfilled pledge to put 100,000 new officers on the beat 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe future for  
our children, and I hope we can pass it with your help,'' Clinton 
said during a ceremony at a police station here. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee immediately  
criticized the plan, saying that putting more money into the 
program could mean subtracting money from block grants set aside 
for other crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robbing from one law enforcement program to give to another is  
not what we call addressing the nation's crime problems,'' 
committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because discretionary funding is exceptionally tight this  
year, appropriators expect the president to fund the initiative by 
terminating high-priority block grants, as he has proposed to do in 
past years,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics midyear  
report, due for release today, the total number of violent crimes 
for 1998 -- both incidents reported to police and those unreported -- 
is expected to fall below 3 million for the first time since 1973, 
when the bureau started its annual interviews with crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with the release of the preliminary survey data,  
Clinton ventured across the Potomac to this Washington suburb to 
dramatize the grass-roots support for COPS, the community police 
project he began with the 1994 crime law and a call for 100,000 new 
police on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals have the best technology. Police should, too,''  
Clinton said. ``For too long, we have seen criminals go free 
because the methods to gather evidence is not up to date. ... 
Police carry a heavy burden, but we know they can't carry it 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new budget will ask Congress for $1.3 billion in  
fiscal 2000 -- and a total of $6.4 billion over the next five years 
-- to extend the COPS program, said Jose Cerda, a crime specialist 
on the White House Domestic Policy Council. New hires under the 
program are expected to meet that goal by midyear. As of October, 
the Justice Department reported the total had reached 88,500 and 
was climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The balanced-budget agreement reached by Clinton and  
congressional Republicans in 1996 planned to phase out COPS, 
allotting $300 million for fiscal 2000 and then shutting it down 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's proposed package would earmark $600 million for  
fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1, for the hiring of 30,000 to 
50,000 additional officers, ``with an effort to target new police 
officers to crime hot spots,'' Cerda said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful that Congress will see the wisdom of continuing  
a very successful program that has, and will continue to have, 
strong law enforcement and local-level support,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., an architect of the original crime  
legislation, said the extra resources are necessary if the nation's 
police are to keep violent crime rates down. ``Let's not declare 
victory and decide we don't have to keep the effort up,'' Biden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an advance copy of the Bureau of Justice Statistics  
midyear report, the 2.88 million serious violent crimes in the 1998 
preliminary report compares to 3.04 million that the bureau 
reported in its final data for 1997. The number has been steadily 
dropping since a high of 4.19 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey defines serious violent crimes as rape, robbery,  
aggravated assault and homicide. If simple assault is factored in, 
the 1997 total rises to 8.61 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Property crime rates for 1998 are expected to be less than half  
what the 1973 rate of 520 per 1,000 households, according to the 
preliminary report. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money designated for hiring new police,  
Clinton's proposed $1.3-billion package for fiscal 2000 would 
provide funds for competitive grant programs, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$350 million for local police agencies to tap into new  
communication, crime-solving, and crime-analysis technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million for communities to hire prosecutors and  
``neighborhood DA's'' for locally tailored, preventive and 
crime-solving programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$50 million for communities to acquire the technology for  
community-based prosecution programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million for innovative community programs, such as  
bringing schools and churches together in the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative is one of the few billion-dollar-plus  
increases'' that Clinton is proposing in this year's budget, Cerda 
said. ``The data from ... (the Bureau of Justice Statistics), we 
think, is a good indicator that it is working.''

<HEADLINE> Reds, Morris Agree to One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Free agent Hal Morris returned to the  
Cincinnati Reds as a backup first baseman Thursday by agreeing to a 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who will be 34 on April 9, hit .309 in 127 games last  
season for Kansas City, which declined to offer him salary 
arbitration. Morris made $1 million with the Royals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also agreed to a one-year contract with pitcher Dennys  
Reyes on Thursday. Terms weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris accepted a one-year nonguaranteed contract with the Reds  
that will pay him $400,000, according to a source speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris played for the Reds from 1990-97, hitting better than  
.300 in five of those eight seasons. His best season was in 1996, 
when he hit safely in 29 consecutive games, led the team with 165 
hits and drove in a career-high 80 runs even though he broke his 
elbow in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be a pinch hitter and backup to Sean Casey, who is  
projected as the Reds' first baseman of the future. General manager 
Jim Bowden said Morris understands his role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going ahead with our youth movement and Sean Casey will  
play first base and Dmitri Young will play left field and Hal is 
not going to get the opportunity to compete for a job,'' Bowden 
said. ``Once a player accepts his role, he becomes very valuable, 
like Lenny Harris was for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds let Morris leave as a free agent after the 1997 season  
because they were reducing their payroll. They chose not to pick up 
his 1998 option for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City signed Morris primarily as a designated hitter to  
replace Chili Davis. He started 40 games at first base and 37 in 
the outfield and was the DH in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pinch hit in 10 games and went 2-for-10 with one double  
and two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Morris got 472 at-bats and hit .309 with one homer and  
40 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can still hit. He's a left-handed bat,'' Bowden said.  
``This is a guy who's work ethic is phenomenal. He's a good 
influence on the younger players. As a left-hander, he gives you 
flexibility on a double-switch late in the game.''

<HEADLINE> Livent Founders Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The founders of Livent Inc., the Broadway  
theater company known for such lavish productions as ``Ragtime'' 
and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' were indicted Wednesday on 
charges they inflated corporate earnings and took $4.6 million in 
kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Garth  
Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb in a lawsuit of siphoning off money 
for themselves by inflating invoices paid to vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky, Livent's former chairman and chief executive, and  
Gottlieb, former president, allegedly had a senior vice president, 
Gordon Eckstein, to write off most of the $4.6 million as 
pre-production expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckstein and another executive recently pleaded guilty to  
criminal charges of conspiracy and securities fraud, and await 
sentencing. Eckstein also was named in the SEC lawsuit, as were 
five other former company executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Gottlieb said the indictment charges him with Livent  
matters that were outside his area of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky also said the charges are baseless and that he was  
``first and foremost a theatrical producer'' with little time to 
study the company's finances. Drabinsky said he was targeted by 
Livent's new management. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Livent owns or controls theaters in New York,  
Chicago, Toronto and Vancouver. Its Broadway productions have won 
18 Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Livent sought bankruptcy protection.  
</P>
<P>
	Livent's new management team, headed by former Walt Disney Co.  
President Michael Ovitz, fired Drabinsky and Gottlieb and accused 
them of engaging in widespread fraud that cost Livent and its 
shareholders $60 million.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- St. Joseph's freshman center Damian Reid was  
suspended for one game Thursday by the Atlantic 10 Conference for 
elbowing Mark Ashman of Dayton on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Reid, who is averaging 8.4 points and 7.6 rebounds,  
sat out the Hawks' game Thursday night against Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid elbowed Ashman and bloodied his nose in Dayton's 67-53  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Reid's actions warrant a one-game suspension for  
unsportsmanlike conduct,'' Atlantic 10 commissioner Linda Bruno 
said. ``... I hope that Mr. Reid learns from this and that we do 
not have to revisit this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Joe's coach Phil Martelli supported the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Damian was wrong,'' Martelli said. ``The unfortunate aspect of  
this incident is that it is not a reflection of Damian as a player 
or a person.''

<HEADLINE> Davis, Martins: Buddies and Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When they first met as opponents in the Blue-Gray  
game, Terrell Davis and Curtis Martin never imagined they'd wind up 
as the showcase runners in an AFC championship game. They were just 
concerned about getting drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft part didn't work out too well. Martin, who hurt his  
ankle after two games of his senior season at Pittsburgh, went in 
the third round (74th overall) to New England. Davis, underutilized 
at Georgia and also plagued with a groin injury as a senior, 
slipped to the sixth round (196th overall) before the Broncos 
grabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro part has worked out spectacularly. Both seized starting  
tailback jobs in their rookie training camps. Both have been well 
over 1,000 yards rushing in each of their four pro seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was selected the NFL's Most Valuable Player this year  
after a 2,008-yard, 21-touchdown rushing performance in Denver's 
14-2 season. He also was the Offensive Player of the Year this 
season and in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was the NFL's top rookie in 1995 when he rushed for 1,487  
yards and 14 scores. After his third season, he signed as a 
restricted free agent with the Jets, and the Patriots took draft 
picks as compensation to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're good friends,'' said Martin, who gained 124 yards on 36  
carries and scored twice in last weekend's playoff victory against 
Jacksonville. ``We sort of have a silent competition going. It's 
more than competing, but pushing one another to become the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met coming out of college at the Blue-Gray game in Alabama.  
We were in the same situation as seniors, not playing much. Then we 
both got drafted later than we thought. So I guess we were 
underdogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasis on were. Now, they are among the league's most  
successful backs as runners and receivers, particularly on screen 
and flare passes. When they meet in Mile High Stadium on Sunday, 
Davis and Martin could be the deciding factors for prolific 
offenses: Denver scored 501 points and the Jets had 416. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could be,'' Davis said. ``Right now, we're competing against  
each other on a friendly level. I root for Curtis each game, but 
not this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin figures he's got a few laurels that Davis hasn't  
attained, but that his Broncos buddy is ahead in the most 
significant category. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pushed each other, especially the first year when we  
were running for rookie of the year, and I ended up beating him 
out,'' Martin said. ``The second year, I went to the Super Bowl 
(but lost). 
</P>
<P>
	``So this year, the thing he said to Marcus Allen was, `I got  
him last year; we won the Super Bowl.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	For Martin to get even in that area, he'll have to help carry  
the Jets past Davis, the '98 Super Bowl MVP, in a building where 
the Broncos have won 18 straight. Martin expects to be busy again, 
but might need something closer to Davis' production of 199 yards 
against Miami last Saturday to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep TD and their offense off the field,''  
Martin said. ``We can't allow a team with an offense like that on 
the field too long, or they can bury you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis will settle for simply getting past the red-hot Jets,  
who've won seven in a row, and back into the big game. He won't be 
speaking with Martin before the AFC title matchup, although they 
might say hello before kickoff. Davis has other things on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you're on the field, you tend to forget what game you're  
playing in,'' Davis said. ``I'm responsible for Terrell. I have to 
believe I am the key to whatever happens. I hold myself accountable 
for whatever things have to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, that might mean outrushing his pal.

<HEADLINE> Reeves, Green Happy Where They Are </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Two years ago, Dan Reeves was out of work,  
fired by the New York Giants after 5-11 and 6-10 seasons and 
numerous squabbles with the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Dennis Green was in upset with instability in the  
Minnesota front office, in hot water for writing a controversial 
book about the team and for sexual harassment charges filed against 
him and ready to jump to Oakland or whatever team would have him. 
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves' Atlanta Falcons meet Green's Vikings in Sunday's  
NFC championship game, they'll be as content as they can be. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, back from heart bypass surgery a month ago, has the  
control over personnel he always sought and is coming off a 14-2 
regular season, best in his team's 33-season history. 
</P>
<P>
	Green has a contract extension through 2001 from Red McCombs,  
the new owner, and his personal life seems serene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the reasons we've done what we've done is that  
Denny finally knows his status,'' running back Robert Smith said. 
``And because he's secure, we're secure. You can't imagine what it 
was like not knowing from day to day whether we'd have our coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Vikings were 9-7 and made it to the second round  
of the playoffs with just about the same team. The only significant 
addition was wide receiver Randy Moss, the offensive rookie of the 
year who is the main reason the team scored an NFL record 556 
points, scoring more than 30 points in 12 of 16 regular season 
games, getting more than 40 three times and hitting 50 once. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who started 1-7 last season in Atlanta, is 21-4 since,  
including a playoff win over San Francisco last week that put the 
Falcons in a conference championship game for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He's done it with a quarterback (Chris Chandler), who had never  
been to the playoffs in 11 seasons with six teams, and pickups like 
veteran safety Eugene Robinson and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, 
who had a good year after seemingly being at the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of all, the key has been a one-time seventh-round draft  
pick named Jamal Anderson, who in his fifth NFL season set a record 
with 410 carries and gained 1,846 yards, the ninth best ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Green has made a point of noting that when Marty Schottenheimer  
resigned in Kansas City that Green's now the senior NFL coach in 
point of service with one team -- by two days over Pittsburgh's Bill 
Cowher. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reeves is the senior coach overall -- 17 uninterrupted  
seasons with the Broncos, Giants and now the Falcons. And this 
despite heart problems that began nearly a decade ago in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves says he's still a bit tired.  
</P>
<P>
	But he also says he'd be in bad shape if he hadn't gotten back  
to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this much -- it would be worse if I wasn't doing this,''  
he says. ``My doctors agree.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Insists He Took No Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Dutch IOC member linked to the  
Olympic bribery scandal insists he did nothing wrong and can 
account for a $5,000 payment made by Salt Lake City Games officials 
to a foundation bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with me,'' Anton Geesink told The  
Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002  
Winter Olympics have said they paid Geesink $5,000 to buy a vehicle 
for an Olympic foundation run by the Dutch official. 
</P>
<P>
	Geesink said the money wasn't paid to him but to an independent  
foundation that funds projects aimed at promoting Olympic ideals 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a board member -- they only carry my name,'' Geesink  
said of the Friends of Anton Geesink Foundation. He said in a 
telephone interview he had no way of personally taking money out of 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Geesink later acknowledged in a statement that he had received a  
letter from IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch relating to the 
committee's corruption investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I am unable to go into more detail,'' Geesink's  
statement said, adding that he would make no further comment until 
after a Jan. 24 meeting at which the IOC executive board will be 
handed recommendations made by its six-person investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber also refused to disclose  
the letter's contents. ``This is a confidential legal process 
within the sense of the IOC rules,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before issuing the press statement, Geesink defiantly  
insisted he has nothing to fear from the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Fight Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- First it's on. Then it's off. Now it's delayed,  
or maybe it's off again. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing certain about the ``Battle of the Aged'' between  
former heavyweight champions George Foreman and Larry Holmes is 
that none of the principals seem sure of when -- or if -- the fight 
will ever come off. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrodome USA president Mike Puryear said Thursday that the  
on-again, off-again event has been postponed from Jan. 23 to March 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen on the 23rd, but we are near  
completion in having everything done to make it go on the 27th,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puryear spoke with fight promoter Roger Levitt on Thursday and  
said Levitt ``is very optimistic that an arrangement can be worked 
out for both fighters to appear on March 27.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt confirmed the report in an interview with Houston  
television station KRIV, saying, ``I'm delighted all parties are 
coming together to make this fight happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not return a telephone message from The Associated Press  
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes didn't sound so sure about the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say, `Yeah, it's going to come off,''' he  
said. ``If I see some things happening for the better by next 
Tuesday, then I will say `Yeah.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's lawyer, Henry Holmes, meanwhile said that he has no  
knowledge of a new date. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has ever mentioned to us postponing the fight or the  
date March 27,'' Henry Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight at the Houston Astrodome has been in jeopardy since  
Levitt missed two deadlines for payment of the remaining $9 million 
of Foreman's $10 million purse. Holmes has received $400,000 of his 
$4 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes spokesman Jay Newman said Levitt was trying to complete  
negotiations with Foreman over the next few days so that the fight 
can go on, albeit belatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it looks good,'' Newman said. ``Right now we're  
looking forward to fighting George March 27 in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has been dubbed the ``Battle of the Aged'' because  
Foreman turned 50 on Sunday and Holmes was 49 on Nov. 3. The bout 
is scheduled to be shown on pay-per-view TV.

<HEADLINE> Overhaul of Veterans' Benefits Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressionally appointed commission  
recommended today the first major overhaul in veterans benefits 
since World War II, including improvements in two of the most 
popular of all government programs: the GI Bill's educational 
program and home loan guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	The GI Bill proposal is the most dramatic of the 100  
recommendations by the 12-member bipartisan panel. If adopted by 
Congress, the government would pay for full college costs for 
veterans who served at least four years on active duty, regardless 
of the cost of the college or university, plus throw in a 
$400-a-month stipend. 
</P>
<P>
	The educational proposal ``will open the door of the military to  
a much broader cross-section of America's youth,'' chairman Anthony 
J. Principi said in announcing the recommendations. High school 
graduates may begin to look at the military as a route to a full 
college scholarship, rather than as a detour on the way to an 
education, Principi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Miller, national commander of the American Legion, the  
nation's largest veterans group, applauded the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make some fundamental improvements in the benefits  
available to our service members and our veterans,'' he said. ``The 
Principi commission's report can get the nation back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan panel also recommended combining some military  
and veterans' health-care benefit programs and allowing those in 
the military to invest in tax-deferred retirement accounts, similar 
to 401(k) accounts available in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Principi said the panel's recommendations would help reverse a  
long slide in morale in the military and to help personnel 
retention. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding that the legislative package cuts across the  
jurisdiction of many congressional committees and federal agencies, 
Principi said: ``I think it will fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and  
Veterans Transition Assistance was created by Congress in 1997 to 
study the transition of military veterans to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is broken, and the commission took a no holds  
barred approach to fixing it,'' Principi, a San Diego lawyer who 
was deputy director of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the 
Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Youthful veterans of World War II and Korea used the education  
and housing provisions of the GI Bill to put themselves through 
college and buy homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But, although the programs remain on the books, in recent years  
they have become less generous and effective in the face of sharply 
rising tuition and real estate costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed overhaul, veterans who are first-time home  
buyers could purchase homes with no out-of-pocket expenses. That 
was the original intent of the so-called VA loans, but veterans who 
currently use it must come up with a 2 percentage points fee to 
cover the transaction. This fee would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission officials said the overall cost of the package is  
hard to determine, because some areas that would cost money -- such 
as the education provisions -- would be offset by savings in other 
areas. They said the education program would cost about $500 
million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the GI bill provides $528 a month for education costs  
for up to 36-months. Furthermore, those in the military have to 
contribute $1,200 from their paychecks -- $100 a month for their 
first year of active duty -- to help finance the program. 
</P>
<P>
	This $1,200 requirement would be eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
	Veterans would get what amounted to a full scholarship to any  
college or university in the nation that accepted them, regardless 
of whether it was a low-cost state school or junior college or one 
of the nation's costliest institutions. This expanded benefit would 
include the full cost of tuition, books and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also would have the authority to make the GI Bill  
benefit transferable to a serviceman or -woman's family members as 
a re-enlistment incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members will present their recommendations before House  
and Senate military and veterans' affairs committees within the 
next 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also recommended extending low-cost health insurance  
to families for 18 months after separation from military service.

<HEADLINE> Video Leads To Charges Vs. Nurse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERGENFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- A couple who installed a video camera  
so they could watch their disabled 3-year-old daughter from their 
bedroom captured a nurse smacking, pinching and manhandling the 
child, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's parents watched the tape, then called police, who on  
Tuesday arrested Neonita Sabate, a 42-year-old registered nurse, on 
charges of assault and child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm traumatized,'' the girl's mother, whose name was not  
released, said in Thursday's Record of Hackensack. ``I don't trust 
anyone anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child has a rare chromosome disorder, and her breathing and  
heartbeat have to be monitored around the clock. The parents bought 
the video system so they could watch her on a monitor in their 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera was mounted in a corner and was not hidden, police  
said, but the nurse apparently did not realize it was there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't buy it to watch the nurses,'' the girl's mother said.  
``I trusted all of my nurses, especially this one, who had been 
with me more than a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tape also showed the nurse pulling the girl's hair and  
placing her hand and a washcloth over the child's mouth to stop her 
from crying. At one point, the girl's mother said, the tape shows 
the nurse picking the girl up and dropping her in the crib ``like a 
sack of potatoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabate has no listed home telephone number.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from House managers' presentation to the Senate in the  
impeachment trial of President Clinton, as transcribed by the 
Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton  
decided to put himself above the law -- not once, not twice, but 
repeatedly. He put himself above the law when he engaged in a 
multifaceted scheme to obstruct justice during the federal civil 
rights case of Paula Corbin Jones v. William Jefferson Clinton, et 
al. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put himself above the law when he made perjurious, false  
and misleading statements under oath during his grand jury 
testimony on Aug. 17, 1998. In both instances, he unlawfully 
attempted to prevent the judicial branch of government -- a co-equal 
branch from performing its constitutional duty to administer equal 
justice under law.'' -- Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the Senate conduct a fair and impartial trial which  
allows each side to present its best case, then the American public 
can be confident that justice has been served regardless of the 
outcome.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear much about how important the rule of law is to our  
nation and our system of government. Some have commented this 
expression is trite. But whether expressed by these three words or 
others, the primacy of law over the rule of individuals is what 
distinguishes the United States from most other countries and why 
our Constitution is as alive today as it was 210 years ago.'' -- 
Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The framers of the Constitution devised an elaborate system of  
checks and balances to ensure our liberties by making sure that no 
person, institution or branch of government became so powerful that 
a tyranny could ever be established in the United States of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the trustees of that sacred legacy, and whether the  
rule of law and faith in our nation emerges stronger than ever or 
are diminished irreparably depends upon the collective decision of 
the message each senator chooses to send forth in the days ahead.'' 
-- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton has recognized that this relationship was wrong. I  
give him credit for that. But he has not owned up to the false 
testimony, the stonewalling, and legal hairsplitting and 
obstructing the courts from finding the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``In doing so, he has turned his affair into a public wrong, and  
for these actions he must be held accountable through the only 
constitutional means the country has available: the difficult and 
painful process of impeachment.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The process is long. It is difficult. It is unpleasant. But  
above all, it is necessary to maintain the public's trust in the 
conduct of their elected officials -- elected officials such as 
myself and yourselves, who through our oaths of office have a duty 
to follow the law, fulfill our constitutional responsibilities and 
protect our republic from public wrongdoing.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers submit witnesses are essential to give  
heightened credence to whatever judgment the Senate chooses to make 
on each of the articles of impeachment against President Clinton. 
The matter of how this proceeding will be conducted remains 
somewhat unsettled. Senate impeachment precedent has been to hold a 
trial, and in every impeachment case, the Senate has heard from 
live witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the president's counsel dispute the facts as laid out  
by the House of Representatives, the Senate will need to hear from 
live witnesses in order to reach a proper and fair judgment as to 
the truthful facts of this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House concluded the president made perjurious, false and  
misleading statements before the grand jury, which the House 
believes constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor. Our entire legal 
system is based upon the court's being able to find the truth. 
That's why witnesses must raise their right hand and swear to tell 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.'' -- 
Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery. By making the penalty  
for perjury the same as that for bribery, Congress has acknowledged 
that both crimes are equally serious.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate is convinced that President Clinton lied under  
oath and does not remove him from office, the wrong message is 
given to our courts, those who have business before them and to the 
country as a whole.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Your decision in this proceeding will answer these questions  
and set the standard of conduct of public officials in town halls 
and courtrooms everywhere and the Oval Office for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice is never served by the placing of any public official  
above the law.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, we are here today because William Jefferson  
Clinton decided to use all means possible, both legal and illegal, 
to subvert the truth about his conduct relevant to the federal 
civil rights suit brought against him by Mrs. Paula Jones.'' -- 
Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone lies about an affair and tries to hide the facts,  
they violate the trust their spouse and their family put in them. 
But when they lie about it during legal proceedings and obstruct 
the parties from obtaining evidence, they prevent the courts from 
administering justice.'' -- Sensenbrenner.

<HEADLINE> 30-Yr. Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rate Up / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.83 percent this week, up from 6.79 
percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st consecutive week that the average remained below  
7 percent. It reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early 
October. Its peak for 1998 was 7.22 percent in late April. 
Economists expect it to remain low this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.48 percent this week, up from 6.43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.61 percent, the same as the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

<HEADLINE> Tyson-Botha Lacks Wallop With Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The last time Mike Tyson fought at the MGM  
Grand Hotel, a melee erupted in the ring after he bit Evander 
Holyfield and panicked gamblers forced the casino shut for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop the MGM from shelling out millions of dollars  
to sign Tyson again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, crowd control may not be the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales for Tyson's return to the ring have been mixed, and  
hotel officials concede the arena won't be filled Saturday night 
when he meets Francois Botha in a scheduled 10-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's hurry to get back into the ring as quickly as he could  
after getting his boxing license in October is one factor in the 
lukewarm reception the fight has gotten. Two straight losses to 
Holyfield also may have turned off some who may not see Tyson as 
the fighter he once was. 
</P>
<P>
	A bad date -- competing with two NFL playoff games -- didn't help,  
and the weekend also falls during a slow tourism period in this 
gambling city. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the final prefight news conference was seemingly jinxed,  
overshadowed by Michael Jordan's retirement announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, hotel officials are counting on the high rollers to be on  
hand, and the MGM contract includes three additional fights that 
could turn into much bigger events if Tyson can keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to have Mike Tyson back,'' said Alex  
Yemenidjian, president and chief operating officer of MGM Grand 
Inc. ``He adds more value to the sport than any of the other 
fighters put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel officials hope for a crowd of some 10,000, paying from  
$200 to $1,500 a seat at the MGM Grand's arena, which was scaled 
back a few thousand seats to 14,000 seats for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The big money will be generated by pay-per-view, though, with  
Showtime executive producer Jay Larkin predicting the fight could 
be bought by up to 1 million homes at a price of about $45 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty confident it will do well,'' Larkin said.  
``People are intrigued by Mike's personal story and they will watch 
him fight in the same way they watch car races, to see the 
wrecks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose purses in his six-fight comeback after being in  
prison totaled more than $100 million, will earn millions to fight 
Botha, although the exact amount is a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's managers had suggested he would make some $20 million,  
and Tyson himself said earlier this week that he would be making 
$35 million. But contracts to be filed with Nevada boxing officials 
are expected to show a base purse of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw big gamblers to his fights makes him a  
valued commodity, despite any misgivings the hotels may have about 
some of his antics. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM hasn't staged a bout since the Tyson-Holyfield debacle  
on June 28, 1997, but was quick to sign Tyson to a four-fight deal 
once the Nevada Athletic Commission reinstated his boxing license. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about redemption and about us getting back in a big  
way in the boxing business,'' hotel president Bill Hornbuckle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemenidjian said the fight is important for the hotel's image as  
a place of big events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really places the MGM Grand yet again as the venue where  
the best sporting events take place,'' Yemenidjian said. ``We look 
at the high rollers and the wide exposure we get. As you can 
imagine, interest is at an international level in Mike Tyson.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Imposes Surcharge on Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines' decision to add a $2 fee for all  
tickets except those purchased at its Internet site may be sign of 
things to come for consumers, who increasingly are being asked to 
pay more for a human touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a lot of consumers who are technology-savvy, it's not a big  
deal. But there are consumers -- senior citizens in particular -- who 
don't feel comfortable or have access who are being penalized,'' 
said Audrey Guskey, an analyst who has studied consumer trends for 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockbrokers and banks are part of a growing number of  
businesses that expect customers to pay more for help from ``a 
living, breathing company representative,'' Ms. Guskey, a professor 
at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Atlanta-based carrier added $2 to  
domestic round-trip bookings -- except for those made at its Web 
site -- to offset rising costs for traditional booking methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta didn't make a public announcement, but informed travel  
agents in a message posted Monday over the computer reservations 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The move drew criticism from the American Society of Travel  
Agents, which represents 26,500 members in more than 170 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta is saying, in effect, we tried to get you to book on the  
Internet and now we are going to make it hurt to book any other 
way. Instead of offering an inducement, they are slapping on a 
penalty,'' said Joe Galloway, president and CEO of the world's 
largest travel trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guskey said the motivation for a move like Delta's was  
simply to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier and cheaper for companies, the less human  
resources they need. There's also less chance of error,'' she said. 
``Those human factors, in a sense, get in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Slade, 28, is among a growing number of people who've  
noticed the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're saving banks enough time and money by using ATMs  
that we should be able to once in a while go into the bank without 
have to pay $5 a month to talk with a human being,'' he said from 
outside a downtown Delta ticket office. 
</P>
<P>
	Slade, who works for a telecommunications company, added that he  
enjoys the ease, convenience and special deals associated with 
Internet shopping, particularly since customer service has ``gotten 
so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Call for Action, a nonprofit consumer helpline, is hearing more  
of those complaints, said the group's president, Shirley Rooker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of frustration we're hearing from consumers has  
increased in the last two or three years,'' Ms. Rooker said. 
``Either people can't get service, or there's a fee attached, or 
they're unable to get through to a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they're pressed for time, she said, consumers must  
tell companies when they are not living up to expectation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't like it, we have to stand up and protest by taking  
our dollars to companies that give you what you want,'' Ms. Rooker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guskey expects the trend to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to eventually reach the point where people  
will be charged for the privilege of dealing with a sales associate 
at a department store,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Exchange Drops on Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- A broker's typing error on a bank stock caused  
Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index to plunge 5.5 percent at 
Friday's opening before the trading house discovered its mistake 
and reported it to the Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Stock Exchange of Singapore would not  
reveal which broker or company made the error while typing in a 
transaction on a locally issued share in Oversea-Chinese Banking 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name, said  
the broker typed in a share price of 30 Singapore cents (18 cents) 
instead of 7.95 Singapore dollars (about $4.73). 
</P>
<P>
	When the computer, detecting a possible problem, asked, ``Would  
you like to continue?'' the broker typed, ``Yes,'' said the 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was forced through. That's how a mistake can occur,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a drastic change in the share price of one of Singapore's  
top banks forced the main index to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage house discovered its own error and reported it to  
the Stock Exchange, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying and selling parties then agreed to withdraw the sale  
and the index corrected itself, showing a 0.6 percent rise by the 
midday closing.

<HEADLINE> Astros Trade Ausmus Back to Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros traded catcher Brad Ausmus and  
reliever C.J. Nitkowski back to the Detroit Tigers for five players 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were dealt to Houston in December 1996 as part of a  
10-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest deal, the Astros get pitchers Dean Crow, Mark  
Persails and Brian Powell, catcher Paul Bako and infielder Carlos 
Villalobos. Persails and Villalobos were minor leaguers last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps us to replace players we've lost in our system due  
to other trades we have made, especially the Moises Alou and Randy 
Johnson deals which were each three-for-one,'' said Houston general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker. 
</P>
<P>
	By dealing Ausmus, the Astros also could be making room for  
catching prospect Mitch Meluskey, who hit .353 with 41 doubles, 17 
home runs and 71 RBIs at Triple-A last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meluskey and backup Tony Eusebio are expected to compete for the  
starting job when spring training begins next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I see it, we've got two able bodies coming to camp,''  
Hunsicker said. ``The most probable scenario would be we start the 
season with both catchers splitting time and see where we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus, who hit .269 with 45 RBIs last season, played 75 games  
for Detroit in 1996 before being traded to the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitkowski was 3-3 with a 3.77 ERA and three saves in 43  
appearances with the Astros last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bako became Detroit's No. 1 catcher after an April 29 recall  
from the minors. He started 83 games and hit .272. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow pitched 45 2-3 innings over 29 games last year while  
splitting time between Triple-A and the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell started last season at Double-A and was summoned by the  
Tigers after three months. He finished the season 3-8 with a 6.35 
ERA.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Taking Care of Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As always, President Clinton's own line of  
impeachment defense was that he is doing the job he was elected to 
do, and that the Senate trial won't distract him from it. But House 
prosecutors argue he can't perform effectively, questioning whether 
anybody can believe anything he says. 
</P>
<P>
	That argument is political, not one of constitutional standards,  
precedents or legalities. And polls show Americans are on Clinton's 
side, as they have been for a scandal-worn year. His job approval 
ratings are still 60 percent and up, even as opening arguments 
begin in his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim of the Republican prosecutors is to counter the claim  
that their perjury and obstruction of justice case is about the 
private, personal misbehavior of the president, not conduct 
affecting his office. 
</P>
<P>
	That was repeated in the trial brief the White House filed on  
Wednesday, denying the charges Clinton's lawyers said would in any 
event not warrant impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate removes this president for a wrongful  
relationship he hoped to keep private, for what will the House ask 
the Senate to remove the next president and the next?'' the defense 
preview said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Clinton's ``private misconduct'' is not grounds to  
oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors contend that presidential lies are not a private  
matter. ``Because all eyes are focused upon that high office, the 
character and credibility of any temporary occupant of the Oval 
Office is vital to the domestic and foreign welfare of the 
citizens,'' their brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued that Clinton's credibility directly affects the  
nation's credibility. ``Indeed, how can anyone in or out of our 
country any longer believe anything he says?'' their brief asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the president is inextricably bound to the  
welfare of the people of the United States,'' the prosecutors said. 
``Not only does it affect economic and national defense, but even 
more directly, it affects the moral and law-abiding fiber of the 
commonwealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while all of this has been happening, before and after  
Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the 
economy has been strong, a major factor in his approval ratings. 
The administration boasts of a record budget surplus, a declining 
crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no suggestion of corruption or misuse of office,''  
Clinton's defense team told the Senate, ``or any other conduct that 
places our system of government at risk in the two remaining years 
of the president's term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton goes on Senate trial saying he will stay otherwise  
occupied. ``I need to work on the business of the people,'' he said 
Wednesday. ``The important thing for me is to spend as little time 
thinking about that as possible and as much time working on the 
issues ... as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is that I should be doing my job for the country,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been issuing almost daily proposals for action in  
Congress this year -- $2 billion for programs for the disabled, $1 
billion for land conservation in the last two days. It is an 
item-by-item preview of his State of the Union address, planned 
next Tuesday night despite misgivings in Congress at having him 
deliver that showpiece speech after a day's trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In that setting, the Republicans who control Congress are wary  
of being seen as too preoccupied with impeachment to deal with 
other business. So Senate Republicans spent two days in closed 
conferences on their 1999 agenda, more activity than usual at this 
point in a new Congress, since major legislation hasn't even been 
introduced, and when it is, committees will have to shape it for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly want to reassure the American people that we will  
continue to conduct the nation's business,'' said Sen. Olympia 
Snowe of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack of Florida borrowed a Clinton term in saying  
that the Senate can deal with impeachment and legislation at the 
same time -- ``compartmentalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I would suggest that the person down in the White House is  
not the only person who has the ability to do that,'' he said. ``We 
will carry out the people's work.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  IOC Displays Some Samaranch Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The ``Samaranch Collection,''  
containing everything from stamps to shotguns, was unveiled by the 
IOC Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled by the biggest corruption scandal in its history, the  
International Olympic Committee opened its storerooms for a glimpse 
of some of the gifts received by president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Among items on view in a basement of the lakeside Olympic  
Museum, in a section labeled ``Juan Antonio Samaranch collection,'' 
were a framed set of Dutch stamps, a commemorative plaque from the 
Atlanta Olympics, statuettes, portraits, a Japanese doll, a tray 
from Barcelona and a Greek icon. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 30 paintings given to IOC presidents past and present were  
also in the storage room. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the space is taken up by items bought by or given to the  
museum itself -- ``tens of thousands'' of pieces ranging from 
sportswear to Olympic torches, according to curator Jean-Francois 
Pahud. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small, cluttered room at the nearby IOC headquarters,  
reporters were shown a Browning Arms 9 millimeter single-action 
handgun and shotgun -- gifts from the bidders and organizers of the 
Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, at the center of the scandal over 
alleged bribes for IOC votes in the selection of the 2002 host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns were apparently unused, displayed in their cases with  
instruction manuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch denies he violated the IOC's rule prohibiting  
committee members from accepting gifts with a value of more than 
$150. He says he is not covered by the rule because he doesn't vote 
in the election of host cities.

	``In every case heard in every courtroom across this great  
country, it is the truth, it is justice, it is the law that are at 
stake. In this journey on earth, there is nothing of greater 
consequence for us to devote our energies than to search for the 
truth, to pursue equal justice and to uphold the law.'' -- Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The obstruction of justice is of great consequence and  
significance to the integrity of our nation when committed by 
anyone, but particularly by the chief executive of our land, the 
president of the United States.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House knew that Monica was on the witness list. The  
president knew that it was likely that she would be subpoenaed as a 
witness and that her truthful testimony would hurt his case. What 
did the president do? What he had to do was he made sure that 
Monica Lewinsky was on his team and under control.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The question here is not why did the president do a favor for  
an ex-intern? But why did he use the influence of his office to 
make sure it happened? 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer is, that he was willing to obstruct, impede justice  
by improperly influencing a witness in order to protect himself in 
a civil rights case.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Clinton) did not say specifically: `Go in and lie.' And  
this is something that you will hear, and Monica Lewinsky testified 
in her grand jury testimony, `The president never told me to lie.' 
Well, how do you tell people to lie? You can tell them the facts 
that they can use that would in substance be a false statement. Or 
you can say go in and lie and make up your own false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president chose to give her the ideas as to what she could  
testify to that would be false, but he never said the words: `You 
need to go in and lie.' And so, what he did say to her was, quote, 
`You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty, or that 
you were bringing me letters.''' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I have faith in the Constitution of the United States, but the  
checks and balances of the Constitution are carried out by 
individuals, individuals who are entrusted under oath with 
upholding the trust given to us by the people of this great land. 
If I believe in the Constitution, that it will work, then I must 
believe in you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I trust the Constitution  
of the United States, but today it is most important that I believe 
in you. I have faith in the United States Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have earned the trust of the American people, and I trust  
each of you to make the right decision for our country.'' -- 
Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In a judicial proceeding, a witness has a very solemn  
obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth. Perjury is a serious crime because our judicial system can 
only succeed if citizens are required to tell the truth in court 
proceedings. If witnesses may lie with impunity for personal or 
political reasons, justice is no longer the product of the court 
system, and we descend into chaos.'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to understanding the facts of this case is to  
understand why the president was asked under oath questions about 
his private life in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the popular spin, it wasn't because members of  
Congress or lawyers from the Office of Independent Counsel or a 
gaggle of reporters suddenly decided to invade the president's 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. This all came about because of a claim against the  
president from when he was the governor of Arkansas.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president made that solemn pledge, he was not  
obliging himself to tell the grand jury the partial truth. He was 
not obliging himself to tell the `I didn't want to be particularly 
helpful' truth. He was not obliging himself to tell the `this is 
embarrassing so I think I'll fudge on it a little bit' truth. He 
was required to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth, and he made that pledge in the name of God.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president was asked: `You have a privilege against  
self-incrimination. If a truthful answer to any question would tend 
to incriminate you, you can invoke the privilege, and that 
invocation will not be used against you. Do you understand?' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's response was: `I do.'  
</P>
<P>
	``The president knew he had the right to refuse to answer any  
incriminating questions and that no legal harm would come to him 
for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he rejected that option, just as he rejected the option of  
telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead, he selected a third path. He continued to lie about  
corrupt efforts to destroy Paula Jones' sexual harassment case 
against him.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Paula Jones had a legal and constitutional right to learn if  
the president, while as president or governor, used his position of 
power and influence to get sexual favors from subordinate female 
employees in the workplace, or to reward subordinate female 
employees for granting such favors to him.'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's perjurious legal hairsplitting, used to bypass  
the requirement of telling the complete truth, denied Paula Jones 
her constitutional right to have her day in court and an orderly 
disposition of her claim in the sexual harassment case against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``To dismiss this conduct with a shrug because it is just about  
sex is to say that the sexual harassment laws protecting women in 
the workplace do not apply to powerful employers or others in high 
places of privilege.'' -- Rogan.

	``By voting these articles of impeachment, the House is not

Everyone falls short of this mark every day. But political life is 
not so much about how an individual fails but rather how that 
person reacts to that failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, a person campaigning for a political office  
admits wrongdoing in the past and says he will not do that again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people accept that commitment.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is elected. Thereafter, he repeats this wrongdoing and he  
confronted again. What does he do? He takes steps to cover up this 
wrongdoing by using his workers and his friends. He lies under oath 
in a lawsuit which is very important to the person he is alleged to 
have harmed.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Let it be said that we are electing people who are imperfect  
and who have made mistakes in life, but who are willing to so 
respect this country and the office of the president that he or she 
will now lay aside their own personal shortcomings and have the 
inner strength to discipline themselves sufficiently that they do 
not break the law which they themselves are sworn to uphold.'' -- 
Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Shame or embarrassment cannot justify concealment of truth.  
Linguistic contortions with the words used cannot legitimately 
conceal a lie, or if under oath, perjury.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Truth-telling is the single most important judicial precept  
underpinning this great system of justice we have -- a system which 
permits the courthouse doors to be opened to all people from the 
most powerful man in America to a young woman from Arkansas.'' -- 
Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Events and words that may seem innocent or even exculpatory in  
a vacuum may well take on a sinister or even criminal connotation 
when observed in the context of the whole plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, when we all agree that Ms. Lewinsky testified,  
'No one ever told me to lie.' When considered alone, this statement 
would seem exculpatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of other evidence, however, we see that this  
one statement gives a misleading inference. Of course no one said, 
'Now Monica, you go down there and lie.' 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to. Based upon their previous spoken and even  
unspoken words, Ms. Lewinsky knew what was expected of her.'' -- 
Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Subordinates and friends alike are drawn into this web of  
deceit. The president is insulated. Crimes are committed. Justice 
is denied. The rule of law is suspended. And this president is the 
beneficiary.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is anticipated that the attorneys for the president will  
present arguments which will contest much of the relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. The president has maintained throughout the last 
several months that while there was no sexual relationship or 
sexual affair, in fact there was some type of inappropriate 
intimate contact with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has now been dubbed as legal gymnastics on the part of  
the president has made its appearance. Other examples followed.'' -- 
Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the very same president who is renowned for his  
intelligence and his ability to compartmentalize, to concentrate, 
to focus on whatever matter is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now, he comes before this Senate to each one of you in his  
answer, by and through his attorneys and pleads that he simply 
wasn't paying attention at this very important part, during his own 
deposition.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A reasonable and impartial review of this record, as it  
presently exists, demands nothing less than a guilty verdict. And 
while it's been the consistent defense of the White House to be 
inconsistent, it still comes as something of a surprise that the 
president has not made a stronger case for calling witnesses.'' -- 
Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground  
that the evidence covered only personal or private behavior would 
frustrate the goals that Congress and the courts have sought to 
achieve in enacting and interpreting the nation's sexual harassment 
laws.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidency is more than an executive responsibility. It is  
the inspiring symbol of all that is highest in America in purpose 
and ideals. As the head of the executive branch, the president has 
the constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully 
enforced and executed.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizen, whether  
in a criminal case, a grand jury investigation, a congressional 
hearing, a civil trial, a civil discovery proceeding, are 
profoundly serious matters. When such acts are committed by the 
president of the United States, those acts are grounds for 
conviction and removal from office.'' -- Bryant

<HEADLINE> Prostitution Ring List Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON WOODS, Mich. (AP) -- Over the objections of  
prosecutors who feared widespread invasions of privacy, police have 
released 7,000 names found in the computerized black book of a 
woman who ran a million-dollar-a-year prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Marci Devernay -- the ``Huntington Woods Madam'' -- pleaded guilty  
last month to racketeering charges for operating a prostitution 
business that served clients throughout Detroit's affluent suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be sentenced Jan. 19.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the names are accompanied by addresses and phone  
numbers, and notations such as ``Big Tipper'' and ``BAD LIST!!!'' 
Most of the addresses are in Michigan but are from as far away as 
Europe and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Two newspapers argued in court papers that they were entitled to  
the list because public officials might be included. The Detroit 
News said it would not publish any names for now; the Detroit Free 
Press said it was deciding how to handle it. Neither published any 
names in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huntington Woods Police Department issued the list on CD-ROM  
with a warning that the names weren't verified. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know that names on the list are in fact clients or  
customers,'' the department said. ``We cannot attest to the 
authenticity of the names nor do we know with any degree of 
certainty their relationship with Ms. Devernay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca had refused to divulge  
the names, saying he needed to ``protect the unknowing, unwitting 
spouses and children from public ridicule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these individuals may not be clients of Devernay's,  
and they may not have participated,'' he said. ``And how do they 
regain their reputation once their names have been published?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution rings often include prominent names on client lists  
in hopes that that will keep the information private, Gorcyca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ms. Devernay, 33, employed at least 25 male and  
female prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since authorities seized her records, officers have fielded  
calls from men offering excuses for why their names might be on the 
lists -- and from suspicious wives. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there were another 7,000 names on Ms. Devernay's  
Rolodex and about 6,000 more in paper files that would be released 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Silverman, publisher and editor of The Detroit News, said  
his paper was not planning at this point to publish the names. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is a convicted felon accusing 20,000 people  
of a crime,'' Silverman said. ``To name them would violate the 
fundamentals of basic journalism ethics that should govern all 
media outlets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free Press managing editor Carole Leigh Hutton said that whether  
her newspaper would publish any names would ``depend on what we 
find from a reporting standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no interest in harming anyone or printing information  
that is not true, causing unnecessary grief in personal lives,'' 
she said. ``Nonetheless, we need to report what is happening out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Huntington Woods, a quiet community about 15 miles north of  
Detroit, some residents downplayed the significance of the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think of all the things that could happen in a  
community, it's certainly not the worst,'' said John Abela, 36. 
``It's not government corruption. If it had been a drug house, the 
community might have been more up in arms.''

<HEADLINE> Researchers Develop Viagra Spray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Two University of Kentucky researchers  
have developed a faster- acting form of Viagra, but they've struck 
out trying to sell the drug's maker on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra, the anti-impotence pill made by pharmaceutical giant  
Pfizer Inc., usually takes an hour to take effect. The researchers 
say they can reduce that time to five to 15 minutes with their 
nasal spray delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they've got a product on the market, they want to leave  
sleeping dogs lie, they don't want to mess around with it,'' said 
University of Kentucky researcher Lewis Dittert who developed the 
nasal spray system with colleague Anwar Hussein. ``It takes a lot 
of effort to move these big companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer spokeswoman Marianne Caprino said her company is ``always  
interested in advancing our medicines... in a way that makes the 
medicine more patient-friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, she added, ``I wouldn't want to speculate about any  
relationship developing with these researchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Viagra pill, whose spectacular debut last year sparked a  
frenzy among impotence sufferers and inspired a thousand late-night 
television jokes, contains an active ingredient, sildenafil, that 
is not very water-soluble. 
</P>
<P>
	That means it can take the pill more than an hour to be digested  
and reach the small intestines, where the sildenafil can reach the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	A nasal spray version of Viagra, by contrast, would bring the  
drug in contact with the mucous membranes, offering the prospect of 
almost immediate absorption into the bloodstream and quicker relief 
for impotence sufferers, Dittert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said he and Hussein had contacted Pfizer officials in  
England, where Viagra was developed, but were given a chilly 
reception. ``They said, `We're looking at it, we'll call you,''' 
Dittert said. ``It's been a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to horn in on their patent,'' he added. ``We  
just think we've got a better mousetrap and we think they ought to 
be interested in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said he and Hussein, a colleague at Kentucky's College  
of Pharmacy, developed the idea of a nasal-spray version of Viagra 
shortly after the drug hit the market last spring and filed for a 
provisional patent in June. Each of the men has studied nasal drug 
delivery systems for over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said a spray that could offer impotency relief on the  
spur of the moment would probably appeal to Viagra users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel because of the nature of Viagra's use that people  
don't want to wait an hour for results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working at their University of Kentucky-affiliated company, New  
Millennium Pharmaceutical Research Inc., Hussein and Dittert added 
a secret compound to sildenafil that allows the drug to remain in 
solution without diminishing its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said the compound is recognized as safe by the federal  
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the researchers sent a postgraduate student to the  
University of Iowa to study the effect of the sildenafil solution 
on rats. Those tests showed that the sildenafil was quickly 
absorbed into the rats' bloodstream, according to the professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we were really excited,'' Dittert said, because  
although not all medicines can be delivered through the mucous 
membranes, there are no known cases of a nasal delivery system 
working for rats but not for humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Pfizer owns all rights to sildenafil, Dittert and  
Hussein must work with the company if they hope to bring their idea 
to market, a process that could take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Caprino said consumers seem happy with their Viagra pills. ``We  
certainly have not heard with consumers that they are unhappy with 
this oral delivery system or that it is impeding their ability to 
effectively use this drug.''

<HEADLINE> Two Shot at Salt Lake TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman carrying a grocery bag filled with  
bullets entered a television studio lobby Thursday afternoon and 
opened fire with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were injured, one seriously, during the woman's  
four-floor shooting spree at the downtown office building housing 
KSL television and radio stations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities took De-Kieu Duy, 25, into custody in the  
fourth-floor offices of AT&AMP;T Wireless Services after company 
employees tackled and disarmed her. Police said Duy had targeted 
KSL but ended up in the AT&AMP;T offices, where her 9mm pistol jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T employee Anne Slater, 30, was shot in the head and was  
listed in extremely critical condition, LDS Hospital spokesman Jess 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	KSL building manager Brent Whiteman was shot but not seriously  
hurt. He was under observation at another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Video West technical operator Dan Nestel said he saw a woman  
wearing a light-colored parka, a hat and shooting range ear 
protection enter the KSL lobby and demand to speak to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	When her request was denied, Nestel said, she began firing  
random shots in the lobby. KSL radio employee Mary Kammeyer entered 
the lobby after hearing shots and was confronted by the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying, `Newsroom, newsroom, where's the newsroom?'''  
Kammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City Police Chief Ruben Ortega said: ``She came in  
specifically with the intent of shooting someone at KSL 
Television,'' Ortega said. ``Her motives are not totally clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KSL is Salt Lake City's NBC affiliate and is owned by the Mormon  
Church.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From House Rebuttal Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from House prosecutors' rebuttal brief to President  
Clinton's pretrial arguments: 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Trial Memorandum contains numerous factual  
inaccuracies and misstatements of the governing law and the 
Senate's precedents. ... A complete and impartial review of the 
evidence reveals that the president did in fact commit perjury 
before the grand jury and that he obstructed justice during the 
Jones litigation and the grand jury investigation as alleged in the 
articles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives. The 
House believes a review of the complete record, including the full 
grand jury and deposition testimony of the key witnesses in this 
case, will establish that. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton maintains that his testimony before the grand  
jury was entirely truthful. At the outset of his argument, he 
states that he told the truth about the nature and details of his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he insists that any false 
impressions that his deposition testimony might have created were 
remedied by his admission of ``improper intimate contact'' with Ms. 
Lewinsky. However, his subsequent testimony demonstrates that this 
admission is narrowly tailored to mean that Ms. Lewinsky had 
``sexual relations'' with him, but he did not have ``sexual 
relations'' with her, as he understood the term to be defined. In 
other words, he admitted only what he knew could be conclusively 
established through scientific tests. He denied what the testimony 
of Ms. Lewinsky, the testimony of a number of her confidantes, and 
common sense proves: that while she engaged in sexual relations 
with him, he engaged in sexual relations with her, regardless of 
how President Clinton attempts to redefine the term. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Following this pattern, President Clinton discounts substantial  
evidence as well as common sense when he maintains that he 
testified truthfully in the grand jury about, among other things, 
his prior deposition testimony, his attorney's statements to Judge 
(Susan Webber) Wright during his deposition, and his intent in 
providing a series of false statements to his secretary after his 
deposition. Again, a complete review of the record and witness 
testimony reveals that President Clinton committed perjury numerous 
times in his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	To the extent that President Clinton's Trial Memorandum raises  
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live 
testimony subject to cross-examination. The Senate, weighing the 
evidence in its entirety, will make an independent assessment of 
the facts as they are presented, and a detailed, point-by-point 
argument on these matters is best resolved on the Senate floor. The 
House is confident that a thorough factual analysis will not only 
refute President Clinton's contentions, but will prove the very 
serious charges contained in the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House acknowledges that the Senate has the power to dismiss  
an article of impeachment on the ground that it does not state a 
removable offense. Beyond that, however, President Clinton 
completely ignores the Senate's precedents concerning the use of 
that power. In the fifteen cases in which the House has forwarded 
articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate has never granted 
a dispositive motion to preclude a trial on the articles with one 
exception. In the 1926 case of Judge George English, the Senate 
granted a motion to adjourn after Judge English resigned from 
office making a trial moot on the issue of removal. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton claims that to remove him on these articles  
would permanently disfigure and diminish the presidency and mangle 
the system of checks and balances. Quite the contrary, however, it 
is President Clinton's behavior as set forth in the articles that 
has had these effects. Essentially, President Clinton argues that 
the presidency and the system of checks and balances can only be 
saved if we allow the president to commit felonies with impunity. 
To state that proposition is to refute it. Convicting him and 
thereby reaffirming that criminal behavior that strikes at heart of 
the justice system will result in removal will serve to strengthen 
the presidency, not weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton continues to try to persuade the American  
public that the House of Representatives has impeached him for 
having an extramarital affair. ... In doing so, the president's 
lawyers refer to an incident involving then Secretary of the 
Treasury Alexander Hamilton being blackmailed by the husband of a 
woman named Maria Reynolds with whom he was having an adulterous 
affair. However, the president's lawyers omit the relevant 
distinguishing facts even as they cast aspersions upon Alexander 
Hamilton: None of Hamilton's ``efforts'' to cover up his affair 
involved the violation of any laws, let alone felonies. Indeed, the 
fact of the matter is that Hamilton was the victim of the crime of 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's argument that presidents are held to a lower  
standard of behavior than federal judges completely misreads the 
Constitution and the Senate's precedents. The Constitution provides 
one standard for the impeachment, conviction, and removal from 
office of ``the president, the vice president, and all civil 
officers of the United States.'' It is the commission of ``treason, 
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The Senate has 
already determined that perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor in 
the cases of Judge Nixon, Judge Hastings and Judge Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton argues that the impeachment trial is similar  
to a criminal trial and that the appropriate standard should 
therefore be ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' That argument is not 
new: It has been made in the past, and the Senate has rejected it, 
as, indeed, President Clinton acknowledges. He asserts, however, 
that the impeachment trial of a president should proceed under 
special procedures that do not apply to the trial of other civil 
officers. His arguments are unpersuasive. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Can the president legitimately argue that he is unable to put on  
a proper defense? President Clinton has committed a great number of 
impeachable misdeeds. The House Judiciary Committee's committee 
report requires 20 pages just to list the most glaring instances of 
the president's perjurious, false, and misleading testimony before 
a federal grand jury and it requires 13 pages just to list the most 
glaring incidents in the president's course of conduct designed to 
prevent, obstruct, and impede the administration of justice. The 
House believes that President Clinton's attorneys have reviewed the 
committee report. They know exactly what he is being charged with. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The claim that President Clinton is not on notice regarding the  
charges is ludicrous. The Lewinsky matter is arguably the most 
reported and scrutinized story of 1998 and possibly of 1999. The 
facts of the case are contained in numerous documents, statements, 
reports and filings. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the clear Senate precedent permitting articles of  
impeachment containing multiple specifications of impeachable 
offenses, the president's attack on the construction of the 
articles is an attack on Senate rules and precedent. The 
president's concerns, if assumed to be valid, could be addressed 
simply by permitting a division of the question. ... The Senate has 
not acted unconstitutionally in the past regarding prior 
impeachments, and is not on a course to do so in the trial of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's attorneys raise the issue of fairness. They  
are entitled to their own opinion about the House's proceedings, 
but they are not entitled to rewrite history. The truth is that the 
committee's subpoena power could have been used to subpoena 
documents or witnesses on behalf of the president if they had so 
requested. They did not. All they requested, is that lawyers, law 
professors, and historians testify before the committee. In short, 
President Clinton's statements about what happened in the House 
completely misstate what occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	For the reasons stated herein and in the Trial Memorandum of the  
United States House of Representatives, the House respectfully 
submits that the articles properly state impeachable offenses, that 
the Senate should proceed to a full trial on the articles, and that 
after trial, the Senate should vote to convict President William 
Jefferson Clinton, remove him from office, and disqualify him from 
holding further office.

<HEADLINE> Va., NJ Must Accept Some NYC Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Want to visit the Big Apple? See a Broadway  
play? Eat on Restaurant Row? Then you'd better be willing to take 
out the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	So says Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.  
</P>
<P>
	With New York's own landfill nearly packed to capacity, the  
mayor said places like Virginia and New Jersey are duty-bound to 
accept some trash. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, out-of-state tourists account for much of  
the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have room here to handle the garbage that's produced  
not just by New Yorkers, but the 3 million more people who come 
here that utilize the place every day,'' Giuliani said Thursday. 
``This is a reciprocal relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubbish, say officials outside New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous,'' said Mark Miner, a spokesman for Virginia  
Gov. James S. Gilmore III. ``Virginia does not have any obligations 
to New York City garbage,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trash talk, sparked last year, was rekindled on Wednesday  
when Gilmore said he wanted to curb the dumping of out-of-state 
trash in Virginia. He was reacting to word this week from Waste 
Management Inc., a waste disposal company, that it wants to dump an 
additional 4,000 tons of New York City trash in his state every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already ships out 2,400 tons of New York City trash  
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia ``has a right -- I would say a duty -- to ban the use of  
barges for the transportation of garbage on Virginia's waterways,'' 
Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman was more blunt in  
commenting on New York's plan to ship out its garbage: ``Drop 
dead,'' read a prepared release from her office. 
</P>
<P>
	But with New York planning to close its last landfill -- Fresh  
Kills on Staten Island -- by 2001, Giuliani needs to figure out what 
to do with 13,000 tons of household waste each day from the city's 
five boroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite resistance, Giuliani is undeterred. He has raised the  
possibility of legal action, but hopes that leaders elsewhere first 
weigh the upside of taking New York's trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of communities all over the country that  
depend on (garbage disposal) for jobs, and that are strongly in 
favor of it,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Coca-Cola Bottlers Merge in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two Coca-Cola bottlers in Japan are merging to a  
create a company that would be Japan's largest Coke bottler. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. said today the new Coca-Cola West Japan Company  
Ltd., headquartered in Fukuoka, would be formed from Kita Kyushu 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and Sanyo Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bottlers had combined revenues of $1.6 billion in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola West Japan will be an ``anchor bottler,'' a  
designation given to global bottlers with significant financial 
resources, strong management and ``a shared commitment (with Coke) 
to the long-term development of the Coca-Cola business in their 
territory,'' a Coke statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the merger will help ``capture growth opportunities in  
the changing Japanese soft drink market.''

<HEADLINE> Kodak's Weak Earnings Batter Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co., pinched by lower film  
prices and a star-crossed deal with its biggest copier customer, 
reported weaker-than-expected earnings. The company's stock tumbled 
more than 10 percent on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographic products company earned $272 million, or 83  
cents a diluted share, for the last three months of 1998, compared 
with a loss of $744 million, or $2.29 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dropped 6 percent to $3.56 billion from $3.78 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The performance fell below Wall Street forecasts. Excluding  
one-time charges, fourth-quarter earnings came in at $1.05 a 
diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call had been expecting a 
$1.15 per share profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's stock fell $8.19 a share to $70.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange Thursday, contributing to the Dow Jones industrial 
average's 228-point drop to 9,120.93. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. consumer film market, Kodak won back ground lost to  
Japanese nemesis Fuji in 1997. It was the first year in a decade 
that Kodak had regained some of its share of that market, but 
success came at a steep cost. Falling prices and deep discounts 
diminished profits, especially during the lucrative holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got to cut price 13 to 15 percent in an industry  
that's growing at 4 or 5 percent, you're killing yourself,'' said 
analyst B. Alex Henderson of Prudential Securities. ``I'd rather 
they just had stable pricing and stable market share and this price 
war went away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's U.S. consumer film share, by volume, rose 3 points last  
year after dipping as low as 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's core business of amateur film, photographic paper and  
cameras generates about half its profits, but sales were flat for 
the year in the United States and dipped 10 percent abroad. 
Operating profits edged up 1 percent in 1998 but plunged 17 percent 
worldwide in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Film sales were especially hard hit in emerging markets,  
dropping 78 percent in Russia, 23 percent in South Korea, 6 percent 
in China and 4 percent in Latin America -- or down 15 percent 
overall in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak also was broadsided in December when it had to terminate a  
distribution contract with London-based Danka Business Systems, 
which bought Kodak's copier sales and service business in 1996 for 
$688 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Danka, short on cash and pondering bankruptcy, had accounted for  
90 percent of Kodak's $425 million in annual copier sales. 
</P>
<P>
	After a moderately profitable year in office imaging, sales of  
Kodak copiers dropped precipitously in the quarter. That led to a 
production slowdown, some 300 job cuts and a quarterly charge of 
$87 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak cut costs by $730 million in 1998, much of it to cover  
19,900 job cuts through the end of this year. Kodak has so far 
eliminated 12,200 jobs, trimming its worldwide payroll to 86,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in the fast-growing field of digital photography, the  
recording of images on computer chips, totaled $262 million in 
1998, down from a $440 million loss in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Kodak earned $1.39 billion, or $4.24 a diluted  
share, up from $5 million, or 1 cent a share, in 1997. Sales for 
the year fell 8 percent to $13.4 billion from $14.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Scripps Howard Shakes Up Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dan K. Thomasson will retire as vice  
president/news for Scripps Howard newspapers and editor of Scripps 
Howard News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be succeeded by Peter Copeland, the news service's  
managing editor, as Washington-based editor and general manager of 
the news service. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasson, 65, has been with Scripps Howard for 40 years,  
serving nearly 35 of those years in Washington. After his 
retirement Friday, he will continue to write a twice-a-week column 
for the news service. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Ambrose, 54, chief editorial writer for the news service and  
former editor of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, has been promoted 
to director of editorial policy for the Scripps Howard newspapers. 
He will be responsible for overseeing editorial policy on national 
and international issues for Scripps newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps Howard newspapers and the Scripps Howard News Service  
are operating units of The E.W. Scripps Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasson was a reporter for The Indianapolis Star and the  
Denver Rocky Mountain News, and was political editor of the News 
when he was assigned to Washington by Scripps Howard in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	He became chief congressional correspondent for Scripps Howard  
in 1966 and managing editor of Scripps Howard News Service in 1976. 
In January 1980, he became editor of Scripps Howard News Service 
and chief of the 50-person Washington bureau. He became a vice 
president in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland 41, became managing editor of Scripps Howard News  
Service in 1997. Before joining the Washington bureau, Copeland 
spent five years as the Scripps Howard Latin America correspondent 
based in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose has been chief editorial writer for Scripps Howard News  
Service since 1995, a position he accepted after serving six years 
as editor of what was then known as the Rocky Mountain News. From 
1984 to 1989, he was managing editor and then editor of the El Paso 
Herald-Post. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> PriceWaterhouse, SEC Reach Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
accused by federal regulators of violating rules requiring 
accountants to remain independent from companies they audit, has 
agreed to a settlement that creates a $2.5 million education fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, which announced the  
settlement Thursday, said some of PricewaterhouseCoopers' 
accountants owned stock in corporations they audited. The SEC said 
the company also agreed to be censured, to improve its procedures 
for monitoring adherence to auditor independence rules and to 
conduct an internal investigation supervised by an outside person. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $2.5 million fund will be used to enhance awareness in  
the accounting profession of the independence rules. 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the merger last July of  
Price Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from its New York City headquarters, the company  
said the settlement came about because ``a few individuals'' in 
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's Tampa, Fla., office had withheld information. 
In the case of the pension fund violations, required procedures 
were not followed, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm accepts responsibility for these incidents,'' the  
statement said. ``We abhor and regret these deviations from firm 
standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers said that while existing rules and  
procedures were stringent, ``we and our clients will benefit from 
the additional measures we will take to make sure this does not 
happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be  
more independent of the companies they audit. Agency officials have 
expressed concern that accounting firms are jeopardizing their 
independence by becoming more financially dependent on the 
lucrative consulting work they do for companies they audit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the PricewaterhouseCoopers case, the SEC alleged that from  
1996 through 1998, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand failed to discover that in 
four instances, some of its accountants owned stock in corporations 
they audited. In 31 cases, the agency said, partners or managers of 
the accounting firm owned stock in corporations that were clients 
of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. 
</P>
<P>
	In another 45 cases, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's retirement plan held  
securities of corporations that were audit clients of Coopers &AMP; 
Lybrand and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the market watchdog agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SEC's rules explicitly forbid accountants from owning  
stock in their audit clients,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard 
Walker said in a statement. ``If auditors are not independent of 
their clients, in fact or perception, the integrity of the 
financial reporting system is jeopardized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came a day after the SEC brought accounting fraud  
charges against the former top managers of Broadway theater 
producer Livent Inc., a troubled Canadian company whose productions 
included ``Ragtime'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''

<HEADLINE> Henry Approved As Marlins Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- By this time next week, the Florida  
Marlins will have a new owner. Change on the field, however, could 
be years away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about what to do to return winning baseball  
to South Florida. It's a big challenge,'' John Henry said Wednesday 
after his $150 million purchase was given unanimous approval, 
ending H. Wayne Huizenga's topsy turvy reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a 49-year-old commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla.,  
formally takes over after the deal closes next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six years since the Huizenga family brought baseball  
to South Florida,'' said Huizenga, who has not attended many 
owners' meetings in the past five years. ``We did not want to sell 
our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the Marlins, obtaining the franchise in July  
1991. The expansion team started play two years later, saw 
attendance plummet after the 1994-95 strike, then won a surprising 
World Series title in 1997 after doubling its payroll from $25.3 
million to $52.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Huizenga, a billionaire who also owns the NFL's Miami  
Dolphins and heads the public company that owns the NHL's Florida 
Panthers, became disenchanted when Florida and Miami officials 
failed to fund a stadium with a retractable roof. He became 
convinced the government wouldn't finance a ballpark for a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks after the Marlins beat Cleveland in Game 7, he  
ordered an unprecedented payroll purge that saw the Marlins go from 
fifth-highest to No. 27 at $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida finished 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending  
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Henry's first tasks is convincing Florida and Miami  
officials to fund a ballpark. While he says he would pay for a 
stadium if the government doesn't fund one, he also says that would 
condemn the Marlins to low payrolls and perennial mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay for players or pay for a ballpark,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry also is hampered by an ongoing relationship with Huizenga,  
who also owns Pro Player Stadium and SportsChannel Florida, which 
has the local television rights to Marlins games. Huizenga 
originally agreed to a deal between the Marlins and the TV network 
that extended for the next 25 years; as part of his negotiations 
with Henry, the TV deal will end after 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry immediately joined the ranks of baseball owners calling  
for economic change. NBA players agreed last week to the first-ever 
limit on individual salaries among the four major North American 
professional sports. Some baseball owners want that, too, when it 
comes time to renegotiate their collective bargaining agreement, 
probably after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have gotten so bad that something will have to be  
done,'' Henry said. ``I'm convinced the current leadership of 
baseball will bring about change. ... I think Florida baseball 
would be in a sad state of affairs without change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga, who was the wealthiest individual owner in baseball,  
gave a goodbye speech during the 2-hour major league meeting, then 
introduced Henry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an emotional moment for everybody,'' Marlins general  
manager Dave Dombrowski said.

<HEADLINE> Minority Stations Paid Less for Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advertisers often bypass or pay less money to  
minority-owned radio stations geared to black or Hispanic 
listeners, but it is unclear why, a report said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil Rights Forum on Communications Policy, an advocacy  
group based here, wrote the report commissioned by the Federal 
Communications Commission at a cost of $20,000, said the forum's 
research director, Kofi Ofori. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 91 percent of the 64 minority-owned radio  
stations that responded indicated they had encountered ``dictates'' 
by advertisers to not buy ads on their stations. A total of 284 
minority-owned stations were surveyed and 64, or 22.5 percent, 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	In a different survey of 3,745 stations, the report found that  
advertisers on average paid minority-owned radio stations targeting 
a minority audience 29 percent less per listener than non-minority 
owned stations targeting a general audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The report didn't pin down the reasons. Many factors, however,  
could be responsible, including audience demographics, ratings or 
whether the station is owned by a company operating many radio 
stations, the report acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the report said anecdotal data suggest that ``in certain  
instances, the media buying process is guided by ethnic/racial 
stereotyping, underestimations of disposable income, the desire to 
control product image, unfounded fears of pilferage, etc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stations that serve minority communities are not getting  
their fair share of advertising dollars,'' said Bill Kennard, the 
FCC's first black chairman. But Kennard said it is too early to 
tell whether new regulations are needed. ``At this stage, we're 
trying to gather the information and determine what the appropriate 
role for government is,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Another commissioner called for follow-up to see what's causing  
the differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace Snyder, president of the American Advertising  
Federation, urged advertisers to base purchase decisions on facts 
and research. He called on the industry to ``look closely at its 
advertising practices and see where the incongruities lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that federal regulators develop guidelines  
on ad practices. And it calls on the industry to adopt a code of 
conduct that requires decisions based on market research. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority broadcasters for years have contended advertisers  
discriminate against them. ``Our ability to serve our communities 
is severely hampered by advertisers who refuse to advertise on our 
stations,'' said Pierre Sutton, president of the National 
Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Drop Another 250 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower and still falling in  
mid-afternoon, after Brazil's main stock exchange halted trading 
following another 10 percent drop in its main Bovespa index. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow average of 30 blue-chip stocks  
was down 252.32 at 9,097.24, its lowest point in the session. The 
Dow was deepening Wednesday's 125-point loss and dropping below 
where it began the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners led advancers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Trading was active, with 644 million shares having 
changed hands, but that was well below Wednesday's brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes were sharply lower. The Nasdaq composite was down  
25.54 at 2,291.27. The S&AMP;P 500 composite was down 20.94 at 
1,213.46. 
</P>
<P>
	The market decline started this morning and accellerated this  
afternoon, after a second key banking official in Brazil resigned, 
sending Brazil's Bovespa stock index sharply lower for the second 
day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Latin America's  
largest, was halted for 30 minutes after a 10 percent plunge this 
afternoon, following a 5 percent drop Wednesday. When trading 
resumed a half-hour later, the leading stock index in Brazil was 
off 9.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Brazil's central bank chief resigned and his  
successor devalued the Brazilian currency by 8 percent. Today, its 
supervision director resigned, citing personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, blue chip stocks were led lower by issues of  
consumer companies, whose earnings rely heavily on exports to 
Brazil and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were also hurt by Eastman Kodak, which this morning  
reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. Kodak's shares, 
which are part of the Dow industrials, were down 8 5/16 at 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other consumer issues taking big hits were Philip Morris, downe  
down 1 9/16 at 52 5/8, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 3 1/2 at 84 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell today despite good news from the Commerce Department  
that retail sales rose a strong 0.9 percent in December, pushing 
the gain for last year to 5.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales increases proved not inflationary, as consumer prices  
rose a moderate 1.6 percent last year, up 0.1 percent in December. 
Inflation was restrained by a big 8.8 percent drop in energy costs.

<HEADLINE> Boat Racer Presumed Shot To Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A champion boat racer was believed to  
have been shot to death in his airplane, which was stolen and 
abandoned with blood in the cabin, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched in Albuquerque, the mountains to the east  
and nearby desert for the body of Harry Christensen, 48, who was 
reported missing by his family on Jan. 6. That night, Christensen's 
1973 Cessna 340 was found at a small airport just north of 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen's body has not been found.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have arrested Bobby Joe Keesee, who has a long  
criminal record, and charged him with stealing the plane and taking 
it from the airport in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit said Keesee, 64, admitted being with  
Christensen when Christensen was shot twice in Lake Havasu City. 
Agent Doug Beldon would not elaborate, and only said the charges 
against Keesee could be elevated. 
</P>
<P>
	When Keesee was arrested in Las Cruces on Jan. 7, he had  
Christensen's rings, Rolex watch and credit cards and had put his 
picture on Christensen's Arizona driver's license, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee was being held without bail. His attorney declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee has served time for posing as a federal official in two  
schemes to obtain airplanes, for attempting to bilk a company in a 
purchasing scam, for theft of a plane and for conspiracy in the 
death of a U.S. consul in Hermosillo, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee was released from prison in August after a term for  
kidnapping and ransom, Beldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen is well known in the boat-racing world and owns a  
high-end custom boat factory in Lake Havasu City. He won a major 
powerboat championship in 1997 in Biloxi, Miss.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Agrees to $120M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Judith Rubin's home was insured for a large  
deck, custom kitchen and interior hot tub. The problem was she 
didn't have any of those things. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she is among as many as 1 million California policyholders  
of Allstate Insurance Co. who will share in a payment of as much as 
$120 million after accusing the company of deliberately falsifying 
their homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company agreed to the refunds that are expected to average  
$120 each, but denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeowners claimed Allstate gouged them by charging premiums  
based on falsely inflated estimates of how much it would cost to 
replace or repair dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim Allstate inflated the premiums by adding nonexistent  
features such as spiral staircases to one-story homes along with 
marble floors, basements and air conditioning. They also say the 
company overestimated the square-footage of some homes. 
</P>
<P>
	These inaccuracies were added to computer-generated ``profile  
sheets'' used to calculate costs of repairing or replacing homes, 
according to the lawsuit. Allstate profited from the overestimates 
that had increased premiums because most homeowners didn't collect 
on their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argued the insurance firm took advantage of  
customers who unknowingly paid higher premiums because they trusted 
Allstate's expertise. Most homeowners are ignorant about how much 
it would actually cost to replace their homes, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiff, and hundreds and thousands of duped customers ...  
reasonably believed the defendants possessed ... specific expertise 
in their field and that they would not place profits over the needs 
and expectations of their customers,'' Harvey Levine, who 
represented the policyholders, said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	A gag order imposed by a federal judge prevented both sides from  
commenting on the settlement reached last week in U.S. District 
Court in San Diego. The impetus for secrecy came from Allstate, 
which receives yearly premiums of over $15 billion, according to 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Policyholders in the class-action were contacted about the  
settlement when it was proposed last fall and soon will be notified 
of their eligibility for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Northbrook, Ill.-based insurance company argued  
in court papers that the figures were innocent mistakes and in some 
cases the homeowners may have provided false or incorrect 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate fought the lawsuit for three years.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Is Just 1.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Helped by a big drop in the cost of gasoline  
and other petroleum products, inflation rose just 1.6 percent in 
1998, giving the country its best back-to-back annual performance 
on consumer prices since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that its closely watched  
Consumer Price Index edged up just 0.1 percent in December, capping 
a year in which inflation was better behaved than the small 1.7 
percent rise recorded in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The small December increase reflected a record 18.3 percent  
surge in tobacco costs, reflecting a drive by tobacco companies to 
recoup the costs of their huge state liability settlements. Without 
the big jump in tobacco costs, there would have been no increase at 
all in prices in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The modest increases in inflation over the past two years  
reflected the best two-year price performance in 34 years, since 
gains of just 1 percent in 1964 and 1.9 percent in 1965. The 1.6 
percent rise last year was the best one-year showing since a 1.1 
percent rise in 1986, a year in which energy prices plummeted by 
19.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent good news on inflation in large part reflects the  
financial crises that began in Asia in 1997. Plunging currency 
values and deep recessions have sharply cut demand for many 
commodities, including energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a boon for U.S. consumers, although American  
manufacturers are suffering a profit squeeze from the loss of 
export markets and the inability to raise prices domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy costs were down 8.8 percent for all of 1998, the biggest  
one-year decline since 1986. Energy prices had fallen 3.4 percent 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of price pressures in the United States gave the  
Federal Reserve the maneuvering room to cut interest rates three 
times in the fall in a so-far successful campaign to keep global 
financial problems from triggering a recession in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist believe that inflation pressures will be slightly  
higher this year as Asian economies begin to recover and worldwide 
demand for energy products and other commodities picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts believe the slight rise will not be troubling  
for the Fed and they do not foresee a need for the central bank to 
start raising interest rates, especially if as expected, the U.S. 
economy slows in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, food costs were up 2.3 percent, a slightly  
faster increase than the tiny 1.6 percent rise in 1997. Dairy 
products showed the sharpest acceleration in price gains last year 
while coffee prices actually fell 8.8 percent following a 16.9 
percent surge in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the so-called  
core rate of inflation rose by 2.4 percent in 1998, only slightly 
faster than a 2.2 percent increase in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This increase in the core rate reflected a sharp 31.8 percent  
jump in tobacco costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical costs were up 3.4 percent in 1998, their biggest one  
year rise since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	For December, the core rate of inflation registered a 0.3  
percent rise, following six straight months of 0.2 percent gains. 
But without the big increase in tobacco costs, the core inflation 
rate would have been up only 0.1 percent in December.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Religious Landlords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Landlords can cite religious beliefs in  
refusing to rent to unmarried couples living together, a federal 
appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on  
Thursday favored two Anchorage landlords fighting Alaska's ban on 
housing discrimination based on marital status. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the majority, Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain said the  
Alaska law, and a similar ordinance in Anchorage, interfered with 
property owners' free exercise of religion as well as their 
property rights and freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissenting judge said the ruling could lead to denials of  
housing to divorced people, interracial couples and victims of 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue. If the ruling  
stands, it will be binding on federal courts in Alaska, California 
and seven other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Robert Royce said Alaska would ask  
the full appeals court to hear the case, and could appeal to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by Kevin Thomas and Joyce Baker, who each  
own several rental properties in Anchorage and said they had 
consistently refused to rent to unmarried couples because of their 
Christian beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	By requiring the landlords to choose between their businesses  
and their religious beliefs, the Alaska laws ``banish both Thomas 
and Baker from the Alaska rental market altogether and force them 
to forsake their livelihoods,'' said O'Scannlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Steven T. McFarland of the Center for Law and Religious  
Freedom said the ruling could help restore religious rights 
weakened in a 1990 Supreme Court case involving religious use of 
the drug peyote. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling said laws that are neutral toward religion are valid  
even if they infringe on some people's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school district that doesn't want to allow parents to opt  
out of a religiously objectionable curriculum, now they've got to 
listen to that parent,'' said McFarland, whose group is affiliated 
with the Christian Legal Society. ``The public hospital that 
doesn't want to accommodate the employee who needs Yom Kippur off 
now has to listen to him.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell, host of Broadway's Tony  
Awards the past two years, will preside over next month's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host told ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' studio  
audience in New York during a break in taping Wednesday that she 
will be the master of ceremonies for the Feb. 24 broadcast on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Donnell's acceptance seemed to surprise executives at the  
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences who had been 
negotiating with her ever since Grammy nominations were announced 
Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Academy President Michael Greene made it official Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rosie is a perfect choice for us for so many reasons,'' Greene  
said. ``She is an all-around performer -- film and television star, 
Broadway entertainer and stand-up comedian, and most importantly 
she is the world's biggest music fan.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Discuss Trial on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-five minutes before the Senate  
impeachment trial resumed Thursday, two senators were discussing 
the case on live television. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they were commanded to remain silent inside the chamber  
``on pain of imprisonment,'' Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sam 
Brownback, R-Kan., were free to talk outside the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	After the session ended, many others did just that, and some  
didn't mince words about where they stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``A foundation was laid today but it was a decidedly weak  
foundation,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike jurors in regular court cases -- sometimes closeted in  
hotels to avoid public contact and kept from talking to relatives 
about testimony -- the only guide in making public comments for the 
100 highly political impeachment jurors is their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether somebody makes the decision to curtail any public  
pronouncements, I guess that's an individual decision,'' said Sen. 
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	No policy exists on public statements for either Democrats or  
Republicans. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``is not inclined 
to do a lot of media on the trial,'' his spokesman said, but that 
could change as events unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	Some comments have seemed to cross the line on impartiality,  
such as Sen. Tom Harkin's recent pretrial characterization of the 
House case as ``a pile of dung.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harkin, D-Iowa, stressed that the Constitution does not  
envision the Senate as an anonymous sequestered jury -- one like the 
O.J. Simpson murder panel that couldn't even be shown during those 
famous televised court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the framers of the Constitution had wanted this in a court  
of law, they would have given that power to the federal courts,'' 
Harkin said. ``They gave it to the Senate, understandably, as a 
political procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said they will continue to discuss the case but  
refrain from comments on whether the evidence is swaying their 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the trial starts, I think we'd be better off not to talk  
about the facts in the case,'' Brownback said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House opening statements Thursday, several senators  
walked past reporters gathered outside the chamber. Most smiled or 
nodded but made no comment. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, muttered 
that the House has made a ``very good presentation,'' but that was 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet several senators did speak with reporters afterwards, and  
Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia and Democratic Sen. Chris 
Dodd of Connecticut were to appear on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said senators should take great  
care in making pronouncements about the case because they could 
appear to be ``trying to affect public opinion so that it will 
affect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We took an oath last week to do impartial justice,'' Lieberman  
said. ``Part of our responsibility as jurors in an impeachment 
trial is to filter the comments ... particularly off the floor of 
the Senate.''

<HEADLINE> Early Humans May Have Eaten Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 3 million years ago, the ancestors of  
modern humans already were climbing down from the trees and 
gathering food on nearby grasslands, perhaps even catching and 
eating small animals, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report published today in the journal Science, researchers  
say that the chemistry of tooth enamel from the remains of hominids 
call Australophithecus africanus shows that the ape-like creatures 
were eating a variety of foods. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that ``africanus was not just a tree dweller,'' said  
Matt Sponheimer, a researcher at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study shows that this early human ancestor found its food  
both in the forest and in the open areas,'' said Sponheimer, 
co-author of the study in Science. He said the africanus may have 
been hunting small animals even before the development of Stone Age 
weapons and tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies, based on bones in the jaw, arms, hands and  
feet, had suggested the species subsisted only on leaves and fruits 
plucked from forests -- rather like the diet of present-day 
chimpanzees, the nearest animal relative to modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sponheimer said the tooth chemistry study proves the species  
also hunted and gathered in the open areas where grass grew. For 
some specimens, up to 25 percent of the diet came from grass or 
grass-eating animals, said Sponheimer. ``For one specimen, it was 
50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study makes clear the early hominids were eating something  
different from what researchers had assumed, said John Kingston, a 
Yale University expert on early human-like species. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the things they could have been eating is meat, which is  
a fascinating possibility,'' Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study did not determine conclusively if the species ate  
meat from grass-eating animals or merely the seeds and roots of 
grassland plants, which would give the same tooth-enamel signature, 
Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossils of the africanus have been found only in South Africa.  
It lived about 3 million years ago and resembles Lucy, the famed, 
nearly complete hominid skeleton found in Ethiopia in North Africa. 
Lucy, however, is slightly more ape-like and is identified as A. 
afarensis, an earlier human ancestral species. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanus was not much bigger than a chimpanzee, at about 4 feet  
and 90 pounds, but had a slightly larger brain. It walked on its 
hind legs, but some specimens suggest an opposing big toe rather 
like a tree-climbing ape, said Sponheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	This feature, along with teeth that resemble those of apes, have  
led other researchers to conclude the species lived in the trees 
and ate only plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, Sponheimer and co-author Julia A. Lee-Thorp of  
the University of Cape Town in South Africa extracted tiny bits of 
tooth enamel from the specimens and then analyzed the carbon 
isotope ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have a different  
number of neutrons. For instance, trees and bushes contain more 
carbon-13 than do grasses that grow in open areas. The isotopic 
ratios in the enamel reflect which of these plants the animals ate. 
Meat-eaters acquire the isotopic signatures of their prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect,'' said Sponheimer, ``you are what you eat.''  
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, if the species ate animals that fed on grasses,  
their tooth enamel would show the carbon-13 signature of grassland 
plants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The specimens analyzed had carbon-13 signatures between that of  
forest animals and plains-dwelling grass-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	That indicates the species ate foods from both the forests and  
the plains. It also suggests they fed on high-protein animal foods, 
perhaps insects or small mammals, that lived on grasses.

<HEADLINE> Government Concludes Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wrapped up its sweeping  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. but inadvertently revealed a 
secret document about prices that some computer makers pay for its 
dominant Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1997 internal memorandum to the chairman and chief  
executive officer for Gateway Inc., Ted Waitt, was among more than 
2,000 pages of documents the government released to reporters 
Wednesday upon the conclusion of its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys later acknowledged the Gateway memo was  
under court-ordered seal and demanded its return. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway complained about a specific price for Windows 95 being  
offered to its rivals, Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer 
Corp. Gateway also complained that Microsoft's discounts offered to 
all computer makers were being reduced 20 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices that Microsoft charges to computer makers -- generally  
believed $45 to $65 -- for each copy of Windows are among the 
industry's most closely guarded secrets. The judge closed the 
courtroom for hours earlier this week when government lawyers began 
asking about prices. The software sells at retail for $89. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan characterized the memo as ``an  
internal document speculating about some pricing information that 
turns out to be wrong.'' Cullinan said the specific price quoted in 
the Gateway memo was ``inaccurate, but we shouldn't comment on 
anything specific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Microsoft challenged the government's last  
witness over claims that the company rewards some computer makers 
and punishes others by charging different prices for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends those price fluctuations help illustrate  
Microsoft's monopoly power, an important distinction under 
antitrust principles. It's also crucial for the government's core 
claim that Microsoft engaged in predatory, anti-competitive 
behavior in an effort to ``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own 
popular Internet browser software once earned tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the price differences for Windows are largely due  
to volume discounts, which are generally legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you name a single software vendor that doesn't  
price-discriminate?'' Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my general belief that this may or may not be a  
widespread practice. I just don't know,'' answered economist 
Franklin Fisher, who also testified at trial that Microsoft 
generally charges computer makers ``very roughly about $50 a 
copy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, also an economist, will be followed  
over the coming months by some of its top executives -- but not Bill 
Gates, its famous billionaire chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	As a procedural move, Microsoft asked the judge Wednesday to  
rule immediately in its favor. But even the company's lead lawyer, 
John Warden, wasn't hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have indeed forecast your decision, we are prepared to  
move ahead with our case,'' Warden offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have indeed,'' answered U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its final evidence, the government also submitted  
more videotape of its deposition with Gates last summer. Gates was 
asked whether he was trying to disparage Netscape in mid-1996 when 
he talked about the company's opportunities for profits being ``not 
very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a goal to do that, and my only comments about  
Netscape's business would have come in response to direct questions 
about that topic from reporters,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also released a July 1997 e-mail from Microsoft  
vice president Brad Chase weighing whether the company might charge 
$49 for a version of the browser that eventually was included in 
Windows 98, in part because it ``starts getting people to think 
about everything won't be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft earlier promised that its browser would be ``forever  
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, said the Chase e-mail  
``absolutely does not support any characterization that Microsoft 
was considering charging for (its browser) Internet Explorer.''

<HEADLINE> Early Humans May Have Eaten Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ancestors of modern humans were more than  
tree-climbing plant-eaters, according to a new study. The ape-like 
creatures millions of years ago probably also caught and ate small 
animals -- even before the invention of stone tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who studied tooth enamel from the fossilized remains  
of hominids called Australopithecus africanus found the chemical 
signature of foods that grew on the open plains of South Africa, as 
well as in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that ``africanus was not just a tree dweller,'' said  
Matt Sponheimer, a researcher at Rutgers University in New 
Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study shows that this early human ancestor found its food  
both in the forest and in the open areas,'' said Sponheimer, 
co-author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies, based on bones in the jaw, arms, hands and  
feet, had suggested the species subsisted only on leaves and fruits 
plucked from forests -- rather like the diet of present-day 
chimpanzees, the nearest animal relative to modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sponheimer said the tooth chemistry study proves the species  
had a much more varied diet. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, up to 25 percent of their diet came from grass or  
grass-eating animals, said Sponheimer. ``For one specimen, it was 
50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study makes clear the early hominids were eating something  
different from what researchers had assumed, said John Kingston, a 
Yale University expert on early human-like species. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the things they could have been eating is meat, which is  
a fascinating possibility,'' Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study didn't conclusively determine if the species ate  
meat from grass-eating animals or merely the seeds and roots of 
grassland plants, which would give the same tooth-enamel signature, 
Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossils of the species have been found only in South Africa. It  
lived 2 million to 3 million years ago and resembles Lucy, the 
famed, nearly complete hominid skeleton found in Ethiopia in North 
Africa. Lucy, however, is slightly more ape-like and is identified 
as A. afarensis, an earlier human ancestral species. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanus was not much bigger than a chimpanzee, at about 4 feet  
and 90 pounds, but had a slightly larger brain. It walked on its 
hind legs, but some specimens suggest an opposing big toe rather 
like a tree-climbing ape, said Sponheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	This feature, along with teeth that resemble those of apes, have  
led other researchers to conclude the species lived in the trees 
and ate only plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, Sponheimer and co-author Julia A. Lee-Thorp of  
the University of Cape Town in South Africa extracted tiny bits of 
tooth enamel from the specimens and then analyzed the carbon 
isotope ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have a different  
number of neutrons. For instance, trees and bushes contain more 
carbon-13 than do grasses that grow in open areas. The isotopic 
ratios in the enamel reflect which of these plants the animals ate. 
Meat-eaters acquire the isotopic signatures of their prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect,'' said Sponheimer, ``you are what you eat.''  
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, if the species ate animals that fed on grasses,  
their tooth enamel would show the carbon-13 signature of grassland 
plants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The specimens analyzed had carbon-13 signatures between that of  
forest animals and plains-dwelling grass-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	That indicates the species ate foods from both the forests and  
the plains. It also suggests they fed on high-protein animal foods, 
perhaps insects or small mammals, that lived on grasses. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no evidence the species had stone tools, but it is  
possible the hominid killed small game with rocks or used twigs to 
gather insects, a technique observed among chimpanzees grazing on 
termites, Sponheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hominids that appeared later, such as Homo habilis, used stone  
weapons to kill larger mammals. It is thought this higher-protein 
food may have played a role in the evolution of the larger brain of 
modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sponheimer and Lee-Thorp write that ``the primary dietary  
difference between A. africanus and Homo may not have been the 
quality of their food, but their manner of procuring it.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Favors Internet Bookings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Saying it must offset rising costs for  
traditional booking methods, Delta Air Lines has added a $2 
surcharge to domestic round-trip bookings, except those made at its 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was criticized Tuesday by the American Society of  
Travel Agents, which accused Atlanta-based Delta of ``blaming and 
punishing the traveling public for purchasing their tickets through 
(non-Internet) channels they clearly prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta has essentially said, `Consumers are to blame for all of  
our escalating costs and, therefore, must pay,''' the group said in 
a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta apparently is the first carrier to impose the surcharge.  
Delta didn't make a public announcement, but informed travel agents 
in a message posted Monday over the computer reservations system. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said Wednesday it had no comment on the surcharge  
beyond what was in the message to travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The message said distribution costs have soared to more than $1  
billion in 1998. It said fees it pays to computer reservations 
systems that provide booking services to agents have risen 280 
percent since 1990, with more increases coming.

<HEADLINE> US Cos. Sued Over Saipan Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands come to the U.S. territory of  
Saipan from across Asia, lured by promises of good-paying jobs in 
garment factories and the possibility of a better life in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	What they get, one lawyer said, is ``America's worst  
sweatshop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed Wednesday claim that Saipan workers face  
beatings, forced abortions, vermin-infested quarters, barbed wire 
and armed guards -- all while making clothing tagged ``Made in the 
USA'' for retailers that include Wal-Mart, Sears, the Gap, Tommy 
Hilfiger and J. Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits seek more than $1 billion in damages for conditions  
lawyers say have persisted for the past decade in the 13-mile-long 
tropical isle in the Central Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first legal attempt to hold U.S. retailers accountable  
for the mistreatment of workers by subcontractors under the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, attorneys said 
at news conferences in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 people, mostly young women, have been recruited  
from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand with promises 
of good wages, only to wind up in sweatshops that ``would make 
medieval conditions look good,'' plaintiffs' attorney William 
Lerach said in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Two class-action lawsuits were filed on behalf of the workers in  
federal courts in Los Angeles and Saipan. Human rights groups -- 
Global Exchange, Sweatshop Watch and the Asian Law Caucus -- joined 
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees in 
filing suit in state court in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 18 companies named in the lawsuits, Nordstrom, Warnaco,  
Tommy Hilfiger, J.C. Penney, Wal-Mart, OshKosh B'Gosh, Cutter &AMP; 
Buck Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp. insist they hire subcontractors 
that strictly follow U.S. labor laws. Wal-Mart denied accepting 
merchandise from factories in Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies said they had no comment or did not return phone  
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuits, 32 factories force people to work up  
to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and threaten them with 
beatings and verbal abuse if they refuse unpaid overtime to meet 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Passports are confiscated, workers are not allowed to leave the  
factory compound and social activities are strictly monitored, 
Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many workers allegedly pay as much as $7,000 as a ``recruitment  
fee'' to go to Saipan, lured by recruiters who say they will be 
living an hour's train ride from Los Angeles, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saipan is part of the Northern Marianas, an island chain seized  
by U.S. troops from Japan in World War II that negotiated a 
commonwealth relationship with Washington. The deal left control of 
immigration and minimum wages in local hands, and exempted Saipan's 
exports from U.S. duties and quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies named in the lawsuits are Associated Merchandising  
Corp.; Cutter &AMP; Buck; Dayton-Hudson; Dress Barn; Gap; Gymboree 
Manufacturing; J. Crew; J.C. Penney Co. Inc.; Jones Apparel Group; 
Lane Bryant; The Limited; May Department Stores Co.; Nordstrom; 
OshKosh B'Gosh; Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co.; Tommy Hilfiger; Wal-Mart; and 
Warnaco.

<HEADLINE> Williams gets $12.75M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For baseball owners, today is the worst day of the year: the day  
players file for salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	A trio of New York Yankees stars -- Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte  
and Mariano Rivera -- are among the 71 players eligible to file. The 
group also includes Texas pitchers Rick Helling and Aaron Sele, 
Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson, Toronto first baseman Carlos 
Delgado and Houston closer Billy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the deadline, pitcher Woody Williams got a $12.75  
million, three-year contract from San Diego, Arizona catcher Kelly 
Stinnett agreed to a $1.75 million, two-year deal and Kansas City 
pitcher Scott Service agreed to a $720,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, first baseman Hal Morris returned to the Cincinnati Reds,  
agreeing to a $400,000, one-year contract, and the Houston Astros 
traded catcher Brad Ausmus and reliever C.J. Nitkowski back to the 
Detroit Tigers for five players: pitchers Dean Crow, Mark Persails 
and Brian Powell; catcher Paul Bako; and infielder Carlos 
Villalobos. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps us to replace players we've lost in our system due  
to other trades we have made, especially the Moises Alou and Randy 
Johnson deals, which were each three-for-one,'' Houston general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for arbitration, the New York Mets have the most eligible  
players with seven, among them shortstop Rey Ordonez, infielder 
Edgardo Alfonzo and pitchers Armando Benitez, Hideo Nomo and Turk 
Wendell. 
</P>
<P>
	Players and owners will exchange arbitration figures next  
Tuesday, with hearings to be scheduled from Feb. 1-21. Most players 
settle before hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners won five of eight cases last year and have a 227-179  
advantage since arbitration began in 1974. Teams dislike the 
process because it leads to huge increases for many players, even 
those who settle. Small-market owners complain the loudest, saying 
it forces them to pay salaries comparable to those of large-market 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81 players who filed last year got an average raise of 150  
percent, from an average of $774,323 to an average of $1,936,400, 
according to a study by The Associated Press. The average increase 
was just below the record 154 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, obtained by San Diego from Toronto during the winter  
meetings, was 10-9 with a 4.46 ERA last season and made $1,615,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Stinnett, who made $275,000 last year, agreed to a two-year  
contract that pays him $750,000 this year and $1 million in 2000. 
Service's one-year contract is an increase of $230,000 from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Players with three or more years of major league service but  
less than six are eligible to file, along with the top 17 percent 
of those with 2-3 years of service. Once a player has six years of 
major league service, he becomes eligible for free agency after his 
contract expires.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Has Fourth Quarter Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. posted a fourth-quarter  
profit after losing money in the period a year earlier, but the 
results fell short of Wall Street's expectations and its stock 
price tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kodak shares  
were down $7.93 3/4 at $70.75 -- a decline of about 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographic products company shored up an erosion in film  
sales in the United States but was hurt by a sharp downturn in 
copier sales and in sales in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	It earned $272 million, or 83 cents a diluted share, for the  
last three months of 1998 compared with a loss of $744 million, or 
$2.29 a diluted share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 6 percent to $3.56 billion from $3.78 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The performance came in below Wall Street forecasts. Excluding  
one-time restructuring and other charges, earnings totaled $1.05 a 
diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call had been expecting a 
$1.15 per share profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's core business of amateur film, photographic paper and  
cameras generates about half its profits, but sales were flat for 
the year in the United States and dipped 10 percent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kodak said it turned back advances in the United States  
by Fuji Photo Film Co., regaining market share it had lost to its 
Japanese nemesis. Kodak's share had fallen from around 70 percent 
to as low as 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Film sales were especially hard hit in emerging markets,  
plunging 78 percent in Russia, 23 percent in South Korea, 6 percent 
in China and 4 percent in Latin America -- or down 15 percent 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	After a moderately profitable year in office imaging, sales of  
copiers dropped precipitously in the fourth quarter. That led to a 
production slowdown, some 300 job cuts and a quarterly charge of 
$87 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After a slow start, sales of new-line Advantix cameras rose 80  
percent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak cut costs by $730 million in 1998, much of it to cover  
almost 20,000 job cuts through the end of this year that will trim 
the worldwide payroll by 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Kodak earned $1.39 billion, or $4.24 a diluted  
share, up from $5 million, or 1 cent a share, in 1997. Yearly sales 
fell 8 percent to $13.4 billion from $14.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Export Demand Boosts Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by unexpectedly strong 
soybean export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported this morning that  
soybean exports in the past week came in at 704,900 metric tons, 
well above market expectations for about 400,000 metric tons. Corn 
and wheat exports were within expectations, but prices bounced 
higher on the strength in soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices were expected to remain under pressure, however,  
from fears Brazil's currency devaluation will cause instability in 
the rest of Latin America, leading to increased selling of 
commodities there and fewer imports of American goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.75 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.06 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $5.36 a bushel.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Open Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening their impeachment case against  
President Clinton, House prosecutors told senators today they need 
trial witnesses to prove the president should be removed from 
office. They argued Clinton's defense defies ``evidence as well as 
common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before beginning their opening argument in Clinton's  
impeachment trial -- the first since 1868 -- the Republican House 
members filed a rebuttal brief that dismissed Clinton's earlier 
written arguments and tried to use them to bolster their own case 
for calling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that President Clinton's trial memorandum raises  
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live 
testimony subject to cross examination,'' the House prosecutors 
said. Senators won't decide whether to allow witnesses until after 
both sides make their opening arguments at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses the prosecutors are considering calling are  
the president and Monica Lewinsky, House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House fired back today that the House case is based on  
political revenge, not law. Press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Clinton would not testify. ``Any witness opens up this process to 
lengthy delays,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The press secretary charged that the House prosecutors have  
``consistently bent, changed, shifted the rules'' according to 
their political goals, have flip-flopped on matters such as the 
need for witnesses and have tried repeatedly to introduce 
``extraneous issues'' such as campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a freezing drizzle, 14 people had lined up outside the  
Capitol by midmorning for a chance to view at least a few minutes 
of the trial. The Senate set aside 50 seats in the gallery for the 
public, and those seats were to be rotated every 15 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. That 15 minutes better be great,'' said Al  
Sitterson, 32, who drove in from the Virginia suburbs to get in 
line at 5:20 a.m., dressed in heavy winter garb. He had hoped to 
end up with a ticket as a souvenir but was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wasn't expect to watch the trial proceedings,  
traveling instead across the Potomac to Alexandria, Va., for a 
crime prevention event before departing for a trip to New York to 
encourage Wall Street to invest more in minority interests. On 
Wednesday, he said he intended to work on the nation's business 
throughout the trial and trusted senators to do ``the right 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House rebuttal to the White House memorandum was submitted  
to the Senate just hours before the trial was to resume in the 
Senate. Clinton is accused of perjury before a grand jury and 
obstruction of justice in his efforts to conceal his affair with 
Ms. Lewinsky. Sixty-seven of the 100 senators must vote to convict 
him to oust him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting Clinton's argument that he did not lie in his  
testimony before a federal grand jury investigating his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the House managers reiterated their 
contention that ``a complete and impartial review of the evidence 
reveals that the president did in fact commit perjury before the 
grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton discounts substantial evidence as well as  
common sense when he maintains he testified truthfully,'' the House 
prosecutors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating a Clinton motion to dismiss the case early in the  
trial, the House prosecutors also argued that the Senate ``has 
never granted a motion to dismiss or strike an article of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and the rest of  
the House managers have discussed calling Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky 
but have made no final decisions, according to prosecution 
officials. Under Senate rules, Clinton is the only witness who 
could not be subpoenaed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers rejected a House request to interview her  
earlier this week.

behalf of the prosecution team would focus on ``laying out the case 
and showing very clearly that the president committed an 
impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and possibly Saturday.  
Clinton's lawyers will follow next week with their defense 
contending he is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of justice 
and that the charges, even if proved, do not rise to the level of 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have decided the trial will  
proceed as scheduled next Tuesday, even though Clinton will be 
delivering his State of the Union speech in the House chamber that

his defense during that day. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of the White House arguments, a trial brief

	Mrs. Willey is a former White House volunteer who contends  
Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in a room near the Oval 
Office in 1993. House managers are divided over attempting to call 
her, since the House did not use any evidence of her involvement 
with Clinton in building its impeachment case.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Open Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening their impeachment case against  
President Clinton, House prosecutors told senators today they need 
trial witnesses to prove the president should be removed from 
office. They argued Clinton's defense defies ``evidence as well as 
common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before beginning their opening argument in Clinton's  
impeachment trial -- the first since 1868 -- the Republican House 
members filed a rebuttal brief that dismissed Clinton's earlier 
written arguments and tried to use them to bolster their own case 
for calling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that President Clinton's trial memorandum raises  
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live 
testimony subject to cross examination,'' the House prosecutors 
said. Senators won't decide whether to allow witnesses until after 
both sides make their opening arguments at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses the prosecutors are considering calling are  
the president and Monica Lewinsky, House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House fired back today that the House case is based on  
political revenge, not law. Press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Clinton would not testify. ``Any witness opens up this process to 
lengthy delays,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The press secretary charged that the House prosecutors have  
``consistently bent, changed, shifted the rules'' according to 
their political goals, have flip-flopped on matters such as the 
need for witnesses and have tried repeatedly to introduce 
``extraneous issues'' such as campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a freezing drizzle, 14 people had lined up outside the  
Capitol by midmorning for a chance to view at least a few minutes 
of the trial. The Senate set aside 50 seats in the gallery for the 
public, and those seats were to be rotated every 15 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. That 15 minutes better be great,'' said Al  
Sitterson, 32, who drove in from the Virginia suburbs to get in 
line at 5:20 a.m., dressed in heavy winter garb. He had hoped to 
end up with a ticket as a souvenir but was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wasn't expect to watch the trial proceedings,  
traveling instead across the Potomac to Alexandria, Va., for a 
crime prevention event before departing for a trip to New York to 
encourage Wall Street to invest more in minority interests. On 
Wednesday, he said he intended to work on the nation's business 
throughout the trial and trusted senators to do ``the right 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House rebuttal to the White House memorandum was submitted  
to the Senate just hours before the trial was to resume in the 
Senate. Clinton is accused of perjury before a grand jury and 
obstruction of justice in his efforts to conceal his affair with 
Ms. Lewinsky. Sixty-seven of the 100 senators must vote to convict 
him to oust him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting Clinton's argument that he did not lie in his  
testimony before a federal grand jury investigating his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the House managers reiterated their 
contention that ``a complete and impartial review of the evidence 
reveals that the president did in fact commit perjury before the 
grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton discounts substantial evidence as well as  
common sense when he maintains he testified truthfully,'' the House 
prosecutors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating a Clinton motion to dismiss the case early in the  
trial, the House prosecutors also argued that the Senate ``has 
never granted a motion to dismiss or strike an article of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and the rest of  
the House managers have discussed calling Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky 
but have made no final decisions, according to prosecution 
officials. Under Senate rules, Clinton is the only witness who 
could not be subpoenaed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers rejected a House request to interview her  
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said his opening statement on  
behalf of the prosecution team would focus on ``laying out the case 
and showing very clearly that the president committed an 
impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and possibly Saturday.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Scandal Affects USOC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A scheme to gather information on IOC members  
for Salt Lake City's Olympic bidders has cost a top-level U.S 
Olympic Committee official his job, Olympic sources told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredo La Mont, the USOC's senior director of international  
relations, was the middleman in efforts by Salt Lake bid chief Tom 
Welch to buy intelligence about IOC members in Latin America, the 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont is the first USOC official to be linked to the growing  
scandal involving alleged bribes of International Olympic Committee 
members in an attempt to win votes in Salt Lake's successful bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A USOC statement said La Mont stepped down after informing the  
committee ``of a previously undisclosed business relationship with 
the Salt Lake Olympic (Bid) Committee through the office of former 
SLOC president Tom Welch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded that Mr. La Mont's activities, which he indicated  
he pursued independent of his USOC responsibilities, nonetheless 
constituted a conflict of interest,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not provide details.  
</P>
<P>
	But sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said La  
Mont had ``passed money -- not a lot -- a couple of grand a month'' 
to third parties in return for ``intelligence information on IOC 
members in Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said La Mont also sent food and dairy products, including  
the diet supplement Ensure, to contacts in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach La Mont by telephone Thursday night were  
unsuccessful. He did not return messages left on his answering 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages also were not returned by Welch, USOC president  
Bill Hybl and spokesman Mike Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Schultz, the USOC's executive director who issued the  
statement on La Mont, said he could not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, the USOC learned of the connection  
when La Mont went to Schultz earlier this month after being 
contacted by Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew everyone was being watched,'' one source said.  
</P>
<P>
	The sources also said that La Mont apparently did the work from  
his Colorado Springs, Colo., home, but that the committee was 
checking the hard drive of his office computer to see if any action 
was taken on USOC property. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said they did not know how long the operation had  
lasted, but believed it started in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has been with the USOC since the late 1980s. Salt Lake  
won the 2002 Games in 1995, on its fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Schultz said information on the La Mont-Welch  
relationship has been given to two panels investigating the bribery 
scandal -- the USOC Special Commission chaired by former Sen. George 
Mitchell and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those inquiries, as well as ones representing the IOC and SLOC,  
are looking into possible influencing of IOC members in exchange 
for votes backing Salt Lake's candidacy for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont's alleged association with Welch is expected to become a  
part of the Justice Department investigation, according to the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members face possible expulsion for ``serious''  
offenses in the Salt Lake scandal, and four others face minor 
charges, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Thursday in an 
interview with The Associated Press. Samaranch didn't identify the 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned in 1997 as head of the Salt Lake organizers  
amid allegations of spouse abuse, has said he used a privately 
funded program to pay for favors of IOC members. He said this was 
common practice in the Olympic bids.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Create Internet Watchdog Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading global companies in technology, media  
and finance on Thursday joined forces to promote their stance on 
Internet issues, including opposition to tough online privacy laws 
and taxes on Internet purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, called the Global Business Dialogue on E-Commerce,  
plans to present suggestions on policy to governments around the 
world as well as send a general message against government 
regulation of the exploding medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by 24 companies including IBM, America Online and German  
publisher Bertelsmann, group members said they would speak in 
coming weeks with European Community officials against a new 
European privacy measure that would make it tougher for companies 
to transmit personal data about their customers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some firms doing business in Europe fear the directive could bar  
them from using customers' confidential information for everything 
from financial transactions to junk mail, stifling business 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take action now,'' said Thomas Middelhoff, chairman  
and chief executive of Bertelsmann AG, the German publishing 
conglomerate whose U.S. headquarters in New York housed a press 
conference launching the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's formation follows the success of U.S. firms in  
lobbying the U.S. government on issues important to the high-tech 
industry, which this year won a temporary ban on Internet taxes and 
new copyright protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is ``now big enough to matter,'' said Steve Case,  
chairman of America Online Inc., the nation's largest online 
service and Internet access provider. ``It's still young enough and 
small enough to be shaped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While members said they represented a broad cross-section of  
industry opinion, software titan Microsoft, the largest Internet 
player, is not a member. They said Microsoft did not seek to join. 
A Microsoft spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other executives in the group include IBM chairman Louis  
Gerstner, Time Warner Inc. chairman Gerald Levin and Netscape 
Communications Corp. chief executive James Barksdale. Also included 
are executives from Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and 
NEC, Finland's Nokia, France Telecom and British retailer Marks &AMP; 
Spencer.

<HEADLINE> Russia Combats Political Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Cabinet on Thursday approved a draft  
bill that would outlaw statements that fuel ethnic strife or call 
for the violent overthrow of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill follows a series of anti-Semitic remarks by Communist  
Party members that caused an uproar in Russia and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told the Cabinet that  
anti-Semitic statements, as well as those directed at other ethnic 
groups, must ``not be only condemned by society, but be punishable 
by law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Political extremism must be absolutely excluded from political  
life, as it undermines society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said the new bill seeks to  
make political parties responsible for members who make extremist 
statements. A party must either disavow such statements made by 
members, or face an official ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the Communist Party was slow to condemn anti-Semitic  
statements by Albert Makashov, a member of parliament. It did so 
only grudgingly, following a wave of protests in Russia and abroad. 
A few weeks later, another Communist lawmaker made similar 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Russian law is vague on the issue, and authorities  
have taken no legal action against the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill must be approved by President Boris Yeltsin before  
being sent to parliament. The Communist-dominated lower house, the 
State Duma, is expected to oppose the bill in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Thursday that the  
president plans to chair a session of his Security Council later 
this month to consider ways to battle political extremism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, this issue remains on the agenda,'' Yakushkin  
said on Echo Moscow radio.

<HEADLINE> Kubiak Latest Coach at Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett and Joe Tiller apparently  
were out and Gary Kubiak was in as the Colorado coaching carousel 
continued spinning out of control on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's search for a football coach to replace Rick  
Neuheisel, who left Colorado for Washington on Saturday, moved at a 
dizzying pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak, the Denver Broncos' offensive coordinator, appeared to  
be the latest front-runner, even though the Broncos haven't given 
permission for the university to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Other coaches whose names have surfaced as candidates for the  
job include Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, LSU 
coach Gerry DiNardo, Texas Christian's Dennis Franchione, Oklahoma 
State's Bob Simmons, Air Force's Fisher DeBerry, Northern 
Colorado's Joe Glenn, Arvada West High School coach Dave Logan and 
five current Colorado assistants -- A.J. Christoff, Karl Dorrell, 
Jon Embree, Brian Cabral and Tom Cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the names we've gone through is amazing,'' Buffaloes  
offensive lineman Brad Bedell said. ``I'm waiting to see when Vince 
Lombardi's comes up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, word was that Barnett, who guided Northwestern to  
a Rose Bowl appearance in 1995, would sign with the Buffaloes 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barnett and Colorado officials couldn't reach agreement on  
financial terms, and suddenly Tiller, the former Wyoming coach who 
has led Purdue to a two-year record of 18-7, was the leading 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, Tiller said he was not a candidate at  
Colorado or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how these rumors get started,'' Tiller said.  
``There's nothing to this ... just like there was nothing to it 
last week about the Washington job. The contract extension Purdue 
has offered me puts to rest any rumors about our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett has nine years left on an 11-year, $5 million contract  
he signed with Northwestern in 1996. Last month, Tiller signed a 
two-year extension worth an estimated $450,000 annually through 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were believed to have hefty buyout clauses in their  
contracts, which may have been the major stumbling block in luring 
them to Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak's name surfaced on Thursday as the Broncos continued  
preparations for Sunday's AFC championship game against the New 
York Jets. SportsFan Radio Network reported that Kubiak would be 
Colorado's new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Dick (Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp)  
earlier in the week, and we are aware of the interest that the 
University of Colorado has in Gary Kubiak,'' Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan said. ``But there has been no contact between Gary and CU, 
and certainly no offers or agreements have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will grant permission for CU to talk with Gary after this  
Sunday's game, regardless of the outcome. Our entire focus at this 
time is on the New York Jets and in winning the AFC championships, 
and nothing else will occur until this game has been played. Right 
now, there's nothing going on, only speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he didn't know if Kubiak remained one of the  
leading candidates for the head job with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a chance to talk to him one time,'' he said, ``but  
they can't do anything until after our season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he planned to submit his own name for the Colorado job  
since everyone else seems to, Shanahan said with a laugh, ``After 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffs quarterback Mike Moschetti said he would welcome Kubiak as  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been around a long time,'' he said. ``He's a great coach.  
He's got a lot of rings. If he is named coach, hopefully he can 
come over here and get us a ring, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp, who returned to the Boulder campus after conducting a  
series of interviews with candidates during a coaching convention 
at Nashville, Tenn., said in a statement that he has ``spoken to a 
number of candidates over the last five days'' and the university 
remains committed ``to a time line of seven to 10 days to complete 
this search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp has indicated an urgency since national letter-of-intent  
signing day is Feb. 3.

<HEADLINE> Sony Open Offers Mixed Bag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Tommy Tolles made good use of his hard-earned  
PGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	Tolles, who shot a 7-under-par 63 Thursday for a 2-stroke lead  
at the Sony Open, had to scramble in the final full-field event 
last year to avoid going back to qualifying school. He promises it 
won't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Notah Begay III, making only his second PGA Tour start, had to  
overcome some anxiety and rookie jitters to share second place with 
Esteban Toledo, who insisted he would quit on the spot if he won a 
tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	In explaining his 1998 predicament, Tolles said, ``I played a  
lot more than I wanted last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But since assuring himself of being a tour regular this year,  
Tolles took some time off to reassess his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel mentally fresh,'' said Tolles, who was among the top  
money-winners the two previous years. ``My finish at Disney (site 
of the National Car Rental Classic) was a good way to end the year. 
Those two months off after Disney were great for me in regards to 
getting my mind back in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After seven birdies on his first 14 holes at the inaugural Sony  
Open, Tolles double-bogeyed the 459-yard, par-4 No. 6 when he had 
to take a drop after knocking his shot against a fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed the miscue with two of his longest birdie putts,  
from 25 and 20 feet, to distance himself from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Begay, who had to take a back seat to Tiger Woods  
while at Stanford, was just relieved to get the first start of 1999 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get the nerves and anxiety out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Begay was 4-under through 12, bogeyed Nos. 13 and 14, then  
birdied the last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 14, I just wanted to get pars and stop the bleeding,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo, one of the few afternoon starters to conquer the windy  
course, provided the most startling quote of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a dream to play on the PGA Tour. To be able  
to play with the best in the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the day I win, I'll quit and go back to be with my family.  
My wife is pregnant and I've dedicated a lot of time to be with my 
wife and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't envision myself as a golfer and a lot of people don't  
believe I can win on the tour. But I think I can. I want to prove 
it. It's my high dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masters and British Open winner Mark O'Meara Joe Durant, Peter  
Jacobsen and Ty Armstrong, all late starters who had to battle 
strong gusts, joined Bob Burns, Fred Funk and Craig Barlow at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Championship winner Vijay Singh was among those another  
stroke behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those skipping the Tour's first full-field event were  
Woods and last year's leading money-winner, David Duval, who 
started the 1999 schedule with a victory last week at the Mercedes 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston, whose tour-record 28-under score a year ago prompted  
changes on the 7,060-yard oceanside course, topped the group at 68. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the course, it had a dramatic makeover after Huston  
demolished the Tour record for 72 holes with a 260 a year ago in 
the Hawaiian Open finale. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes at Waialae were reflected in the scores. After the  
first round of the last year, only 26 of the 144 players were over 
par. This time around, 98 were over par.

<P>
	O'Meara said the changes made the course tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more demanding,'' he said. ``It's windy, too, so  
it's testy out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To which Toledo added, ``You're not going to see another  
28-under. The course is very difficult. It's not very long, but 
with the wind, it plays a lot longer.''

<HEADLINE> Historic Impeachment Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening their case in the first presidential  
impeachment trial since 1868, House prosecutors told senators today 
that President Clinton had committed ``egregious and criminal'' 
acts in concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky and should be 
removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton  
decided to put himself above the law -- not once, not twice but 
repeatedly,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said in making 
the opening argument for the 13 Republican prosecutors who seek to 
oust the 42nd president on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Making a case before a silent jury of 100 senators,  
Sensenbrenner said a conviction of Clinton -- requiring two-thirds 
of the senators -- would send a message to all future presidents and 
public servants that lying under oath will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing from the Senate lectern in front of Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist, Sensenbrenner said of Clinton: ``He has not 
owned up to the false testimony, the stonewalling and legal 
hairsplitting and obstructing the courts from finding the truth. In 
doing so, he has turned his affair into a public wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president engaged in a conspiracy of crimes to prevent  
justice from being served. These are impeachable offenses for which 
the president should be convicted,'' Sensenbrenner said in an 
hour-long presentation void of dramatic expression or the theatrics 
of many courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was away from the trial, traveling across the  
Potomac to Alexandria, Va., for a crime prevention event before 
departing for a trip to New York to encourage Wall Street to invest 
more in minority interests. On Wednesday, he had said he trusted 
senators to do ``the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today the House case is based on political  
revenge, not law and that Clinton would not testify as some House 
prosecutors have suggested he should. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' Press Secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor,  
said the House had impeached Clinton simply because he had violated 
his oath to tell the truth and uphold the laws of the nation. The 
prosecutors wove into their arguments allusions to historical 
figures, from Thomas More to Theodore Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
	``You are seated in this historic chamber not to embark on some  
great legislative debate ... but to listen to the evidence as those 
who must sit in judgment,'' Hyde said in an introduction of the 
House prosecution team. ``These managers will explain how egregious 
and criminal the conduct alleged in the articles of impeachment 
is,'' Hyde promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, the case you will consider is about those two  
words -- 'I do,''' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House prosecutor turned to modern technology -- not  
available when President Andrew Johnson was tried in 1868 and 
escaped conviction by a single senator's vote -- to bolster the 
case. Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., showed a videotape of Clinton 
swearing to ``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution'' when 
he took the oath of office as president in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team frequently argued that the grand jury  
testimony of Ms. Lewinsky -- some displayed on charts -- supported 
their case. At one point after extensive use of the former intern's 
testimony, Bryant renewed the prosecutors' request for a right to 
call witnesses during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can speak for all us, out of a sense of fairness,  
and again request that we and the president be permitted to call 
witnesses,'' Bryant pleaded. ``I would submit that the state of the 
evidence is such that unless and until the president has the 
opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses like Ms. 
Lewinsky -- and himself to testify if he desires -- there could not 
be any doubt of his guilt on the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators won't make a decision on witnesses until after opening  
arguments end next week. Prosecutors have identified Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and possibly even Clinton as 
possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after the 100 senators were sworn in as jurors,  
Rehnquist banged the proceeding back to order. ``The Senate will 
convene as a court of impeachment,'' he intoned at 1:04 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, the Senate chaplain, offered a brief  
prayer that the senators would engage in ``nonpartisan 
patriotism.'' The prosecutors then were given the floor to make 
their case that Clinton's offenses were high crimes and 
misdemeanors requiring his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former federal prosecutor, told  
senators it was a ``humbling experience'' to argue for the removal 
of the president. He used a series of charts to review the familiar 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton had ``crossed the line'' and coached the  
testimony of his secretary, sought to encourage Ms. Lewinsky to 
file a false affidavit by helping her find a job and tried to hide 
gifts he had given the former intern. ``Obstruction of justice is a 
serious threat to the integrity of our nation when committed by the 
chief executive of our land,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting White House arguments that the offenses did not meet  
the constitutional standards for removing a president, 
Sensenbrenner noted that the Founding Fathers explicitly considered 
bribery as an impeachable offense and that perjury carries an 
identical penalty under statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery. ... It follows that  
perjury ... be considered among the high crimes and misdemeanors 
the framers intended to be grounds for impeachment,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators sat quietly at their polished wooden desks, barred  
by trial rules from speaking in the chamber where they ordinarily 
debate. A few House members were seated at the rear of the chamber, 
and the public galleries were full. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's seven-member legal team, led by White House  
Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, were seated a few feet to the side of 
the lectern where House Republicans made their case. 
</P>
<P>
	In an impeachment drama dominated by partisan struggle, the two  
sides made an effort today to display bipartisanship. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans shook hands with Ruff. Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., greeted Hyde, R-Ill., with a hearty ``Mr. 
Chairman -- How are you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers entering the Senate from its main entrance were  
greeted by the blinding flashes of three dozen cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	In a freezing drizzle, people lined up outside the Capitol for a  
chance to view at least a few minutes of the trial. The Senate set 
aside 50 seats in the gallery for the public, and those seats were 
to be rotated every 15 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. That 15 minutes better be great,'' said Al  
Sitterson, 32, who drove in from the Virginia suburbs to get in 
line at 5:20 a.m., dressed in heavy winter garb. He had hoped to 
end up with a ticket as a souvenir but was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and Saturday. Clinton's  
lawyers will follow next week with their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have decided the trial will  
proceed as scheduled next Tuesday, even though Clinton will be 
delivering his State of the Union speech in the House chamber that 
night. The president's attorneys are expected to begin presenting 
his defense during that day.

<HEADLINE> Dow Dips 12 But Nasdaq Gains 19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened mixed. The Dow Jones  
Industrial Average is down 12 points in today's early going. 
Advancers and decliners are evenly split on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 19 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street looks to recover more of yesterday's selloff, with  
overseas markets having done the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say while Brazil's troubles are real, in the long  
run U.S. companies will be able to weather the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The major market averages on Wall Street managed impressive  
recoveries from yesterday's early whitewashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian markets appeared to pay little mind to the Brazilian  
currency devaluation, and European stocks are largely higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, there is earnings news to be digested.  
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer and Motorola have reported better-than-expected  
results. But Advanced Micro Devices and Kodak have failed to live 
up to expectations.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Organizers Target IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers may put pressure on  
the International Olympic Committee to cough up more money and 
expect less pampering during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the possibility of changing the contract will be broached when 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch visits in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can adjust some of the expenses. One of them  
might be a reduction of protocol expenses, in the fancy treatment 
of the Olympic community,'' Garff told the Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bullock, a member of SLOC, said he has tallied up $10  
million worth of IOC expenses that SLOC has agreed to pay and which 
he considers extravagances ``that would turn your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference Thursday afternoon, IOC member Anita  
DeFrantz deflected questions about whether the IOC would 
renegotiate the contract to protect Salt Lake in the event of a 
scandal-caused revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC believes that the money will be raised for these  
games,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she bristled at the suggestion IOC members will be getting  
perks in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not assume the IOC is on the take. We provide a lot of  
money to organizing committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, also a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
spoke to reporters from around the world who came for a SLOC 
meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled 
pending completion by Feb. 11 of an outside ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was adamant on two counts: that Samaranch should remain  
at the helm of the IOC and that Salt Lake will keep the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the hour, I have spoken with President Samaranch. He  
was very clear. We are 100 percent behind the Games being here,'' 
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC expenses that Bullock questions in SLOC's $1.45  
billion budget are $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 
suite for Samaranch and $30,000 in lobby decorations; a $1.1 
million transportation system including chauffeurs; $650,000 in 
breakfasts; and $16,000 for trailers at outdoor events so IOC 
members won't have to sit in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Olympics are about. You're taking money  
to put into the day care of these individuals that could be put 
into venues, athletes or community programs,'' Bullock told the 
Deseret News. ``It shows how out of whack the priorities have 
become.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a renegotiation of the deal. Bullock did not  
return calls to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz defended one of the expenses for IOC: chauffeured cars.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need drivers because we don't know the community. They're  
drivers, not chauffeurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the press conference, Garff said only that he knew no  
details about the IOC expenses and that in almost daily 
conversations, SLOC, IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee officials ``are 
always fine-tuning our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps suggested by some Salt Lake leaders is to use a  
clause of the contract to pressure the IOC to share more of its 
sponsorship revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause exempts the IOC from responsibility for the cost of  
the Games, except in the instance of ``willful misconduct or gross 
negligence by the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake, IOC and USOC organizers are scurrying to shore up  
sponsor support in the wake of revelations that Salt Lake bid 
executives gave lavish gifts and cash payments to IOC members 
before the 1995 vote giving Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt has already called on the IOC to help should  
Salt Lake lose sponsor money -- the biggest source of Olympic 
funding -- because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	No sponsors have said they'll back out, but organizers worry  
about lining up new sponsors. The 2002 Games still need $250 
million from sponsors to meet the $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC receives money from product sales, international  
sponsorships and sale of broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said Thursday the SLOC believes it can still meet its  
revenue target, since sponsors are holding tight and IOC appears 
poised to oust any members found culpable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, the investigation should not end there. ``We  
would like the process to look into other cities, other nations so 
that the evil is rooted out.''

<HEADLINE> Gore To Commit Funds for NY Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore committed the  
Clinton administration to dredging soil and silt in the Port of New 
York and New Jersey to keep one of the nation's largest ports from 
losing business to harbors with deeper water. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will include $60 million in next year's  
budget to deepen a channel in New York Harbor from 40 to 45 feet. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey signed an agreement that commits the federal 
government to paying $550 million to dredge the port through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the great trading crossroads of the world,''  
Gore said Wednesday of the nation's third-largest container port. 
But, he conceded, ``the port's not deep enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government has recently begun spending more money to deepen  
U.S. ports up and down both coasts to allow them to handle a new 
generation of huge cargo ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships, called post-Panamax vessels because they are too wide  
to fit through the Panama Canal, can handle twice the cargo of 
current container ships but need deeper water to dock fully loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	The dredging is scheduled to begin this April. The silt and  
soil, some of it contaminated, will be moved to a site six miles 
off the coast and covered by rocks to create an artificial reef.

<HEADLINE> Fire Hits N.Y. Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCRIBA, N.Y. (AP) -- A fire erupted Thursday near the electric  
turbine at the James FitzPatrick nuclear power plant near Oswego, 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said the fire was under control  
shortly after it started, but wasn't completely extinguished as of 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believed the fire was out early Thursday afternoon  
because hydrogen burns so cleanly, they couldn't see the flames, 
Sheehan said. But they discovered the fire was still going as they 
advanced toward it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said officials thought the fire would eventually burn  
itself out, but kept water on it to make sure it didn't spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is owned by the New York Power Authority. The  
762-megawatt plant began operation in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC spokesman Joe Gilliland said the fire began in an area of  
hydrogen tanks near the plant's electric turbine generator shortly 
before 1 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no danger to the reactor building,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters from local areas helped control the fire. The power  
plant continued to operate at full power during the fire, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One fireman was injured when he was struck in the leg by a hose  
and a plant worker was slightly burned, said Woody Berzins, a 
spokesman for the New York Power Authority, the plant's operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliland said there are no plans to order the plant to shut  
down, although NRC response teams are monitoring the incident. NRC 
resident inspectors were on the site, he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Appeals Judge's Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. appealed a federal judge's  
ruling that ordered the software giant to rewrite parts of its 
Windows 98 operating system, calling it overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte ordered Microsoft in November  
to change Internet Explorer 4.0 and other software incorporating 
the Java programming language -- including Windows 98 -- or stop 
shipping the products within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by Palo Alto-based  
Sun Microsystems Inc., which claimed Microsoft designed a 
Windows-only form of Java that is incompatible with rival software. 
Sun has tried to promote its form of Java as a universal 
programming language that can be used with any software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft filed papers Wednesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals, accusing Whyte of wrongly ruling that compatibility 
requirements Sun had imposed on Microsoft's Java limited how 
Microsoft could distribute Sun's technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte ``abandoned (his) role by ignoring the plain language of  
the agreement,'' Microsoft's lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company also said Whyte's order was so  
broad that it restrains Microsoft from distributing other 
unspecified products that make no use of Sun's copyright material. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun is effectively given control over future Microsoft  
products in which it has no intellectual property rights,'' 
Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun said Whyte had ruled correctly.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to maximize compatibility and minimize switching  
costs is a central value of the Java platform -- millions of 
developers and users rely on that value,'' Sun said in a statement 
Thursday. ``They would be best served if Microsoft would come back 
into compliance with the Java specifications.''

<HEADLINE> Gilbert, Enquirer Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Melissa Gilbert's four-year battle against  
the National Enquirer is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The former ``Little House on the Prairie'' actress and the  
tabloid have reached an agreement that means she will drop her 
libel suit over a story in which her ex-husband, Bo Brinkman, 
called her a ``deadbeat mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a no-fault divorce,'' said the Enquirer's editor in  
chief, Steve Coz. ``We're no longer making accusations against each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Gilbert filed the suit in 1995, but it was dismissed a year  
later by a judge who said the Enquirer had quoted Brinkman 
accurately and could not be sued for neutral reporting on a subject 
of public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Gilbert appealed and the 2nd District Court of Appeal  
reversed the decision, saying the level of public interest didn't 
mean that the actress could not seek damages.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dive: Dow Ends Down 228.63 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were pummeled for the second day in a row  
Thursday, as continued economic turmoil in Brazil raised new fears 
among investors that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin 
America could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.63 to 9,120.93. The  
Dow deepened Wednesday's 125-point loss and put it 60 points below 
where it began the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 22.21 to 1,212.19, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 39.99 to 2,276.82. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline started in the morning and accelerated later on,  
after a second key banking official in Brazil resigned, sending 
Brazil's main stock index sharply lower for the second day in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Latin America's  
largest, was halted for 30 minutes after a 10 percent plunge, 
following a 5 percent drop Wednesday. The leading stock index in 
Brazil ended Thursday off 9.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil started a worldwide market decline on Wednesday after its  
central bank chief resigned and his successor devalued the 
Brazilian currency by about 8 percent. On Thursday the Central 
Bank's director of the banking industry resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors are not so much concerned with Brazil, which by  
itself takes up only 2 percent of U.S. exports. But Brazil is the 
biggest and most important economy in Latin America, which accounts 
for 20 percent of U.S. exports. The real fear is that its problems 
will spread throughout Latin America and specifically to Mexico, a 
major trading partner with the United States. Mexico's main stock 
index, however, ended higher on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also concerns about how Brazil would affect the  
dollar. The dollar actually was stable against the Brazilian 
currency -- the real -- Thursday and firmer against European 
currencies and the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But, if an economic downturn in Latin America spreads to the  
United States and causes the dollar to fall, that could cause a 
rout on Wall Street that could make last summer's dizzying drop 
tied to problems in Asia and Russia look like a cakewalk, said 
Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. dollar can be threatened, and if the U.S. dollar goes  
down, people can pull their money out of U.S. stocks and bonds,'' 
Canelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders were also mindful of the impeachment trial  
involving President Clinton. Analysts said some may have used the 
trial as an excuse to take profits, but they were hesitant to blame 
the trial for the day's big decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks were led lower by issues of consumer companies,  
whose earnings rely heavily on exports to Brazil and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Among consumer issues taking big hits were Dow components Philip  
Morris fell 1 3/16 to 53, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 2 13/16 to 85 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were also hurt by Eastman Kodak, which Thursday  
morning reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. Kodak's 
shares fell 8 3/16 to 70 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of industrial and financial companies fell as well.  
Citigroup, which has lent heavily in Brazil and throughout Latin 
America, fell 1 5/16 to 50 7/8. General Motors fell 11/16 to 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pretty much ignored a Commerce Department report that  
retail sales rose a strong 0.9 percent in December, pushing the 
gain for last year to 5.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales increases proved non-inflationary, as consumer prices  
rose a moderate 1.6 percent last year, up 0.1 percent in December 
alone. Inflation was restrained by a big 8.8 percent drop in energy 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. NYSE volume totaled 952.97 
million shares as of 4 p.m. EST, down from the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index closed at 581.07, down 9.65, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index closed at 698.16, down 
1.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies closed at 420.10,  
down 4.76. 
</P>
<P>
	World markets ended mixed. The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo gained  
2.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 5.16 percent, the FT-SE 100  
in London fell 0.51 percent, but the Paris CAC index was up 0.97 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against other major  
currencies Thursday as worries about Brazil's faltering economy 
sent U.S. stocks plunging. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency fell against the euro, the new single currency  
of 11 European nations, in reaction to the drop on Wall Street, 
where investors worried that the turmoil in Brazil would spread 
throughout Latin America. Stocks were also hurt by worries about 
U.S. corporate profits after Eastman Kodak reported fourth-quarter 
results well below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose slightly against the yen, however, as traders  
feared Japanese authorities would again enter the market to support 
the dollar if it resumed its recent slide. The Japanese central 
bank on Tuesday bought dollars on the open market to stem the yen's 
rise, which hurts Japanese exporting companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1710, up  
from $1.1666 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 113.61 
Japanese yen, up from 113.33. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the dollar fell to 1.3583 Swiss francs from 1.3681  
and rose to 1.5333 Canadian dollars from 1.5210. The British pound 
rose to $1.6567 from $1.6472. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6703 German 
marks, down from 1.6764; 5.6022 French francs, down from 5.6243; 
and 1,652.89 Italian lire, down from 1,661.13.

<HEADLINE> Patient in Kevorkian Flap Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETOSKEY, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Gerald Klooster, an Alzheimer's  
victim who became the subject of a custody dispute after his wife 
was accused of trying to arrange for him to commit suicide with Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian's help, has died at 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Klooster died Wednesday in Castro Valley, Calif., apparently of  
natural causes, the Alameda County coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Klooster's son Dr. Gerald ``Chip'' Klooster II brought  
his father to Petoskey and filed for custody. He said his mother, 
Ruth Klooster, was trying to arrange for Kevorkian to help Klooster 
commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klooster acknowledged having talked to Kevorkian by phone  
but said no visit had been scheduled and denied ever trying to help 
her husband end his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The family battled for months in court, and judges in Petoskey  
and California reached opposing decisions. A settlement finally was 
reached under which Klooster was returned to California to live 
with his wife in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, Klooster was found unconscious in his home  
from an overdose of alcohol and barbiturates. His son suggested his 
mother had given Klooster the cocktail. Mrs. Klooster denied that. 
Afterward, a judge ordered that a nurse live with the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Klooster said he feels ``a real peace'' that his father  
apparently died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that God did not want to have his life taken at the  
hand of another man,'' he said. ``God was going to take him when he 
saw fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his family, he said: ``It's very sad to see the family  
had to be divided over the whole euthanasia movement. I still love 
and care for my family, and I hope that in the long run these 
issues can be dealt with, and that people in the family can forgive 
and forget. That would be what my father wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Economic Committee Buys Selig Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- By establishing yet another economic  
study committee, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has given himself 
time to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	He can tell hard-liners, who want a massive change in the  
collective bargaining agreement, that the committee is working hard 
to come up with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	To those afraid of another long industry shutdown in 2002, he  
can say no actions have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we can take another work stoppage,'' Selig  
said after announcing the ``Blue Ribbon Task Force on Baseball 
Economics'' on Wednesday night. ``We need different ways to solve 
our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many baseball owners are looking enviously at the NBA, which got  
its players to agree last week to salary maximums: $9 million for 
players with 1-5 years of experience, $11 million for players with 
6-9 years and $14 million for players with 10 years of more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think each situation is unique,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the  
owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the NBA's Phoenix Suns. ``But 
I think it's useful to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources familiar with the committee, speaking on the  
condition they not be identified, said Selig formed the panel to 
appease those owners calling for change in the wake of Kevin 
Brown's $105 million, seven-year contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, which made him baseball's first $100 million player. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig can either listen to the panel's recommendations and use  
them as a basis for bargaining proposals following the 2001 season, 
or ignore them, claiming they would provoke baseball players, who 
have the most powerful union in sports, one that has given few 
concessions during eight work stoppages since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association has repeatedly made it clear that it  
won't accept a team salary cap or individual payroll maximums in 
any shape or form the owners can conceive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt baseball owners would prefer to have the NBA  
deal,'' Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players' association, 
said Thursday. ``But they have to understand there is a particular 
history there and there is a particular environment in this 
industry. It's just not in the cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four outsiders picked for the panel all have ties to  
baseball management: 
</P>
<P>
	-- George Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader from 1989-94 and  
current head of a panel investigating alleged bribes involving the 
awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City, was 
mentioned five years ago as a possible candidate for commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve board from  
August 1979-August 1987, was head of the independent study panel 
appointed jointly by owners and the union following the 1990 spring 
training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yale president Richard Levin, an economics professor, came up  
with baseball's original salary cap proposal during collective 
bargaining following the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Television commentator George Will, an author of two baseball  
books, is on the boards of the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	While the last study committee was a joint endeavor with the  
union, this one is unilateral. The independent members will be 
joined by Selig, the chairman, vice chairs John Harrington of the 
Boston Red Sox and Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, and 11 
other team officials: Bill DeWitt (St. Louis), Dick Jacobs 
(Cleveland), Larry Lucchino (San Diego), Andy MacPhail (Chicago 
Cubs), John McHale (Detroit), Kevin McClatchy (Pittsburgh), Dave 
Montgomery (Philadelphia), Vince Naimoli (Tamp Bay), Tom Schieffer 
(Texas) and Tony Tavares and Sandy Litvack (Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
	Notably missing are representatives from many of baseball's  
biggest spenders: Baltimore, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The last study commission issued a majority report in 1994  
written by Volcker; then-Rockefeller Foundation chairman Peter 
Goldmark; and David Feller, a law professor at the University of 
California. They recommended the elimination of salary arbitration 
and lowering the service time needed for free agency to three years 
from six, but didn't propose a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	It also recommended owners start sharing ticket receipts and  
local broadcast money, a step that began in 1996 under a plan that 
won't go into full effect until 2000.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Famine Hits Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- A drought covering much of southern  
Somalia has left streams and shallow water wells dry, creating food 
shortages and endangering thousands of people, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Khadija Ahmed Abukar, a World Health Organization official, said  
more than 700,000 Somalis were affected by food shortages in the 
south of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including two children, apparently died Wednesday  
from thirst and hunger after arriving in Huddor, where drought and 
famine are widespread, Sheik Aden Modobeh told reporters in an 
interview conducted over a high frequency radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Modobeh said he had reports that four or five people were dying  
daily in some villages surrounding Huddor, about 185 miles 
northwest of Mogadishu, due to hunger, thirst and related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports reaching Mogadishu say outbreaks of measles and  
cholera are occurring in most of southern Somalia, including the 
Indian Ocean port of Kismayo, 300 miles south of Mogadishu. Dr. 
Faysal Abdulkadir said 70 people have been diagnosed with cholera 
and have been quarantined. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the suffering, international aid agencies appear  
reluctant to resume work in southern Somalia since the abduction of 
10 International Committee of the Red Cross workers in April. They 
were later freed unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 12, authorities in southern Somalia said famine had  
killed 25 people, mostly children, in the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the Middle Juba region, 250 miles southwest of  
Mogadishu, said that flooding, followed by drought, had destroyed 
more than two-thirds of the season's harvest. The floods also 
attracted malaria-carrying mosquitoes and destroyed clean water 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 percent of the region's children were suffering  
from hunger, malaria, diarrhea and tuberculosis, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Somalia has had no central government since dictator Mohamed  
Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 by clan leaders who then turned on 
each other, creating armed fiefdoms.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Not Worried About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All computer systems deemed critical to U.S.  
national defense, including those that warn of a missile attack, 
will be safe from glitches many expect when 1999 turns to 2000, 
Defense Department officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be 100 percent ready by the end of the year,'' Deputy  
Defense Secretary John Hamre said in announcing that as of Dec. 31, 
1998 the Pentagon had certified that 81 percent of ``mission 
critical'' computer systems were ready for the arrival of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had asked all government agencies to reach the  
100 percent ready mark by March 1999. The Defense Department will 
be at the 93 percent mark by then, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department ``went into hyperdrive'' with its Year  
2000, or Y2K, work after realizing last August that it was moving 
too slowly in preparing the approximately 2,300 crucial computer 
systems, Hamre said. In all, the Pentagon has about 10,000 computer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said minor glitches are likely to crop up on Jan. 1, 2000.  
``I think it's going to clearly be in a category of nuisance,'' he 
said. ``I'm very confident we won't have major problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem begins when computers try to add or subtract  
dates using only the last two digits of the year -- 00 in the case 
of 2000 -- which may confuse computers into reading the date as 
1900. Larger, older mainframe computers used by government and big 
corporations for many vital functions are particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill for fixing the Pentagon's computers and testing them  
will reach $2.5 billion, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Special attention is being given computer systems that affect  
the U.S. nuclear arsenal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said that in December the North American Aerospace Defense  
Command, or NORAD, ran a three-day series of about 30 simulated 
missile attacks to ensure that its Y2K-compliant computer systems 
would run properly in providing attack warning and assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every case the systems worked as designed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some individual nuclear systems, including Trident submarines  
carrying nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
already are certified as ready for 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, all other U.S. warfighting commands  
worldwide will run their own tests to evaluate the completeness of 
Pentagon computer fixes that affect them, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy defense secretary said U.S. officials are working  
with the Russian government on its 2000 preparations, but he 
indicated that Moscow has been moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre acknowledged ``some nervousness'' in Washington about  
potential computer problems in Russia. ``They don't seem to have 
the same level of urgency that we have had over it,'' he said, 
while adding that there is little worry about accidental Russian 
nuclear launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a Russian expert on the Y2K problem said Thursday  
that ``the problem with strategic weapons has been solved,'' but 
that questions remain about Russia's air defenses and early warning 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Terekov, director of a firm helping Russian companies  
with the Y2K transition, said it was unlikely Y2K would cause 
warheads to detonate or missiles to be fired by mistake.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's an early verdict in the impeachment  
trial, although not on President Clinton's guilt or innocence: Some 
members of the public say they're being shooed out of the visitors' 
gallery too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when he's getting interesting, we had to leave,'' Isabel  
Najera complained Thursday. The Washington retiree said she was 
allowed to sit in the Senate's public galleries for about half an 
hour but had to hand over her seat just as Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., laid out the case for Clinton's removal from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like more time,'' said Najera's companion, Helen  
Cooney, an Agriculture Department employee from suburban Virginia. 
``It was interesting hearing this firsthand. We're going to try to 
do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Palchik, a civil engineering student at the University of  
Texas at Austin, said he was awed by the opportunity to witness the 
government in action. 
</P>
<P>
	But he, too, wanted more than his 20 minutes of gallery time.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the chief justice, when I saw the House members in  
the Senate chamber, it was beautiful and very historic,'' he said. 
``I wish I could stay in there all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Seeming almost out of place, several dozen tiara-clad Mardi Gras  
queens and princesses roamed the Capitol's corridors Thursday, 
hours before the proceedings began in the nation's only impeachment 
trial for an elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Here to attend the 1999 Washington Mardi Gras Ball on Saturday,  
the young women were aware of the history unfolding just down the 
hall in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about being here,'' said Nicole Denning, 20, of  
Morgan City, La., waiting with her group in the Capitol Rotunda 
near the chamber where the trial was resuming. ``I can say I was in 
Washington when Bill Clinton was being impeached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really exciting,'' added Kathryn Keaty, 19, of Lafayette,  
La. ``We're all hoping that maybe we'll be able to get tickets and 
go in and see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris John, R-La., led a group from his district on a tour,  
including visits to the public Senate galleries and the House 
floor. They also posed for photographs in front of a statue of 
George Washington in the Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	The gala is in its 52nd year. ``We kind of bring Mardi Gras up  
and showcase the state of Louisiana up here,'' John said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the trial's testimony began, and even as workmen  
labored to put final touches on the Senate 
chamber-turned-courtroom, Sen. George Voinovich solved a really 
important question: Where he would sit as a new member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohioan ended up in the last row, at a desk on the Republican  
side of the center aisle, next to Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who 
has two years to go on his first term as a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshmen generally sit in the last row, moving forward as they  
build seniority and as other members leave -- unless trumped by a 
more senior member. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich is one of eight new members -- four in each party -- who  
are beginning their Senate careers as jurors in Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Like a professor teaching a mind-numbing college course, Rep.  
Asa Hutchinson, one of the 13 House Republicans acting as 
impeachment prosecutors, resorted to a series of charts to help 
make the case for Clinton's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson amplified his 75-minute presentation before the  
Senate with 20 charts highlighting testimony from such key 
witnesses as Monica Lewinsky, Oval Office secretary Betty Currie, 
presidential pal Vernon Jordan and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits 7-11 were titled ``Mission Accomplished'' and detailed  
Ms. Lewinsky's signing of an affidavit denying a sexual 
relationship with Clinton and her subsequent job interviews, which 
prosecutors contend were intended to buy her silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson ended with a chart labeled ``Seven Pillars of  
Obstruction'' that outlined seven instances in which Clinton 
allegedly obstructed justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said Clinton ``personally constructed'' the pillars.  
</P>
<P>
	``The goal was to win, and he was not going to let the judicial  
system stand in his way,'' said Hutchinson, who hails from 
Clinton's home state of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was followed by Rep. Ed Rogan, R-Calif., who seemed to prefer  
videotape more than the few charts he put on display. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan played snippets from Clinton's civil deposition in the  
now-dismissed Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and from his 
August grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the House members arguing for impeachment, space was  
reserved in the Senate for representatives who just wanted to 
witness history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, was the only taker.  
</P>
<P>
	She sat there alone, all day, in a row of seats reserved for  
House Democrats. Chairs set out for House Republicans remained 
empty. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Star Rejects Knicks Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Oded Katash rejected an offer from the New York  
Knicks that could have made him the first Israeli to play in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 6-foot-4 guard said Thursday he will stay with  
Maccabi Tel Aviv, which is struggling both in the Israeli and 
European leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team is not playing well and I feel an obligation to  
Maccabi Tel Aviv, to the fans and also to myself to help this 
team,'' said Katash. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Katash was said to have reached preliminary  
agreement with the Knicks last summer, but negotiations were cut 
off July 1 by the owners' lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning home, Katash has suffered a series of minor  
injuries. On Wednesday, a day before an important home game in the 
European champions league, he sprained an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Katash's Maccabi teammate Doron Sheffer starred for Connecticut  
and was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1996, but failed to 
make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks spokesman Chris Weillr said the club could not comment on  
player issues because of lockout restrictions still in effect.

</P>
<P>
	PAOLI, Pa. (AP) -- Herman Ball, head coach of the Washington  
Redskins from 1949 through part of the 1951 season, died Tuesday 
from heart ailment complications. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball spent eight years on the Redskins' staff, winning promotion  
from line coach to head coach midway through the 1949 season. The 
Redskins finished that year with a 4-7-1 record and won three out 
of 12 games the following year. Ball was replaced as head coach 
after a winless streak in the 1951 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He later was a Redskins scout. In 1955, he joined the Pittsburgh  
Steelers as an assistant coach. He also was on the coaching staffs 
of the Baltimore Colts and the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring 
in 1968.

	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- Former state Sen. President Maurice  
Donahue, a down-to-earth liberal who helped give western 
Massachusetts a strong voice in Boston, died at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was found Wednesday by relatives at his home. He died  
of natural causes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue, a Democrat, led the Senate from 1964-70. He won his  
first legislative seat in the House in 1949, then moved to the 
Senate in 1951. He also twice ran unsuccessfully for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	As a legislator, he helped build up the University of  
Massachusetts and found campuses like Holyoke Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	After his legislative career, he founded and ran the Donahue  
Institute at the University of Massachusetts, a political think 
tank that advises local governments.

	WALL, S.D. (AP) -- Ted E. Hustead, who helped build Wall Drug  
into an international tourist attraction, died Tuesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Hustead, who opened Wall Drug Co. in 1931, grossed $350 his  
first month. But the store was on a popular travel route, and 
Hustead and his wife, Dorothy, decided to put up signs to promote 
free ice water to lure customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy wrote the copy for the first sign, which read: ``Get a  
soda. Get a beer. Turn next corner. Just as near. To Highway 16 and 
14. Free ice water. Wall Drug.'' Cars started turning in as soon as 
the signs went up. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs and bumper stickers telling the number of miles to Wall  
Drug now appear around the world. The tradition earned the store 
international attention and it was written up in more than 700 
newspapers.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Logan, a football player for the Tampa  
Bay Buccaneers who later served as an announcer for the team's 
flagship radio station, died Tuesday night of a blood clot in the 
lungs. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, who played nose tackle, joined the Buccaneers in 1979  
after being drafted out of the University of Pittsburgh. He was 
named an All-Pro in 1984. He finished his Buccaneer career in 1986 
with a streak of 103 consecutive starts, a team record until it was 
broken in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He played an additional season in 1987 for the Green Bay  
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan began his broadcasting career with NBC affiliate WFLA-TV

way up the ranks at KOMO Radio to oversee its parent company for 
radio and television operations, died Friday after undergoing heart 
surgery. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren entered broadcasting as a salesman in 1933. He was  
quickly promoted to program manager at KOMO-KJR radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the first radio news department in the Northwest and  
helped develop KOMO-TV in Seattle and KATU-TV in Portland, Ore.

parent company of STAR-FM, KOMO-AM and KVI-AM.

<P>
	He won a Peabody Award for a television program about a group of

	He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, three children and six  
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's the ``wedding'' of the year for U.S. Protestantism, a  
service of union to bless a lesbian couple, jointly performed by a 
phalanx of 84 United Methodist ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, the unprecedented event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday  
at the Sacramento, Calif., Convention Center, is a civil rights 
demonstration. After all, the couple has lived together 14 years 
and held a private ceremony long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, the clergy and the 1,000 invited guests intend to  
dramatize defiance of a Methodist law that codifies the Christian 
tradition against same-sex relations. The Sacramento 84 declare, 
``We believe we are acting in the way in which Jesus Christ would 
act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blessing-cum-protest is the latest episode in a growing  
nationwide split over homosexuality, the worst crisis for the 
United Methodist Church since it was formed through merger in 1968. 
With 8.5 million members, this is America's second biggest 
Protestant body after the Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Methodist liberals have advocated clergy ordination  
for gays and lesbians with no requirement that they live as 
celibates. The churchwide legislature, the General Conference, has 
repeatedly said no. 
</P>
<P>
	On a second front, clergy were quietly performing same-sex  
blessings. But the 1996 General Conference inserted this sentence 
in the ``Social Principles'' section of the Methodists' Book of 
Discipline: ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not 
be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our 
churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that provision, the Rev. Jimmy Creech performed a 1997  
blessing for a lesbian couple in his Omaha, Neb., congregation. 
Last March, a Methodist tribunal decided to take no action against 
Creech. After that ruling roused fierce nationwide protest, the 
denomination's supreme court overturned it last August, finding 
Creech guilty and declaring the ban to be binding law. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago defiantly  
conducted his 33rd same-sex ceremony, for two men in his 
congregation. Dell, who is likely to face a church trial within 
weeks and could be defrocked, says church law violates his duty 
``to provide ministry to all people and not discriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days before charges were filed against Dell, the Rev.  
Donald Fado delivered an incendiary sermon at St. Mark's United 
Methodist Church in Sacramento. He announced his desire to lead a 
public same-sex service as an ``act of ecclesiastical 
disobedience'' to challenge church law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must demonstrate to the General Conference the folly of the  
exclusion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He soon got the hoped-for request for a ceremony from Jeanne  
Barnett and Ellie Charlton and began recruiting clergy to join him 
in officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 68, is the lay leader of the regional Methodist  
conference; Charlton, 63, serves on its board. Both are dedicated 
members of St. Mark's, but the congregation is split over the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Methodists from across the region planned a protest  
rally at a Sacramento church and will caucus again Jan 25-27 in 
Boulder Creek, Calif. They are virtually certain to file charges 
against Fado. Trials for all 84 participants, each requiring 13 
clergy jurors, seem doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, the California bishop who would have to pursue  
any charges, Melvin Talbert, disagrees with church policy. Prior to 
the August court ruling, Talbert had said he wouldn't prevent 
same-sex ceremonies. But he issued a letter January 6 stating he 
will uphold church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert hopes the next General Conference, in May 2000, will  
``decide we do not need to close down the debate, but open it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop C. Joseph Sprague, Dell's reluctant pursuer in Chicago,  
has been equally critical of Methodist policy. In fact the Columbus 
(Ohio) Dispatch revealed last fall that Sprague himself conducted 
same-sex blessings when he was an Ohio pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, 360 rebel clergy (out of a nationwide total of  
53,600) have vowed to conduct rites for ``all couples, regardless 
of gender.'' Methodism is not alone in its same-sex turmoil. The 
latest episode for the Presbyterian Church (USA) occurs February 26 
when an ecclesiastical court hears charges against the First 
Presbyterian Church of Stamford, Conn., for putting a homosexual 
layman on its ruling body. 
</P>
<P>
	At base, the Protestants are squabbling over the authority and  
interpretation of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	Fado says Paul taught in the New Testament book of Romans that  
homosexuality was unnatural ``but now we understand that it is 
natural, even in the animal kingdom. That pulls the rug out from 
under Paul. His cultural perspective was limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John Christie, a Californian who recently quit the  
Methodists for the Baptists due to pro-gay activity, says 
conservatives want to be sensitive to gay people in their midst but 
also faithful to the biblical teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe you can do both,'' Christie said. ``The others  
believe you have to make a choice, either the Bible and our 
Christian heritage, or affirming all people regardless of lifestyle 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James V. Heidinger II of Wilmore, Ky., president of the  
conservative Good News caucus, insists that ``the church simply 
cannot put its imprimatur on the practice of homosexuality.'' He 
says local congregations ``are being torn, damaged irreparably, and 
the pro-gay folks don't seem to mind. It's a crusade for them, and 
I don't see them backing away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the opposite side, Creech, who was removed from his Omaha  
pulpit and remains on leave writing a book, thinks clergy will be 
ousted ``due to the church's bigotry'' but predicts ultimate 
victory. ``It will be a long-term process of working for justice, 
very much like the history of apartheid in South Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between those two poles, the Dallas-based United Methodist  
Reporter newspaper chain asked in a sober New Year's editorial: 
``Can we agree to disagree and still live in the same 
ecclesiastical 'house,' but in different 'rooms'? Or do we need to 
be planning wisely for the division of the house, preparing to 
become two denominations that share a common history?''

<HEADLINE> Copper Falls on Brazil Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Copper futures closed in on new 12-year lows Thursday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange amid fears economic weakness in Brazil 
will escalate into a Latin American crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures fell due to the Brazilian  
currency devaluation, while crude and its products continued their 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell as investors reacted badly to the decision  
by Brazil's central bank to effectively devalue its currency, 
sending stock rates lower and interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. futures investors worried that U.S. companies with heavy  
interests in Latin America could be affected by a macroeconomic 
crisis in the region. Weaker profits could lead to weaker 
industrial production, and U.S. industry has virtually alone been 
the only thing propping up copper prices in the face of economic 
weakness in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper inventories now stand near record highs amid a worldwide  
slowdown in electronics-making and construction. Mine production, 
meantime, has increased as companies turn out more of the metal 
just to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	High-grade copper for March delivery fell .65 cent to 65.80  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures fell on the New York Board of Trade as investors  
worried Brazil, one of the world's largest growers, will increase 
selling to take advantage of the devalued currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, giving weaker  
foreign currencies an advantage in selling. Sugar prices also were 
nearly 25 percent below asking prices this time last year after 
farmers harvested a record global crop. 
</P>
<P>
	March sugar fell .15 cent to 8.55 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures continued their slide on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid perceptions U.S. inventories will only get 
larger in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors digested news that the Clinton administration had  
proposed to the United Nations that Iraq be allowed to sell as much 
oil as it can to purchase food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an exception to a years-long U.N. embargo following Iraq's  
invasion of Kuwait, Iraq currently is allowed to sell slightly more 
than $5.2 billion in oil every six month to buy food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts noted that Iraqi facilities currently are not  
capable of handling increased capacity, making the U.S. proposal 
moot, but market participants saw the announcement as another sign 
a world supply glut will not end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell a day earlier after the American Petroleum Institute  
reported inventories jumped 1 percent, or 3.1 million barrels, in 
the past week, surpassing expectations of a modest increase. 
</P>
<P>
	February light, sweet crude fell 16 cents to $12.15 a barrel;  
February heating oil fell 1.01 cents to 32.77 cents a gallon; 
February unleaded gasoline fell .80 cent to 35.60 cents a gallon; 
February natural gas rose 3.9 cents to $1.809 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet.

<HEADLINE> Kids Charity Boxes Stranded in Ore. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When 11-year-old Brittany McCord heard  
Honduran children were suffering from the effects of Hurricane 
Mitch, she packed a shoe box with little stuffed animals, shampoo 
and crayons and hoped it would find its way to a needy little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	But her box -- and 42 tons of boxes like it -- is still sitting at  
the Portland International Airport because no planes are free to 
transport the load. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had planned to make the delivery before Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
	Another 133 tons of supplies are accumulating in warehouses  
throughout the state, according to officials with Operation 
Shoebox, a community-based humanitarian organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay is disappointing for children like Brittany, a  
sixth-grader at Fowler Middle School in Tigard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted her to be really happy because she would have some  
nice things,'' Brittany said. ``I was thinking she might be sad 
because they lost everything there, and there were some people on 
the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch struck Central America in October, killing at least 9,000  
and leaving thousands more homeless. Honduras was hardest hit, with 
more than 5,600 people killed, 8,000 people missing and $5 billion 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian and Air Force workers hope the supplies will reach  
Honduras within the next two months, but there are no promises.

	``It's nobody's fault,'' said Bill Inman, president of Operation  
Shoebox. ``It seems like Oregon is just off the beaten track, and 
it's hard to get squadron leaders around the country to think about 
picking (the supplies) up.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Fall Over Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets fell on Thursday in  
reaction to Brazil's financial woes, but a stronger U.S. dollar 
boosted share prices in Tokyo -- the region's largest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo investors bought shares of companies heavily dependent on  
exports, betting the weaker yen would help stoke profit growth at 
big auto and electronics manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 335.26  
points, or 2.50 percent, to close at 13,738.86 points. On 
Wednesday, the index had gained 42.63 points, or 0.32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar bought 113.28 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up  
1.73 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York 
level of 113.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a shakeup at Brazil's central bank and its currency  
devaluation were the focus of many traders' attention, Tokyo 
investors figured that the 125-point drop overnight by the Dow 
Jones industrial average in New York had been a relatively calm 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some market players remained wary about new developments  
in the Brazilian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is churning fears, including concerns about emerging  
market risk,'' said Takeo Suzuki of Nomura Trust and Banking Ltd. 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares fell but bounced back from early lows after  
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang suggested any damage would be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the contagion effect won't be that big,'' Tsang said.  
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed with a loss of 90.64  
points, or 0.9 percent, at 10,183.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the index had plunged by as much as 365.97 points, or  
3.6 percent, following Wednesday's loss of 437.79 points, or 4.1 
percent, that came amid fears of big bank losses in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's STI fell 29.67 points, or 2 percent, to close at  
1,476.39. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southeast Asia's still wobbly economies, fears over Brazil  
triggered a sell-off in the region's currencies, which dragged down 
share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's JSX Composite Index fell 10.550 points, or 2.5  
percent, to close at 408.554 points. The Philippines' PSE Index was 
down 104.12 points, or 4.8 percent, at 2,063.28. Malaysia's 
Composite Index was down 0.70 points, or 0.11 percent, at 593.34 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose as late afternoon buying of blue chips  
offset early losses. The SET Index rose 1.38 points, or 0.35 
percent, to close at 386.96. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares fell on the Brazilian turmoil. The Weighted Price  
Index was down 78.02 points, or 1.2 percent, at 6,241.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares fell 4.5 percent, with the KOSPI dropping 28.61  
points to close at 604.42. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares fell 0.6 percent, with gains in mining stocks  
preventing a bigger drop. The All Ordinaries Index was down 17.2 
points to close at 2,804.8. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose as steady gains in local blue chips  
allayed fears of Brazil. The NZSE-40 rose 4.39 points, or 0.20 
percent at 2111.76.

<HEADLINE> Griffith Is Vikings' Mr. Everything </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Robert Griffith was everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	When Jake Plummer misfired, Griffith was there. When Orlando  
Thomas got hurt, Griffith was there. When three young defensive 
backs were pressed into action, Griffith was there for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He even played some special teams, returning briefly to the role  
that first allowed him to make his mark with the Minnesota Vikings 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith might be listed as the Vikings' starting strong safety,  
but he did just about everything in the secondary during last 
Sunday's 41-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That performance, which included two interceptions, earned  
Griffith NFL defensive player of the week recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the best safety play I've seen in a long, long  
time,'' Vikings defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith is back in the spotlight again this week as Minnesota  
prepares for Sunday's NFC championship game against Atlanta. One of 
the hardest-hitting safeties in the NFL, Griffith is on a collision 
course with Jamal Anderson, who looks more like a battering ram 
than a running back when he breaks into the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a challenge for me,'' said Griffith, a  
second-team All-Pro. ``I don't look at it like me against Jamal. 
It's their offense against us. I mean, they've got two great 
wideouts as well. I figure they're going to run the ball, they have 
to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Griffith's job will be multi-faceted.  
</P>
<P>
	He'll be back at strong safety at game time, with Thomas  
expected to return at free safety despite a hamstring injury that 
was only about 75 percent healed as of Thursday. But the Vikings 
once again figure to need the help of their young backups, and as 
usual Griffith will be a major part of Minnesota's run defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Griff is very talented,'' linebacker Dixon Edwards said. ``He  
knows his stuff, he knows every position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was knocked out early in the second quarter against  
Arizona. Leading just 7-0 at the time and already playing without 
injured nickel back Ramos McDonald, the Vikings were forced to 
scramble to patch up their secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	With little-used backups Duane Butler, Anthony Bass and Antonio  
Banks forced into their most significant action of the season, 
Griffith seemed omnipresent. 
</P>
<P>
	Just listen to coach Dennis Green describe Griffith's day  
against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to go out and go play strong safety, then a guy gets  
hurt and you go play nickel,'' Green began. ``Then you go back to 
playing strong safety and making calls like you're a free safety, 
then play free safety, then go back to strong safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's tiring just listen to. Griffith just shrugged when asked  
about it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just myself,'' he said. ``I mean, we've got guys who  
know what they're doing. We practice four days a week, and I was 
just out there settling guys down. We had Bass in the game, and 
it's funny because he already knew (what to do). He just wanted to 
say, `OK, Griff.' That's all it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith's development this season has been one of the main  
reasons the Vikings' defense has been such a worthy complement to 
the high-scoring offense. 
</P>
<P>
	He got off to a fast start, with five interceptions in the first  
five games. That included two in the Monday night victory at Green 
Bay on Oct. 5, when the Vikings first announced themselves as title 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	While he remained an integral part of Minnesota's run defense  
and coverage schemes, Griffith went without an interception until 
Sunday. Both of his interceptions against the Cardinals came in the 
second quarter, helping the Vikings to a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of the rest of the day looking like a traffic cop,  
but still found time to make six tackles, second on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That looked like a good football player making some great  
plays,'' Thomas said. ``I mean, he's done an exceptional job. It 
was tough standing on the sidelines, but to know that he was in 
there, he did a great job.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Inspectors Back in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using a French proposal as a springboard, the  
Clinton administration is huddling with U.S. allies to try to find 
a way to get weapons inspectors back to Iraq to spur the country's 
disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the administration is seeking to keep the pressure on  
Iraq on inspections, it also is signaling a new U.S. willingness to 
ease restrictions on Iraqi humanitarian purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said there were two more incidents  
in the no-fly zone over northern Iraq early today. In both cases, 
said the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, Iraqi 
defenses posed a threat to U.S. and British planes patrolling the 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force F-16 fighter fired a high-speed anti-radiation  
missile at a surface-to-air missile site and anti-aircraft 
artillery system. 
</P>
<P>
	An F-15 launched a precision guided missile at another  
surface-to-air missile site. In both cases, U.S. officials said, 
the American planes returned safely to base. There was no immediate 
report of damage to the targets. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth straight day Iraqi forces challenged the  
no-fly edict enforced by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A French proposal unveiled Wednesday at the United Nations would  
lift a nine-year-old U.N. oil embargo on Iraq in exchange for a new 
monitoring system that would focus on deterring Iraq from acquiring 
weapons of mass destruction rather than accounting for what it may 
have hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tepid reaction, the State Department spokesman, James P.  
Rubin, said the French approach had some ``positive elements.'' 
But, reflecting U.S. policy, he said Iraq should not be liberated 
from the sanctions until it rids itself of all weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a number of questions and concerns'' about the French  
proposal, Rubin said. ``The United States has always been skeptical 
and perhaps others are not as skeptical as we are'' of Iraq's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Vice President Al Gore, in a speech in New York City,  
said the United States ``is willing to look at ways to improve the 
effectiveness of the humanitarian programs in Iraq, including 
lifting current ceilings on funds which can be used to purchase 
food and medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who was speaking to the Israel Policy Forum, a U.S.-based  
lobbying group, did not say when the administration would make a 
decision or whether it would monitor how Iraq would spend the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is now allowed to export up to $5.3 billion worth of oil  
over 180 days under the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program. Proceeds are 
used primarily for food and medical supplies and to compensate Gulf 
War victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, State Department officials stressed the United States  
was prepared to attack Iraq again if it continues to defy U.N. 
Security Council resolutions that call for disarmament or if it 
persists in interfering with U.S. flights over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would take up  
with government leaders in Egypt and Saudi Arabia tactics for 
deposing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. She will go to Cairo and 
Riyadh for talks at the end of the month after a three-day visit to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Albright's agenda is finding ways to get Iraq to  
distribute to its people the food and medicine it purchases from 
proceeds of the oil sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said that much of the purchased medicine and food is  
stored in government warehouses while Iraq insists the suffering of 
the Iraqi people should be alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Iraq announced it planned to boost oil production to  
3 million barrels a day from the current level of 2.5 million 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's refusal to admit U.N. inspectors led to a missile and  
bombing attack last month by the United States and Britain. Russia, 
China and France all objected. In the aftermath, the Clinton 
administration is struggling to keep an inspection system alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has consulted by telephone with Russian Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov and will return to the subject on her trip to 
Moscow. State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, said 
some inspection system was essential to keep tabs on Iraq's 
remaining nuclear, chemical and biological weapons caches. 
</P>
<P>
	The French proposal has opened the door to active discussions,  
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Farm-State Senators Petition Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Democratic senators have asked  
Attorney General Janet Reno to launch a formal investigation into 
``continued and growing concentration'' in the nation's livestock 
and farm commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe conditions have reached a point that our producers  
are being denied the opportunity to receive a fair price for their 
products through fair, free and open markets,'' the letter, dated 
Tuesday, read. 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed by Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North  
Dakota, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Reno did not immediately return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently asked the Justice  
Department and the Federal Trade Commission to examine pricing 
problems within the pork industry, where farmers are receiving 
record-low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have expressed concern about plans by Cargill  
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, to buy the 
worldwide grain operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
Justice is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., has  
scheduled a hearing Jan. 26 on the concentration issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators wrote that the top four firms control 87 percent of  
beef slaughter, 60 percent of pork slaughter and 73 percent of 
sheep slaughter. It's the same in commodities markets, they said, 
writing that four firms control 59 percent of port facilities, 62 
percent of flour milling, 74 percent of wet corn milling and 76 
percent of soybean crushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department should investigate ``whether such  
powerful concentration is squeezing farm prices and denying farmers 
the opportunity to receive a fair return for their production,'' 
the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Set for Second Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson might have lost more against Evander  
Holyfield than a heavyweight title and a temporary ban from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Botha will find out Saturday night just how much.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson begins his second comeback from an enforced layoff when he  
returns to meet Botha in a scheduled 10-round fight. This time, 
though, it begins with a fighter more eager to trade punches with 
him than when he fought Peter McNeeley after Tyson's release from 
prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bully mystique was shattered in the two fights with  
Holyfield,'' said Tyson's new trainer, Tommy Brooks. ``He has to 
fight now. Guys aren't going to lay down any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The old, invincible Mike Tyson disappeared about the time he bit  
Holyfield's ears, leaving Tyson without one of the major weapons he 
used to bring into a fight -- his ability to intimidate his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, fighters like Botha can go into the ring knowing there is a  
way to beat Tyson. Actually doing it, though, is a different 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my best is over yet,'' Tyson said. ``I was in  
a drought for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is a 6-1 favorite to beat Botha in his first fight in 19  
months and his first since he bit a chunk out of Holyfield's ears 
in his second straight loss to the reigning WBA and IBF heavyweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha has also not fought in 19 months, but his only loss was to  
former champion Michael Moorer. He is certainly a step up from 
McNeeley in the quality of opponent for Tyson's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be intimidated,'' said Botha, a South African now  
living in California. ``I won't be intimidated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will make some $10 million for the fight, which is  
available on pay-per-view for about $45, but isn't expected to draw 
more than about 10,000 fans willing to pay at least $200 a seat at 
the MGM Grand hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who weighed a career-high 223 pounds Thursday, is 45-3,  
but two of his losses have come in his last two fights. Botha, 233, 
is 39-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been training hard. I'm 32 years old, I've been putting  
on weight,'' said Tyson, whose previous top weight was 222 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is the first of a scheduled series of four fights this  
year that Tyson and his handlers hope will end in a third fight 
against Holyfield sometime in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kills me to think someone could get the better of me,''  
Tyson said of the Holyfield fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada boxing officials say they will take no extra precautions  
for the fight in the same ring where Tyson bit Holyfield in the 
third round of their June 28, 1997, fight, prompting a wild melee 
to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won his boxing license back by promising never to snap  
again, and a team of psychiatrists from Massachusetts General 
Hospital who examined him for five days said there was little 
likelihood such an incident would occur again. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, efforts to promote Tyson as a changed individual fell  
flat in the days leading up to the fight when he went into an 
obscenity-laden tirade to a New York City television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Mike and Mike is going to be Mike,'' Tyson said. ``You can  
be crass. You can be obnoxious. That's who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who split with promoter Don King following his ban from  
boxing, needs a quick series of paydays to pay off a $13 million 
IRS debt and restore his finances. His earlier comeback earned him 
some $100 million, but King and his handlers got a good chunk of it 
and Tyson blew the rest in spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get screwed, that's the history of our business,'' Tyson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson begins his comeback still facing the possibility of jail  
time when he is sentenced next month on a no-contest plea to 
misdemeanor assault charges stemming from his assault of two men 
following a fender-bender in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He also could face revocation of his Indiana probation, which is  
still in effect from his rape conviction. Those close to Tyson, 
though, believe he will escape any jail or prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for anything. If you're going to send me to jail,  
send me to jail,'' Tyson said. ``I've done that already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tyson faces the pressure of having to win to keep a  
comeback plan that could earn him another $100 million or so, Botha 
goes into the bout knowing it is his one big chance at stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Botha briefly held the IBF version of the  
heavyweight title before it was stripped from him for testing 
positive for steroids following his fight with Germany's Axel 
Schulz. He got another shot at the title, but was stopped by Moorer 
in the 12th round of a punishing fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a sore loser and I've got a great chin,'' said Botha, who  
will earn $1.8 million. ``I still think Tyson is the best 
heavyweight out there. It's just a great opportunity for me to be 
where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight tops a card that includes Roberto Garcia's defense of  
his IBF junior lightweight title against former champion John 
Molina. The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, with the Tyson-Botha 
match expected to start no later than 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Winter Chills Midwest, Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain made for a white-knuckle Thursday across  
the Northeast and Midwest, and in Detroit's snowbound 
neighborhoods, people were told if they wanted their mail, they'd 
have to come out into the streets and get it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine hamlet of Allagash, people stayed indoors to avoid  
the lowest temperature ever recorded in the state: 55 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Hell froze over.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're at 1 degree,'' said Jim Ley, owner of the  
Devil's Den, a clothing and souvenir store in Hell, a Michigan 
village about 60 miles west of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow extended from Ohio through Pennsylvania and into New  
York state, closing schools, canceling flights and forcing drivers 
to take it slow and steady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was slipping all over. My big question is, where are the  
sanders?'' secretary Vicki Piccione said in Mineola, N.Y., on Long 
Island. ``I saw a plow on the side of the road. Very helpful, 
wasn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	South of the snow, freezing rain and sleet fell from the Ohio  
Valley east into the mid-Atlantic states. Roads were icy from Ohio 
to Virginia and New Jersey, with numerous traffic accidents during 
the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were shut down all over, including Brooke, W.Va., where  
students have had only two days of class since the Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my wife's going crazy'' handling their 14-year-old son,  
said John Schwertfeger of Brooke, W.Va. ``I think she's about ready 
to drop him off at the superintendent's house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, where more than 23 inches of snow has accumulated  
since the beginning of the year and few neighborhood streets have 
been plowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Postmaster Lloyd Wesley Jr. said letter carriers will operate  
``like the Good Humor man'' -- driving their trucks to the front of 
an impassable street and honking their horns for 60 seconds so that 
people can come and get their mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is never-before stuff,'' said postal spokeswoman Diana  
Pritchard. ``This isn't in the regs book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Allagash, where Maine's cold-weather record of minus 48, set  
in the town of Van Buren in 1925, was broken overnight, many of the 
roughly 250 people living in the hamlet near the Canadian border 
plugged their cars into electric outlets to keep the engines warm 
and hunkered down indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Buffalo, N.Y., a 9-year-old boy fell through thin ice on  
Lake Erie and his 7-year-old friend held onto him until rescuers 
arrived. Hospital officials said both boys would recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow resumed Thursday in Buffalo, which by Wednesday had  
recorded nearly 53 inches this month alone. Buffalo usually gets 
93.2 inches of snow every year, or more than 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The added weight brought down sections of barns, churches and  
other buildings. ``The whole thing fell in like an accordion,'' 
Charles Spencer Jr. said of a roof in one room of his home. 
``Anybody who was out in that room would have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about 2 1/2 feet on the ground Thursday, prison inmates were  
out with shovels uncovering fire hydrants and clearing walkways. 
More than 100 National Guardsmen and 80 state transportation 
workers also helped out. 
</P>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The government has authorized the first  
extradition of a major Mexican drug dealer, an official said 
Thursday, a move that could send Jesus Amezcua to California to 
face U.S. indictments for methamphetamine smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico seldom extradites its citizens to the United States, and  
has never turned over a major Mexican drug suspect. But persistent 
requests from the United States -- and Mexico's own lack of success 
in prosecuting Amezcua and two of his brothers -- apparently played 
a role in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Amezcua and the two brothers were arrested in June. Authorities  
say they headed the world's biggest methamphetamine and ephedrine 
trafficking operation, with the majority of the drugs going to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican officials never formally charged any of the men with any  
drug-related offense. In interviews with local newspapers, the 
brothers have denied involvement in drugs.

	CORDOBA, Argentina (AP) -- A former army chief sought in  
connection with the disappearance of children during the country's 
``dirty war'' was put under house arrest Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gen. Cristino Nicolaides, 73, was interrogated Wednesday  
by Federal Judge Adolfo Bagnasco and then hospitalized because of a 
heart ailment, the Noticias Argentinas news agency reported. He was 
granted house arrest because of his age and ill health. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagnasco is investigating an alleged plan to kidnap and change  
the identities of babies born in clandestine detention centers 
during the 1976-83 military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicolaides remains in intensive care and his condition ``has  
worsened,'' the former army chief's lawyer, Alejandro Zeverin, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicolaides is the eighth high-ranking officer to be detained by  
Bagnasco. Others include former Gen. Jorge Videla, the regime's 
first president, and former navy chief Adm. Emilio Massera, a 
member of the military junta that ousted President Isabel Peron in 
1976.

	PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Trinidad and Tobago has signed a  
five-year trade development agreement with Cuba, foreign minister 
Ralph Maraj said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pact, officials will promote trade and investment in  
the other country, agencies will share surveys and published 
research and schools will be encouraged to start student exchange 
programs and scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba is one of Trinidad's best trade partners. About 90 percent  
of Caribbean imports to Cuba are from Trinidad and Tobago, said 
Cuban ambassador Guillermo Batista Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government recently has made vigorous overtures to  
several Caribbean countries to step up trade and tourism with Cuba

	President Jules Wijdenbosch said he signed three social  
development agreements with Cuban leader Fidel Castro during a 
visit to Havana this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wijdenbosch said he pledged to bring up Cuba's relationship with  
the United States at a meeting of the Caribbean Community trade 
group on Jan. 30. Cuba is pressing for admission to the 15-member 
organization, and Wijdenbosch became chairman of the group Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Wijdenbosch said Cuban specialists would help upgrade  
audiovisual aids in the country's schools, develop elementary 
curricula, and train agriculture teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba will send 52 doctors to work in rural areas of the South  
American country, he said. It will also give 52 medical school 
scholarships to Surinamese students.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenging Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is challenging Wall Street  
to invest in the underserved markets of America and ensure that the 
nation's downtowns share the good economic times with impoverished 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting a section of his fiscal 2000 budget proposal,  
Clinton planned today to unveil a bundle of tax incentive and loan 
guarantees designed to attract venture capital to distressed areas 
from the barrios of Los Angeles to the hamlets of Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is going to challenge the leaders of Wall Street  
to take the lead in investing in America's new markets,'' said an 
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate impeachment trial against him proceeding,  
Clinton was scheduled to address a conference on reinventing 
government at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He then planned to travel to New York City to unveil the new  
initiative at an economic conference organized by Jesse Jackson's 
Wall Street Project, a coalition dedicated to expanding business 
opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	He was expected back in Washington tonight to attend a  
Democratic fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal was developed by an administration task  
force that consulted with investment advisers and pioneers in 
community development as well as members of Congress. In some ways 
it mirrored federal efforts to boost struggling economies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a domestic version of these vehicles,'' Jackson said.  
``Whether it's the Ozarks, East L.A. or Harlem, there must be 
vehicles ... to transport capital to people who need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would seek to stimulate billions of dollars in new  
private capital investments, building a network of private 
investment institutions to funnel credit and technical assistance 
to businesses in these underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of the proposal include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in the targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--The creation of new private investment partnerships to be known  
as America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the 
Overseas Private Investment Corp. APIC would make equity 
investments into larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner 
cities or rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the SBA's Small Business Investment Program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the SBA will authorize establishment of new markets  
venture capital firms and approve non-bank lenders that will target 
their lending to underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget also will include seed money for  
BusinessLink, a public-private partnership to demonstrate to large 
firms the business benefits of developing small and minority 
business partners.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen quiet trading in  
Tokyo today ahead of a local holiday as dealers shrugged off a 
dramatic devaluation of Brazil's currency overnight. Japanese share 
prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 113.46 yen, up 1.91  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 113.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 335.26  
points, or 2.50 percent, to close at 13,738.86 points. On 
Wednesday, the index had gained 42.63 points, or 0.32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar strengthened on  
buying by Japanese institutional investors and short-covering by 
other players, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge in the value of the Brazilian currency, the real, by  
7.6 percent on Wednesday had little impact in Tokyo trading today, 
but traders remained cautious about how the situation in Brazil 
will develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is churning fears, including concerns about emerging  
market risk,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign exchange manager 
at Nomura Trust and Banking Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, trading was relatively quiet prior to a three-day  
weekend. Financial markets will be closed in Tokyo on Friday for a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making investors cautious was the lingering possibility of  
another bout of intervention in support of the dollar by the Bank 
of Japan, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, after sliding from a high of more than 147 yen in  
August to a 28-month low on Monday, jumped more than 4 yen on the 
back of a surprise intervention by Japan's central bank on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's trading in Tokyo, the dollar ranged between 112.90  
yen and 113.80 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.30 yen by late afternoon  
in Tokyo, up from 130.00 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the U.S. currency's advance against  
the yen helped restore confidence in the profit outlook for 
export-oriented companies, pushing up share prices of auto and 
electronics blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in large exporters had taken a beating in recent days as  
the value of the yen surged. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen hurts exporters' price competitiveness and  
reduces their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen. Lower 
earnings by exporters could hamper efforts to jump-start Japan's 
recession-plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section totaled 393 million  
shares, up from Wednesday's turnover of 375 million shares. 
Advancers outnumbered decliners 734 to 399, with 163 issues closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 12.86 points, or 1.22 percent, to 1,069.94. The 
TOPIX rose 1.15 points, or 0.11 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.665 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.725 
percent, driving its price up to 101.09 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Vets' Program Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan panel urged broad expansion of  
military and veterans benefits on Thursday, including a new GI Bill 
promising full college scholarships in exchange for four years of 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarships would cover any institution of higher learning,  
from inexpensive community colleges to Ivy League schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans' groups applauded the ambitious package, which also  
calls for more generous terms on VA home loans, better health 
services and a tax-deferred investment program for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could face a multitude of jurisdictional disputes in  
Congress and among federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some programs have simply become outdated,'' said Anthony J.  
Principi, chairman of the congressionally appointed Commission on 
Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the 12-member panel recommended 100 changes,  
representing the biggest projected overhaul in benefits since the 
1950s. Eligible beneficiaries include some 26 million veterans and 
8.4 million in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Miller, national commander of the American Legion, the  
nation's largest veterans' group, applauded the proposals, saying 
they would ``get the nation back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger signals are clear. We need to make some fundamental  
improvements in the benefits available to our service members and 
our veterans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that some of the recommendations -- particularly the GI  
Bill overhaul -- would essentially restore benefits available to 
returning World War II soldiers that have eroded since. 
</P>
<P>
	If adopted by Congress, the government would pay for full  
college costs for veterans who served at least four years on active 
duty, regardless of the cost; plus pay a $400-a-month stipend for 
up to 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Pentagon could transfer this benefit to other  
family members as an re-enlistment incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	The program ``will open the door of the military to a much  
broader cross section of America's youth,'' Principi said. 
</P>
<P>
	High school graduates may start viewing the military as a route  
to a full college education, rather than as a detour, Principi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would repeal the $1,200 contribution now required  
from all enlistees to qualify for the current GI Bill program. That 
program pays just $538 a month toward a college education. 
</P>
<P>
	Other key proposals:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Veterans could again buy a home with no down payment, as in  
the early days of the VA loan program. Currently, veterans must pay 
a 2 percentage point fee. Future subsidies could only be used once. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Many health-care benefit programs would be combined. Veterans  
could seek health care treatment at military hospitals, and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Enlistees could invest their money in tax-deferred Thrift  
Savings Plans, similar to 401(k) accounts available in the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Those leaving the service could receive subsidized health  
insurance for up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Principi, a San Diego attorney who was deputy director of the  
Department of Veterans Affairs in the Bush administration, said the 
panel's recommendations could help reverse a long slide in morale 
in the military and help with personnel retention. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, he conceded the legislative package cuts across  
the jurisdictions of many congressional committees and federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``I think it will fly.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs  
Committee, scheduled a hearing for Feb. 23. Similar hearings were 
expected by the House National Security Committee and the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Cochran, minority staff director for the Veterans Affairs  
Committee, said legislative language has already been prepared to 
go along with the panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to say we agree with every recommendation.'' But  
Cochran predicted that, on the whole, the package would be well 
received by Congress, despite its high potential price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations add up to nearly $3 billion over five years,  
including $539 million for the expanded GI bill, a sum that would 
climb as more and more veterans became eligible; $462 million for 
the added 18 months of subsidized health care and $263 million for 
programs to help the estimated 300,000 to 500,000 homeless 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	But commission members said much of this would be offset by  
savings, including combining health treatment and pharmaceutical 
procurement programs.

<HEADLINE> Two Jailed for Beheading a Duck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Two men got 30 days in jail and  
two months in boot camp for beheading a duck with a golf club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we think we see it all, we're shocked,'' Circuit  
Judge Barry Howard said Wednesday. ``This defenseless animal was 
killed and there is no rhyme or reason for it. Anyone who could do 
this could easily escalate such acts to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley Woons, 23, and Michael Prasher, 22, were also given  
three years' probation and ordered to undergo mental health 
treatment and perform 100 hours of community service at an animal 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing some golf Sept. 1, the men used crumbs to lure a  
duck from a pond. Woons grabbed the bird and held it while Prasher 
used a nine-iron to slice off its head. 
</P>
<P>
	They pleaded guilty to maliciously killing an animal and could  
have gotten five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tons of profiles on serial killers and most start out  
killing animals,'' prosecutor Joseph A. Lavigne said. ``We want to 
nip that in the bud.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When was the last time you saw a cucumber with  
bulging cheeks puffing on a tuba? How about a singing tomato? An 
airborne carrot with yellow pigtails and freckles? 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing the main ingredients, er, characters, of  
``VeggieTales,'' a series of popular videos that teach children 
biblical stories and values. 
</P>
<P>
	These animated Bible-thumpers are not ``The Prince of Egypt,''  
but they are hot -- not just with young kids, but among college 
students who love their flashes of quirky humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Big Idea Productions Inc., has produced 11 videos  
since 1993 and has sold about 7 million copies -- 4 million last 
year. It also has released three veggie music albums and six books. 
</P>
<P>
	These brightly colored vegetables, who blend rhyming rap with  
silly tunes and a bit of blues, star in the top 10 selections among 
the Christian Booksellers Association's video best sellers. Among 
all children's videos, not just religious ones, four 
``VeggieTales'' videos recently ranked in the top 30 sellers, 
according to market researcher VideoScan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The tales' hosts are the good-hearted but gullible Larry the  
Cucumber and his wiser sidekick, big-eyed Bob the Tomato. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry and Bob -- described by the company's founder, Phil  
Vischer, as the ``Abbott and Costello of the vegetable kingdom'' -- 
appear in all of the series videos. Guest stars include the likes 
of 5-year-old Junior Asparagus; his best friend, Laura the Carrot; 
Madame Blueberry; and a zucchini portraying Moses. 
</P>
<P>
	They retell stories of the Old and New Testaments -- from David  
and Goliath to the Good Samaritan -- as a way of teaching basic 
values such as loving your neighbor and telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, ``Rack, Shack &AMP; Benny'' retells the story of  
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and the fiery furnace. The story 
shows everyone else eating as many chocolate bunnies as they want 
and some getting sick, but Junior Asparagus remembers what his 
mother taught him and he resists peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a rule very early on that we would not portray Jesus  
as a vegetable,'' said Vischer, 32, co-creator of ``VeggieTales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He provides the calming voice of Bob the Tomato, while Mike  
Nawrocki, writer and director at Big Idea, provides Larry the 
Cucumber's voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The videos are aimed at children ages 3 to 9. But with spoofs of  
Monty Python, Dr. Seuss, ``Gilligan's Island'' and even ``Madame 
Bovary,'' the tales also appeal to college students, who have begun 
holding ``VeggieTales'' parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost has like a cult following among college students,''  
said Tim Burton, manager of Baptist Bookstore in Chattanooga, 
Tenn., where 1,200 people turned out to watch the ``Madame 
Blueberry'' video when it was released last summer. That day, 
Burton sold about 500 copies of ``VeggieTales'' videos. 
</P>
<P>
	The videos, which run about 30 minutes each, sell for $13 to $15  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other retailers, the store also offers veggie paraphernalia  
-- toys, stationery, ties, postcards, diaries and more. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Taylor of the Chicago suburb of Wheaton said her  
2-year-old son is ``addicted'' to ``VeggieTales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He asks me to watch 'VeggieTales' all the time'' and dances to  
the music, she said. Her 8-year-old son understands the videos' 
value discussions and watches ``them over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The videos' popularity is reflected in the company's growth from  
a staff of six or so in 1994 to 70 now. Big Idea also has expanded 
its sales, offering some of the videos in mass-market stores in 
addition to Christian bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bob the Tomato, he lets the audience know he's clearly  
sold on the series when he recites the opening lyrics to the show's 
theme song. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you like to talk to tomatoes, if a squash can make you  
smile, if you like to waltz with potatoes up and down the produce 
aisle, have we got a show for you,'' he sings as Larry the Cucumber 
makes not-so-lyrical music on his tuba.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's largest stock market  
was overcome by jitters Thursday, with another Central Bank 
official stepping down and trading temporarily halted after the Sao 
Paulo index fell 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller Rio de Janeiro market also plunged 9 percent in  
continuing repercussions a day after the Central Bank president 
resigned and Brazil decided to let its currency slide against the 
U.S. dollar.

	Analysts said the market movements were a clear reflection of  
the country's financial fragility, which includes fears of another, 
larger devaluation and rising inflation.

	Brazil's action raised fears that the 18-month financial crisis  
that has battered Asia and Russia has not gone away and could bring 
down other economies in Latin America. Traders also worry that U.S. 
multinational companies operating in Brazil could take a big profit 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears led to a second day of selling on Wall Street. The  
Dow Jones fell 228.63 points to close at 9,120.93, which on top of 
Wednesday's 125-point loss puts the index below where it began the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sao Paulo, the market was up in the morning after closing 5  
percent lower Wednesday but turned steeply lower in the afternoon, 
setting off a circuit-breaker that automatically halted trading for 
30 minutes near the end of the day. The market ended at its low for 
the day, off 9.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was spooked by unconfirmed rumors that  
some local hedge funds were having problems, coupled with the 
resignation of the Central Bank's director for banking system 
supervision, Claudio Mauch. Mauch said his resignation on Thursday 
had been planned for months.

	``The uncertainty and panic that shook world markets was a  
natural reaction,'' said Maria Lucia Rangel Filardo, an economist 
at the University of Sao Paulo.

	She said investor confidence should return in the next few days  
``when people realize the devaluation was a minor economic policy 
change needed to push interest rates down.''

Thursday they were higher in Japan, lower elsewhere in Asia and 
mixed in Europe.

8.8 percent a day earlier fell 4.1 percent Thursday.

for the first time since the year began. The market gained 56.17 
points over the day to end at 3356.59.

<P>
	About $2.3 billion in currency outflows has left Brazil in the  
past two days, the Central Bank reported Thursday -- and there were 
fears the outflow could worsen. Since Brazil's economic problems 
began in August, investors have pulled $40 billion out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, meanwhile, said  
the United States was ``committed to supporting Brazil while it 
works through a difficult economic time'' and called on its 
government to carry out a ``strong, credible economic program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Washington was in touch with Brazilian officials and  
the IMF, and was watching world markets. ``Brazil's financial 
stability and prosperity are extremely important to the United 
States and our entire hemisphere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Central Bank chief Gustavo Franco resigned and his  
replacement, Francisco Lopes, announced that the Brazilian 
currency, the real, would trade in a wider band against the dollar. 
His move effectively devalued the currency by about 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency traded Thursday at the bottom of the  
range, at 1.32 reals to the dollar.

<P>
	Some analysts say the government should have devalued the  
currency by twice as much.

seriously consider a devaluation of around 15 percent or so,'' said 
Silvio Camargo, head of institutional equity sales at Sao Paulo's 
Banco Fator. 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation prompted the Senate on Wednesday to approve a  
presidential decree raising corporate income taxes, a measure 
expected to yield $3.8 billion this year. It also approved a 
measure reducing long-term interest rates to 12 percent a year from 
19 percent.

only be voted on next week.

America's largest economy, must get things back on track quickly if 
it is to attract foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and other international lenders in November came up with a  
$41.5 billion aid package. But to get that money, Brazil had to 
commit to trimming $23 million from its deficit in 1999, a task 
made more difficult during economic uncertainty.

<HEADLINE>  Trading Halted in Brazil Market </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's largest stock market  
was overcome by jitters Thursday, with another Central Bank 
official stepping down and trading temporarily halted after the Sao 
Paulo index fell 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller Rio de Janeiro market also plunged 9 percent in

resigned and Brazil decided to let its currency slide against the

<HEADLINE> Fosse's Dance Musical Exhausting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Watching ``Fosse,'' Broadway's exhausting new  
dance musical, is a little like eating an entire box of chocolates 
at one sitting. Individual pieces are delicious, but the overall 
experience leaves you stuffed, with a twang or two of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuffed because despite the high energy and talent of the large  
cast, this three-act celebration of choreographer Bob Fosse churns 
on forever. And guilt because one feels the production at the 
Broadhurst Theater should be more satisfying, considering the 
genius this musical is saluting. 
</P>
<P>
	Fosse, who died in 1987, was an original, a man with a unique  
dance vocabulary. With Jerome Robbins, Gower Champion and Michael 
Bennett, he shaped the way Broadway musicals moved in the boom 
years following the Second World War. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mistaking Fosse's style, a combination of sex,  
sleaze and fondness for show biz. It dazzled audiences with quirky 
moves and odd angles. Fosse dances were not about character. They 
exuded attitude, flash and flesh. It's hard to build an entire show 
around all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Richard Maltby Jr. has not given ``Fosse'' much shape  
or forward motion. The evening doesn't build, chronologically or 
emotionally. The running order of the numbers could be reshuffled 
and there would not be much change in the musical's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because much of ``Fosse'' is rooted in pure dance.  
Several of the numbers are amalgamations, inspired by a parade of 
Fosse creations, rather than exact duplications of his work. After 
a while, the moves begin to look alike. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' another voluminous  
retrospective, ``Fosse'' makes no attempt to place the dance pieces 
from the master's various Broadway musicals, movies and television 
specials in the context of their original productions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robbins'' expensively recreated sets and costumes. Here, set  
and costume designer Santo Loquasto has come up with simple yet 
generic settings (for the most part, a series of proscenium arches 
and a bit of Las Vegas glitz). 
</P>
<P>
	There also are the signature Fosse black outfits, bowler hats  
and white gloves and serviceable costumes for several of the more 
elaborate numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are some amazing moments, recreated by  
co-choreographers Ann Reinking and Chet Walker. For much of the 
last 20 years, dance has been a Broadway orphan. Can you recall the 
choreography from such big Brit musicals as ``Les Miserables'' or 
``The Phantom of the Opera'' or ``Miss Saigon''? 
</P>
<P>
	``Fosse'' shows why dance could lift a musical higher than the  
biggest star or the most persistent melody. The best scenes here 
recreate dances from such hit musicals as ``The Pajama Game,'' 
``Damn Yankees'' and ``Sweet Charity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can almost hear the audience sigh with contentment as Jane  
Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex Sanchez strut, slouch and 
swivel their way through ``Steam Heat,'' a classic dance trio from 
``The Pajama Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the genial Scott Wise, the show's unofficial master of  
ceremonies, reiterates why he is probably the best song-and-dance 
man currently on Broadway. He exudes a sunny confidence, a genial 
vaudeville style equally at home in tap and the more athletic 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the show's few sung interludes, the vocally superb  
Valarie Pettiford smokes her way through ``Life Is Just a Bowl of 
Cherries,'' a standard used in Fosse's last musical, ``Big Deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show ends with a re-creation of Benny Goodman's ``Sing,  
Sing, Sing,'' which wowed audiences in the 1978 Fosse revue 
``Dancin'.'' It still does, particularly when the astonishing 
Elizabeth Parkinson takes over the stage in the number's trumpet 
section. I swear the woman levitates. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one serious misstep, the inclusion of two snippets from  
``Chicago,'' which is playing next door at the Shubert Theater. 
``Chicago'' -- hands down and feet first -- is still the best musical 
on Broadway, and the ``Fosse'' recreation of ``Hot Honey Rag'' just 
isn't in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its length, it's hard not to come away from ``Fosse''  
hungering for more. Not for the arty, abstract creations that stuff 
this show, but for the original musicals Fosse helped create and 
his dances that made them soar.

<HEADLINE> New Committee Gives Selig Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- By establishing yet another economic  
study committee, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has given 
hard-liners a forum to vent and himself time to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teams wants massive change in the collective bargaining  
agreement. To other clubs, afraid of another long industry shutdown 
in 2002, he can say no action has been taken to provoke the players 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we can take another work stoppage,'' Selig  
said after announcing the ``Blue Ribbon Task Force on Baseball 
Economics'' on Wednesday night. ``We need different ways to solve 
our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many baseball owners are looking enviously at the NBA, which got  
its players to agree last week to the first salary maximums among 
the four major pro sports in North America: $9 million for players 
with 1-5 years of experience, $11 million for players with 6-9 
years and $14 million for players with 10 years of more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think each situation is unique,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the  
owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the NBA's Phoenix Suns. ``But 
I think it's useful to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources familiar with the committee, speaking on the  
condition they not be identified, said Selig formed the panel to 
appease those owners calling for change in the wake of Kevin 
Brown's $105 million, seven-year contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, which made him baseball's first $100 million player. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig can either listen to the panel's recommendations and use  
them as a basis for bargaining proposals following the 2001 season, 
or ignore them, claiming they would provoke baseball players, who 
have the most powerful union in sports, one that has given few 
concessions during eight work stoppages since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The players association has repeatedly made it clear that it  
won't accept a team salary cap or individual payroll maximums in 
any shape or form the owners can conceive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt baseball owners would prefer to have the NBA  
deal,'' Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players association, 
said Thursday. ``But they have to understand there is a particular 
history there and there is a particular environment in this 
industry. It's just not in the cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four outsiders picked for the panel all have ties to  
baseball management: 
</P>
<P>
	-- George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader from 1989-94 and  
current head of a panel investigating alleged bribes involving the 
awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City, was 
mentioned five years ago as a possible candidate for commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from  
August 1979-August 1987, was head of the independent study panel 
appointed jointly by owners and the union following the 1990 spring 
training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yale president Richard Levin, an economics professor, came up  
with baseball's original salary cap proposal during collective 
bargaining following the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Television commentator George Will, an author of two baseball  
books, is on the boards of the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	While the last study committee was a joint endeavor with the  
union, this one is unilateral. The independent members will be 
joined by Selig, the chairman, vice chairs John Harrington of the 
Boston Red Sox and Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, and 11 
other team officials: Bill DeWitt (St. Louis), Dick Jacobs 
(Cleveland), Larry Lucchino (San Diego), Andy MacPhail (Chicago 
Cubs), John McHale (Detroit), Kevin McClatchy (Pittsburgh), Dave 
Montgomery (Philadelphia), Vince Naimoli (Tampa Bay), Tom Schieffer 
(Texas) and Tony Tavares and Sandy Litvack (Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
	Notably missing are representatives from many of baseball's  
biggest spenders: Baltimore, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The last study commission issued a majority report in 1994  
written by Volcker; then-Rockefeller Foundation chairman Peter 
Goldmark; and David Feller, a law professor at the University of 
California. They recommended the elimination of salary arbitration 
and lowering the service time needed for free agency to three years 
from six, but didn't propose a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	It also recommended owners start sharing ticket receipts and  
local broadcast money, a step that began in 1996 under a plan that 
won't go into full effect until 2000.

	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A woman allegedly punched another

	Ms. Canales then bent her license plate to prevent Ms. Vedovelli  
from reading it and pushed her in front of a car, which ran over 
her foot, police said. Ms. Vedovelli was treated at a hospital and

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Temp Contract Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An angry federal judge Thursday admonished  
Microsoft Corp. lawyers for language recently added to contracts 
for temporary workers that would waive their right to any future 
court-ordered additional pay or benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour called the contract  
language ``outrageously arrogant'' and dismissed Microsoft lawyers' 
defense that it covers only future work for the company. Coughenour 
said damages typically continue to accrue right up to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract workers filed a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft  
in 1992 over their status, claiming the company treated them as 
full-time workers in every regard except compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has not disclosed how many temporary employees it has,  
but estimates put the number near 5,000, with contracts that often 
run three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that  
Microsoft should have allowed contract workers to take part in a 
stock-purchase plan in which employees can buy stock at a 15 
percent discount. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was referred back to U.S. District Judge Carolyn  
Dimmick here. Last fall, she limited the scope of the case to 
include only people who worked at Microsoft from 1987 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers have appealed that ruling, but in the  
meantime filed a new class-action lawsuit to cover those excluded 
from the earlier lawsuit. Coughenour is overseeing the second 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as their existing contracts expire, the company  
recently began requiring temporary workers to sign new contracts 
that plaintiffs contend illegally waives their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreements contain a sentence which reads: ``Even if a  
court or government agency determines that temporary personnel and 
Microsoft have had a common law employer-employee relationship at 
any time, temporary personnel ... will not be entitled to receive 
... any different or additional pay, or any benefits, insurance 
coverage, tax payments or withholding, or compensation of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare move, Coughenour called today's hearing rather than  
waiting for the plaintiffs' lawyers to seek it. 
</P>
<P>
	After debating Microsoft lawyer James Oswald over the language,  
Coughenour recessed the hearing until Jan. 26 ``to give lawyers a 
chance to suggest to their clients that they do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach declined to say whether the  
company would remove the language from its contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously going to take the judge's comments under  
consideration,'' Leach said, adding that Microsoft always complies 
with court orders.

	Impeachment Trial Ends First Day  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors on Thursday demanded  
President Clinton's removal from office, charging he had ``piled 
perjury upon perjury'' and obstructed justice. Senate Republican 
leaders suggested Clinton might be invited to testify at his 
impeachment trial. Inside the Senate chamber, the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years trial unfolded in an 
atmosphere of uncommon gravity. ``Failure to bring President 
Clinton to account ... will cause a cancer to be present in our 
society for generations,'' asserted Wisconsin Republican James 
Sensenbrenner. Clinton spent the day at the White House, preparing 
for next week's State of the Union address. 

</P>
<P>
	World Reacts to Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Congress put President Clinton on trial before the  
eyes of the world today, but much of the international audience was 
looking the other way. Turmoil in financial markets following 
Brazil's dramatic currency devaluation grabbed headlines and 
overshadowed the opening of Clinton's impeachment trial. Mexican 
news media paid little attention to Clinton. Austrian radio ignored 
the Washington spectacle to focus on the big European Union story -- 
a vote of confidence over allegations of fraud and nepotism within 
the European Commission. But by Friday morning, the impeachment 
trial grabbed the lead-story position in many British dailies. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Proposes Cigarette Tax Hike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who has been rolling out a  
series of spending initiatives, will propose paying for them with a 
new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax, an administration official said. 
The cigarette tax would raise some $8 billion for the domestic 
spending initiatives, according to the official. Congressional 
Republicans, however, have consistently warned Clinton against 
paying for his plans with increased taxes, including cigarette 
taxes. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Eyes Lifting Iraq Oil Cap  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States today proposed to let  
Baghdad sell unlimited amounts of oil -- but only if the proceeds go 
to buy food and other humanitarian supplies for Iraqis. The U.S. 
proposal would remove those limits on exports and would streamline 
the U.N. bureaucracy, allowing food and medicine contracts to to be 
automatically approved. Both the U.S. plan and a French call to 
lift the oil embargo were intended to jump-start U.N. Security 
Council discussions on the Iraq issue in the aftermath of the 
December airstrikes by U.S. and British forces.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China conceded today that its human rights record  
could be improved, although it also accused its critics of painting 
``a totally dark picture'' of Chinese rights abuses. The mixed 
assessment, delivered by the Foreign Ministry, followed two days of 
talks on human rights in Washington. China has come under heavy and 
repeated criticism from the United States and other countries for 
its recent crackdown on dissidents.

<HEADLINE> Scripps Howard Shakes Up Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dan K. Thomasson is retiring as vice  
president/news for Scripps Howard newspapers and editor of Scripps 
Howard News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being succeeded by Peter Copeland, the news service's  
managing editor, as Washington-based editor and general manager of 
the news service. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasson, 65, has been with Scripps Howard for 40 years,  
serving nearly 35 of those years in Washington. After his 
retirement today, he will continue to write a twice-a-week column 
for the news service. 
</P>
<P>

former editor of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, has been promoted 
to director of editorial policy for the Scripps Howard newspapers. 
He will be responsible for overseeing editorial policy on national 
and international issues for Scripps newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps Howard newspapers and the Scripps Howard News Service  
are operating units of The E.W. Scripps Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasson was a reporter for The Indianapolis Star and the  
Denver Rocky Mountain News, and was political editor of the News 
when he was assigned to Washington by Scripps Howard in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	He became chief congressional correspondent for Scripps Howard  
in 1966 and managing editor of Scripps Howard News Service in 1976. 
In January 1980, he became editor of Scripps Howard News Service 
and chief of the 50-person Washington bureau. He became a vice 
president in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland 41, became managing editor of Scripps Howard News

<HEADLINE> PriceWaterhouse, SEC Reach Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
accused by federal regulators of violating rules requiring 
accountants to remain independent from companies they audit, has 
agreed to a settlement that creates a $2.5 million education fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, which announced the  
settlement Thursday, said some of PricewaterhouseCoopers' 
accountants owned stock in corporations they audited. The SEC said 
the company also agreed to be censured, to improve its procedures 
for monitoring adherence to auditor independence rules and to 
conduct an internal investigation supervised by an outside person. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $2.5 million fund will be used to enhance awareness in  
the accounting profession of the independence rules. 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the merger last July of  
Price Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from its New York City headquarters, the company  
said the settlement came about because ``a few individuals'' in 
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's Tampa, Fla., office had withheld information. 
In the case of the pension fund violations, required procedures 
were not followed, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm accepts responsibility for these incidents,'' the  
statement said. ``We abhor and regret these deviations from firm 
standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers said that while existing rules and  
procedures were stringent, ``we and our clients will benefit from 
the additional measures we will take to make sure this does not 
happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be  
more independent of the companies they audit. Agency officials have 
expressed concern that accounting firms are jeopardizing their 
independence by becoming more financially dependent on the 
lucrative consulting work they do for companies they audit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the PricewaterhouseCoopers case, the SEC alleged that from  
1996 through 1998, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand failed to discover that in 
four instances, some of its accountants owned stock in corporations 
they audited. In 31 cases, the agency said, partners or managers of 
the accounting firm owned stock in corporations that were clients 
of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. 
</P>
<P>
	In another 45 cases, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's retirement plan held  
securities of corporations that were audit clients of Coopers &AMP; 
Lybrand and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the market watchdog agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SEC's rules explicitly forbid accountants from owning  
stock in their audit clients,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard 
Walker said in a statement. ``If auditors are not independent of 
their clients, in fact or perception, the integrity of the 
financial reporting system is jeopardized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came a day after the SEC brought accounting fraud  
charges against the former top managers of Broadway theater 
producer Livent Inc., a troubled Canadian company whose productions 
included ``Ragtime'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Killings of Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Anthony Merlino's neighbor thought he was  
peculiar, the way he bragged about shooting birds in the yard, 
gutted a deer on his living room carpet and left dead ducks lying 
around his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	But she never imagined the 20-year-old construction worker could  
be involved in the slaughter of 34 wild horses outside Reno last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to think about somebody that they are capable of that  
much killing,'' Melissa Sarenana, who lived next to Merlino for 
more than a year, said Wednesday. ``He seemed like somebody who had 
been picked on his whole life and had to take it out on innocent 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino was arrested Tuesday after the granddaughter of a  
sheriff's department employee overheard a conversation about the 
slaughter at a party, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested were Lance Cpl. Scott Brendle, 21, and Lance Cpl.  
Darien Brock, 20, high school buddies of Merlino who authorities 
said joined the slaughter while home on leave from their bases in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this kind of behavior is in fact true, it doesn't speak  
very highly of a Camp Pendleton Marine,'' said Lt. David Nevers, a 
spokesman at Brock's base. ``We're as disgusted and sickened as 
anyone by this kind of behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horses were shot with rifles, and several limped away and  
lay dying when authorities found them and put them out of their 
misery. A reward fund grew to $35,000 as hundreds of tips about the 
Dec. 27 shootings came in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing the number of everyday people that were  
interested in helping us,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Bill Petty. ``I've 
been getting checks for $5 and $10 from as far away as Florida and 
Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino was charged with offenses including grand larceny and  
maiming, poisoning or killing another person's animal. He was 
jailed on $60,000 bail and scheduled to be arraigned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	His Nevada hunting license was revoked last year after a state  
game warden saw him shoot a federally protected hawk, Nevada 
Wildlife Division spokesman Chris Healy said. Merlino also was 
cited in December 1997 for illegally trapping and killing a kit 
fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sick. He was bizarre. He was really disgusting. I don't  
know any other way to put it,'' Ms. Sarenana said. ``He'd leave 
dead ducks around the house all the time. I mean, for days at a 
time he would leave animals on their kitchen counter.''

<HEADLINE> Nine IOC Members Face Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Nine IOC members face possible  
expulsion for ``serious'' offenses in the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal and four others face minor charges, the Olympics' top 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch declined to identify the  
members or their offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Samaranch was less  
than categorical on whether the 2002 Winter Games would definitely 
stay in Salt Lake City, saying it was the IOC's ``hope'' and 
``desire'' that they go ahead in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he has no intention of resigning as long as he has  
the support of the rest of the committee. He plans to stay in 
office ``until the last minute'' of his term in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC sent letters this week demanding  
explanations from the 13 members implicated in the inquiry. He said 
four members had replied; the deadline is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said some of those members may ask to appear before a  
six-man investigative panel when it meets in Lausanne on Jan. 23. 
The panel will report to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	If investigators recommend that members be expelled, the board  
will suspend them immediately, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual expulsion must wait until the full IOC meets next June in  
Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, expulsion requires a two-thirds  
majority vote of the IOC session. However, any members facing 
expulsion would be free to resign before then, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was still uncertain what action would be taken  
against members cited for minor violations. He said official 
warnings were possible, but he ruled out fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke for 40 minutes in his first one-on-one interview  
with the international media since the biggest corruption scandal 
in Olympic history broke last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had wonderful years,'' he said. ``We had very successful  
games. And now we are in a storm.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC has three priorities: close the Salt Lake  
City scandal, adopt special measures for the bidding on the 2006 
Winter Olympics; and change the voting procedure for all future 
site selections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system we have today is not working,'' he said. ``We have  
to change the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the changes could include selection of Olympic cities by  
the executive board or another small group, or conducting an open 
election among the 115 rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch appointed a high-level IOC panel last month to  
investigate allegations that IOC members received cash payments, 
scholarships, free medical care, lavish gifts and other inducements 
from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven IOC members have been linked with the Salt Lake  
City investigation by Olympic officials, investigators, press 
reports or the members themselves -- Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of 
Congo), David Sibandze (Swaziland), Bashir Attarabulsi (Libya), 
Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Sergio Santander (Chile), Anton Geesink 
(Netherlands) and Pirjo Haeggman (Finland). 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch discounted reports that Salt Lake City may have  
provided prostitutes or female escorts for IOC members, saying he 
had seen and heard nothing to confirm such activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC is considering a code of ethics for its  
members. This would replace the ethics rules drawn up by Swiss 
executive board member Marc Hodler, who rocked the IOC last month 
by alleging widespread corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe (Hodler's rules) are not enough,'' Samaranch said.  
``Maybe for the future, we must think to have an ethics code. This 
is something we are studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top two officials in Salt Lake's organizing committee,  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson, resigned 
last week in the escalating scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had spoken with Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who  
was determined to ``save the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The games must go on,'' Samaranch said. ``The International  
Olympic Committee will do its best to try to put in Salt Lake City 
in 2002 very successful games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could state with 100 percent certainty that the  
games would stay in Salt Lake, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I can speak only on behalf of the International Olympic  
Committee,'' he said. ``The hope, the desire of the IOC, is that 
the games will go on as planned in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has suggested the games could be moved -- or some events  
held at other venues -- if Salt Lake fails to meet its $1.45 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said the IOC had no contingency plans in the event  
Salt Lake organizers face a shortage of sponsorship funds and 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sponsors and public opinion are waiting for the  
reaction of the IOC, how we can clean our house,'' he said. ``The 
reaction will be on the 24th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had no intention of resigning, despite calls  
from several Olympic-related officials in recent days for him to 
accept responsibility for the misconduct that took place during his 
leadership. He has been president since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received many, many letters from members of the IOC  
supporting the IOC, supporting me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he should accept some of the blame for the  
scandal, Samaranch said, ``I think the blame is not only for the 
president, the blame is also for the International Olympic 
Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had nothing unethical by accepting firearms  
from Salt Lake City during the 2002 bid. He said he received a 
pistol and a rifle -- reports put their total worth at more than 
$2,000 -- and put them in a storeroom with other gifts he has 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	Although IOC members are prohibited from accepting gifts with a  
value of more than $150 from bid cities, Samaranch said the rule 
does not apply to him because he does not vote. He said he is 
routinely presented with protocol gifts during his travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the executive board will take up his proposal to  
ban IOC members from visiting Olympic bid cities. These trips, in 
which members are provided first-class flights, luxury hotel 
accommodation and other hospitality, are seen as fraught with 
dangers of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the visits aren't necessary because the IOC has a  
group of experts who inspect the sites and compile a report on the 
logistical and financial merits of each bid. In addition, the 
cities make presentations to the IOC members at the session before 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the executive board will adopt interim measures,  
including a possible ban on visits, for the rest of the 2006 bid 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may call a special session in the next few months to  
get changes adopted by the assembly before the 2006 site is 
selected at the June meeting in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Could Liven Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In ordinary Senate times, it could have been  
called a filibuster. But this was extraordinary, 100 senators 
sitting in unaccustomed silence as House impeachment prosecutors 
opened the repetitive case for the conviction and ouster of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	That would take 67 votes, an outcome neither side could count as  
the trial resumed Thursday. So the Republicans arguing the House 
case for conviction said in turn that the next chapter should 
feature witnesses, Monica Lewinsky and other figures in and around 
the sex and cover-up scandal that brought the first presidential 
impeachment in 131 years, the second ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House does not want witnesses; Clinton's defenders are  
satisfied to have him judged on the evidence produced by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. They argue that it does not 
prove perjury or obstruction of justice, and that if it did, the 
charges against Clinton did not warrant House impeachment and are 
not grounds for Senate conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers said the trial was not supposed to repeat the  
process that led to the Republican-driven impeachment vote, and 
that testimony from the people involved -- including Clinton, one 
suggested -- is essential at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be essential to their chances of changing the prospect  
that at least 34 senators would vote against impeachment, enough to 
acquit him to serve out his term. Only with Ms. Lewinsky on the 
stand to be questioned can the Senate ``fairly and honestly 
determine her credibility,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the prosecutors' case remains essentially the  
one made in the House Judiciary Committee, and again as the House 
voted to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Their opening arguments showed the hurdle involved in making the  
paper case so compelling as to persuade two-thirds of the Senate, 
including at least 12 Democrats, to convict Clinton. All estimates 
at this point are that they need to change minds to do so. That 
will take more than lawyerly repetition of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republican congressmen did so on Thursday, beginning with  
an overview, then reviewing the charges and the evidence piece by 
piece. Five more are taking over today. 
</P>
<P>
	They are lecturers with visual displays, quotes from the law and  
prior testimony, brief videotapes -- one of Clinton swearing the 
oath of office at his first inauguration, another of his vehement, 
finger-wagging televised denial a year ago of the affair he finally 
had to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	No questions, no challenges, no debate. Even the written  
questions senators are entitled to ask are reserved for later. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, an uninterrupted speech or a series of them clears the  
Senate chamber. Some senators drifted out and back during the six 
hours of House arguments, but the 100 seats were full or nearly so 
most of the opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Short on drama, the lead prosecutors were long on oratory about  
the dire impact of acquittal. Rep. Henry Hyde, the Judiciary 
Committee chairman, said oaths of office and of truth would ``never 
be the same,'' their significance crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail in our duty,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner of  
Wisconsin said, ``I fear the difficult and dedicated work done by 
thousands of honorable men and women elected to serve not just here 
but in our state capitals, city halls, courtrooms and school board 
rooms will be swept away in a sea of cynicism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers listened from the defense table, only  
observers until next Tuesday. Then their turn comes. 
</P>
<P>
	Observing, and listening, was wearing.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska praised the House  
prosecutors, but said he was taking cold medication that made him 
drowsy. ``It's tougher than hell to stay awake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Money Market Mutual Fund Assets Up / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds  
rose sharply in the latest week, adding to this year's sizable 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets in retail money market mutual funds rose by $15.11  
billion to $844.98 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the 
Investment Company Institute reported. Assets of institutional 
money market funds rose by $12.03 billion to $581.13 billion for 
the same period, the Washington-based trade group said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain of more than $27 billion followed a rise of  
almost $33 billion in the previous week, which was the sharpest 
gain in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the retail category, assets of the taxable money market funds  
rose by $12.34 billion to $693.84 billion this past week. 
Tax-exempt fund assets rose by $2.77 billion to $151.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Among institutional funds, assets of taxable money market funds  
rose by $12.05 billion to $531.35 billion; assets of the tax-exempt 
funds fell by $19.3 million to $49.78 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.426 trillion for the week,  
up from the previous week's $1.399 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.47 percent from 4.56 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield dipped to 4.53 percent from 4.54 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.57 percent from 4.66  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.63 percent from 4.65 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
55 days, up from 54 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.21 percent as of 
Wednesday unchanged from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
continued to decline, slipping to 0.98 percent from 0.99 percent a 
week earlier.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talk Dominates Rumor Mill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Scottie Pippen will likely have a choice of  
signing with the Houston Rockets or being involved in a 
sign-and-trade deal sending him elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a Latrell Sprewell trade, the top contenders appear to be  
the Miami Heat and New York Knicks, the Associated Press learned 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumor mill was rampant with talk of proposed deals for  
Pippen, McDyess and Tom Gugliotta, the top three players on the 
free agent market, and Sprewell, who will be dealt by the Golden 
State Warriors soon after the lockout is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the expected starting date for the opening of  
training camps -- as well as trades and free agent signings -- will 
be next Tuesday instead of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to numerous league sources who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, these were some of the scenarios regarding each of the 
four most sought after players: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bulls general manager Jerry Krause was trying to set up a  
sign-and-trade transaction involving Pippen, while Pippen was 
pondering whether to exact some revenge in his longstanding feud 
with Krause by signing a free agent contract with Houston starting 
at about $9 million per season, thereby preventing the Bulls from 
getting anything in return. Two of the strongest sign-and-trade 
rumors involved the Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando Magic, with the 
Seattle SuperSonics a longshot. Pippen would only agree to such a 
deal if the Bulls signed him to a contract starting at $10-11 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- McDyess was trying to decide between signing with the Rockets,  
the Bulls, the Denver Nuggets and his old team, the Phoenix Suns. 
Although the Suns could offer McDyess the largest contract over 
seven years, McDyess would receive an opt-out clause making him a 
free agent again after five years. And since the difference between 
what Phoenix could offer over five years versus what the other 
teams could offer would be only $2-3 million, the Suns do not have 
a huge advantage. The Bulls scheduled a meeting with McDyess for 
Monday in Chicago. The Rockets were believed to prefer McDyess over 
Pippen, and the possibility of McDyess rejoining the Nuggets was 
realistic because of his friendship with Denver point guard Nick 
Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Gugliotta was said to be leaning to re-signing with the  
Timberwolves for seven years, since Minnesota can pay him more than 
any other team. The Lakers were believed to have inquired about 
making a sign-and-trade deal involving Gugliotta, Eddie Jones and 
Elden Campbell, but the league's complicated base-year compensation 
rules would prevent such a deal. Houston, Denver and Detroit also 
are interested in Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The long-rumored Sprewell trade scenarios involving the  
Indiana Pacers appeared to be dead, and there were conflicting 
reports over whether the San Antonio Spurs had renewed their 
interest. There was a rumor of Sprewell, Clarence Weatherspoon and 
Bimbo Coles being sent to Miami for Jamal Mashburn, Brent Barry and 
Voshon Lenard or Dan Majerle, but again the base-year compensation 
rules appeared to be a major hindrance. That could leave the Knicks 
as the best contender for Sprewell, although New York was believed 
to be offering a package of Chris Mills and Chris Childs while the 
Warriors were asking for John Starks and-or Charlie Ward to be 
included. The fine print of the sign-and-trade rules, however, 
would prevent Ward from being packaged with another player. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the league, general managers and agents continued to  
be confused by the complexities of the new collective bargaining 
agreement relating to trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers from the league and union have been working the past  
several days to put the agreement in writing, and the lockout will 
remain in effect until the deal is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, every team was trying to gauge every other  
team's probable moves, and everyone was expecting a frenzy of 
activity to commence immediately after the lockout is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possibilities:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bulls free agent center Luc Longley was said to be headed to  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bulls free agent guard Steve Kerr was said to be going to  
Detroit, along with Clippers free agent forward Loy Vaught. The 
Pistons soured on Suns free agent forward Clifford Robinson when he 
asked for a four-year deal starting at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Atlanta Hawks were trying to decide between signing Lakers  
free agent forward Rick Fox and Kings free agent forward Billy 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Bulls were mulling making runs at free agents Jayson  
Williams (Nets), Jerry Stackhouse (Pistons) and Brent Barry (Heat). 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Orlando Magic were again exploring the possibility of  
trading Penny Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Magic free agent guard Derek Harper had received interest from  
the Knicks, Lakers, Rockets, Bucks and Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Clippers free agent center Isaac Austin was said to be  
choosing between Orlando and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks were looking into acquiring Weatherspoon.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Several contenders were trying to get Derrick Coleman to sign  
for the $1.75 million exception, but Coleman was trying to land a 
more lucrative deal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Portland free agent guard Damon Stoudamire was trying to use  
the possibility of signing with the Rockets as leverage to get the 
Trail Blazers to increase their offer.

<HEADLINE> Seattle May Open 2000 in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners, a franchise whose majority  
owner is the Nintendo Corp. of Kobe, Japan, could start off the 
2000 American League season with a series in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Brosnan, director of Major League Baseball International,  
said commissioner Bud Selig's office was talking about the 
possibility of a two- or three-game series matching the Mariners 
and an undetermined opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners would play exhibition games with Japanese teams  
during the final week of spring training, Brosnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fair to say there have been negotiations about playing  
baseball in Japan in the year 2000 and that the Mariners have 
always been a part of that discussion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball officials have said in recent weeks that  
Japanese teams have voiced objections, not wanting to have their 
own season openers overshadowed. Major league baseball would be 
reluctant to go into Japan unless the Japanese teams supported the 
idea, the officials said, speaking on the condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo stepped in and played a key role in keeping the  
Mariners in Seattle when the team was up for sale in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners tried to play in Japan before, but a 1995 date was  
scuttled by the 1994 players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also makes a lot of sense to take a team from the West  
Coast with star power like Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez,'' 
Brosnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey has been to Japan several times, once for Nike and once  
on the annual All-Star trip. Rodriguez went there after the 1997 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' Griffey said. ``The fans were great and it was  
an experience I've always remembered.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights of House Arguments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In arguments made in a rebuttal brief filed today in President  
Clinton's impeachment trial, House prosecutors: 
</P>
<P>
	--Contend that Clinton's written filing in the case ``contains  
numerous factual inaccuracies and misstatements'' and ``discounts 
substantial evidence as well as common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Argue that they need to call witnesses to show Clinton lied and  
has ruined his credibility as president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reject the White House argument that the articles of  
impeachment passed by the House should be dismissed at the outset. 
The prosecutors note that ``the Senate has never granted a motion 
to dismiss or strike an article of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Dismiss Clinton's argument that his removal from office would  
weaken the presidency and American democracy. ``Convicting him and 
thereby reaffirming that criminal behavior that strikes at the 
heart of the justice system will result in removal will serve to 
strengthen the presidency, not weaken it,'' the prosecutors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	--Argue that Clinton is not on trial for having an affair or  
lying to his wife or the American public. He is on trial for lying 
in a court proceeding, they said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Makes Organic Meat Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who want to expand their menu of  
organic foods soon will find organic meat and poultry products on 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department agreed Thursday to allow the labels  
while the agency continues work on national standards for all 
organic foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement means more information and more choice for  
American consumers,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``It 
will help organic family farmers and ranchers further expand their 
already growing markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organic certification generally means no pesticides, herbicides  
or preservatives have been sprayed on the growing fruits or 
vegetables. For livestock, organic producers mostly shun the use of 
antibiotics and confined feeding areas, opting instead to give 
organic animals access to the outdoors, fresh air and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade  
Association, called the decision ``a victory for the organic 
industry and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on this issue for about eight years,''  
DiMatteo said. ``I think people have an interest in having choices 
in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMatteo said consumers will see the first organic meat, poultry  
and egg products in stores by early spring. Certified organic meat 
processors will have to apply to USDA for label approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally grown fruits, vegetables and other products have been  
allowed to carry the organic label for some time. Until Thursday, 
USDA had prohibited the label for meat, which is more strictly 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the disparity and respond to a growing organic  
industry, USDA is developing national standards to cover the entire 
industry. The rules would replace a hodgepodge of state and private 
certification programs that sometimes differ on their definition of 
organic. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman chose to allow meat labels in the interim, partly  
because development of national standards is taking longer than 
expected, officials said. Aides said he also thought the rule would 
provide a boost for organic farmers, who tend to be smaller family 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The organic industry has grown in recent years as more and more  
consumers become worried about health effects of pesticides and 
other chemicals in food and about Earth's ability to sustain 
conventional farming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organic Trade Association estimates that the organic  
industry is growing at least 20 percent a year, with current 
overall sales of about $4.2 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Trading Halted in Brazil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's largest stock market  
was overcome by jitters Thursday, with another Central Bank 
official stepping down and trading temporarily halted after the Sao 
Paulo index fell 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller Rio de Janeiro market also plunged 9 percent in  
continuing repercussions a day after the Central Bank president 
resigned and Brazil decided to let its currency slide against the 
U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market movements were a clear reflection of  
the country's financial fragility, which includes fears of another, 
larger devaluation and rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets are overreacting and simply panicking,'' said  
Alexander Azara, an analyst for BBA Paraiba bank in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's action raised fears that the 18-month financial crisis  
that has battered Asia and Russia has not gone away and could bring 
down other economies in Latin America. Traders also worry that U.S. 
multinational companies operating in Brazil could take a big profit 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears led to a second day of selling on Wall Street. The  
Dow Jones fell 228.63 points to close at 9,120.93, which on top of 
Wednesday's 125-point loss puts the index below where it began the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sao Paulo, the market was up in the morning after closing 5  
percent lower Wednesday but turned steeply lower in the afternoon, 
setting off a circuit-breaker that automatically halted trading for 
30 minutes near the end of the day. The market ended at its low for 
the day, off 9.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was spooked by unconfirmed rumors that  
some local hedge funds were having problems, coupled with the 
resignation of the Central Bank's director for banking system 
supervision, Claudio Mauch. Mauch said his resignation on Thursday 
had been planned for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uncertainty and panic that shook world markets was a  
natural reaction,'' said Maria Lucia Rangel Filardo, an economist 
at the University of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	She said investor confidence should return in the next few days  
``when people realize the devaluation was a minor economic policy 
change needed to push interest rates down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markets worldwide reacted Wednesday with steep losses. On  
Thursday they were higher in Japan, lower elsewhere in Asia and 
mixed in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Argentina, Buenos Aires stocks that closed off  
8.8 percent a day earlier fell 4.1 percent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's stock market rallied from a morning drop and closed up  
for the first time since the year began. The market gained 56.17 
points over the day to end at 3356.59. 
</P>
<P>
	About $2.3 billion in currency outflows has left Brazil in the  
past two days, the Central Bank reported Thursday -- and there were 
fears the outflow could worsen. Since Brazil's economic problems 
began in August, investors have pulled $40 billion out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, meanwhile, said  
the United States was ``committed to supporting Brazil while it 
works through a difficult economic time'' and called on its 
government to carry out a ``strong, credible economic program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Washington was in touch with Brazilian officials and  
the IMF, and was watching world markets. ``Brazil's financial 
stability and prosperity are extremely important to the United 
States and our entire hemisphere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Central Bank chief Gustavo Franco resigned and his  
replacement, Francisco Lopes, announced that the Brazilian 
currency, the real, would trade in a wider band against the dollar. 
His move effectively devalued the currency by about 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency traded Thursday at the bottom of the  
range, at 1.32 reals to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say the government should have devalued the  
currency by twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main question now is whether the government will have to  
seriously consider a devaluation of around 15 percent or so,'' said 
Silvio Camargo, head of institutional equity sales at Sao Paulo's 
Banco Fator. 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation prompted the Senate on Wednesday to approve a  
presidential decree raising corporate income taxes, a measure 
expected to yield $3.8 billion this year. It also approved a 
measure reducing long-term interest rates to 12 percent a year from 
19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But other key measures, which also are more controversial, will  
only be voted on next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts agree that Brazil, a major U.S. trade partner and Latin  
America's largest economy, must get things back on track quickly if 
it is to attract foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and other international lenders in November came up with a  
$41.5 billion aid package. But to get that money, Brazil had to 
commit to trimming $23 million from its deficit in 1999, a task 
made more difficult during economic uncertainty.

<HEADLINE> Kidman, Spacey Lead Olivier Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Nicole Kidman, Kevin Spacey and an acclaimed  
London revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic musical 
``Oklahoma!'' led the 1999 nominees Thursday for the Laurence 
Olivier Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, the rough equivalent of Broadway's Tony Awards,  
honor the best in London theater, opera and dance during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In her London stage debut, Kidman received one of six  
nominations afforded ``The Blue Room,'' the David Hare adaptation 
of Arthur Schnitzler's daisy chain of love and lust ``La Ronde,'' 
which has gone on to be a Broadway sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	The leggy wife of Tom Cruise and star of such films as ``To Die  
For'' and ``Portrait Of A Lady,'' Kidman leads a strong race for 
best actress that includes two Dames -- Judi Dench in ``Filumena'' 
and Diana Rigg for ``Britannicus'' and ``Phedre'' -- as well as 
Sinead Cusack in ``Our Lady of Sligo'' and Eileen Atkins in ``The 
Unexpected Man''. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidman's ``Blue Room'' co-star, Scottish actor Iain Glen, is up  
for best actor against Michael Gambon in ``The Unexpected Man,'' 
David Suchet in ``Amadeus,'' Jim Norton in ``The Weir,'' and clear 
front-runner Kevin Spacey, for his marathon performance as the 
salesman Hickey in the Broadway-bound revival of Eugene O'Neill's 
``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sexually charged ``Blue Room'' will compete for best play  
against ``Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's somber meditation on the 
origins of the H-bomb; ``The Weir,'' Irishman Conor McPherson's 
gentle examination of love and loss in rural Ireland; and Yasmina 
Reza's ``The Unexpected Man,'' which tells of the chance meeting 
aboard a train between a well-known writer and his No. 1 fan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was English director Trevor Nunn's fresh take on the  
musical warhorse ``Oklahoma!'' that got the most nominations -- nine 
in all -- including best musical production; best director for Nunn; 
best set by Anthony Ward; best lighting by David Hersey and best 
choreography by Susan Stroman. 
</P>
<P>
	Four cast members -- Hugh Jackman, Josefina Gabrielle, Shuler  
Hensley, and Jimmy Johnston -- also were nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up in the musical production category are three other  
London revivals of Broadway shows: ``Into the Woods,'' ``Annie'' 
and ``Show Boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consistent Broadway sellout, the late Jonathan Larson's  
``Rent'' is among the nominees for best new musical. It goes up 
against ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' the critically derided new show 
from Andrew Lloyd Webber; ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the first stage 
version of the smash 1977 movie; and ``Kat and the Kings,'' a 
high-energy South African import by David Kramer and Taliep 
Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire South African cast of ``Kat and the Kings'' received  
a collective nomination for best actor in a musical. Their

<HEADLINE> Kidman, Spacey Lead Olivier Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Nicole Kidman, Kevin Spacey and an acclaimed  
London revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic musical 
``Oklahoma!'' led the 1999 nominees Thursday for the Laurence 
Olivier Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, the rough equivalent of Broadway's Tony Awards,  
honor the best in London theater, opera and dance during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In her London stage debut, Kidman received one of six  
nominations afforded ``The Blue Room,'' the David Hare adaptation 
of Arthur Schnitzler's daisy chain of love and lust ``La Ronde,'' 
which has gone on to be a Broadway sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	The leggy wife of Tom Cruise and star of such films as ``To Die  
For'' and ``Portrait Of A Lady,'' Kidman leads a strong race for 
best actress that includes two Dames -- Judi Dench in ``Filumena'' 
and Diana Rigg for ``Britannicus'' and ``Phedre'' -- as well as 
Sinead Cusack in ``Our Lady of Sligo'' and Eileen Atkins in ``The 
Unexpected Man''. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidman's ``Blue Room'' co-star, Scottish actor Iain Glen, is up  
for best actor against Michael Gambon in ``The Unexpected Man,'' 
David Suchet in ``Amadeus,'' Jim Norton in ``The Weir,'' and clear 
front-runner Kevin Spacey, for his marathon performance as the 
salesman Hickey in the Broadway-bound revival of Eugene O'Neill's 
``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sexually charged ``Blue Room'' will compete for best play  
against ``Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's somber meditation on the 
origins of the H-bomb; ``The Weir,'' Irishman Conor McPherson's 
gentle examination of love and loss in rural Ireland; and Yasmina 
Reza's ``The Unexpected Man,'' which tells of the chance meeting 
aboard a train between a well-known writer and his No. 1 fan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was English director Trevor Nunn's fresh take on the  
musical warhorse ``Oklahoma!'' that got the most nominations -- nine 
in all -- including best musical production; best director for Nunn; 
best set by Anthony Ward; best lighting by David Hersey and best 
choreography by Susan Stroman. 
</P>
<P>
	Four cast members -- Hugh Jackman, Josefina Gabrielle, Shuler  
Hensley, and Jimmy Johnston -- also were nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up in the musical production category are three other  
London revivals of Broadway shows: ``Into the Woods,'' ``Annie'' 
and ``Show Boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consistent Broadway sellout, the late Jonathan Larson's  
``Rent'' is among the nominees for best new musical. It goes up 
against ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' the critically derided new show 
from Andrew Lloyd Webber; ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the first stage 
version of the smash 1977 movie; and ``Kat and the Kings,'' a 
high-energy South African import by David Kramer and Taliep 
Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire South African cast of ``Kat and the Kings'' received  
a collective nomination for best actor in a musical. Their 
competition starts with American expatriate Clarke Peters in 
``Chicago,'' as well as two London-based Australians -- Adam Garcia, 
who stepped into John Travolta's dancing shoes in ``Saturday Night 
Fever,'' and Jackman, the golden-voiced Curly in ``Oklahoma!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nominated for best supporting performance, male or female, in a  
musical is ``Rent'' co-star Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who won a Tony 
Award for playing the transvestite Angel on Broadway. He left the

<HEADLINE> Two Weeks Changed Anderson's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Gary Anderson was a wide-eyed South  
African teen-ager who moved to America with dreams of being a 
college soccer star. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights later, someone casually mentioned ``this guy they  
call the kicker,'' and Anderson's life was changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dizzying sequence of events in the next two weeks, Anderson  
was whisked from a small-town high school football field to an NFL 
training camp and four big-time colleges. He finally settled at 
Syracuse, beginning the career that, 20 years later, has made him 
the Minnesota Vikings' perfect kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to tell people that if I have any claim to fame, I  
may be the only football player who, the first game of football 
that I actually saw, I played in,'' said Anderson, the only NFL 
kicker to ever go through a regular season without missing an extra 
point or field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	He puts that record on the line again Sunday in the NFC  
championship game against Atlanta in the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson's first two weeks in the United States came in the  
summer of 1978. ``Grease'' was the big hit movie. Jimmy Carter was 
in the White House. The Vikings' ``Purple People Eaters'' dynasty 
was crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 18 when my family emigrated to America and knew nothing  
at all about American football,'' Anderson remembered. ``I had 
contacts here soccer-wise to go to college on a soccer 
scholarship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They had dinner with a couple of friends two nights later. The  
conversation turned to football -- American style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got around somehow, I guess with our soccer background, to  
talking about this guy they called the kicker,'' Anderson said. 
``Then they explained, `All this guy does is kick and then he comes 
and stands on the sidelines and watches the rest of the game.' So I 
think my next question was, `Well, what does one of these footballs 
look like.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny you should ask, Gary.  
</P>
<P>
	One of those friends showed up the next morning at the Anderson  
home in Downingtown, Pa., about 45 minutes outside of Philadelphia, 
with three footballs. Anderson, his dad and the friend went up to 
the local high school field to ``see what one of these American 
footballs flew like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Anderson was booting a few through the uprights, the high  
school football coach happened to be driving by. Figuring he knew 
every kid in town and not recognizing the kid with the big leg, the 
coach strolled out to the field to try to recruit Anderson to play 
for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, coach. Just finished high school overseas.  
</P>
<P>
	The serendipity didn't end there, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was very fortunate,'' Anderson said. ``He was a friend of  
Dick Vermeil, who was the head coach of the Eagles at the time. 
``And he set it up for me the following day, my fourth day in 
America, to go and have a tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles, who 
have training camp in a neighboring town of West Chester.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil took one look at the boyish 5-foot-9 kid and knew he  
needed a few pointers on how football players do things here in 
America. Vermeil explained that you have to go to college before 
you can play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vermeil had put out the word that some kicking prodigy was  
going to be at camp that day. Scouts from Georgia, Tennessee, 
Indiana and Syracuse were there, and Vermeil took Anderson to the 
practice field to kick for 20 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	All four coaches offered Anderson a scholarship on the spot.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, an 18-year-old kid from South Africa isn't likely to know  
Athens, Ga., from Bloomington, Ind., so Anderson and his father 
spent the next two weeks flying to the four schools to check them 
out. He liked Syracuse the best -- if only he'd known about the 
snow; the Orangemen didn't move into the Carrier Dome until his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he got the football coach to promise he'd also be allowed  
to play soccer -- ``That was actually in writing at the end of the 
football scholarship,'' Anderson said -- he signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson spent the next four years trotting across campus on  
autumn Saturdays. Soccer in the morning, football in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never understand why the football coach seemed to be  
so worried about that,'' Anderson said. ``I didn't understand 
anything about this game of football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, Anderson's senior season at Syracuse was the only  
time he played in a dome before coming to Minnesota. How'd he do? 
</P>
<P>
	He was 18-for-19.

<HEADLINE>  Historic Impeachment Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a jury of 100 silent senators, House  
prosecutors charged Thursday that President Clinton ``piled perjury 
upon perjury'' and obstructed justice to conceal a sexual affair. 
They demanded his removal from office in the first presidential 
impeachment trial in 131 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to bring President Clinton to account ... will cause a  
cancer to be present in our society for generations,'' asserted 
Wisconsin Republican James Sensenbrenner, standing in the well of 
the historic Senate chamber to address the senators and a 
nationwide television audience counted in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 42nd president was in the White House, preparing  
for next Tuesday's State of the Union address, when Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist rapped the gavel and announced that the Senate 
would ``convene as a court of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeant-at-Arms James Ziglar admonished all to remain silent  
``on pain of imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silent they were, the senators at their seats; those spectators  
lucky -- or influential -- enough to have space in the galleries 
above; the president's lawyers and House prosecutors seated around 
separate custom-made curved tables at the base of the rostrum and 
Rehnquist, presiding in his judicial robe. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of two brief breaks, the trial remained in  
session until after dark as a string of House Republicans laid out 
their evidence. They buttressed their presentation with numerous 
images of Clinton on videotape, many of them of his testimony 
before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is,''  
Clinton was seen to say in one snippet, a now-famous utterance that 
his critics have seized on as evidence of legal hairsplitting -- or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman James Kennedy attacked the Republican case  
even as it continued. It is ``both unsubstantial and 
circumstantial,'' he said. ``We look forward to presenting our 
defense based on the facts, the law and the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner's Midwestern monotone belied the gravity of the  
moment. The Founding Fathers wrote impeachment into the 
Constitution as a way of reining in a corrupt chief executive, but 
their script has been played out this far only once before -- in the 
case of Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted by a single vote in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day wore on, prosecutors moved methodically through the  
minutiae of the case. Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, for example, 
led senators through a series of timelines that cross-referenced 
telephone calls by the president with actions taken by other 
principals in the case, evidence, he said, of a frantic effort on 
the chief executive's part to keep his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest by the television networks dwindled.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice for  
attempting to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, the former 
White House intern. He has admitted to an improper relationship, 
but he and his lawyers maintain that the charges, even if proven, 
do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	His trial is expected to last at least two more weeks -- far  
longer if the Senate agrees to the House's demand to call witnesses 
and if the White House's follow-up request for a long delay to 
prepare is also approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The House pressed its case for witnesses during the day, as  
Hutchinson, Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Rep. James Rogan of 
California urged the Senate to grant their request to summon Ms. 
Lewinsky, at a minimum, to testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had floated the possibility on Wednesday of seeking  
Clinton's testimony. The White House has said repeatedly there are 
no plans for that. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House on Thursday, Press Secretary Joe Lockhart  
sharply accused the House of making a case so partisan ``it isn't 
on the level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee, went first for the prosecutors. ``We are here, Mr. Chief 
Justice and distinguished senators, as advocates for the rule of 
law, for equal justice under the law and for the sanctity of the 
oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and others put Clinton's oath of office -- and his alleged  
violation of it -- at the heart of the case against him. Senators 
were twice shown videotaped snippets of Clinton raising his hand 
and swearing an oath: first on Inauguration Day in 1993 and then 
when he testified in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his presentation, Sensenbrenner laid out the familiar  
allegations: that Clinton had lied before Starr's grand jury, had 
lied in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and had taken a 
variety of actions to obstruct Starr's investigation. According to 
the accusations, these included coaching his secretary, Betty 
Currie, to give false testimony, to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in 
New York, and to encourage her to give false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show that the president piled perjury upon  
perjury,'' Sensenbrenner said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking a pillar of the White House defense argument,  
Sensenbrenner argued that perjury is an impeachable offense. He 
cited the case of judicial impeachments in the Senate, one as 
recently as 1989. ``The truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. 
There cannot be different levels of truth for judges than for 
presidents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defense lawyers -- including private attorney  
David E. Kendall as well as Charles Ruff and Bruce Lindsey of the 
White House counsel's office -- listened attentively, some of them 
writing notes. Their turn to argue before the court of impeachment 
will come next week, coincidentally on the day of the State of the 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, senators sat quietly at their seats, adhering  
carefully to the suggested rules of decorum. Some leafed through 
notebooks containing impeachment material, others simply sat at 
gleaming, clean desks listening intently. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mere presence as silent participants was remarkable.  
Customarily, only a few senators are on the floor at a time, and 
when they all converge to vote, the chamber is filled with dozens 
of conversations proceeding simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Rehnquist made one personal announcement. He  
wanted all parties to know he would ``stand on occasion to stretch 
my back,'' and didn't intend for the proceedings to be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Chaplain Lloyd J. Ogilvie offered a prayer, asking for a  
``special measure of wisdom for the men and women'' who hold 
Clinton's fate in their hands. Then he, too, took a seat along the 
rear of the chamber and sat back to watch history. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner appealed to senators not to shrink from a task  
made tougher by the ``public opinion polls, the popularity and 
unpopularity of individuals, even questions over the strength of 
our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to the political subtext to the entire  
impeachment proceedings, in which Clinton has been buoyed by high 
poll ratings, even in the wake of embarrassing disclosures about 
his personal life.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Falls Behind in Climate Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has fallen behind other  
countries in developing complex computer models of the weather, 
simulations that are crucial to predicting the effects of climate 
change, the National Research Council warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``To understand how climate change might affect people ... we  
want to understand it at the level of counties, how it's going to 
affect my city, and the U.S. hasn't leveraged the resources 
together to achieve this as effectively as the Europeans have,'' 
study director Peter Schultz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States still is a leader in many aspects of climate  
modeling, but in terms of being able to produce these high 
resolution simulations of climate change we are falling behind,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current leader in computer power to generate these models is  
the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, 
England, according to the NRC study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another is the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and  
Analysis,'' Schultz said in a telephone interview. ``The Germans 
are doing some leading work, the Australians, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Climate models are complex computer programs that use  
mathematical formulas to explain how the weather works. Scientists 
can make changes in the initial weather conditions in the model, 
run through the formulas and see what happens to the climate hours, 
days or years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The models divide the world into grids and the smaller the grids  
the more accurate they are in simulating the actual weather. But 
smaller grids mean millions more calculations per second for each 
little change, requiring more and more computer power. 
</P>
<P>
	The models in use in the United States are among the best in  
forecasting conditions in grids larger than 2.8 degrees of latitude 
by 2.8 degrees of longitude, while the finer models get down to 
about 2 degrees each way. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, ``there is no integrated national  
strategy'' coordinating the climate modeling efforts, Schultz 
explained. ``What we have in the U.S. are several different 
modeling centers,'' including the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research in Boulder, Colo., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton 
University and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	While the three labs try to cooperate, Schultz said, better  
coordination would be valuable ``in terms of producing the 
simulations that are of value to policy-makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of climate change has been widely debated in  
recent years. Many scientists are concerned that the so-called 
greenhouse warming, caused by industrial gases released into the 
atmosphere, could cause the Earth to overheat. Other scientists say 
the threat remains unproved. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides duel over the results produced by various computer  
models in forecasting how climate might change in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study notes that while the Energy Department has a plan  
for increasing U.S. climate modeling capacity, the project has not 
been funded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``Capacity of U.S. Climate Modeling to Support  
Climate Change Assessment Activities,'' was produced by the climate 
research committee of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate 
at the National Research Council, an affiliate of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> NBC Movie Upsets Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- NBC has gotten on the bad side of Jesse  
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The new governor of Minnesota is upset that the network is  
producing a made-for-television movie about him without his 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely disappointed that the NBC network has decided  
to produce an unauthorized movie about my life. It appears they 
have put ratings above accuracy and honesty,'' the former pro 
wrestler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC spokeswoman did not return a phone call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	NBC had approached Ventura about the movie idea after his  
surprise election as governor, NBC affiliate KARE-TV reported. But 
Ventura said he wanted any movie to wait until after a book about 
him is released this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC decided to go ahead anyway, scheduling the broadcast for May  
23.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Top Pick Fouls Out in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi is not having his way  
in European basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft fouled out with six minutes  
left in regulation Thursday and his Kinder Bologna lost to a 74-72 
double-overtime loss to cross-city rival TeamSystem in a Euro 
League playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, whose NBA rights are held by the Los Angeles  
Clippers, finished with six points and seven rebounds in 22 
minutes. He signed with the defending European club champions right 
before the NBA lockout was resolved, and has an escape clause that 
allows him to leave Kinder Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another player who went overseas because of the lockout, Vinny  
Del Negro, also struggled Thursday, scoring two points in 13 
minutes for TeamSystem. The San Antonio Spurs guard can return to 
the NBA after Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder Bologna is 1-2 since Olowokandi joined the team, and he's  
averaging 11.3 points and nine rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi went to the bench Thursday after picking up his  
fourth foul with 11:47 left. When coach Ettore Messina put the 
7-foot-1 center back on the floor five minutes later, Olowokandi 
was whistled for an offensive foul the first time he touched the 
ball and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	European pro games are 40 minutes, and players get five fouls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lithuanian Arturas Karnisovas, a Seton Hall product, led  
TeamSystem with 18 points, including the winning free throws with 
four seconds left in the second OT.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Religious Landlords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Religious landlords can refuse to rent to  
unmarried couples, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday in an 
Alaska case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld  
a federal judge's ruling in favor of two Anchorage landlords who 
said their Christian beliefs forbade them to rent to unmarried 
people living together. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came despite the state of Alaska's ban on housing  
discrimination based on marital status. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday's ruling stands, it will be binding on federal  
courts in Alaska, California and seven other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain said the Alaska law, and a  
similar ordinance in Anchorage, interfered with property owners' 
free exercise of religion as well as their property rights and 
freedom of speech.

<HEADLINE> First Union Posts Earnings Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- First Union Corp., the nation's sixth  
biggest banking company, posted a 49 percent increase Thursday in 
its fourth-quarter profit, citing strong growth from its recent 
merger and increased fees. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union earned $857 million, or 87 cents per diluted share,  
for the three months ending Dec. 31 including merger-related and 
restructuring charges. That's up from $576 million, or 60 cents a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Its operating earnings were up 34 percent to $993 million, or $1  
a share. That was a penny higher than then 99 cents per share 
average that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But in trading on a sharply declining New York Stock Exchange,  
First Union gave up early gains and finished down $1.43 3/4 at $61 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte-based First Union acquired CoreStates Financial Corp.  
last April. Its assets amounted to $237 billion at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our record 1998 performance clearly underscores our progress  
in building a new kind of financial services company,'' said Edward 
E. Crutchfield, First Union's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, the bank earned $2.89 billion, or $2.95 a share, a  
7 percent gain over the $2.7 billion, or $2.80, earned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Wachovia Corp., which is headquartered in  
Winston-Salem, reported a profit of $241 million, or $1.17 a share, 
for the final three months of 1998, up from $3.6 million, or 2 
cents a share, in the last three months of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 quarterly results included special charges of $303  
million in merger-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results fell short of the $1.19 a share average  
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call. Its shares closed down 
$1.93 3/4 a share at $87.50 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Wachovia's net income was $874 million, or $4.18  
per share, up from $593 million, or $2.92 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	L.M. Baker Jr., Wachovia's chief executive, cited strong revenue  
growth in fee income and net interest income for both the quarter 
and year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted Wachovia completed mergers with strategic banking  
partners in Virginia and Florida, moved forward with technology 
enhancements and expanded consumer and corporate banking 
initiatives in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Its assets were $63.9 billion at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Blanc Wins Snowboarding Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- Isabelle Blanc of France, taking  
advantage of a late mistake by American Rosey Fletcher, won the 
parallel giant slalom gold medal Thursday in the World Snowboarding 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher led .30 seconds after the first of two runs in the  
final and was within six gates of winning the gold when she 
faltered, giving Blanc all the opening she needed to claim the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``In dual racing, you have to stay powerful the whole day and  
Isabelle was just a bit more powerful than me today,'' the 
Girdwood, Alaska product said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she just missed the gold, the silver was a nice  
consolation prize for Fletcher after having fallen in the 
individual GS on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was definitely fired up,'' Fletcher said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why, but I've always tended to do well in  
duals,'' she added. ``It just fires me up to hear somebody next to 
me, just keeping strong and keeping your mind focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher got into the final by eliminating Olympic champion  
Karine Ruby, considered the best snowboarder in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's, well, it's Karine Ruby!'' Fletcher said. ``So, yes, I  
was relieved'' when Ruby fell in the first run, giving the American 
all the advantage she needed in the two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Asa Windfahl got the bronze medal.  
</P>
<P>
	Sondra Van Ert of Ketchum, Idaho, bronze medalist in the  
individual GS, was eliminated in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's race, Richard Richardson of Sweden got the gold  
over Austrians Stefan Kaltschuetz, bronze medalist in the 
individual GS, and Harald Walder. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Thorndike of Meredith, N.H., and Jeff Greenwood of Granby,  
Conn., were eliminated in the round of 16.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested in Boy's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police today arrested a man sought for  
questioning in the killing of an 8-year-old boy who was expected to 
testify against him in a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, 26, was found Wednesday at his father's home,  
not far from where Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, 
were slain last week. He was placed under arrest shortly after 
midnight on a charge of possession of a stolen weapon, state police 
Sgt. Scott Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the gun at Peeler's father's home. They had  
actually gone to there looking for Peeler's younger brother, who 
had disappeared from a halfway house and was also sought for 
questioning in the child's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was arraigned today in Superior Court in Bridgeport, and  
a judge set bond at $750,000, requiring that the total amount be 
posted for him to be freed. He remained in custody late this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been free on $900,000 bond in a murder case in which  
Leroy was expected to be a key witness. In that case, he had to 
post only 10 percent, of $90,000, of the bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke and her son were shot to death in their home as they were  
returning from an errand. Their bodies were found Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler is charged in the May 29, 1998, fatal shooting of Rudolph  
Snead Jr. -- Clarke's boyfriend -- and an earlier attempt on his 
life. Leroy identified Peeler as the gunman in a Sept. 2, 1997, 
drive-by shooting, in which Snead was slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Although police have not said the new killings are connected to  
Peeler's murder case, the slayings have sparked outrage about why 
the boy was not protected as a witness. His mother had turned down 
special police protection after a few days, saying it was too 
disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also questioned why Peeler had been free on bond when Leroy  
and his mother were killed. His lawyer has said he was at home at 
the time they were killed, monitored by an electronic bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Connecticut Violent Crime Fugitive Task Force  
also were searching for Peeler's 22-year-old brother, Adrian, who 
was wanted for escaping from a halfway house, Anderson said. He had 
been serving a sentence on drug and child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Mathew Cuminotto Jr. said police want to question  
Adrian about the killings of Leroy and his mother. ``We want to 
question him, we want to question everyone associated with 
(Russell) Peeler,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they raided Peeler's father's home because they were  
told Adrian Peeler had been seen there. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a weapon that had been reported stolen early last  
year from a Milford gun shop, officials told the Connecticut Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had wanted to question Russell Peeler about the slayings  
of Leroy and his mother but would not say whether they knew of his 
whereabouts. While Peeler was under electronic monitoring as part 
of his bond, he was not confined to his home, police said. He was 
never considered missing, Cuminotto said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers confirmed Tuesday that Peeler had been spotted outside  
Clarke's home just days before the slayings, the Connecticut Post 
reported Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police on Thursday arrested a man  
wanted for questioning in the slaying of an 8-year-old boy who was 
going to testify against him in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, 26, was taken into custody by police searching  
for his 22-year-old brother, Adrian, who had escaped from a halfway 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers were being sought for questioning in the slayings  
of 8-year-old Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, who 
were shot in their home last week as they returned from grocery 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, state police issued a news release asking for the  
public's help tracking down Adrian Peeler, considered a fugitive 
from justice. Police said he will be charged with first-degree 
escape and weapons violations that stemmed from the recovery of a 
stolen gun recovered at the Peeler home. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler was arrested shortly after midnight at his  
father's home. State police said they found a stolen shotgun in the 
house and charged Peeler with illegal possession of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was jailed on $750,000 cash bail.  
</P>
<P>
	He had been free on $900,000 bail in a murder case in which  
Leroy -- who was known as B.J. -- was expected to be a key witness. 
In that case, Peeler had to post only 10 percent, or $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler is charged in the shooting death last May of Rudolph  
Snead Jr., Ms. Clarke's boyfriend. Leroy identified Peeler as the 
gunman in an earlier drive-by shooting in which Snead was slightly 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings of Leroy and his mother prompted questions about  
why Peeler was out on bail and why the boy was not under police 
guard as a witness. His mother had turned down police protection 
after a few days, saying she found it intrusive.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Faces Challenge in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter  
was dealt an intimidating challenge when the draw for the 
Australian Open was made at Melbourne Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-seeded Australian, who is struggling so far this year  
after missing the end of the 1998 season with a knee injury, could 
face compatriot Mark Philippoussis in the fourth round in a repeat 
of their U.S. Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Rafter's quarter of the draw are Britain's Tim Henman,  
the unpredictable Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Chang. Chang would 
first have to overcome New Zealander Brett Steven before clashing 
with Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	A doubt remains over how far top seed and 1998 finalist Marcelo  
Rios can progress. The Chilean is suffering from a back injury, and 
his quarter of the draw includes a former finalist Todd Martin, 
big-serving Greg Rusedski and either Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov or 
Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman, who meet up in an intriguing first-round 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-seeded Alex Corretja appears to have to a comfortable run  
to the quarterfinals, with no less than five qualifiers in his 
section of the draw. U.S. Open quarterfinalist Thomas Johansson is 
his likely opponent in the fourth round, with Karol Kucera or 
Richard Krajicek scheduled to meet him in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, who with Philippoussis has drawn the shortest odds  
for claiming the trophy, will be content with a draw that will not 
see him face a major threat until the quarterfinals, where former 
finalist Carlos Moya looms. His main obstacle until then is 
12th-seeded Albert Costa of Spain in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's draw lacks drama in the early stages, with the only  
meaningful clash in the first round coming between 13th seed Irina 
Spirlea and 1996 finalist Anke Huber. 
</P>
<P>
	Top seed Lindsay Davenport has a potentially difficult  
quarterfinal against Venus Williams, while second seed Martina 
Hingis will be expected to get past her quarterfinal with former 
champion but unpredictable Mary Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles, who remains undefeated in four former Australian  
Open campaigns, could face Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals. But 
the unseeded Serena Williams poses a threat in that section of the 
draw, and could meet Seles in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Should results go according to seeding, Rios should play Moya  
and Corretja should face Rafter in the men's semifinals, while 
Davenport is expected to play Jana Novotna and Hingis should take 
on Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the women's singles.

Kukoc hates the thought of mediocrity even more than losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get the team with a few good guys that cannot reach the  
playoffs, they're always short of the playoffs,'' he said and then 
stopped, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Michael Jordan retired, the brutal reality of what  
the Bulls will be like without him is starting to sink in. Only 
four players -- Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are 
under contract, with Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Bulls say they want to bring back Scottie Pippen and  
the rest of the championship team, the prospects of that are 
looking less and less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, one of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for starting center Luc Longley, who appears headed for  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pippen and the rest of the gang do leave, the Bulls would  
have enough money to make some deals in the free-agent market, 
which includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse 
and Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Chicago could pick up a few big names, don't expect  
to be partying in Grant Park any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's certainly 
probably not going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. Regardless of what happens to  
the rest of the championship team, the Bulls still plan to run 
their trademark triangle offense. The system isn't complicated, but 
it's not easy to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable with 
it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other out on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As painful as it might be to watch, this is the best time to  
rebuild if the Bulls are going to do it, Kukoc said. The 
lockout-shortened season will last only three months, so at least 
the agony won't go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls end up with a high draft pick and make some big  
moves in free agency over the summer, they could be well on their 
way to rebuilding a good team by next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, this has been a long time coming, Kukoc said. It's  
better to just get it over with now and move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was not this year, we would be here next year talking  
about the same thing. Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings 
than six, but we would be here and talking about, `What do you 
think about rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that 
it's better to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.''

	House Prosecutors To Make Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors seeking President Clinton's  
removal get to make their case today in a Senate impeachment trial. 
The House ``managers'' will present their evidence without knowing 
whether the Senate will accede to their request for witnesses. The 
chief potential witness, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, 
rejected a House request to interview her. The House case will be 
followed next week by a vigorous White House defense contending 
that Clinton is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of justice.

	U.S. Jet Crashes In Germany  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Rescue workers recovered two bodies  
today and were looking for two others from a U.S. military 
refueling plane that crashed and burned near the German-Dutch 
border, a NATO base spokesman said. The KC-135 Stratotanker, 
assigned temporarily to a NATO base near the northwestern German 
town of Geilenkirchen, was attempting to land after a refueling run 
when it crashed at about 1:30 p.m. EST yesterday, about two miles 
from the base. A crew of four was on board, and all were presumed 
killed, said base spokesman Johan Higmenbrt. The cause of the crash 
was unknown.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Despite Russia's pleas, the International Monetary

Russia, the IMF representative in Moscow said today. The 
representative, Martin Gilman, said that the IMF's $22.6 billion

	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police today arrested a man sought for

testify against him in a murder trial. Russell Peeler was arrested 
shortly after midnight on a weapons charge, said state police Sgt. 
Scott Anderson. Peeler had been free on $900,000 bond in a murder 
case in which the boy, Leroy Brown Jr., was expected to be a key

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The weather is the most universal of topics so  
it's no surprise it is now the most popular subject for Americans 
seeking news on the Internet, a poll released today found. The 
online audience is changing from an elite, computer-savvy group 
(typically well-educated, affluent and male) to a group that looks 
more like mainstream America, the survey by the Pew Research Center

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Helped by a big drop in the cost of gasoline  
and other petroleum products, the inflation rate rose just 1.6 
percent in 1998, giving the country its best back-to-back annual 
performance on consumer prices since the mid-1960s. The Labor 
Department said today that its closely watched Consumer Price Index 
edged up just 0.1 percent in December, capping a year in which 
inflation was better behaved than the small 1.7 percent rise 
recorded in 1997.

stunning development came less than a week after the Dolphins were 
eliminated from the NFL playoffs with a 38-3 loss in Denver. It was 
the most lopsided postseason loss in franchise history. Johnson, 
55, coached the Miami Hurricanes to the 1987 national college 
championship and led the Dallas Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl 
titles in 1992-93.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton, Kids Dream of Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and arts  
officials kicked off planning Thursday for the first permanent 
station on Mars by some of the schoolkids who may eventually go 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters are being asked to think about the year 2030 and a  
``Millennium Mars Project.'' So far, only small experimental 
vehicles have been landed on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will all be reliving, through these young people's  
imagination, what it means to create a new world,'' Ms. Clinton 
said during the kickoff at the National Air and Space Museum, part 
of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to get pupils and high school students working with  
scientists and technicians on the design for a permanent Mars 
settlement, according to officials at the National Endowment for 
the Arts, which is putting $500,000 into the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our young citizens will not only imagine what new dance and  
music and painting will emerge in a community on Mars,'' said NEA 
Chairman Bill Ivey, ``but they must also consider what our 
interplanetary pioneers will carry with them. They will need 
creative minds -- imagination and ingenuity -- to solve the problems 
they are certain to encounter as they invent their new world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before her speech, Mrs. Clinton and Donna Shirley, who managed  
the Mars Pathfinder project, met 15 pupils from Washington's Anne 
Beers Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting under a prototype space suit for visitors to Mars, they  
talked about work the children have done on how they imagined 
living conditions would be -- based on what has already been 
discovered about conditions on the planet.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dive: Dow Ends Down 228.63 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were pummeled for the second day in a row  
Thursday, as continued economic turmoil in Brazil raised new fears 
among investors that profits of U.S. companies operating in Latin 
America could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.63 to 9,120.93. The  
Dow deepened Wednesday's 125-point loss and put it 60 points below 
where it began the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 22.21 to 1,212.19, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 39.99 to 2,276.82. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline started in the morning and accelerated later on,  
after a second key banking official in Brazil resigned, sending 
Brazil's main stock index sharply lower for the second day in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Latin America's  
largest, was halted for 30 minutes after a 10 percent plunge, 
following a 5 percent drop Wednesday. The leading stock index in 
Brazil ended Thursday off 9.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil started a worldwide market decline on Wednesday after its  
central bank chief resigned and his successor devalued the 
Brazilian currency by about 8 percent. On Thursday the Central 
Bank's director of the banking industry resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors are not so much concerned with Brazil, which by  
itself takes up only 2 percent of U.S. exports. But Brazil is the 
biggest and most important economy in Latin America, which accounts 
for 20 percent of U.S. exports. The real fear is that its problems 
will spread throughout Latin America and specifically to Mexico, a 
major trading partner with the United States. Mexico's main stock 
index, however, ended higher on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also concerns about how Brazil would affect the  
dollar. The dollar actually was stable against the Brazilian 
currency -- the real -- Thursday and firmer against European 
currencies and the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But, if an economic downturn in Latin America spreads to the  
United States and causes the dollar to fall, that could cause a 
rout on Wall Street that could make last summer's dizzying drop 
tied to problems in Asia and Russia look like a cakewalk, said 
Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. dollar can be threatened, and if the U.S. dollar goes  
down, people can pull their money out of U.S. stocks and bonds,'' 
Canelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders were also mindful of the impeachment trial  
involving President Clinton. Analysts said some may have used the 
trial as an excuse to take profits, but they were hesitant to blame 
the trial for the day's big decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks were led lower by issues of consumer companies,  
whose earnings rely heavily on exports to Brazil and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Among consumer issues taking big hits were Dow components Philip  
Morris fell 1 3/16 to 53, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 2 13/16 to 85 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were also hurt by Eastman Kodak, which Thursday  
morning reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. Kodak's 
shares fell 8 3/16 to 70 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of industrial and financial companies fell as well.  
Citigroup, which has lent heavily in Brazil and throughout Latin 
America, fell 1 5/16 to 50 7/8. General Motors fell 11/16 to 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pretty much ignored a Commerce Department report that  
retail sales rose a strong 0.9 percent in December, pushing the 
gain for last year to 5.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales increases proved non-inflationary, as consumer prices  
rose a moderate 1.6 percent last year, up 0.1 percent in December 
alone. Inflation was restrained by a big 8.8 percent drop in energy 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. NYSE volume totaled 952.97 
million shares as of 4 p.m. EST, down from the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index closed at 581.07, down 9.65, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index closed at 698.16, down 
1.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies closed at 420.10,  
down 4.76. 
</P>
<P>
	World markets ended mixed. The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo gained  
2.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 5.16 percent, the FT-SE 100  
in London fell 0.51 percent, but the Paris CAC index was up 0.97 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Trial Will Infringe on Sabbath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's no fun to work on the weekend, especially  
when your job is to sit in silence, listening to lawyers argue for 
removing the president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the Senate's only  
Orthodox Jew, this weekend's task is complicated further by the 
Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously not going to be the kind of Sabbath I normally  
like to spend, but I think we can, you know, work it out,'' said 
Lieberman, who won't answer the phone, ride in an elevator or turn 
on a light during the Sabbath observance. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Lieberman says his responsibility as a juror in President  
Clinton's impeachment trial comes before his personal preferences, 
even in matters of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the continuing pursuit of justice takes  
precedent, and therefore, without any hesitation, I'll be there,'' 
Lieberman told reporters this week. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors began arguing their case against Clinton on  
Thursday. Their presentation is to last three days, after which the 
Senate is to recess until Tuesday. At that point, Clinton's lawyers 
are to open their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	For observant Jews, the Sabbath generally means attending  
services at a temple and spending time with family. The use of 
mechanical and technological devices -- even toasters and pencils -- 
is shunned, and work is to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	When he must work on the Sabbath, something that happened less  
than two dozen times in his 10 years in the Senate, Lieberman makes 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, he takes a hotel room on Capitol Hill; but he's also  
been known to walk from his home, several miles away, sometimes 
accompanied by a Capitol police officer for security. At work, he 
takes the stairs. He won't write, but he'll vote by voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've found it possible to go and not violate any of the  
particular prohibitions that I accept on myself on the Sabbath,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial, actually, could prove more accommodating  
than other sessions. Senators are required to sit silently 
throughout the proceedings. They've been asked to turn off all 
beepers and cellular telephones.

<HEADLINE> Winter Chills Midwest, Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain made for a white-knuckle Thursday across  
the Northeast and Midwest, and in Detroit's snowbound 
neighborhoods, people were told if they wanted their mail, they'd 
have to come out into the streets and get it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine hamlet of Allagash, people stayed indoors to avoid  
the lowest temperature ever recorded in the state: 55 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Hell froze over.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're at 1 degree,'' said Jim Ley, owner of the  
Devil's Den, a clothing and souvenir store in Hell, a Michigan 
village about 60 miles west of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow extended from Ohio through Pennsylvania and into New  
York state, closing schools, canceling flights and forcing drivers 
to take it slow and steady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was slipping all over. My big question is, where are the  
sanders?'' secretary Vicki Piccione said in Mineola, N.Y., on Long 
Island. ``I saw a plow on the side of the road. Very helpful, 
wasn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	South of the snow, freezing rain and sleet fell from the Ohio  
Valley east into the mid-Atlantic states. Roads were icy from Ohio 
to Virginia and New Jersey, with numerous traffic accidents during 
the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were shut down all over, including Brooke, W.Va., where  
students have had only two days of class since the Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my wife's going crazy'' handling their 14-year-old son,  
said John Schwertfeger of Brooke, W.Va. ``I think she's about ready 
to drop him off at the superintendent's house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, where more than 23 inches of snow has accumulated  
since the beginning of the year and few neighborhood streets have 
been plowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Postmaster Lloyd Wesley Jr. said letter carriers will operate  
``like the Good Humor man'' -- driving their trucks to the front of 
an impassable street and honking their horns for 60 seconds so that 
people can come and get their mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is never-before stuff,'' said postal spokeswoman Diana  
Pritchard. ``This isn't in the regs book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Allagash, where Maine's cold-weather record of minus 48, set  
in the town of Van Buren in 1925, was broken overnight, many of the 
roughly 250 people living in the hamlet near the Canadian border 
plugged their cars into electric outlets to keep the engines warm 
and hunkered down indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Buffalo, N.Y., a 9-year-old boy fell through thin ice on  
Lake Erie and his 7-year-old friend held onto him until rescuers 
arrived. Hospital officials said both boys would recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow resumed Thursday in Buffalo, which by Wednesday had  
recorded nearly 53 inches this month alone. Buffalo usually gets 
93.2 inches of snow every year, or more than 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The added weight brought down sections of barns, churches and  
other buildings. ``The whole thing fell in like an accordion,'' 
Charles Spencer Jr. said of a roof in one room of his home. 
``Anybody who was out in that room would have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about 2 1/2 feet on the ground Thursday, prison inmates were  
out with shovels uncovering fire hydrants and clearing walkways. 
More than 100 National Guardsmen and 80 state transportation 
workers also helped out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Erie, Pa., where snowplow crews have worked 12-hour shifts  
for 16 days straight, ``the guys are starting to come to me after 
eight hours and saying, `I can't take it anymore,''' said Dan 
Leone, chief of the Streets Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Ice Cream in Portland, Maine, was  
amazed that anybody ventured into his store, which normally serves 
50 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had my faithful New York Superfudge guy come in. I just  
sold a shake. So I've three or four customers,'' Jim Harmon said. 
``People are rushing by with their heads tucked into their 
scarves.''

<HEADLINE> Politicians Criticize Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some politicians here say United Airlines  
is setting hypocritical policies by agreeing to pay workers in Los 
Angeles that city's living wage but refusing to comply with San 
Francisco's domestic partners ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco law requires companies doing business with the  
city to provide the same benefits to workers with domestic partners 
as they give to married employees. Chicago-based United is part of 
a federal lawsuit seeking exemption from the law. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, United became the first major airline doing business  
at Los Angeles International Airport to pay its security workers 
the city's mandated ``living wage'' -- $7.39 per hour plus benefits, 
or $8.69 per hour without benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``United's disingenuous argument that they are opposed to local  
regulation has just been eviscerated,'' San Francisco Supervisor 
Leslie Katz said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Matt Triaca disagreed, saying the Los Angeles  
ordinance deals only with subcontractors and does not directly 
affect United employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have operations in all 50 states and the San Francisco  
ordinance has far-reaching implications nationally,'' Triaca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisor Tom Ammiano didn't buy the argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot of doublespeak,'' Ammiano said. ``It doesn't hold  
water because living wage is a national issue. It's happening in 
many cities,'' and is under consideration in San Francisco.

	The goal is clear enough, even if the rest of her life seems  
muddled. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak is coming off a frenetic year, and not just because she took  
women's golf to its high level of notoriety since the 1978 rookie 
season of Nancy Lopez by becoming the youngest woman to win a U.S. 
Open and the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors. 
</P>
<P>
	First came the celebrated homecoming in South Korea, where she  
had to be hospitalized because of fatigue. She bought a house in 
Orlando while still trying to maintain her 27-tournament schedule, 
then had trouble deciding on her support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	During one two-week stretch, manager Steven Kil was fired,  
re-hired and then fired again. She also ditched swing coach David 
Leadbetter, went back to him and then lost him when Leadbetter said 
he refused to be a tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
	As the new season begins, Pak is trying to negotiate a  
management deal. International Management Group is close to signing 
her to a contract, but one source said Cornerstone Sports was 
expected to make an 11th-hour pitch to Pak this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that going on around her, the plush fairways of Grand  
Cypress must look like paradise to Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before end of season, I was getting famous,'' she said.  
``After, make news with coach and I fire my manager. All talk about 
things around me, talk about my private life. Coach should talk 
about players, swing, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything makes me more busy. No time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pak can do without the distractions. Her goal is to get to the  
top, but she knows it won't be easy. Proof of that is Annika 
Sorenstam, the three-time player of the year who also won four 
tournaments last year and led the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The new season also figures to recharge the batteries of Karrie  
Webb, who in 1996 became the first LPGA rookie to surpass $1 
million in a season, and Kelly Robbins, the defending champion of 
the HealthSouth Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, I try to play more better,'' Pak said. ``But golf ...  
we don't know what will happen. I want to finish top-10 all the 
time. I want to be player of the year, money list No. 1, everything 
No. 1. But it's not that easy. I do my best and work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam did win until June last year, and she usually doesn't  
start her season until the LPGA Tour moves out to the west coast. 
But having moved in to a new house in Orlando -- about 30 yards down 
the fairway from Nick Faldo -- she'll play two of the three Florida 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a continuation from last year,'' Sorenstam said.  
</P>
<P>
	That can't be good news to the rest of the field. Sorenstam  
finished out of the top 10 in just four of the 21 tournaments she 
played last year and became the first woman to break 70 in the 
season scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scoring average says everything,'' she said. ``To break 70  
is one of the best things I've ever done. Now I want to get it down 
to whatever I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question for this year is who will be trying to knock her  
off. The LPGA has not lacked for rivalries the past couple of 
years, and they always seems to include Sorenstam -- first Laura 
Davies in 1996, the Webb in 1997 and Pak last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam concedes that Pak's success during a 10-week stretch --  
the LPGA, the U.S. Open and two other wins -- motivated her to 
practice more and play better. The 28-year-old Swede responded in 
fashion and went over $1 million for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	She expects Pak to be at the forefront again this year -- Pak  
included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go in 1999,'' Pak said. ``I learned a lot last  
year. I am more strong. I don't have many tired. Everything is 
getting more comfortable. It is good.''

<HEADLINE> 51 Killed in Stampede in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Thousands of barefoot pilgrims jostling  
for space atop a holy mountain caused part of a hill to collapse, 
triggering a stampede that killed 51 people during a Hindu holiday 
Thursday in southern India, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cave-in took place on a hill where thousands of people had  
crowded to watch what pilgrims believe is the celestial light -- 
visible deep in a forest facing the hill -- on a route leading to 
the popular Sabarimala shrine in the mountains of south India, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Press Trust of India said over 100 were injured, several of them  
seriously, but police said 56 were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic all around, people were screaming, and most  
people died because they tried to rush down the hill,'' said R. 
Vishvanath Pillai, a special officer at Pamba, a base camp at the 
bottom of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths occurred in the stampede or by the cave-in itself,  
police said. Eleven bodies were thought to be buried under 
boulders, said Pillai, speaking by telephone from the site located 
about 1,300 miles south of New Delhi in Kerala state. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred fire fighters and policemen were helping in the  
rescue efforts in the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabarimala is a deeply revered Hindu pilgrimage site in India.  
Tens of millions of pilgrims each year climb the 9-mile route up 
the mountain in traditional black robes to worship at its temple to 
the Hindu god Ayappa. 
</P>
<P>
	On the way back down, they often stop at vantage points on the  
hill to watch the celestial light in the surrounding forest, which 
is believed to be visible only on a limited number of holy days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were visiting the area  
Thursday for the Hindu festival of Makar Sankranti. Pilgrims 
watching for the celestial light swarmed the hilltop, pushing for 
space and chanting hymns as the sun set. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilgrims carried hundreds of small miniatures of the  
Sabarimala temple made of reed and decorated with candles and oil 
lamps, in a procession they would later set afloat in the nearby 
Pampa River.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Horse Slay Suspect Gets Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- One of three suspects in the  
slaughter of 34 wild horses was freed on bail after declaring his 
innocent while another underwent a mental exam and fought his 
extradition to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Merlino, 20, posted a $60,000 bond Thursday and was  
released from jail. He was to be arraigned today on charges of 
grand theft, grand larceny and maiming, poisoning or killing 
another person's animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Merlino maintains his innocence,'' defense lawyer Scott  
Freeman said. ``Everybody is so quick to judge this young man. 
That's what we have courts for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors at an apartment Merlino rented with friends in  
1997 have described him as a hunter who blasted birds in the yard 
with a shotgun, gutted a deer on his living room carpet and bragged 
about his marksmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the free-roaming mustangs were found outside Reno  
late last month. Authorities said several animals suffered for a 
long time before they died or were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the same charges as Merlino are two high school buddies,  
Scott Brendle, 21, and Darien Brock, 20, both Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock, who was stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, was  
transferred to a mental health facility after he mentioned suicide 
Wednesday night, according to San Diego County sheriff's Lt. Rick 
Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock is contesting his extradition to Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
	Brendle has indicated he will agree to return to Nevada to face  
charges. He was transferred on Wednesday from the Marine Corps 
Air-Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms east of Los Angeles to 
a nearby jail.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Romo a Study in Contrasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bill Romanowski is a walking contradiction, a  
devoted family man but one of the NFL's dirtiest players. 
</P>
<P>
	His Denver Broncos teammates love him for his studious  
preparation, his physical conditioning and his maniacal play on 
Sunday. Opponents can't talk about him without spouting 
obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski is a leader in the Denver locker room and a player  
for whom coach Mike Shanahan has the utmost respect. 
</P>
<P>
	It is no coincidence that Romanowski and Claude Lemieux of the  
Colorado Avalanche -- one of the NHL's most reviled figures -- are 
the best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Said teammate Bubby Brister: ``Off the field, he's the best  
person you'd ever want to meet. He would do anything for his family 
and his friends. On the field, he's the best person you could ever 
have on your side. Nobody wants to play against him. That's a 
compliment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Broncos' 38-3 rout of Miami in an AFC divisional  
playoff game last week that propeled Denver into Sunday's AFC 
championship game, Dolphins receiver O.J. McDuffie said Romanowski 
``is a heck of a football player, but sometimes he can be an 
(expletive deleted).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins offensive guard John Bock said ``some of the things he  
did I didn't appreciate. You can look at the films and see the crap 
he does when the play is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 245-pound linebacker, who played six years in San  
Francisco and two in Philadelphia before signing with Denver in 
1996, gained unwanted notoriety last season when a television 
camera caught him spitting in the face of 49ers receiver J.J. 
Stokes. He was fined $7,500 by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski had already been labeled a dirty player for his  
helmet-to-helmet collision with Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins 
that broke Collins' jaw. For that infraction, he was fined $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski, 32, has shown little remorse for the Collins'  
incident, insisting it was unavoidable. On the other hand, he has 
apologized repeatedly for the spitting matter, saying it was 
``totally out of character and it was wrong. I got caught up in the 
heat of battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, he worried most about how it would affect his wife,  
Julie, and his two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's problem, if there is one, is the transformation he  
undergoes on game day, when he virtually goes into a trance about 
four hours before kickoff, mentally reviewing the game plan and 
pumping himself up to make every tackle on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go all out on every play, that's what I try to do,'' he said  
Thursday. ``I try to leave it on the field. Sometimes people call 
me dirty, but I just call it playing hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he like to play against himself? ``No, probably not,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said Romanowski is ``going  
to give all he has on every play, more than anybody I've ever seen 
in my life. I feel sorry for the players who have to play against 
us. He plays the game at a level that a lot of guys can't achieve. 
His intensity is way off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister has seen a slight change in Romanowski this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this year he's cleaned it up a little bit on the  
field,'' Brister said. ``He's still playing aggressive, but he puts 
that other stuff behind him and he was rewarded by going to the Pro 
Bowl, so there's a lot of other players around the league that feel 
the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski, who also went to the Pro Bowl in 1996, has always  
been a winner, regardless of reputation. He owns three Super Bowl 
rings, two from his days with the 49ers. After making six tackles 
and an interception against Miami, he has the Broncos within one 
more victory of getting a shot at a fourth ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some incidents when he did things he wasn't proud  
of,'' Shanahan said, ``but people who think Bill Romanowski is a 
bad guy don't know him. He prepares himself as well as anyone I've 
ever been around. He works out constantly in the offseason to give 
himself the best chance for success. That's part of the reason he 
hasn't missed a game in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner, he's a great competitor, he's a class act.''

<HEADLINE> Two Andersons Will Face Off Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- One letter separates their names. A few  
field goals divide their legacies. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Gary Anderson and Atlanta's Morten Andersen, men  
from different lands, have been intertwined since entering the NFL 
together 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the two most prolific kickers in history come  
together at the Metrodome, where the Vikings play host to the 
Falcons in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary and I have sort of been parallel since 1982,'' said  
Andersen, a native of Denmark. ``He's a little bit ahead of me 
statistically. To have a perfect year is unbelievable. He's setting 
the bar very high for the rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, that might be said of both kickers, who began their  
careers in 1982 and likely will find themselves side by side in the 
Hall of Fame one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Anderson, who was born in South Africa, became  
the first kicker in NFL history to go through a season without a 
miss. He made 35-of-35 field goals, giving him 420 for his career, 
and 59-of-59 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, one year younger, has 401 field goals to rank No. 2 on  
the career list after another superb season in which he made 
23-of-28 attempts for the Falcons. He was 51-of-52 on extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if anybody compares to Anderson &AMP; Andersen, the Vikings  
kicker replied, ``Nobody. Not when you talk about the length of 
time. There are a handful of very good kickers in the league, but 
until they've done it for 17 years, that's a different category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both grew up playing soccer in their homelands, then switched to  
a different brand of football after moving to America. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, an exchange student, took up the sport in high school  
and wound up earning a scholarship to Michigan State. Anderson left 
South Africa with his family following high school and was 
discovered by Syracuse coaches at a tryout camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After stellar college careers, both landed in the NFL. Since  
then, they've never been too far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is 420-of-525 on field goals (80 percent), while  
Andersen has made 401-of-510 (79 percent). On extra points, 
Anderson is 585-of-590 (99 percent), Andersen is 558-of-566 (98.5 
percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's numbers are even more impressive in light of spending  
his first 16 seasons in poor-weather cities -- Pittsburgh, 
Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary is an all-around tremendous kicker,'' said Andersen, who  
has spent his career with dome teams New Orleans and Atlanta. 
``He's done it in the playoffs, he's done it in big games, he's 
done it in any circumstances -- outside or inside, grass or turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While similar is so many ways, these two kickers are actually  
quite different in their techniques. Vikings special teams coach 
Gary Zauner made the comparison using a golf analogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary hits the ball like Tom Watson,'' Zauner said. ``Tom  
Watson maybe didn't hit the ball the farthest, but he was always 
leading in fairways played. Gary's got the whole game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morton Andersen's maybe more like John Daly. No, not John  
Daly, because he didn't win a lot of tournaments. But Morton's one 
of those guys who hits the ball a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The left-footed Andersen holds the NFL record with 35 field  
goals from 50 yards or longer. The right-footed Anderson has made 
11 of those long-range kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more of a finesse kicker,'' Andersen said. ``I'm probably  
a little bit more of a power kicker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't limit these guys with stereotypes, however.  
</P>
<P>
	This season, Anderson has made 14 kicks of at least 40 yards,  
including two 50-yarders. Overlooked much of the season on the 
high-powered Vikings, the fans of Minnesota finally seemed to 
realize his value last week during the divisional playoffs when 
they chanted ``Gary! Gary!'' before the first of two field goals 
against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little distracted,'' Anderson said, but he didn't miss  
in the 41-21 victory over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen made two key field goals in the second half of  
Atlanta's 20-18 triumph over San Francisco, which put the Falcons 
in the NFC championship game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing that a guy could go through the season and not  
miss a single extra point or field goal,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves 
said. ``But I wouldn't trade Morten for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has played in one AFC championship game but never the  
Super Bowl. Andersen has never gotten this far in the playoffs, his 
career dragged down by poor teams in New Orleans and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt that individually I've accomplished a lot,''  
Andersen said. ``But this is a team sport, and I've always looked 
at it that way. I've never gotten to the big dance. Now, I'm one 
step away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe one kick.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Hutchinson Details Obstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,  
attempted to show Thursday that a series of actions by President 
Clinton and others amounted to a scheme to keep the president's 
affair with Monica Lewinsky from Paula Jones' lawyers at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the key dates:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 5, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky appears on the witness list in the  
Paula Jones case. Until that date, Hutchinson said, the president 
and his friend Vernon Jordan had promised to help Ms. Lewinsky find 
a job in New York, but nothing had been done. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 11. Jordan meets with Ms. Lewinsky and begins making calls  
to corporate executives. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, 
handling the Jones case, orders that Mrs. Jones is entitled to 
information regarding any state or federal employee with whom the 
president had sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 17. The president, knowing that Ms. Lewinsky has met with  
Jordan and the job search is picking up steam, calls Ms. Lewinsky 
about 2 a.m. to let her know she is on the Jones witness list. When 
Ms. Lewinsky asks what she should do if subpoenaed, Clinton says, 
``Well, maybe you can sign an affidavit'' to avoid testifying in 
the Jones case. According to Hutchinson, only a false affidavit, 
denying an affair, would avoid the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 19. Ms. Lewinsky receives her subpoena in the Jones case.  
Jordan meets with Ms. Lewinsky at 4:47 p.m. Less than 15 minutes 
later, the president calls Jordan, who tells him about the 
subpoena. Jordan arranges for attorney Francis Carter to represent 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 19-31. Jordan keeps Clinton informed about the  
still-unsigned Lewinsky affidavit and the job search. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dec. 28. Ms. Lewinsky tells Clinton the subpoena calls for her  
to produce gifts the president gave her. She suggests she take the 
gifts somewhere or maybe give them to the president's secretary, 
Betty Currie. The president responds, ``I don't know'' or ``Let me 
think about that,'' according to Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky later gets a call from Mrs. Currie, who says,  
according to Ms. Lewinsky, ``I understand you have something to 
give me'' or ``the president said you have something to give me.'' 
Later, Mrs. Currie picks up the gifts and places them in a 
container under her bed at home. The prosecution contends the 
president asked his secretary to pick up the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 6, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky picks up a draft of the false  
affidavit, meets with Jordan and deletes a potentially troublesome 
paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 7. Ms. Lewinsky signs the affidavit and takes a signed  
copy to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 8. Ms. Lewinsky has a job interview arranged by Jordan and  
tells Jordan it went poorly. Jordan intercedes with the company's 
chairman, Ronald Perelman. Additional interviews are secured with 
the company and Ms. Lewinsky is offered a job. Jordan informs Mrs. 
Currie, ``Mission accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 17. Clinton is deposed in the Jones case and his attorney,  
Robert Bennett, uses Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit to state there was 
``absolutely no sex of any kind'' between the president and the 
former intern. Clinton states that the statement is ``absolutely 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 17, evening. Clinton calls Mrs. Currie at home and asks  
her to come to work the next day, a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 18. Clinton asks Mrs. Currie questions that prosecutors  
say were designed to coach her if she should become a witness. The 
president also asks Mrs. Currie to find Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 19. Mrs. Currie tries numerous times to page Ms. Lewinsky,  
using a code name the two women had established. The secretary is 
unable to reach Ms. Lewinsky. Jordan also tries to page her. Jordan 
learns that Carter, the attorney he obtained for Ms. Lewinsky, was 
fired by Ms. Lewinsky. Jordan informs Clinton that Carter is out. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jan. 21. The first news stories appear about Clinton and  
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	--After Jan. 21. Clinton denies the affair to aides, who later  
become witnesses in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation and repeat the denial.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics To Shed Subsidiary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. plans to gradually shed  
its nearly $1 billion stake in microprocessor subsidiary MIPS 
Technologies Inc., part of a broader effort to focus on selling 
powerful computers for scientists, engineers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Thursday it would dispose of its 85 percent  
stake between now and Sept. 30, 2000, through the public stock 
market, private placements with large investors or other means. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics, based in Mountain View, Calif., is struggling  
to regain some of its former glory as a darling of the 
technological world, celebrated for making the computers used to 
create the special effects in such movies as ``Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been hurt by growing competition by workstation  
makers such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. It 
also has been hurt by less costly workstations and high-end 
personal computers using Intel chips and Microsoft's Windows NT 
operating software.

	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders are stockpiling  
Heisman Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders said Thursday they have signed former Heisman  
Trophy-winning quarterback Andre Ware and tight end Marcus Hinton.

	Historic Impeachment Trial Opens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House of Representatives opened its first  
presidential impeachment trial since 1868 as House prosecutors told 
senators today they should vote to remove President Clinton from 
office because he had violated his oath to tell the truth. House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said his team would show 
how ``egregious and criminal'' Clinton's conduct was in concealing 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky and that Clinton had violated his 
oath to tell the truth in court. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Proposes $6B for More Cops  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated new data  
that show a record low number of serious violent crimes. Today, he 
proposed a five-year, $6 billion package to raise the ante on his 
nearly fulfilled pledge to put 100,000 new officers on the beat 
nationwide. The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics 
midyear report is due for release today and is expected to show 
that a drop in the number of violent crimes below 3 million for the 
first time since 1973.

<P>
	Gore Wants Changes in Federal Pay  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore recommended today a  
global coalition to reform governments so they serve people better. 
For the United States, he proposed a plan to pay federal managers 
according to performance rather than seniority. Gore announced 
three U.S. initiatives: to reform civil service pay for government 
managers, to funnel more federal dollars to helping children and to 
conduct the first governmentwide ``customer satisfaction survey'' 
for federal services.

	Trading Halted in Brazil Market  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Trading was temporarily halted in  
Brazil's main stock market this afternoon after the index fell 10 
percent, a day after its Central Bank president resigned and Brazil 
decided to let its currency slide against the U.S. dollar. Brazil's 
action raised fears that the 18-month-old financial crisis that has 
battered Asia and Russia had not gone away and could bring down 
other economies in Latin America.

	Dow Drops 219; Nasdaq Down 25

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were  
down 219.88 to 9,129.68. NYSE decliners edged advancers 1,986-964. 
The Nasdaq was down 25.54 to 2,291.27.

	Lifting Iraq Oil Ceiling Proposed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States today proposed removing a  
U.N. ceiling on Iraqi oil sales provided the proceeds are used to 
purchase food and other humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people. 
Calling on Iraq to take advantage of the exemption to a 9-year-old 
Security Council trade embargo, State Department spokesman James 
Rubin said also that the process for approving food and 
pharmaceutical contracts would be streamlined and made virtually 
automatic. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Wants Inspectors Back in Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is huddling with  
U.S. allies to try to find a way to get weapons inspectors back to 
Iraq to spur the country's disarmament. But while the 
administration is seeking to keep the pressure on Iraq on 
inspections, it also is signaling a new U.S. willingness to ease 
restrictions on Iraqi humanitarian purchases. That could involve 
streamlining the way the U.N. sanctions committee clears supplies 
of food, medicine and other humanitarian items, U.S. officials 
said.

	Microsoft Appeals Judge's Order  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft has appealed a federal judge's  
order to rewrite parts of its Windows 98 operating system to 
conform with Sun Microsystems' version of the Java programming 
language. The judge ordered Microsoft in November to change 
Internet Explorer 4.0 and other software that incorporates Java 
programming, or stop shipping the products within 90 days.

	Foreman-Holmes Fight Postponed  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The money-troubled ``Battle of the Aged'' between  
former heavyweight champions George Foreman and Larry Holmes has 
been postponed from Jan. 23 to March 27, according to a television 
report. George Koenig, vice president of marketing and sales for 
Astrodome USA, told KRIV-TV in Houston that he had received 
official notification from promoter Roger Levitt that the bout 
would be delayed.

<HEADLINE> Student's Fatal Fall Ruled Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The fatal fall of a University of  
Michigan freshman from her sixth-floor dormitory room window has 
been ruled an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence that 18-year-old Courtney Cantor committed  
suicide or was thrown out the window, Chief Assistant Washtenaw 
County Prosecutor Joseph Burke said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death led the governing body of Phi Delta Theta fraternity  
to permanently suspend the charter of its University of Michigan 
chapter, where Ms. Cantor was seen drinking prior to her Oct. 16 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Ms. Cantor attended parties at Chi Omega  
sorority and Phi Delta Theta, drinking at the fraternity party. She 
then returned to her room where she fell through a window that 
opened just 12 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter of Detroit News columnist and editorial writer  
George Cantor died of skull and spinal fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy results showed Ms. Cantor's blood-alcohol level was  
below the threshold for legal intoxication, 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten fraternity members charged with furnishing alcohol to a  
minor and violating host laws for allegedly allowing minors to 
drink at the party were to be arraigned today in district court.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson's voice cracked and his eyes  
welled with tears Thursday as he explained his flirtation with 
retirement by describing the worst loss of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went to mother's funeral, they had the viewing the day  
before, and I wasn't able to do that,'' Johnson said, pausing 
between sentences to compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 20 death of his mother, Allene, his father's fight with  
cancer and his impending marriage had Johnson ready to quit as 
coach of the Miami Dolphins -- until the team's owner talked him 
into a startling change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with owner Wayne Huizenga, the 55-year-old  
Johnson decided to delegate some of his duties by hiring former 
Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt as assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times when you pull back and say, `Be with the  
people you care about, and don't shortchange them. They care about 
you. They love you. They're supportive in everything you do. Give 
them just a little bit back,''' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of quitting, Johnson will return for a fourth season  
with Miami in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is going to be the same as far as getting us to  
a championship,'' he told a hastily called news conference. ``But I 
will try to spend a few more hours with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild sequence of events began late Wednesday, when the news  
surfaced that Johnson planned to retire. Dolphins officials were 
braced for Johnson's departure when he arrived at work Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not looking forward to being on the streets looking for  
a coach,'' team president Eddie Jones said, ``and that's where we 
were headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting outside the head coach's office, Johnson said, was  
quarterback Dan Marino, eager to persuade him to stay. Johnson then 
met with Huizenga, who flew overnight from a baseball meeting in 
California to keep his coach, and they discussed the addition of 
Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, fired two weeks ago after six seasons with the Bears,  
was an assistant to Johnson when the Dallas Cowboys won the 1992 
NFL title and the Miami Hurricanes won the 1987 national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne's smart enough to see this can work,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with his assistant coaches, who endorsed the new  
chain of command, Johnson announced that he'll stay for another 
season. But he'll also try to cut down on the 16-hour workdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be times I'm not going to be here until  
midnight -- but Dave will,'' Johnson said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't talk about that,'' Wannstedt jokingly protested.  
</P>
<P>
	The developments raised questions about Johnson's commitment,  
but he stressed several times during the news conference that he 
remains devoted to the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to coach like the dickens to get us a  
championship,'' he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and players apparently believe him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad Jimmy has decided to stay and continue the progress  
we have made over the last three years,'' Marino said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga didn't attend the news conference, but he grinned later  
while rushing to his car at the Dolphins' complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything you can do to save Jimmy is a good day,'' Huizenga  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in the plans is Johnson's marriage to his longtime  
girlfriend, Rhonda Rookmaaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's excited about me staying,'' Johnson said. ``The only  
thing she said was, `I'm not letting you off the hook. You're still 
marrying me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is under contract through 2000 after signing a one-year  
extension in April. But with Wannstedt now the heir apparent, 
Johnson was noncommittal about coaching beyond 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows?'' Johnson said. ``I can't say what's going to  
happen a year from now. You may be stuck with me forever. I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Johnson retiring was a surprise because the  
Dolphins appear on the verge of Super Bowl contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the humiliating 38-3 loss at Denver was the most  
lopsided postseason loss in team history, the Dolphins have 
improved in each of Johnson's three seasons. This year, they 
allowed the fewest points in the NFL and won a playoff game for the 
first time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away  
offensively from getting that championship,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who divorced his first wife and has two children from  
that marriage, has always confessed to putting his job first and 
family second. He rarely remembers birthdays or anniversaries, 
doesn't observe holidays and dislikes talking on the phone. Now he 
wants to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret doing anything I did,'' he said. ``But I can  
learn from what has happened. I can be a better coach, more 
relaxed, more upbeat and more positive if I have a good family 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's funny how things work out: Johnson stays with the Dolphins,  
and they have themselves a new coach.

<HEADLINE> Hedge Funds Hurt Bank of America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Bank of America chairman Hugh McColl will earn  
a smaller bonus for 1998 due to hedge fund losses that caused a 
steep earnings decline in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The hedge funds were part of the investment strategy of  
BankAmerica Corp. before it merged with NationsBank, which McColl 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, McColl's bonus from NationsBank was $3.5 million,  
accounting for more than two-thirds of his total compensation of 
$4.64 million. Bank of America wouldn't specify what his 1998 bonus 
will be. McColl's pay package will be disclosed in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, McColl told the bank's senior management he  
should bear responsibility for Bank of America's losses when it 
came time to hand out bonuses. Lynn Drury, head of corporate 
affairs for the Charlotte-based bank, said no other bonuses are 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America disclosed last October that it lost $372 million  
because of the old BankAmerica's partnership with D.E. Shaw, which 
was using complex computer-driven strategies to invest in 
derivatives and bond trading strategies. Investors have filed more 
than 30 lawsuits against Bank of America over the Shaw losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses prompted the resignation of David Coulter, the  
BankAmerica chairman and CEO who was to be president of the 
combined bank. Coulter was thought to be McColl's eventual 
successor.

<HEADLINE> JJ Decides To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson is going to spend more time  
with his family and less time at work. The Miami Dolphins are 
delighted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything you can do to save Jimmy is a good day,'' team owner  
Wayne Huizenga said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins managed to keep their coach Thursday -- barely.  
After meeting with Huizenga, an emotional Johnson changed his mind 
and decided not to retire at age 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Johnson chose to delegate some of his duties by hiring  
close friend and former Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt as 
assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave is a great addition to the team and has a special  
relationship with Jimmy, and that's so important,'' team president 
Eddie Jones said. ``That brings something special to the table and 
will allow Jimmy to do what he wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Johnson wants to do is change the priorities in his life.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has always confessed to putting his job first and family  
second. He divorced his wife, rarely remembers birthdays or 
anniversaries, doesn't observe holidays and dislikes talking on the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, following the death of his mother Dec. 20, he wants to  
marry his longtime girlfriend and spend more time with his two sons 
and his father, who is battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's voice cracked and his eyes welled with tears Thursday  
as he explained his flirtation with retirement by describing the 
worst loss of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went to mother's funeral, they had the viewing the day

conference, pausing at times to compose himself. 
</P>

people you care about, and don't shortchange them. They care about 
you. They love you. They're supportive in everything you do. Give 
them just a little bit back.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A wild sequence of events began late Wednesday when reports  
surfaced that Johnson planned to resign after three seasons with 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The news stunned Dolphins officials because the team appears to  
be on the verge of Super Bowl contention. But they were braced for 
Johnson's departure when he arrived at work Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not looking forward to being on the streets looking for

	``Jimmy's someone I respect on a professional and personal  
level,'' said Wannstedt, 46. ``He and I have had an awful lot of 
success together over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with his assistant coaches, who endorsed the new  
chain of command, Johnson announced that he'll stay for another

<HEADLINE> Photographers Denied Trial Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate rule makers, stressing the need to  
maintain decorum, have rejected a request by news photographers for 
access to the Senate floor during the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules Committee Chairman Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the  
committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, 
said in a letter written Wednesday they opposed changes in the 
normal rules barring still photos in the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to the Standing Committee of Press Photographers,  
they said the current rule best serves the interests of providing 
accurate information ``while respecting the gravity of the matter 
before it and preserving the decorum of the chamber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standing committee, which represents news photographers  
working on Capitol Hill, had petitioned Senate leaders, the Senate 
sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee to make an exception to 
the ban on photos because of the historical significance of the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a losing battle, and it's too bad,'' said  
Margaret O'Connor, director of photography for The New York Times. 
``In the future people are going to look back and see that 
something was missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and Dodd left open the possibility that official  
Senate photographers would take photos of the proceedings, as they 
did when Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the senators were 
sworn in for the trial last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio and print reporters have seats in the gallery, and most of  
the trial proceedings will be televised through cameras operated by 
Senate staff. C-Span, which takes the feed, has no control over 
which shots are taken.

<HEADLINE> House Fire Kills Three Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Three young children died in a house fire  
Thursday and their mother was burned when she tried to kick open 
the bedroom door to rescue them. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, ages 3, 4 and 5, died in their second-story  
bedroom from a blaze that may have been started because they were 
playing with fire, said Jack Cassady, a fire department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was contained to the bedroom and part of a hallway.  
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Margaret Clark, and a neighbor, Edwin Gunnell, 47,  
were treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation from unsuccessful 
rescue attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-month-old toddler and 16-year-old daughter also were home  
and escaped the fire. Cassady said 11 people lived in the house, 
including eight children, a mother and father, and another tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters found that none of the home's smoke detectors were  
working. ``It would have made a real difference in the outcome,'' 
Cassady said.

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 228.63  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were pummeled for the second day in a  
row, as deepening economic worries in Brazil caused concerns that 
profits of U.S. multinational companies operating there could 
suffer. At the close of trading, the Dow industrial average was 
down 228.63 at 9,120.93, its lowest point in the session, on active 
volume. The Dow deepened Wednesday's 125-point loss and dropped 
below where it began the year. Broad indexes were sharply lower. 
Despite the big drop in the index, leadership was thin, with 
decliners leading advancers by a 12-7 margin on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The Nasdaq composite index fell 39.92 to 2,276.89.

	Trading Halted in Brazil Market  
</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's largest stock market  
was overcome by jitters today, with another Central Bank official 
stepping down and trading temporarily halted after the Sao Paulo 
index fell 10 percent. The smaller Rio de Janeiro market plunged 9 
percent, a day after the Central Bank president resigned and Brazil 
decided to let its currency slide against the U.S. dollar. Analysts 
said the market movements were a clear reflection of the country's 
financial fragility, which includes fears of another, larger 
devaluation and rising inflation. 

</P>
<P>
	Inflation Rate Is Just 1.6 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There was good news on inflation, retail sales  
and jobless claims today. The Consumer Price Index -- the inflation 
rate -- was up just 1.6 percent in 1998, the Labor Department said. 
That gave the country its best back-to-back annual performance on 
consumer prices since the mid-1960s. The index was up 0.1 
percentage point in December, capping a year in which inflation was 
better behaved than the small 1.7 percent rise recorded in 1997. 
Meanwhile, retail sales were up 5.1 percent for the year, and 0.9 
percent for the month of December, the Commerce Department 
reported. The Labor Department said new applications for 
unemployment benefits dipped by 4,000 last week, the second 
straight weekly decline after an unusual surge during Christmas 
week.

	PriceWaterhouse, SEC Reach Accord  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
accused by federal regulators of violating rules requiring 
accountants to remain independent from companies they audit, has 
agreed to a settlement that creates a $2.5 million education fund. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which announced the 
settlement today, said some of PricewaterhouseCoopers' accountants 
owned stock in corporations they audited. The SEC said the company 
also agreed to be censured, to improve its procedures for 
monitoring adherence to auditor independence rules and to conduct 
an internal investigation supervised by an outside person. The new 
$2.5 million fund will be used to enhance awareness in the 
accounting profession of the independence rules.

	Talk of Nissan-DaimlerChrysler Tie

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co.'s president signaled his  
willingness today to consider a capital tie-up with DaimlerChrysler 
AG should such a proposal be put forward by the German-American 
automaker, according to a published report. Kyodo News agency 
quoted Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa as saying such an offer 
would be seriously considered. Nissan officials were unavailable 
for comment today. The report comes just days after DaimlerChrysler 
co-Chairman Juergen Schrempp was reported saying his company might 
be interested in acquiring an equity stake in Nissan, which is 
burdened with debt.

	A New Breed of Internet Surfers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People going online today to find news or  
pursue other interests look increasingly like America as a whole -- 
they're less computer-savvy, less affluent and include more women 
than the band of early Internet devotees, according to a poll 
released today. That more mainstream audience is interested in more 
mainstream topics than those first drawn to the Internet, indicates 
a survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. 
Sending or receiving electronic mail is the most popular activity 
for the 41 percent of adults who now use the Internet. And weather 
is the type of news they seek most often.

	Hedge Funds Hurt Bank of America  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Bank of America chairman Hugh McColl will earn  
a smaller bonus for 1998 due to hedge fund losses that caused a 
steep earnings decline in last year's third quarter. The hedge 
funds were part of the investment strategy of BankAmerica Corp. 
before it merged with NationsBank, which McColl headed. In 1997, 
McColl's bonus from NationsBank was $3.5 million, accounting for 
more than two-thirds of his total compensation of $4.64 million. 
Bank of America wouldn't specify what his 1998 bonus will be. 
McColl's pay package will be disclosed in March.

	Microsoft Temp Contract Criticized  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge today admonished Microsoft Corp.  
lawyers for language recently added to contracts for temporary 
workers that would waive their right to any future court-ordered 
additional pay or benefits. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour 
called the contract language ``outrageously arrogant'' and 
dismissed Microsoft lawyers' defense that it covers only future 
work for the company. Coughenour said damages typically continue to 
accrue right up to trial. Contract workers filed a class-action 
lawsuit against Microsoft in 1992 over their status, claiming the 
company treated them as full-time workers in every regard except 
compensation. 

</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Appeals Judge's order  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has appealed a federal  
judge's order to rewrite parts of its Windows 98 operating system 
to conform with Sun Microsystems' version of the Java programming 
language. U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte ordered Microsoft in 
November to change Internet Explorer 4.0 and other software that 
incorporates Java programming, or stop shipping the products within 
90 days. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by Sun 
Microsystems Inc., which claimed Microsoft designed a Windows-only 
form of Java that is incompatible with rival software.

	Clinton Backs Business Incentives

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton wants the government to offer  
financial incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Wall 
Street firms and small businesses to resurrect the economies of 
underserved rural and urban areas from Appalachia to Harlem. The 
president is to announce the proposals tomorrow at an economic 
conference organized by the Wall Street Project, an initiative of 
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. The project's mission is to 
expand business opportunities for minorities and women.

	Kodak Has Fourth Quarter Profit  
</P>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. posted a fourth-quarter  
profit after losing money in the period a year earlier, but the 
results fell short of Wall Street's expectations and its stock 
price tumbled , down 8 3/16 to 70 1/2. The photographic products 
company shored up an erosion in film sales in the United States but 
was hurt by a sharp downturn in copier sales and in sales in 
emerging markets. It earned $272 million, or 83 cents a diluted 
share, for the last three months of 1998 compared with a loss of 
$744 million, or $2.29 a diluted share, a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Business Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton wants the government to offer  
financial incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Wall 
Street firms and small businesses to resurrect the economies of 
underserved rural and urban areas from Appalachia to Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is to announce the proposals Friday at an economic  
conference organized by the Wall Street Project, an initiative of 
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. The project's mission is to 
expand business opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which will be included in Clinton's budget plan,  
are the culmination of talks Clinton has had with Congress, federal 
agencies, community groups, finance experts and Jackson, who has 
been pushing for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson particularly wants to see agencies created that offer  
the same kinds of incentives the government now offers U.S. 
businesses going overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, he cited, among other agencies, the Overseas  
Private Investment Corp., an arm of the government that finances 
U.S. businesses overseas. The corporation offers loans and loan 
guarantees and secures private investment funds while insuring 
overseas investments against political risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a domestic version of these vehicles,'' Jackson said.  
``Whether it's the Ozarks, East L.A. or Harlem, there must be 
vehicles ... to transport capital to people who need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hill, state treasurer of Oregon and president of the  
National Association of State Treasurers, praised the concept 
Thursday at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense to me to use the same ideas to serve  
underserved people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Cheap, president of South Shore Bank in Chicago, a  
leading investor in underserved neighborhoods, said the programs 
would work if the government creates sustainable institutions in 
communities as opposed to one-shot efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Jackson's second annual Wall Street conference, a  
two-day affair whose sponsors include a number of blue chip 
companies such as Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Ford and General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first conference, the president said it was in the U.S.'s  
interest to invest where the strong economy had not reached, 
bringing together ``the gleaming office tower and the dark 
shadows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he offered no plans, but this year he will get  
specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of it is taking from existing programs and ... funding  
them better as well as trying to propose some new initiatives,'' 
said Gene Sperling, chairman of President Clinton's National 
Economic Council, who declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	White House sources and others who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity said the initiatives would be worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiatives seek investment bankers to place capital, with  
guarantees, in the nation's underserved areas. Studies have shown 
that inner city dwellers both white and non-white have millions of 
dollars in disposable income but nowhere to spend them. Blacks, 
Latinos and Asians have an estimated $1 trillion in disposable 
income that could be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the administration has come up with, and I've been  
working with them around the clock, is to use the tax codes to 
invest in these types of communities and to (have investors) 
receive tax credits for the amount of monies they invest,'' said 
U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Wall Street Project thus far achieved small, but  
measurable goals. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he intervened in a discrimination dispute  
involving workers and Con Edison, the big New York City utility, 
convincing the workers to enter a mediation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed also hired three minority firms to help manage its  
pension portfolio, an example that was followed Thursday by the 
telecommunications companies Bell Atlantic and GTE, which plan to 
do the same.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Mayor Calls Pie Act `Criminal' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mayor Willie Brown told a jury that jamming  
pies in his face was a criminal attack, not a joke by political 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an assault on my person by three people, not one, in a  
cowardly manner, with the intention of doing injury to my face and 
my eyes,'' Brown testified Wednesday at a Superior Court trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the persons who assaulted me in a violent, hostile  
way ... should be prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first day of the trial of members of the Biotic  
Baking Brigade, who face misdemeanor charges of battery and assault 
on a public official. 
</P>
<P>
	Rahula Janowski, 27, Justin Gross, 27, and Jerard Livernois, 34,  
were arrested after they hit Brown with cherry, pumpkin and tofu 
cream pies as he gave a speech in November. They said they were 
protesting the mayor's policies on homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pieing, not a crime,'' defense lawyer Mark  
Vermeulen told the jury in his opening statement earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Maria Bee told the jury the pie-throwing was a  
criminal act. If convicted, the three face up to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Baking Brigade's other victims are Nobel Prize-winning  
economist Milton Friedman, the head of the Monsanto Corp. and the 
executive director of the Sierra Club.

<HEADLINE> Women Endorse Equality Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For all the gains women have made in recent years,  
female lawmakers and activists are still looking for economic 
equality -- and not just in the paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	At statehouses from Boston to Olympia, Wash., women from 20  
states planned to call today for paid medical and maternity leave, 
expanded job training programs, better pay and more money for women 
who want to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The statehouse challenge goes beyond endorsing an agenda for  
women's economic sufficiency. It aims to get ideas off the drawing 
boards through legislative policy initiatives in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaining political power seemed paramount in 1992's Year of the  
Woman, but a poll taken four years later by the Washington-based 
Center for Policy Alternatives -- sponsor of today's statehouse 
events -- shows that women want economic power. 
</P>
<P>
	Their wish list includes affordable health care, access to  
financial markets and freedom from having to choose between keeping 
their jobs and caring for their families. 
</P>
<P>
	With states enjoying budget surpluses, it is the perfect time to  
push for change, said Linda Tarr-Whelan, chairwoman of the 
nonprofit Center for Policy Alternatives and U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
	Quality childcare remains a top priority -- and an elusive one,  
partly because of meager pay. The nation's childcare workers earn 
between 55 and 70 percent of what other hourly workers make. In 
Massachusetts, the ratio is 68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watch my daughter still dealing with problems of child care  
that are the same as they were for me 30 years ago when she was a 
tiny baby,'' Tarr-Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, women's groups seek paid family and medical  
leave to recover from illness or take care of family members who 
need them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, legislators in Austin are calling for increased job  
training, a potential boon for the 82.6 percent of Texas women 
without college educations. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Atlanta, 18 lawmakers planned to introduce legislation  
that would prohibit insurance companies from dropping policies of 
domestic violence victims or curtailing their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other states that planned to launch initiatives today were  
Maine, Washington, Michigan, Arizona, Idaho, Oklahoma, Missouri, 
West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Hawaii, 
New York, Colorado, Nevada, Connecticut and Maryland.

<HEADLINE> NBA Top Pick Fouls Out in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi is not having his way  
in European basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft fouled out with six minutes  
left in regulation Thursday and his Kinder Bologna lost to a 74-72 
double-overtime loss to cross-city rival TeamSystem in a Euro 
League playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, whose NBA rights are held by the Los Angeles  
Clippers, finished with six points and seven rebounds in 22 
minutes. He signed with the defending European club champions right 
before the NBA lockout was resolved, and has an escape clause that 
allows him to leave Kinder Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another player who went overseas because of the lockout, Vinny  
Del Negro, also struggled Thursday, scoring two points in 13 
minutes for TeamSystem. The San Antonio Spurs guard can return to 
the NBA after Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder Bologna is 1-2 since Olowokandi joined the team, and he's  
averaging 11.3 points and nine rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi went to the bench Thursday after picking up his  
fourth foul with 11:47 left. When coach Ettore Messina put the 
7-foot-1 center back on the floor five minutes later, Olowokandi 
was whistled for an offensive foul the first time he touched the 
ball and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	European pro games are 40 minutes, and players get five fouls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lithuanian Arturas Karnisovas, a Seton Hall product, led  
TeamSystem with 18 points, including the winning free throws with 
four seconds left in the second OT.

	``To set a different standard in this trial is to say that the  
standard for judicial truthfulness during grand jury testimony is 
higher than that of presidential truthfulness. That result would be 
absurd. The truth is the truth, and a lie is a lie. There cannot be 
different levels of truth for judges than for presidents.'' --

	``During his presentation to the House Judiciary Committee, the  
president's very able lawyer, Charles Ruff, was asked directly: Did 
the president lie during his sworn grand jury testimony? 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ruff could have answered that question directly, but he  
did not. And his failure to do so speaks a thousand words. Is there 
not something sacred when a witness in a judicial proceeding raises 
his or her right hand and swears before God and the public to tell 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?'' -- 
Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we want to tell the country that its leader gets a pass  
when he's required to give testimony under oath? Should we not be 
concerned about the effect of allowing perjurious, false and 
misleading statements by the president to go unpunished on the 
truthfulness of anyone's testimony in future judicial and 
legislative proceedings?'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What is on trial here is the truth and the rule of law.  
Failure to bring President Clinton to account for his serial lying 
under oath and preventing the courts from administering equal 
justice under law will cause a cancer to be present in our society 
for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those parents who have asked the question should be able to  
tell their children that even if you are the president of the 
United States, if you lie when sworn to tell the truth, the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth, you will face the consequences of 
that action even when you will not accept the responsibility for 
it.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``America is a place where government exists by the consent of  
the governed, and that means our nation's leaders must earn and 
re-earn the trust of the people with everything they do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever an elected official stumbles, that trust is eroded  
and public cynicism goes up. The more cynicism that exists about 
government, its institutions and those chosen to serve in them, the 
more difficult the job is for those who are serving. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's why it's important -- yes, vital -- that when a  
cancer exists in the body politic, our job, our duty, is to excise 
it. If we fail in our duty, I fear that difficult and dedicated 
work done by thousands of honorable men and women elected to serve, 
not just here in Washington, but in our state capitals, city halls, 
courthouses and school board rooms, will be swept away in a sea of 
public cynicism.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the walls of the capitol and throughout this great  
country, there rages an impassioned and divisive debate over the 
future of this presidency.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president engaged in a conspiracy of crimes to prevent  
justice from being served. These are impeachable offenses for which 
the president should be convicted. Over the course of the days and 
weeks to come, we, the House managers, will endeavor to make this 
case.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legacy now must be not to lose the trust the people should  
have in our nation's leaders. Our legacy now must be not to cheapen 
the legacies left by our forebears. Our legacy must be to do the 
right thing based upon the evidence. And for the sake of our 
country, the Senate must not fail.'' -- Sensenbrenner.

<HEADLINE> NBC Aims for Less Sex in Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NBC is turning a cold shower on  
overheated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said Thursday the  
network, home of such sexy comedies as ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' needs to put less emphasis on bedroom antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, we could use a few more words between `Hello'  
and `Would you sleep with me?''' Sassa told the Television Critics 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa, who took over as top programmer last fall, said he also  
wants NBC to show more traditional two-parent families, more 
diversity and more programs set somewhere other than New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his remark about toning down the sexual content in  
series that prompted the most questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa was quick to explain that he didn't mean NBC was turning  
puritanical. ``We're not trying to create The Family Channel 
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a show like ``Friends,'' about singles living in the big  
city, sexuality is a logical part of the formula, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying no sex. I'm saying less sex, and it depends on  
the kind of show it is,'' Sassa said. ``When sex is used in a smart 
way, it works out OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends'' airs at 8 p.m. in many markets, and NBC, which also  
focuses on young singles with comedies like ``Caroline in the 
City'' and ``Just Shoot Me,'' has taken heat for scheduling racy 
fare early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa also acknowledged that NBC has weak spots in its schedule  
outside of its key Thursday night lineup that includes ``ER'' and 
``Friends,'' but he said the network has several shows in 
development for spring. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ``Everything's Relative'' with Jeffrey Tambor (who  
played Hank on ``The Larry Sanders Show'') and another sitcom 
called ``Cold Feet,'' based on a British series. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to predict what effect Michael Jordan's retirement would  
have on NBC's broadcast of NBA games, Sassa reached back to 
Jordan's first retirement three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings dipped 5 percent then, Sassa said, although the lockout  
and the shortened season makes this year's situation more difficult 
to gauge.

<HEADLINE> Talk of Nissan-DaimlerChrysler Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co.'s president signaled his  
willingness today to consider a capital tie-up with DaimlerChrysler 
AG should such a proposal be put forward by the German-American 
automaker, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they propose entering a capital tie-up with us, we would  
consider it seriously,'' Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa was 
quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan officials were unavailable for comment today.  
</P>
<P>
	The reported remark by the head of Japan's debt-laden No. 2  
automaker came just days after DaimlerChrysler co-Chairman Juergen 
Schrempp was reported saying his company might be interested in 
acquiring an equity stake in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp plans to fly to Tokyo next week for an exhibition of  
DaimlerChrysler vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been in negotiations with DaimlerChrysler and its  
German predecessor, Daimler-Benz AG, for a possible expanded 
alliance -- including sharing technology -- in commercial vehicle 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler Corp. in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan and Daimler-Benz had agreed in July to jointly build a  
light truck starting in 2002 as the first step toward broader 
cooperation. Daimler also said at that time it was considering 
obtaining a stake in Nissan's truck-making subsidiary, Nissan 
Diesel Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also has been reportedly discussing possible linkups with  
Renault of France and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan reported in November it suffered a net loss of $291  
million for the six months ended in September, partly due to a 
deepening slump in demand for vehicles in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Johnson To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson, on the verge of quitting,  
changed his mind today and will remain as coach of the Miami 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away  
offensively from getting that championship,'' Johnson said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said former Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt, a former  
Johnson assistant in Dallas, will join the Dolphins as assistant 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the death of his mother a month ago had made him  
realize that he needed to spend more time with his family, 
especially since he was marrying his longtime girlfriend, Rhonda 
Rookmaaker. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga convinced Johnson today that  
hiring Wannstedt would allow him to have more time off from the 
15-hour workdays during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga had rushed back from a baseball meeting in California  
after word surfaced late Wednesday that Johnson had been prepared 
to end his tenure after three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	That stunning news came less than a week after the Dolphins were  
eliminated from the NFL playoffs with a 38-3 loss in Denver.

<HEADLINE>  A Scene Like No Other in 131 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was tough obeying democracy's rare summons  
to sit still and be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those chairs are more museum pieces,'' observed newcomer Peter  
Fitzgerald, Republican senator from Illinois, after six hours of 
sitting and listening. ``I don't think they had sitting in mind 
when they designed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A chamber that echoes with debate and chatter was devoted  
Thursday to a monologue, the opening House Republican case on why 
President Clinton should be thrown out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators acted as jurors. Some were transfixed, gazing  
sphinx-like upon the proceedings. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller 
of West Virginia was stuck in the same contemplative, hands-clasped 
pose all day. 
</P>
<P>
	A decorum suited to the august chamber was the norm on this  
far-from-normal occasion. The House Republicans who had unleashed 
the graphic Starr report on the world tread delicately on matters 
sexual when they stood in the well, Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
behind them, presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the House impeachment  
managers, struggled to make his point about how Clinton dodged 
legal definitions of sexual relations without getting into the sort 
of details that, not so long ago, made following the news a 
treacherous business for families with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel a need to enumerate to this body what the actual  
body parts are,'' Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House members brought video, slides and charts. There again  
was the stark tape of Clinton fudging in testimony. Also, shown was 
video of two of his oaths -- when he became president, and again in 
court proceedings when he said ``I do'' to the oath committing him 
to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on a day of ringing history, there was a ring of the  
familiar. Senators may have resolved to cleanse their minds of bias 
and subvert their political nature, but these are people who, for 
the most part, have been following the Monica Lewinsky saga from 
Day One. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept feeling like I heard everything again and again,'' said  
Democratic Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers -- their turn to come -- sat around one of  
the curved tables specially made for the trial. Among them, David 
Kendall sat there with his beaten-up briefcase, eyebrows raised, 
head bent, mouth drawn down at the edges into what appeared to be a 
permanent look of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	He took few notes. Mostly, he had his two pens lined up neatly  
on the table. He was among the first to yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for a special measure of wisdom,'' Senate chaplain  
Lloyd J. Ogilvie prayed at the start. ``Now, dear Father, help us 
through this difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee and essentially leader of the prosecution, gave an 
introductory speech that marked the drama's turning from high 
ceremony to painstaking business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are now stewards of the oath,'' he said gravely. He  
invoked Sir Thomas More, who chose to die rather than swear an oath 
that he could not live by. Senators paid rapt attention at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the particulars. The prosecution team got out the  
charts and the senators began to fidget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their demeanor was, 'Let's cut to the quick -- I've heard this  
all before,''' said Nora Owen, an Irish member of Parliament 
watching from the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' eyes closed and his  
head dropped several times. Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, 
battling a cold, leaned his head heavily on his hand, eyes also 
drifting shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than  
hell to stay awake.'' But he praised the House team's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Snyder, a teacher from Wasilla, Alaska, said the senators  
seemed to be paying attention for the most part. ``They looked like 
they were taking notes. They could have been writing grocery lists 
for all I know.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Reagan Adviser May Head CBO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A one-time aide to former President Reagan and  
former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker seems likely to become 
the new chief of the Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,  
recommended Wednesday that Dan Crippen become director of Congress' 
official budget analysis agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici's recommendation means Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., is virtually certain to support Crippen, and House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is also expected to endorse him. By 
law, the CBO director is appointed by House and Senate leaders 
without a confirmation vote by either body. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office is pivotal for Congress' budget process  
because it is the official estimator of federal spending. It has a 
long history of nonpartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency came under pressure last year from Newt Gingrich,  
R-Ga., who was then speaker. He accused it of undermining GOP 
tax-cutting plans by consistently underestimating the size of 
federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Democrats said that based on their interviews with  
Crippen and his moderate record, they believe he will not abandon 
the CBO's longtime practice of making budget estimates using 
mainstream economic methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Crippen has strongly assured us he would run CBO in an  
entirely nonpartisan manner,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New 
Jersey, ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Crippen received a Ph.D. in public finance from Ohio State  
University. He was an aide to Baker, R-Tenn., and moved to the 
White House in the waning years of the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a principal at the consulting firm of Washington Counsel,  
where he focuses on budget issues, health care, retirement, trade 
and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	He would replace June O'Neill, who announced last October that  
she would return to academic life in New York when her four-year 
term expires this month.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson's voice cracked and his eyes  
welled with tears Thursday as he explained his flirtation with 
retirement by describing the worst loss of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went to mother's funeral, they had the viewing the day  
before, and I wasn't able to do that,'' Johnson said, pausing 
between sentences to compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 20 death of his mother, Allene, his father's fight with  
cancer and his impending marriage had Johnson ready to quit as 
coach of the Miami Dolphins -- until the team's owner talked him 
into a startling change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with owner Wayne Huizenga, the 55-year-old  
Johnson decided to delegate some of his duties by hiring former 
Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt as assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times when you pull back and say, `Be with the  
people you care about, and don't shortchange them. They care about 
you. They love you. They're supportive in everything you do. Give 
them just a little bit back,''' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of quitting, Johnson will return for a fourth season  
with Miami in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is going to be the same as far as getting us to  
a championship,'' he told a hastily called news conference. ``But I 
will try to spend a few more hours with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild sequence of events began late Wednesday, when the news  
surfaced that Johnson planned to retire. Dolphins officials were 
braced for Johnson's departure when he arrived at work Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not looking forward to being on the streets looking for  
a coach,'' team president Eddie Jones said, ``and that's where we 
were headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting outside the head coach's office, Johnson said, was  
quarterback Dan Marino, eager to persuade him to stay. Johnson then 
met with Huizenga, who flew overnight from a baseball meeting in 
California to keep his coach, and they discussed the addition of 
Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, fired two weeks ago after six seasons with the Bears,  
was an assistant to Johnson when the Dallas Cowboys won the 1992 
NFL title and the Miami Hurricanes won the 1987 national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne's smart enough to see this can work,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with his assistant coaches, who endorsed the new  
chain of command, Johnson announced that he'll stay for another 
season. But he'll also try to cut down on the 16-hour workdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be times I'm not going to be here until  
midnight -- but Dave will,'' Johnson said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't talk about that,'' Wannstedt jokingly protested.  
</P>
<P>
	The developments raised questions about Johnson's commitment,  
but he stressed several times during the news conference that he 
remains devoted to the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to coach like the dickens to get us a  
championship,'' he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and players apparently believe him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad Jimmy has decided to stay and continue the progress  
we have made over the last three years,'' Marino said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga didn't attend the news conference, but he grinned later  
while rushing to his car at the Dolphins' complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything you can do to save Jimmy is a good day,'' Huizenga  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in the plans is Johnson's marriage to his longtime  
girlfriend, Rhonda Rookmaaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's excited about me staying,'' Johnson said. ``The only  
thing she said was, `I'm not letting you off the hook. You're still 
marrying me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is under contract through 2000 after signing a one-year  
extension in April. But with Wannstedt now the heir apparent, 
Johnson was noncommittal about coaching beyond 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows?'' Johnson said. ``I can't say what's going to  
happen a year from now. You may be stuck with me forever. I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Johnson retiring was a surprise because the  
Dolphins appear on the verge of Super Bowl contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the humiliating 38-3 loss at Denver was the most  
lopsided postseason loss in team history, the Dolphins have 
improved in each of Johnson's three seasons. This year, they 
allowed the fewest points in the NFL and won a playoff game for the 
first time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away  
offensively from getting that championship,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who divorced his first wife and has two children from  
that marriage, has always confessed to putting his job first and 
family second. He rarely remembers birthdays or anniversaries, 
doesn't observe holidays and dislikes talking on the phone. Now he 
wants to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret doing anything I did,'' he said. ``But I can  
learn from what has happened. I can be a better coach, more 
relaxed, more upbeat and more positive if I have a good family 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's funny how things work out: Johnson stays with the Dolphins,  
and they have themselves a new coach.

<HEADLINE> It's Business As Usual for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was in a suburban Virginia  
police station Thursday, talking about his plans to prevent crime, 
just as the first senators sat down in the Senate chamber to hear 
charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., rose to present the case against  
him, the president was sitting alone at his desk in the Oval 
Office, working on his State of the Union speech with the 
television set off, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	And as House prosecutors used oversized charts to argue that he  
told lies and obstructed justice and he must go, Clinton was eating 
lunch with the vice president. He then worked on his speech some 
more and talked to his budget advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton worked hard to make things appear normal as opening  
arguments began in his impeachment trial. If he had impeachment 
jitters, he didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
	The president began his day with a late-morning trip to a police  
station in Alexandria, Va., to announce his planned request for a 
five-year, $6 billion package to put more police officers on the 
streets and enhance the technology they use in fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals have the best technology. Police should, too,''  
Clinton said. ``Police carry a heavy burden. But we know they can't 
carry it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations  
Committee, criticized Clinton's plan, saying it would take money 
away from block grants set aside for other crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This raises the question of whether the president's latest  
initiative is part of a shell game, taking funding away from 
communities' crime-fighting needs with one hand and returning with 
Washington's strings attached with the other,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by two jurors in his impeachment trial,  
Democratic Sens. Chuck Robb of Virginia and Joseph Biden of 
Delaware. Biden sat at Clinton's right side on stage and whispered 
at length in the president's ear as the program started. The 
senator later joked that those whispers were about the original 
crime bill and what it took to get it passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton strode into the police station's gym to the strains of  
``Hail to the Chief.'' The 200 people assembled in the gym stood as 
he entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden praised Clinton effusively, saying he is a president  
``totally committed to education, totally committed to a thousand 
other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The cops have never had a better friend than Bill Clinton --  
never. Never, never, never,'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recalled his role in pursuing passage of the 1994 crime  
bill, saying he had vowed that ``we're going to stop doing what 
normally happens in Washington, which is that you make speeches and 
talk tough and nothing happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather say less and do more,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart accused House  
prosecutors of trying to ``impose their will'' on the Senate by 
attempting to cram too many ``extraneous issues'' into their case 
out of sheer political revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just indicative that what you're getting from them isn't  
on the level,'' Lockhart said. ``This isn't about a judicial 
process. It's about pursuing a partisan agenda from the House, the 
House Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton would not watch the impeachment trial. He  
preferred to get his updates from his legal advisers.

<HEADLINE>  A Scene Like No Other in 131 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was tough obeying democracy's rare summons  
to sit still and be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those chairs are more museum pieces,'' observed newcomer Peter  
Fitzgerald, Republican senator from Illinois, after six hours of 
sitting and listening. ``I don't think they had sitting in mind 
when they designed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A chamber that echoes with debate and chatter was devoted  
Thursday to a monologue, the opening House Republican case on why 
President Clinton should be thrown out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators acted as jurors. Some were transfixed, gazing  
sphinx-like upon the proceedings. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller 
of West Virginia was stuck in the same contemplative, hands-clasped 
pose all day. 
</P>
<P>
	A decorum suited to the august chamber was the norm on this  
far-from-normal occasion. The House Republicans who had unleashed 
the graphic Starr report on the world tread delicately on matters 
sexual when they stood in the well, Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
behind them, presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the House impeachment  
managers, struggled to make his point about how Clinton dodged 
legal definitions of sexual relations without getting into the sort 
of details that, not so long ago, made following the news a 
treacherous business for families with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel a need to enumerate to this body what the actual  
body parts are,'' Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House members brought video, slides and charts. There again  
was the stark tape of Clinton fudging in testimony. Also, shown was 
video of two of his oaths -- when he became president, and again in 
court proceedings when he said ``I do'' to the oath committing him 
to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on a day of ringing history, there was a ring of the  
familiar. Senators may have resolved to cleanse their minds of bias 
and subvert their political nature, but these are people who, for 
the most part, have been following the Monica Lewinsky saga from 
Day One. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept feeling like I heard everything again and again,'' said  
Democratic Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers -- their turn to come -- sat around one of  
the curved tables specially made for the trial. Among them, David 
Kendall sat there with his beaten-up briefcase, eyebrows raised, 
head bent, mouth drawn down at the edges into what appeared to be a 
permanent look of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	He took few notes. Mostly, he had his two pens lined up neatly  
on the table. He was among the first to yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for a special measure of wisdom,'' Senate chaplain  
Lloyd J. Ogilvie prayed at the start. ``Now, dear Father, help us 
through this difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee and essentially leader of the prosecution, gave an 
introductory speech that marked the drama's turning from high 
ceremony to painstaking business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are now stewards of the oath,'' he said gravely. He  
invoked Sir Thomas More, who chose to die rather than swear an oath 
that he could not live by. Senators paid rapt attention at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the particulars. The prosecution team got out the  
charts and the senators began to fidget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their demeanor was, 'Let's cut to the quick -- I've heard this  
all before,''' said Nora Owen, an Irish member of Parliament 
watching from the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' eyes closed and his  
head dropped several times. Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, 
battling a cold, leaned his head heavily on his hand, eyes also 
drifting shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than  
hell to stay awake.'' But he praised the House team's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Snyder, a teacher from Wasilla, Alaska, said the senators  
seemed to be paying attention for the most part. ``They looked like 
they were taking notes. They could have been writing grocery lists 
for all I know.''

<HEADLINE> Another Busy Day Ahead for Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- One more coach. 130 more players.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns' plate gets fuller by the day.  
</P>
<P>
	Browns president Carmen Policy planned to interview Jacksonville  
offensive coordinator Chris Palmer today. Palmer is the fourth head 
coaching candidate to meet with Policy, who has previously talked 
with Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick, Denver 
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Atlanta offensive line coach 
Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer already has interviewed with Baltimore owner Art Modell,  
who also owned the old Cleveland franchise. Palmer was said to be 
headed to Northwestern if Wildcats coach Gary Barnett leaves for 
Colorado, but that deal fell through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Policy said he would likely bring in 4-6 more  
candidates and expects to know the coach of the Browns before the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Browns also were to receive a list from the NFL  
today of 130 players they'll be able to choose from at next month's 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Resumes and scouting reports are piling up on desks at the  
team's Berea headquarters as fast as the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, 26 teams submitted lists to the league office  
of five players they would make available to the Browns for the 
Feb. 9 draft in Canton. Only the four teams involved in this 
weekend's conference championship games were exempt from filing, 
but they'll have to submit five names when their seasons are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players already known to be available to the Browns  
are: a Moose, a former Super Bowl MVP and a quarterback best known 
for banging his head into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns, who have already signed 14 free agents, can  
select 30-42 players in the expansion draft, and under provisions 
set up by the league, Cleveland must use up 38 percent of its 
projected $60 million salary cap on such players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns inherit the salary of any draftee, making the size of  
his contract as important as his ability or stature. 
</P>
<P>
	Some intriguing names are out there. There are also some  
bargains and busts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Desmond Howard, a Cleveland native, finally  
seemed to have salvaged a disappointing pro career after returning 
a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in Green Bay's Super Bowl 
victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
	He tucked his MVP trophy under his arm and bolted to Oakland,  
signing a four-year, $6 million deal with the Raiders, who promised 
to play him at wide receiver despite his previous failings at that 
position with both Washington and Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, though, was a bust in Oakland. He caught just two passes  
this season and could play his next one in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Redskins once thought Gus Frerotte would be their  
QB of the future after the seventh-round pick beat out Heath Shuler 
for the starting job in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frerotte, who after scoring a touchdown in 1997 injured his  
neck by head-butting a concrete wall, lost his starting job this 
year to Trent Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte's experience makes him attractive to the Browns. His  
nearly $6-million-per-year salary does not. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Daryl Johnston, a k a ``Moose'' Johnston, a  
two-time Pro Bowl fullback for the Dallas Cowboys. He'll turn 33 
next month, and his base pay will jump to $1.25 million next 
season. That prompted Dallas to make him available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands this is today's NFL,'' Johnston's agent, Leigh  
Steinberg, said. ``His preference is to stay with the Cowboys on 
this contract, but if Cleveland picks him he'll graciously go and 
give them his best efforts.''

<HEADLINE>  Historic Impeachment Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening their case in the first presidential  
impeachment trial since 1868, House prosecutors told senators today 
that President Clinton had committed ``egregious and criminal'' 
acts in concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky and should be 
removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton  
decided to put himself above the law -- not once, not twice but 
repeatedly,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said in making 
the opening argument for the 13 Republican prosecutors who seek to 
oust the 42nd president on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Making a case before a silent jury of 100 senators,  
Sensenbrenner said a conviction of Clinton -- requiring two-thirds 
of the senators -- would send a message to all future presidents and 
public servants that lying under oath will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing from the Senate lectern in front of Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist, Sensenbrenner said of Clinton: ``He has not 
owned up to the false testimony, the stonewalling and legal 
hairsplitting and obstructing the courts from finding the truth. In 
doing so, he has turned his affair into a public wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president engaged in a conspiracy of crimes to prevent  
justice from being served. These are impeachable offenses for which 
the president should be convicted,'' Sensenbrenner said in an 
hour-long presentation void of dramatic expression or the theatrics 
of many courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was away from the trial, traveling across the  
Potomac to Alexandria, Va., for a crime prevention event before 
departing for a trip to New York to encourage Wall Street to invest 
more in minority interests. On Wednesday, he had said he trusted 
senators to do ``the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today the House case is based on political  
revenge, not law and that Clinton would not testify as some House 
prosecutors have suggested he should. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' Press Secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor,  
said the House had impeached Clinton simply because he had violated 
his oath to tell the truth and uphold the laws of the nation. The 
prosecutors wove into their arguments allusions to historical 
figures, from Thomas More to Theodore Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
	``You are seated in this historic chamber not to embark on some  
great legislative debate ... but to listen to the evidence as those 
who must sit in judgment,'' Hyde said in an introduction of the 
House prosecution team. ``These managers will explain how egregious 
and criminal the conduct alleged in the articles of impeachment 
is,'' Hyde promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, the case you will consider is about those two  
words -- 'I do,''' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House prosecutor turned to modern technology -- not  
available when President Andrew Johnson was tried in 1868 and 
escaped conviction by a single senator's vote -- to bolster the 
case. Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., showed a videotape of Clinton 
swearing to ``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution'' when 
he took the oath of office as president in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team frequently argued that the grand jury  
testimony of Ms. Lewinsky -- some displayed on charts -- supported 
their case. At one point after extensive use of the former intern's 
testimony, Bryant renewed the prosecutors' request for a right to 
call witnesses during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can speak for all us, out of a sense of fairness,  
and again request that we and the president be permitted to call 
witnesses,'' Bryant pleaded. ``I would submit that the state of the 
evidence is such that unless and until the president has the 
opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses like Ms. 
Lewinsky -- and himself to testify if he desires -- there could not 
be any doubt of his guilt on the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators won't make a decision on witnesses until after opening  
arguments end next week. Prosecutors have identified Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and possibly even Clinton as 
possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after the 100 senators were sworn in as jurors,  
Rehnquist banged the proceeding back to order. ``The Senate will 
convene as a court of impeachment,'' he intoned at 1:04 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, the Senate chaplain, offered a brief  
prayer that the senators would engage in ``nonpartisan 
patriotism.'' The prosecutors then were given the floor to make 
their case that Clinton's offenses were high crimes and 
misdemeanors requiring his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former federal prosecutor, told  
senators it was a ``humbling experience'' to argue for the removal 
of the president. He used a series of charts to review the familiar 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton had ``crossed the line'' and coached the  
testimony of his secretary, sought to encourage Ms. Lewinsky to 
file a false affidavit by helping her find a job and tried to hide 
gifts he had given the former intern. ``Obstruction of justice is a 
serious threat to the integrity of our nation when committed by the 
chief executive of our land,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting White House arguments that the offenses did not meet  
the constitutional standards for removing a president, 
Sensenbrenner noted that the Founding Fathers explicitly considered 
bribery as an impeachable offense and that perjury carries an 
identical penalty under statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery. ... It follows that  
perjury ... be considered among the high crimes and misdemeanors 
the framers intended to be grounds for impeachment,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators sat quietly at their polished wooden desks, barred  
by trial rules from speaking in the chamber where they ordinarily 
debate. A few House members were seated at the rear of the chamber, 
and the public galleries were full. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's seven-member legal team, led by White House  
Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, were seated a few feet to the side of 
the lectern where House Republicans made their case. 
</P>
<P>
	In an impeachment drama dominated by partisan struggle, the two  
sides made an effort today to display bipartisanship. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans shook hands with Ruff. Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., greeted Hyde, R-Ill., with a hearty ``Mr. 
Chairman -- How are you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers entering the Senate from its main entrance were  
greeted by the blinding flashes of three dozen cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	In a freezing drizzle, people lined up outside the Capitol for a  
chance to view at least a few minutes of the trial. The Senate set 
aside 50 seats in the gallery for the public, and those seats were 
to be rotated every 15 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. That 15 minutes better be great,'' said Al  
Sitterson, 32, who drove in from the Virginia suburbs to get in 
line at 5:20 a.m., dressed in heavy winter garb. He had hoped to 
end up with a ticket as a souvenir but was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and Saturday. Clinton's  
lawyers will follow next week with their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have decided the trial will  
proceed as scheduled next Tuesday, even though Clinton will be 
delivering his State of the Union speech in the House chamber that 
night. The president's attorneys are expected to begin presenting 
his defense during that day.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson's voice cracked and his eyes  
welled with tears Thursday as he explained his flirtation with 
retirement by describing the worst loss of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went to mother's funeral, they had the viewing the day  
before, and I wasn't able to do that,'' Johnson said, pausing 
between sentences to compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 20 death of his mother, Allene, his father's fight with  
cancer and his impending marriage had Johnson ready to quit as 
coach of the Miami Dolphins -- until the team's owner talked him 
into a startling change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with owner Wayne Huizenga, the 55-year-old  
Johnson decided to delegate some of his duties by hiring former 
Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt as assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times when you pull back and say, `Be with the  
people you care about, and don't shortchange them. They care about 
you. They love you. They're supportive in everything you do. Give 
them just a little bit back,''' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of quitting, Johnson will return for a fourth season  
with Miami in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is going to be the same as far as getting us to  
a championship,'' he told a hastily called news conference. ``But I 
will try to spend a few more hours with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild sequence of events began late Wednesday, when the news  
surfaced that Johnson planned to retire. Dolphins officials were 
braced for Johnson's departure when he arrived at work Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not looking forward to being on the streets looking for  
a coach,'' team president Eddie Jones said, ``and that's where we 
were headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting outside the head coach's office, Johnson said, was  
quarterback Dan Marino, eager to persuade him to stay. Johnson then 
met with Huizenga, who flew overnight from a baseball meeting in 
California to keep his coach, and they discussed the addition of 
Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, fired two weeks ago after six seasons with the Bears,  
was an assistant to Johnson when the Dallas Cowboys won the 1992 
NFL title and the Miami Hurricanes won the 1987 national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne's smart enough to see this can work,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with his assistant coaches, who endorsed the new  
chain of command, Johnson announced that he'll stay for another 
season. But he'll also try to cut down on the 16-hour workdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be times I'm not going to be here until  
midnight -- but Dave will,'' Johnson said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't talk about that,'' Wannstedt jokingly protested.  
</P>
<P>
	The developments raised questions about Johnson's commitment,  
but he stressed several times during the news conference that he 
remains devoted to the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to coach like the dickens to get us a  
championship,'' he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and players apparently believe him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad Jimmy has decided to stay and continue the progress  
we have made over the last three years,'' Marino said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga didn't attend the news conference, but he grinned later  
while rushing to his car at the Dolphins' complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything you can do to save Jimmy is a good day,'' Huizenga  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in the plans is Johnson's marriage to his longtime  
girlfriend, Rhonda Rookmaaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's excited about me staying,'' Johnson said. ``The only  
thing she said was, `I'm not letting you off the hook. You're still 
marrying me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is under contract through 2000 after signing a one-year  
extension in April. But with Wannstedt now the heir apparent, 
Johnson was noncommittal about coaching beyond 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows?'' Johnson said. ``I can't say what's going to  
happen a year from now. You may be stuck with me forever. I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Johnson retiring was a surprise because the  
Dolphins appear on the verge of Super Bowl contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the humiliating 38-3 loss at Denver was the most  
lopsided postseason loss in team history, the Dolphins have 
improved in each of Johnson's three seasons. This year, they 
allowed the fewest points in the NFL and won a playoff game for the 
first time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away  
offensively from getting that championship,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who divorced his first wife and has two children from  
that marriage, has always confessed to putting his job first and 
family second. He rarely remembers birthdays or anniversaries, 
doesn't observe holidays and dislikes talking on the phone. Now he 
wants to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret doing anything I did,'' he said. ``But I can  
learn from what has happened. I can be a better coach, more 
relaxed, more upbeat and more positive if I have a good family 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's funny how things work out: Johnson stays with the Dolphins,  
and they have themselves a new coach.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Says He'll Serve Out Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch says he  
won't resign over the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, declaring he 
will remain IOC president ``until the last minute'' of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Samaranch dismissed  
calls by several Olympic-related officials that he should step down 
to accept responsibility for misconduct committed by IOC members 
during his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are saying this, but I have been elected by the  
IOC members, and if I have the confidence of the members of the 
IOC, I will remain as president of the IOC until the last minute of 
my mandate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, is scheduled to  
complete his final term in 2001, when he will be 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 13 IOC members were identified in the internal inquiry  
into allegations of corruption in the awarding of the 2002 Winter 
Games to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said nine members were accused of serious offenses  
punishable by possible expulsion, while four others were cited for 
lesser violations. He declined to name the members or the offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC is considering a code of ethics for its  
members. This would replace a previous set of ethics rules drawn up 
by Marc Hodler, the Swiss executive who rocked the IOC last month 
with allegations of widespread Olympic corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe (Hodler's rules) are not enough,'' Samaranch said.  
``Maybe for the future, we must think to have an ethics code. This 
is something we are studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke for 40 minutes Thursday in his first one-on-one  
interview with the international media since the worst corruption 
scandal in Olympic history broke last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had wonderful years,'' he said. ``We had very successful  
games. And now we are in a storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, calls for Samaranch's resignation have come from  
officials outside the Olympic inner circle: Ken Bullock, a member 
of the Salt Lake organizing committee; Robert Helmick, a former 
U.S. member of the IOC who resigned in an ethics scandal in 1991; 
and Rene Paquet, who headed the losing 2002 bid from Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch's position appears rock solid within the IOC.  
Executive board officials and rank-and-file members have all 
rejected calls for his resignation and expressed confidence he can 
lead a clean-up of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received many, many letters from members of the IOC  
supporting the IOC, supporting me,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he should accept some of the blame for the crisis,  
Samaranch said, ``I think the blame is not only for the president, 
the blame is also for the International Olympic Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch set up a high-level IOC panel last month to  
investigate allegations that IOC members or their relatives 
received cash payments, scholarships, jobs, free medical care, 
lavish gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC sent letters this week demanding  
explanations from the 13 members cited in the Salt Lake 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said four members had replied by Thursday; the deadline is  
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven IOC members have been linked with the Salt Lake  
City investigation by Olympic officials, investigators, press 
reports or the members themselves -- Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of 
Congo), David Sibandze (Swaziland), Bashir Attarabulsi (Libya), 
Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Sergio Santander (Chile), Anton Geesink 
(Netherlands) and Pirjo Haeggman (Finland). 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said some of the members may ask to appear before the  
six-man investigative panel when it meets in Lausanne on Jan. 23. 
The panel will report to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	If investigators recommend that members be expelled, the board  
will suspend them immediately, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual expulsion must wait until the next meeting of the full  
IOC assembly, scheduled next June in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, expulsion requires a two-thirds  
majority vote of the IOC session. However, any members facing 
expulsion would be free to resign before then, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC leader said it was still uncertain what action would be  
taken against members cited for lesser violations. He said official 
warnings were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not completely close the door on the possibility  
that the 2002 Games could be moved from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can speak only on behalf of the International Olympic  
Committee,'' he said. ``The hope, the desire of the IOC, is that 
the games will go on as planned in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler, the Swiss IOC executive who alleged widespread Olympic  
corruption last month, has suggested the games could be moved -- or 
some events held at other venues -- if Salt Lake City fails to meet 
its $1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said the IOC had no contingency plans in the event  
Salt Lake City organizers face a shortage of sponsorship funds and 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sponsors and public opinion are waiting for the  
reaction of the IOC, how we can clean our house,'' he said. ``The 
reaction will be on the 24th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC has three priorities: close the Salt Lake  
City scandal, adopt special measures for the bidding on the 2006 
Winter Olympics and change the voting procedure for all future site 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system we have today is not working,'' he said. ``We have  
to change the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the executive board would consider recommendations to  
ban visits by IOC members to the six 2006 Winter Games candidates 
and leave the selection of future host cities to the board or other 
small ``electoral college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may call a special session in the next few months to  
get changes adopted by the assembly before the 2006 site is 
selected at the June meeting in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Line Running at Full Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Almost two years later, Bob Whitfield still  
grimaces at the thought of being a lineman going from the 
run-and-shoot to an offense that relies on good, old-fashioned 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, that's the toughest change ever,'' said Whitfield, the  
Atlanta Falcons' mammoth left tackle. ``We went from moving 
backwards to moving forward. It's like a baby learning to walk. 
You've got to pull yourself up at first, then crawl a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took half a season -- and quarterback Chris Chandler almost  
got wiped out in the process -- before the Falcons' line learned to 
crawl. Now, heading in Sunday's NFC championship game at Minnesota, 
they're running at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
	While hardly considered one of the league's elite units,  
Whitfield, Calvin Collins, Robbie Tobeck, Gene Williams and Ephraim 
Salaam must be doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler threw for more than 3,000 yards, Jamal Anderson was the  
NFL's second-leading rusher with 1,846 yards, Terance Mathis and 
Tony Martin were both 1,000-yard receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons (15-2) led the league in time of possession (33  
minutes, 10 second per game), ranked second in rushing offense 
(131.3 yards) and fourth in scoring (27.6 points). 
</P>
<P>
	``They used to talk about us being a weakness, and maybe we were  
a weakness,'' Whitfield said. ``I don't feel like we're a weakness 
anymore. I feel like we're contributing to this team now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Dan Reeves took over as the Falcons coach for the 1997  
season, he ditched the run-and-shoot -- a pass-oriented formation 
that relied heavily on draws and screen passes -- and told his team 
it was time to get physical. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition was tough on everyone -- but the offensive linemen  
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	In the run-and-shoot, they were supposed to play passively,  
allowing defensive players to slip into designated gaps so holes 
opened up elsewhere. In Reeves' style of offense, a strong running 
game is mandatory, which means the guys up front have to control 
the line of scrimmage, or at least hold their own and let Anderson 
find a seam. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of plays in the run-and-shoot are so wide open, the  
linemen didn't have to knock people off the ball,'' Anderson said. 
``The big key for them was getting used to team blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first eight games of last season, the Falcons surrendered  
30 sacks and Chandler was injured four times. The running game 
averaged a paltry 73 yards per game and 2.9 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half of the season, the sacks dropped to 24 and  
the running game picked up to 132.4 yards per game and 4.4 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is getting the technique down,'' Whitfield  
said. ``That, and getting a physical attitude that you can move 
somebody. Once you work hard and have a little success, then it 
grows on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The line went through another transition at the start of this  
season. Free-agent signee Corey Louchiey, supposed to fill a gaping 
hole at right tackle, didn't even make the team coming out of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	By default, the Falcons were forced to turn to the rookie  
Salaam, a seventh-round draft pick. Further muddling the situation, 
Tobeck and Collins switched positions, Tobeck going to center and 
Collins to left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Williams and Whitfield as the only players in the same  
positions as last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons gave up 16 sacks in the first three games, but that  
number has dipped to an average of 2.8 per game since then. The 
22-year-old Salaam, meanwhile, has grown more and more confident at 
right tackle, allowing the team to run the offense without 
constantly having to worry about covering for his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Ephraim has improved, the whole offensive line has played  
better,'' said Chandler, who enjoyed a much healthier season. ``I 
think Ephraim has improved so much, it's really made the offensive 
line play real well this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camaraderie helps, too. The ``O-Line Club'' is probably the  
most close-knit group on the team, going to lunch together and 
good-naturedly handing out fines for various offenses, such as 
talking to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously in more of a mood to talk this season, they have  
accumulated a pot of about $6,000, which will be used for a party 
at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things are not going too well, the offensive line  
generally takes the heat,'' Williams said. ``We're used to that. 
But it's not something that's going to bring us down or deter us 
from getting where we want to go.''

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Screen Actors Guild has agreed to  
allow the audiovisual arm of the Mormon church to give hiring 
priority to Mormon actors and those outside the church who pledge 
to behave like Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year deal with Deseret Media Productions is awaiting  
signatures of SAG and officials of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, church spokesman Dale Bills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, non-Mormons must be willing ``to commit in  
writing to live their lives in accordance with church standards 
during the production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those standards are not spelled out, but Bills said they would  
be similar to the honor code signed by all students at church-owned 
Brigham Young University. Students promise to abstain from coffee, 
tea, alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, sex outside marriage, 
profanity, shorts above the knee, beards and earrings on men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis is on-set behavior -- that's what's going to be  
visible, therefore that's what's going to be monitored,'' Bills 
said. ``We're not going to challenge people's privacy.''

 *Sisters seek quieter grounds    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- The 15 nuns and four novices at the  
Monastery of the Poor Clares will soon leave Newport News because 
it is too noisy. 
</P>
<P>
	They are negotiating for 42 acres in New Kent County, according  
to Rev. James Arsenault, pastor of Our Lady of the Blessed 
Sacrament in West Point, who has helped them with their search. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuns lead contemplative lives, spending most of their day in  
prayer. Like all nuns, the Poor Clares -- whose order was founded by 
a follower of St. Francis of Assisi in 1212 -- take vows of 
obedience, chastity and poverty. But unlike most others, they also 
take a vow of enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	They rarely leave the monastery or speak to outsiders, even  
their families. Typically, one sister relays messages between the 
public and the rest of the order. But the cloister increasingly has 
had to fend off the roar of jets from Langley Air Force Base, the 
blare of radios from a nearby apartment complex and the rumble of 
trucks in an area that has grown considerably since the monastery 
opened more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother Mary Colette Rist, abbess of the five-acre monastery,  
said in an article in the latest issue of The Catholic Virginian 
that the disturbances make it hard to concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a contemplative atmosphere for a monastery,'' she  
wrote. ``We need a fair amount of property for seclusion to have 
the monastic environment.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 *Church laments theft of sacred bones    	
</P>
<P>
	CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) -- Centuries-old sacred bone fragments and  
the reliquary box in which they were displayed have disappeared 
from a Greek Orthodox Church. The pebble-sized fragments date from 
the third and fourth centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are very highly venerated,'' said the Rev. Philip  
Armstrong, priest of St. Katherine Greek Orthodox Church. ``The 
relics of saints are considered to be sources for healings, for 
answered prayers and for the blessing of premises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a grave loss spiritually to us.''  
</P>
<P>
	The fragments were gifts from monasteries and other Orthodox  
Church sources. The oldest is from St. Gerasimos of the third 
century. Others were from fourth century saints, including St. 
Demetrios, St. Paraskezi, St. Rafael and St. Haralambos.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell, host of Broadway's Tony  
Awards the past two years, will preside over next month's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host told ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' studio  
audience in New York during a break in taping Wednesday that she 
will be the master of ceremonies for the Feb. 24 broadcast on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Donnell's acceptance seemed to surprise executives at the  
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences who had been 
negotiating with her ever since Grammy nominations were announced 
Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Academy President Michael Greene made it official Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rosie is a perfect choice for us for so many reasons,'' Greene  
said. ``She is an all-around performer -- film and television star, 
Broadway entertainer and stand-up comedian, and most importantly 
she is the world's biggest music fan.''

<HEADLINE> World Watches Clinton Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Congress put President Clinton on trial before the  
eyes of the world Thursday, but much of the international audience 
was looking the other way -- at its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Turmoil in financial markets following Brazil's dramatic  
currency devaluation grabbed headlines and overshadowed the opening 
of Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican news media, occupied with economic woes, paid little  
attention to the president's. The daily newspaper Excelsior 
published Clinton's trial memorandum on its front page, but with 
little comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian radio ignored the Washington spectacle to focus on the  
big European Union story -- a vote of confidence over allegations of 
fraud and nepotism within the European Commission, the EU's 
executive agency. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton's impeachment got under way, the 20-member  
commission underwent -- and survived -- a vote in the European 
Parliament that could have forced its dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, a member of the EU, was watching too, and most evening  
TV news broadcasts played up the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday morning, a day after the Brazilian debacle, the  
impeachment trial grabbed the lead-story position in many British 
dailies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times of London's headline read, ``Battle begins for  
Clinton's survival,'' while the Daily Telegraph's story took up 
half of the front page. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent's display swallowed the entire front page with  
the headline, ``January 14, 1999. The day a President went on 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sky TV's all-day news program Thursday ran some live segments  
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And Channel 4 led its main news program with ``the extraordinary  
proceedings'' in Washington, which anchorman Jon Snow called a 
``bizarre partisan trial of strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's Washington correspondent, David Smith, called it a  
yearlong ``political soap opera'' and posed the question: ``Who 
over the next few days is going to test the patience of the United 
States Senate and the American public more? Will it be the 
Republicans or ... the presidents' lawyers?''

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Son Excused From Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- One of George Steinbrenner's sons was excused  
Thursday as a prospective juror in a racketeering trial after 
expressing concerns about the privacy of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked hard for nine years to make sure my kids have a  
private life,'' said Henry Steinbrenner, whose father owns the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner was worried about the stigma that might be attached  
to his family name and his children if he were selected as a juror 
for the trial of the Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National 
Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a law that high-profile people don't serve in  
high-profile cases,'' he said during questioning by Circuit Judge 
Susan Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, a St. Petersburg minister, and co-defendant Bernice  
Edwards of Milwaukee are accused of diverting money to secret 
accounts from corporations seeking to do business with the Baptist 
convention, which claims to have 8.5 million members.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After years of hating each other, Scottie Pippen  
and Jerry Krause now suddenly need each other. Pippen can't get top 
dollar without Krause's help, and Krause can't get anything back in 
a trade without Pippen's help. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Chicago Bulls are giving us one last soap opera  
before the breakup hits full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA teams learned Thursday that the expected starting date for  
the opening of training camps -- as well as the go-ahead for trades 
and free agent signings -- will be next Tuesday instead of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new collective bargaining rules, the Bulls can offer  
Pippen more than any other team, with a limit of $14 million. Since 
Pippen doesn't have the leverage to command that amount, the Bulls 
are trying to sign him for $10 million to $11 million and 
immediately trade him to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pippen, a free agent, could choose to sign with Houston,  
taking the Rockets' $9.5 million in salary cap space and leaving 
the Bulls with nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
	If Houston gave him a four-year deal, Pippen would make $44.2  
million. If the Bulls gave him a four-year deal starting at $10 
million, he would make $58.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Therein lies the price, at least $14 million, that Pippen must  
pay to mess up the plans of Krause, the Bulls general manager with 
whom he has feuded. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be my impression right now. I don't think you'll  
see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform again,'' said Bill Wennington, 
another one of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's best other option would be to sign with Denver if the  
Nuggets would give him their entire $13 million in salary cap 
space, but Pippen wants to win another championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the strongest Pippen sign-and-trade rumors involved the  
Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando Magic, with the Seattle SuperSonics 
a longshot, the Associated Press learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a Latrell Sprewell trade, the top contenders appear to be  
the Miami Heat and New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to numerous league sources who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, these were some of the scenarios regarding some of the 
most sought after players: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Antonio McDyess was trying to decide between signing with the  
Rockets, the Bulls, the Denver Nuggets and his old team, the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Suns could offer McDyess the largest contract for  
seven years, McDyess could receive an opt-out clause making him a 
free agent again after five years. And since the difference between 
what Phoenix could offer for five years versus what the other teams 
could offer would be only $2 million to $3 million, the Suns do not 
have a huge advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls scheduled a meeting with McDyess for Monday in  
Chicago. The Rockets are believed to prefer McDyess over Pippen, 
and the possibility of McDyess rejoining the Nuggets was realistic 
because of his friendship with Denver point guard Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Gugliotta was said to be leaning to re-signing with the  
Timberwolves for seven years, since Minnesota can pay him more than 
any other team. The Lakers were believed to have inquired about 
making a sign-and-trade deal involving Gugliotta, Eddie Jones and 
Elden Campbell, but the league's complicated base-year compensation 
rules would prevent such a deal. Houston, Denver and Detroit also 
are interested in Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The long-rumored Sprewell trade scenarios involving the  
Indiana Pacers appeared to be dead, and there were conflicting 
reports over whether the San Antonio Spurs had renewed their 
interest. There was a rumor of Sprewell, Clarence Weatherspoon and 
Bimbo Coles being sent to Miami for Jamal Mashburn, Brent Barry and 
Voshon Lenard or Dan Majerle, but again the base-year compensation 
rules appeared to be a major hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
	That could leave the Knicks as the best contender for Sprewell,  
although New York was believed to be offering a package of Chris 
Mills and Chris Childs, while the Warriors were asking for John 
Starks and-or Charlie Ward. The fine print of the sign-and-trade 
rules, however, would prevent Ward from being packaged with another 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the league, general managers and agents continued to  
be confused by the complexities of the new collective bargaining 
agreement relating to trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers from the league and union have been working the past  
several days to put the agreement in writing, and the lockout will 
remain in effect until the deal is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, every team was trying to gauge every other  
team's probable moves, and everyone was expecting a frenzy of 
activity to commence immediately after the lockout is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possibilities:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bulls free agent center Luc Longley was said to be headed to  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bulls free agent guard Steve Kerr was said to be going to  
Detroit, along with Clippers free agent forward Loy Vaught. The 
Pistons soured on Suns free agent forward Clifford Robinson when he 
asked for a four-year deal starting at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Atlanta Hawks were trying to decide between signing Lakers  
free-agent forward Rick Fox and Kings free-agent forward Billy 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Bulls were mulling making runs at free agents Jayson  
Williams (Nets), Jerry Stackhouse (Pistons) and Brent Barry (Heat). 
But Williams reportedly agreed to a six-year, $85.8 contract with 
the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Orlando Magic were again exploring the possibility of  
trading Penny Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Magic free agent guard Derek Harper received interest from the  
Knicks, Lakers, Rockets, Bucks and Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Clippers free agent center Isaac Austin was said to be  
choosing between Orlando and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks were looking into acquiring Weatherspoon.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Several contenders were trying to get Derrick Coleman to sign  
for the $1.75 million exception, but Coleman was trying to land a 
more lucrative deal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Portland free agent guard Damon Stoudamire was trying to use  
the possibility of signing with the Rockets as leverage to get the 
Trail Blazers to increase their offer.

<HEADLINE> Nature Film Hails King Penguin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Immaculately decked out in black and white,  
they stand erect and alert, their long rows extending to the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	They are king penguins, each occupying a small plot of rocky  
land near Antarctica on which they protect their eggs or newborn. 
</P>
<P>
	This striking scene is one of many in a new chapter of ``The  
Living Edens'' nature films. ``South Georgia Island: Paradise of 
Ice'' appears on PBS Wednesday, Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous ``Living Edens'' examined on PBS included Alaska's  
Denali, Africa's Etosha and Namib, Madagascar, Palau in the 
Pacific, Argentina's Patagonia and Namu in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow-peaked, glacier-packed South Georgia is a bit bigger than  
Rhode Island and lies about 1,200 miles east of the tip of South 
America. It serves as the mating ground for penguins, albatross, 
snow petrels, elephant seals and southern fur seal. The penguin 
colonies, numbering in the millions, are the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	BBC crews filmed on the island in summer and winter. Michael  
Richards, who has traveled the world to capture raw nature on film, 
did his work during the forbidding winter. Since living in the 
bitter cold was too dangerous, Richards and his assistant, David 
Rootes, retreated after each day's shooting to a supply boat 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards, 47, knew South Georgia from a 1992 visit for another  
BBC film, ``Life in the Freezer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was surprised by the severity of the winter,'' he said  
by phone from England. ``Also the rough seas. From the time we left 
the Falklands we had huge seas, the biggest the boatman had ever 
seen. I thought we would never find South Georgia at all because we 
got blown off course. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the island, the wind chill was the most numbing thing. The  
weather was about 20 below, the wind chill taking it colder than 
that. It was dangerous to have any skin exposed for any length of 
time. We were in the sort of winds that could blow you off balance 
on level ground if you weren't paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first three weeks of the eight weeks we were there, it  
stormed constantly. It was amazing, actually. But it was what 
produced the film we got.''

	The unique footage he captured helps explain how the king  
penguin chicks survive in the fierce winter. He was able to get 
close enough to the chicks without disturbing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't frightened per se,'' he explained. ``They don't  
see many people, though some of the penguin beaches are visited in 
the summertime. They were not frightened by me, because I was just 
another object. 
</P>

<P>
	His travels occupy him 200-300 days a year. ``Fortunately I have  
a family that tolerates it,'' he said. They include his wife of 22

than three months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Would Richards return to South Georgia?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go tomorrow,'' he responded immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	``Its remoteness, and the spectacle of its penguins and  
albatrosses, make it ``one of the most inspiring places that I as a 
wildlife cameraman have been,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about that isolation that other places don't  
give you.''

<HEADLINE> Powell Comfortable With Opting Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell said Thursday  
he'll likely avoid the campaign trail entirely in the next election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said he's completely comfortable with his decision not to  
seek the Republican presidential nomination and said he probably 
won't get involved with anyone else's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule that out, but right now I don't expect to be  
taking an active role in politics,'' Powell said at a news 
conference. ``It just generates too much speculation about my own 
place in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell was in the state where precinct caucuses launch the  
presidential nominating process to deliver a speech to business 
leaders and tour a renovated youth club. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last presidential election, Powell was mentioned as a  
potential GOP contender but he opted against running. He said last 
year he wouldn't run in the next election either. 
</P>
<P>
	As a retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who played a  
prominent role in the Gulf War, Powell was viewed as a serious 
contender. A black moderate, Powell is viewed by many as the sort 
of candidate that Republicans should field if they want to win back 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be entering political life,'' said Powell.  
``I am not seeking any political office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling, Powell referred to basketball's Michael Jordan's  
announcement Wednesday that he was retiring. Jordan said he was 
``99 percent'' sure he wouldn't play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found Michael a little wishy-washy,'' said Powell. ``He said  
99.9 percent. I'm more sure than that. I have been comfortable with 
it from the day I made it, 100 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes $6B for More Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton, celebrating new data  
that show a record low number of serious violent crimes, today 
proposed a five-year, $6 billion package to raise the ante on his 
nearly fulfilled pledge to put 100,000 new officers on the beat 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe future for  
our children, and I hope we can pass it with your help,'' Clinton 
said during a ceremony at a police station here. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee immediately  
criticized the plan, saying that putting more money into the 
program could mean subtracting money from block grants set aside 
for other crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robbing from one law enforcement program to give to another is  
not what we call addressing the nation's crime problems,'' 
committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because discretionary funding is exceptionally tight this  
year, appropriators expect the president to fund the initiative by 
terminating high-priority block grants, as he has proposed to do in 
past years,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics midyear  
report, due for release today, the total number of violent crimes 
for 1998 -- both incidents reported to police and those unreported -- 
is expected to fall below 3 million for the first time since 1973, 
when the bureau started its annual interviews with crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with the release of the preliminary survey data,  
Clinton ventured across the Potomac to this Washington suburb to 
dramatize the grass-roots support for COPS, the community police 
project he began with the 1994 crime law and a call for 100,000 new 
police on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals have the best technology. Police should, too,''  
Clinton said. ``For too long, we have seen criminals go free 
because the methods to gather evidence is not up to date. ... 
Police carry a heavy burden, but we know they can't carry it 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new budget will ask Congress for $1.3 billion in  
fiscal 2000 -- and a total of $6.4 billion over the next five years 
-- to extend the COPS program, said Jose Cerda, a crime specialist 
on the White House Domestic Policy Council. New hires under the 
program are expected to meet that goal by midyear. As of October, 
the Justice Department reported the total had reached 88,500 and 
was climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The balanced-budget agreement reached by Clinton and  
congressional Republicans in 1996 planned to phase out COPS, 
allotting $300 million for fiscal 2000 and then shutting it down 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's proposed package would earmark $600 million for  
fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1, for the hiring of 30,000 to 
50,000 additional officers, ``with an effort to target new police 
officers to crime hot spots,'' Cerda said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful that Congress will see the wisdom of continuing  
a very successful program that has, and will continue to have, 
strong law enforcement and local-level support,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., an architect of the original crime  
legislation, said the extra resources are necessary if the nation's 
police are to keep violent crime rates down. ``Let's not declare 
victory and decide we don't have to keep the effort up,'' Biden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an advance copy of the Bureau of Justice Statistics  
midyear report, the 2.88 million serious violent crimes in the 1998 
preliminary report compares to 3.04 million that the bureau 
reported in its final data for 1997. The number has been steadily 
dropping since a high of 4.19 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey defines serious violent crimes as rape, robbery,  
aggravated assault and homicide. If simple assault is factored in, 
the 1997 total rises to 8.61 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Property crime rates for 1998 are expected to be less than half  
what the 1973 rate of 520 per 1,000 households, according to the 
preliminary report. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money designated for hiring new police,  
Clinton's proposed $1.3-billion package for fiscal 2000 would 
provide funds for competitive grant programs, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$350 million for local police agencies to tap into new  
communication, crime-solving, and crime-analysis technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million for communities to hire prosecutors and  
``neighborhood DA's'' for locally tailored, preventive and 
crime-solving programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$50 million for communities to acquire the technology for  
community-based prosecution programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million for innovative community programs, such as  
bringing schools and churches together in the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative is one of the few billion-dollar-plus  
increases'' that Clinton is proposing in this year's budget, Cerda 
said. ``The data from ... (the Bureau of Justice Statistics), we 
think, is a good indicator that it is working.''

<HEADLINE> Europe Defense Co. Seen Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- France's plans to partially privatize its  
state-owned aerospace company have raised hopes that it will join 
Britain and Germany in forming a European aerospace and defense 
concern, a newspaper reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	France's privately owned Lagardere plans to merge one of its  
units, Matra Hautes Technologies, with state-owned Aerospatiale, 
after which 20 percent of Aerospatiale will be sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	That would reduce the state's ownership to about 48 percent. The  
move could make it easier to set up the European venture, which is 
being created to compete with U.S. defense contractors Boeing and 
Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Dasa, the Munich-based aerospace offshoot of DaimlerChrysler,  
already is talking with British Aerospace and Aerospatiale. The 
French have generally been the strongest opponents of a three-way 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	With the news of Aerospatiale's partial flotation, ``the French  
have signalled increased interest in talks,'' the business 
newspaper Handelsblatt quoted a Dasa official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dasa spokesman said only that the company is in constant talks  
regarding the restructuring of the European aerospace and defense 
industry, and that the company is talking to the French. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale Chairman Yves Michot, however, hinted that little  
progress was being made toward creating a three-way merger. He 
reiterated his that Aerospatiale would like to participate, but 
said getting France on board ``is more complicated than a two-way 
merger.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Not Worried About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All computer systems deemed critical to U.S.  
national defense, including those that warn of a missile attack, 
will be safe from glitches many expect when 1999 turns to 2000, 
Defense Department officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be 100 percent ready by the end of the year,'' Deputy  
Defense Secretary John Hamre said in announcing that as of Dec. 31, 
1998 the Pentagon had certified that 81 percent of ``mission 
critical'' computer systems were ready for the arrival of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had asked all government agencies to reach the  
100 percent ready mark by March 1999. The Defense Department will 
be at the 93 percent mark by then, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department ``went into hyperdrive'' with its Year  
2000, or Y2K, work after realizing last August that it was moving 
too slowly in preparing the approximately 2,300 crucial computer 
systems, Hamre said. In all, the Pentagon has about 10,000 computer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said minor glitches are likely to crop up on Jan. 1, 2000.  
``I think it's going to clearly be in a category of nuisance,'' he 
said. ``I'm very confident we won't have major problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem begins when computers try to add or subtract  
dates using only the last two digits of the year -- 00 in the case 
of 2000 -- which may confuse computers into reading the date as 
1900. Larger, older mainframe computers used by government and big 
corporations for many vital functions are particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill for fixing the Pentagon's computers and testing them  
will reach $2.5 billion, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Special attention is being given computer systems that affect  
the U.S. nuclear arsenal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said that in December the North American Aerospace Defense  
Command, or NORAD, ran a three-day series of about 30 simulated 
missile attacks to ensure that its Y2K-compliant computer systems 
would run properly in providing attack warning and assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every case the systems worked as designed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some individual nuclear systems, including Trident submarines  
carrying nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
already are certified as ready for 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, all other U.S. warfighting commands  
worldwide will run their own tests to evaluate the completeness of 
Pentagon computer fixes that affect them, Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy defense secretary said U.S. officials are working  
with the Russian government on its 2000 preparations, but he 
indicated that Moscow has been moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre acknowledged ``some nervousness'' in Washington about  
potential computer problems in Russia. ``They don't seem to have 
the same level of urgency that we have had over it,'' he said, 
while adding that there is little worry about accidental Russian 
nuclear launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a Russian expert on the Y2K problem said Thursday  
that ``the problem with strategic weapons has been solved,'' but 
that questions remain about Russia's air defenses and early warning 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Terekov, director of a firm helping Russian companies  
with the Y2K transition, said it was unlikely Y2K would cause 
warheads to detonate or missiles to be fired by mistake.

<HEADLINE> Senate Transformed Into Courtroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the ancient cry of ``Hear ye! Hear ye!  
Hear ye!'' the Senate's transformation into an impeachment trial 
courtroom was complete today. 
</P>
<P>
	All 100 senators were at their desks when Sergeant-at-Arms James  
W. Ziglar issued the courtroom call, which will open every day of 
the trial. It was followed by a prayer from Chaplain Lloyd J. 
Ogilvie asking for divine guidance to ``help us through this 
difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few minutes, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
took care of some housekeeping resolutions such as providing money 
for trial equipment and Chief Justice William Rehnquist mentioned 
that he ``may need to stand on occasion to stretch my back'' as he 
presides. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closest thing to a last-minute hitch, Senate workers this  
morning took down a television camera after Sen. Robert Byrd, 
D-W.Va., objected to its placement near the chamber's main doors. 
Byrd is the Senate's self-appointed historian and a stickler for 
its traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the room, with its soft blue-and-red carpet and  
polished wooden desks, was ready for the first presidential 
impeachment trial in 131 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two tables around the Senate presiding officer's podium were  
custom-built for the House prosecuting managers and President 
Clinton's legal team. In a twist, the House group will sit in front 
of the Democrats and the White House lawyers in front of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Four video monitors were set up near the chamber's front wall,  
along with two overhead projectors. Easels for charts and documents 
sat facing the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	In the main hallway outside, maroon rope corrals manned by armed  
Capitol police officers were set up to keep reporters from roaming 
too far. Printed guidelines were issued today for reporters with 
admonishments such as: 
</P>
<P>
	``Press cannot leave the roped area to stroll the corridor or to  
walk with senators who are not in the interview area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators themselves have a list of decorum rules, such as a  
requirement that they silently stand when Rehnquist enters the 
chamber or rises to leave. The senators shouldn't talk to each 
other, shouldn't read anything not pertaining to the trial and 
should ``turn off cell phones and beepers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were 14 people lined up in freezing drizzle at 9 a.m.  
outside the Capitol for a chance to view at least a few minutes of 
the trial. The Senate set aside 50 seats in the gallery for the 
public, and those seats were to be rotated every 15 minutes or so 
to allow more people a glimpse of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	First in line were Ricky Colson, 42, of Alexandria, Va., and Al  
Sitterson, 32, of Centreville, Va. Dressed in heavy winter gear, 
they said they arrived at 5:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to see something that nobody alive has ever  
seen,'' Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitterson said he was a bit disappointed that he wouldn't be  
permitted to keep a souvenir ticket. ``It's crazy,'' he said. 
``That 15 minutes better be great.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Claims Unauthorized Web Billing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission has asked a  
federal judge to stop a group of California-based businesses from 
billing consumers for unauthorized -- and sometimes nonexistent -- 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleges the companies placed charges on the  
credit cards of consumers, or deducted charges from their bank 
debit cards, for unordered and unwanted Internet entertainment 
services, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the consumers who were billed -- both from inside and  
outside the United States -- didn't even own computers, federal 
regulators charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers received bills with the charge item and a name of one  
of the businesses along with an 800 number to call. But when they 
tried to contact the company to have the charges removed, they were 
led on a wild-goose chase, the agency alleges. That included busy 
signals, no answer and a recording directing them to enter their 
credit card number to discuss charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers had difficulty reaching someone to speak to in-person,  
the FTC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency named the businesses J.K. Publications Inc., MJD  
Services Corp., and Net Options Inc. as defendants, along with 
individuals from the companies. The complaint alleges the 
defendants also used the business names Netfill, N-Bill, Webtel and 
Online Billing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Sacks, a lawyer for the defendants, called the charges  
``unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no intent ever on the part of these defendants to  
fraudulently use credit cards,'' said Sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacks said the companies are provided with members for their  
Internet services, but cannot always tell whether the members are 
legitimate or not. Once they learn that a consumer is billed for 
unrequested services, the companies remove the charges from their 
credit cards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the FTC, some of the consumers were billed  
repeatedly over successive months, forcing them to appeal to credit 
card companies for help. They were told by the companies that the 
charges could not be blocked, and in some cases, consumers canceled 
their credit card accounts to avoid the charges, according to the 
FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	At the agency's request, the judge has issued a temporary  
restraining order, appointed a temporary receiver for two of the 
companies and frozen their assets pending a further hearing.

<HEADLINE> Rights Group Criticizes Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican judges, prosecutors and  
law-enforcement officers collude to torture suspects, illegally 
obtain evidence and block investigations into human rights 
violations, a New York-based watchdog group charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch said a two-year investigation found judicial  
officials routinely failed to investigate reported human rights 
violations or to prosecute alleged torturers. 
</P>
<P>
	A 122-page report released Thursday looks at abuses by soldiers,  
state and federal police, investigators and other authorities in 
five states: the U.S.-Mexico border states of Baja California and 
Tamaulipas; central Morelos and Jalisco states; and Oaxaca in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Mexican government's assurances of its commitment to  
human rights, ``authorities are more likely to close ranks and deny 
that even well-documented abuses ever took place than they are to 
insist that those responsible be brought to justice,'' Human Rights 
Watch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The offices of Mexico's president, the Foreign Ministry and the  
Attorney General refused to comment on the report. Human Rights 
Watch said it had sent the reports to the government, but had 
received no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oaxaca, where the leftist Popular Revolutionary Army has  
staged attacks, state and federal police have arbitrarily detained 
suspected guerrilla sympathizers and have tortured people into 
signing blank papers later filled out to implicate others, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 case, authorities produced statements they claimed  
were given by three Oaxaca men accusing a fourth of rebel activity. 
A judge later threw out the Spanish-language statements because the 
three men spoke only an indigenous language -- not Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch said a 1997 case showed how complaints often  
are handled: Judicial police officers in Oaxaca state were assigned 
to investigate the shooting death of a man they were accused of 
murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities' zealous efforts to catch drug traffickers have  
resulted in tortured confessions and disappearances, the group 
said. In 1996, soldiers detained a U.S. citizen, Alejandro Hodoyan, 
in Jalisco state and accused him of being a bodyguard for the 
Arellano Felix drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodoyan told his family that soldiers tortured him for weeks to  
get information about the cartel. A U.S. law enforcement agent who 
was called in realized that Hodoyan was being held illegally and 
reported the case to the U.S. Embassy, which failed to act on his 
behalf, Human Rights Watch said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. officials were allowed to take Hodoyan to San  
Diego for further questioning about the cartel. He escaped and fled 
back to Mexico, where he was abducted by armed men -- allegedly led 
by a Mexican anti-drug agent -- in March 1997, Human Rights Watch 
said. He remains missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The group described what it said were problems that have led to  
a general breakdown in Mexico's human rights enforcement: 
</P>
<P>
	--Judges rarely throw out questionable confessions, even after  
defendants retract them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Evidence gained through illegal means is not necessarily  
considered illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prosecutors and judges routinely sit on or ignore complaints  
alleging human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Public defenders often are underqualified.  
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch, however, praised some advances, such as  
Mexico's agreement to respect rulings by the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, the country's improved cooperation with 
the United Nations, and work by Mexico's 8-year-old National Human 
Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The group noted, however, that Mexico's commission has no  
enforcement power and often does little more than recommend that 
authorities begin investigating a specific case. 
</P>
<P>
	It also expressed concern that new programs to crack down on  
rampant crime could open the way for further human rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations, the Organization of  
American States and the European Union to demand greater human 
rights enforcement from Mexico. It especially called on the United 
States to do so since it aids and trains Mexican soldiers and 
police.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Between moving in to a new home and  
practicing for the start of the LPGA season, Annika Sorenstam took 
time out to watch David Duval shoot a 10-under-par 63 on the way to 
winning the PGA's Mercedes Championships last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inspiring,'' she said Thursday. ``I think he's great.  
He's got a fluid swing, he's so down to earth and he makes it look 
so easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Duval's length off the tee, Sorenstam could have been  
talking about herself. Both have the same stoic demeanor behind the 
sunglasses. Both look like they're on cruise control, dominating 
fields with their consistency rather than breathtaking shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks up in his swing, too,'' Sorenstam said with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, both of them have become big-time winners.  
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam went over $1 million in earnings last year for the  
second straight season, winning four tournaments. She also won 
player of the year for the third time in four seasons, and she won 
the Vare Trophy for scoring average by becoming the first woman to 
break 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Now if she can only do what Duval accomplished in Hawaii last  
week -- win the season-opening HealthSouth Inaugural, which starts 
today at Grand Cypress Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming off a great year and I want to be better,''  
Sorenstam said. ``The scoring average says everything. Break 70 is 
one of the best things I've ever done. Now I want to get the 
scoring average down to whatever I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those must be frightening words to the rest of the tour. Then  
again, this is the same Swede who is obsessed with hitting every 
green and one-putting every hole (her pro-am team did shoot a 54 on 
Thursday, but she wants that score by herself). 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have to play until I'm 100, but that's what is driving  
me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the only thing that was driving Sorenstam last year.  
While her play was consistent as ever, Sorenstam didn't win until 
the first week of June. By then, a 20-year-old rookie from South 
Korea was well on her way to stealing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Se Ri Pak won the LPGA Championship for her first victory, then  
became the youngest winner of the U.S. Open by beating 20-year-old 
amateur Jenny Chausiriporn in a 20-hole playoff. Another week 
brought two scoring records and another victory. That was followed 
by a fourth win. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long before Sorenstam was on top of her game and, by  
the end of the year, on top of the money list once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning of the year, she wasn't motivating me to  
practice or anything,'' Sorenstam said. ``But the more the season 
came along, and she won two majors and her fourth victory, I 
started thinking, `She's good. I need to practice to keep up with 
her.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been good,'' she said. ``The competition with Karrie Webb  
was great, also, especially if you want to stay on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam loves nothing better than a challenge, whether it's  
Laura Davies, Webb or Pak. She's taken all of them on over the past 
four years and usually winds up ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might low-key it a little bit, but inside it means a lot to  
me,'' she said of the rivalries. ``I'm more competitive than I may 
show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no one can argue with the victories.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Robbins is the defending champion -- this was her only win  
of the 1998 season -- while Pak will be happy to just get back on 
the golf course again. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sensational rookie season did not come without a few  
distractions. She was hospitalized for fatigue during her 
celebrated homecoming to South Korea. She fired, re-hired and then 
fired her manager. She parted ways with coach David Leadbetter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before end of season, I was getting famous,'' she said.  
``After, make news with coach and I fire my manager. All talk about 
things around me, talk about my private life. Coach should talk 
about players, swing, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything makes me more busy. No time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pak says she is feeling more comfortable in her new country --  
she also bought a home in Orlando. And while her life outside the 
ropes may seem muddled, her goals could not be more clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to finish top-10 all the time,'' she said. ``I want to  
be player of the year, money list No. 1, everything No. 1. But it's 
not that easy. I do my best and work hard.''

<HEADLINE> Markets Cautious After Brazil News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stock markets showed some signs of  
bouncing back Thursday after the panic set off by Brazil, but 
caution still marked early morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets took their lead from Asia, where stocks later  
recovered after opening down. But trading was thin as the markets 
waited anxiously for direction from Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index of  
leading shares fell 39.7 points to 5,810.4 in the opening minutes 
of trading, but had recovered to 5,928.9 by noon. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAC 40 index of the most actively traded French stocks was  
up 58.47 points, or 1.5 percent, at 4,017.19 points by midday. On 
Wednesday, the index had fallen 3.5 percent to close at 3,958.72 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's drop was justified in light of what happened in  
Brazil ... but today people are going to take a step back and 
realize there's really no reason to panic,'' said Andres Marinovic, 
a trader with Credit Lyonnais Securities, who predicted rises for 
the CAC index throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Foley, economic adviser at Lloyds TSB in London,  
however, was not as optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	If Brazil's ``economy collapses, the implications for the U.S.  
economy and the rest of the world are fairly significant,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a fierce sell-off hit Wall Street on news of a  
dramatic currency devaluation in Brazil, an important U.S. trading 
partner. But stocks bottomed out quickly and partly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial index stood  
125.12 points lower, or 1.3 percent, at 9,349.56. In earlier 
trading, the Dow had been down as much as 261 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The sell-off occurred after Brazil's central bank chief  
resigned, and his successor allowed the country's troubled 
currency, the real, to fall nearly 8 percent against major world 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brazil's action was not a surprise, it stirred fears  
that Latin America's largest economy could drag the entire region -- 
and maybe even the United States -- into a recession. That, in turn, 
could pull the rest of Europe down. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said: ``The  
Brazilian authorities are well aware of the seriousness of the 
situation and they are determined to govern through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's stock market was trading with a gain of 0.92 percent  
Thursday, after opening with a gain of 1.46 percent, while the 
Helsinki Stock Exchange was trading up 3.2 percent at midmorning at 
5,895 points. On Wednesday, the HEX share index had fallen by 5.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, the Swiss Market Index was up 1 percent at 7,193.10  
points midday Thursday. In Budapest, stocks were trading slightly 
down by midday at 5,997.61, a fall of 47.4 points. Stockholm 
bourse's general index was 3,207, up 0.74 from previous day's 
closing in midmorning. The index had dropped 2.8 percent in 
Wednesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian markets opened with further tumbles, but rallied as  
the day wore on. Japan's market, however, seemed to ignore the 
Brazil crisis entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed with a loss of  
90.64 points, or just 0.9 percent, at 10,183.13. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the main Straits Times Index plummeted as soon as  
trading began, but by the end of the day it began to recover 
somewhat, closing at 1,476.39, a 1.97 percent drop from Wednesday's 
close of 1,506.06. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average climbed  
throughout the day and closed 335.26 points, or 2.5 percent, higher 
at 13,738.86.

<HEADLINE> Panel Criticized for Overfishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal councils charged with managing  
fisheries are failing to halt overfishing and protect essential 
fish habitat as required by a 1996 law, a coalition of 
environmental groups charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Fish Conservation Network asked that Commerce  
Secretary William Daley reject a series of management plans being 
submitted by the eight regional councils because, the group argued, 
they failed to adequately protect fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	The law ``clearly called for a sea-change in the way our  
fisheries are managed. Instead what we're getting is business as 
usual,'' said Ken Hinman, president of the National Coalition for 
Marine Conservation, one of the 88 groups in the network. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service said a  
review of 39 fishery management plans won't be completed for 
several months. ``If any of them or portions of them are found 
inadequate we're prepared to send them back to the councils for 
modification,'' said agency spokesman Scott Smullen. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the environmentalists' criticism was premature. Final  
plans won't be issued until probably this summer when they will be 
ready for review by Daley. The Service, which is part of the 
Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, regulates fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure from environmentalists was key in getting Congress in  
1996 to enact changes in the Sustainable Fisheries Act to address 
the dramatic decline in virtually all species of fish off America's 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires that the eight regional councils and the  
National Marine Fisheries Service develop fisheries management 
plans to reduce overfishing, the growing problem of fish being 
killed as ``bycatch'' and then discarded, and protection of the 
most vulnerable fish habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans submitted in recent weeks ``do not measure up to the  
new mandates'' and all or parts of some of them should be rejected, 
the environmental coalition said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Allison, president of Fish Forever, one of the coalition  
members, said the regional councils are ``putting short-term 
profits before long-term sustaintability'' in developing plans that 
in the long run will destroy fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	A report to Congress last October by the National Marine  
Fisheries Service said that 90 fish species already are being 
overfished and in need of help to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	And, huge amounts of fish -- more than 27 million tons worldwide  
-- are killed each year as ``bycatch'' that fishermen throw back 
into the water. This problem, said the environmentalists, 
``garnered little or no attention from (management) councils across 
the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the councils ignored the call for measures  
to quantify bycatch and, most importantly, take action to avoid 
it,'' the coalition said in a report analyzing the council plans 
that have been sent to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the coalitions complaints were that councils haven't  
called for actions to shrimp trawler bycatch in the eastern Gulf; 
is allowing continued fishing of seriously depleted species in the 
Mid-Atlantic; and have in many areas only identified essential fish 
habitat, but proposed no action to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional councils, although funded by the federal  
government, are comprised of state fishery managers, commercial and 
recreational fishermen and academics. One council, the one in New 
England, has a conservation organization advocate as members.

<P>
	PAOLI, Pa. (AP) -- Herman Ball, head football coach of the  
Washington Redskins from 1949 through part of the 1951 season, died 
Tuesday from heart ailment complications. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball spent eight years on the Redskins' staff, winning promotion  
to head coach midway through the 1949 season. The Redskins finished 
that year with a 4-7-1 record and won three out of 12 games the 
following year. Ball was replaced as head coach after a winless 
streak in the 1951 season. 
</P>

He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford was named chief steward of the Indianapolis 500 after a

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Radio and television actress Betty Lou  
Gerson, who gave a voice to fur-loving villainess Cruella De Vil in 
Disney's animated 1961 feature ``101 Dalmatians,'' died Tuesday 
after suffering a stroke last week. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney animator Marc Davis, who designed and drew Cruella De Vil  
in the classic movie, said Ms. Gerson helped define the character. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gerson began a radio career in 1935. She had dramatic roles  
on programs like ``First Nighter,'' ``Grand Hotel'' and ``The Lux 
Radio Theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was in ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,''  
``Perry Mason'' and ``The Untouchables'' on television and appeared 
in films such as ``Undercover Girl'' and ``The Fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her distinctive voice earned her the role of narrator in  
Disney's 1950 animated feature ``Cinderella'' and an on-screen 
cameo appearance in ``Mary Poppins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gerson gave up acting until she did voice-over work in  
recent years. She gave voice to a fish diva named Francis in the 
1997 animated feature, ``Cats Don't Dance.''

Jack Kevorkian's help, died Wednesday of natural causes. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Klooster's son, Dr. Gerald Klooster II, filed for  
custody of his father in Petoskey, Mich. He said his mother, Ruth

<P>
	Mrs. Klooster acknowledged having talked to Kevorkian by phone  
but denied ever trying to help her husband end his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The family battled for months in court, and judges in Petoskey

<P>
	A few months later, Klooster was found unconscious in his home

<HEADLINE>  Historic Impeachment Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening their case in the first presidential  
impeachment trial since 1868, House prosecutors told senators today 
that President Clinton had committed ``egregious and criminal'' 
acts in concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky and should be 
removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton  
decided to put himself above the law -- not once, not twice but 
repeatedly,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said in making 
the opening argument for the 13 Republican prosecutors who seek to 
oust the 42nd president on perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Making a case before a silent jury of 100 senators,  
Sensenbrenner said a conviction of Clinton -- requiring two-thirds 
of the senators -- would send a message to all future presidents and 
public servants that lying under oath will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing from the Senate lectern in front of Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist, Sensenbrenner said of Clinton: ``He has not 
owned up to the false testimony, the stonewalling and legal 
hairsplitting and obstructing the courts from finding the truth. In 
doing so, he has turned his affair into a public wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president engaged in a conspiracy of crimes to prevent  
justice from being served. These are impeachable offenses for which 
the president should be convicted,'' Sensenbrenner said in an 
hour-long presentation void of dramatic expression or the theatrics 
of many courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was away from the trial, traveling across the  
Potomac to Alexandria, Va., for a crime prevention event before 
departing for a trip to New York to encourage Wall Street to invest 
more in minority interests. On Wednesday, he had said he trusted 
senators to do ``the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today the House case is based on political  
revenge, not law and that Clinton would not testify as some House 
prosecutors have suggested he should. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the  
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim 
based on partisan political differences,'' Press Secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor,  
said the House had impeached Clinton simply because he had violated 
his oath to tell the truth and uphold the laws of the nation. The 
prosecutors wove into their arguments allusions to historical 
figures, from Thomas More to Theodore Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
	``You are seated in this historic chamber not to embark on some  
great legislative debate ... but to listen to the evidence as those 
who must sit in judgment,'' Hyde said in an introduction of the 
House prosecution team. ``These managers will explain how egregious 
and criminal the conduct alleged in the articles of impeachment 
is,'' Hyde promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, the case you will consider is about those two  
words -- 'I do,''' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House prosecutor turned to modern technology -- not  
available when President Andrew Johnson was tried in 1868 and 
escaped conviction by a single senator's vote -- to bolster the 
case. Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., showed a videotape of Clinton 
swearing to ``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution'' when 
he took the oath of office as president in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team frequently argued that the grand jury  
testimony of Ms. Lewinsky -- some displayed on charts -- supported 
their case. At one point after extensive use of the former intern's 
testimony, Bryant renewed the prosecutors' request for a right to 
call witnesses during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can speak for all us, out of a sense of fairness,  
and again request that we and the president be permitted to call 
witnesses,'' Bryant pleaded. ``I would submit that the state of the 
evidence is such that unless and until the president has the 
opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses like Ms. 
Lewinsky -- and himself to testify if he desires -- there could not 
be any doubt of his guilt on the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators won't make a decision on witnesses until after opening  
arguments end next week. Prosecutors have identified Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and possibly even Clinton as 
possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after the 100 senators were sworn in as jurors,  
Rehnquist banged the proceeding back to order. ``The Senate will 
convene as a court of impeachment,'' he intoned at 1:04 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, the Senate chaplain, offered a brief  
prayer that the senators would engage in ``nonpartisan 
patriotism.'' The prosecutors then were given the floor to make 
their case that Clinton's offenses were high crimes and 
misdemeanors requiring his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting White House arguments that the offenses did not meet  
the constitutional standards for removing a president, 
Sensenbrenner noted that the Founding Fathers explicitly considered 
bribery as an impeachable offense and that perjury carries an 
identical penalty under statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery. ... It follows that  
perjury ... be considered among the high crimes and misdemeanors 
the framers intended to be grounds for impeachment,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators sat quietly at their polished wooden desks, barred  
by trial rules from speaking in the chamber where they ordinarily 
debate. A few House members were seated at the rear of the chamber, 
and the public galleries were full. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's seven-member legal team, led by White House  
Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, were seated a few feet to the side of 
the lectern where House Republicans made their case. 
</P>
<P>
	In an impeachment drama dominated by partisan struggle, the two  
sides made an effort today to display bipartisanship. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans shook hands with Ruff. Sen. 
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., greeted Hyde, R-Ill., with a hearty ``Mr. 
Chairman -- How are you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers entering the Senate from its main entrance were  
greeted by the blinding flashes of three dozen cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	In a freezing drizzle, people lined up outside the Capitol for a  
chance to view at least a few minutes of the trial. The Senate set 
aside 50 seats in the gallery for the public, and those seats were 
to be rotated every 15 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy. That 15 minutes better be great,'' said Al  
Sitterson, 32, who drove in from the Virginia suburbs to get in 
line at 5:20 a.m., dressed in heavy winter garb. He had hoped to 
end up with a ticket as a souvenir but was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and Saturday. Clinton's  
lawyers will follow next week with their defense contending he is 
not guilty of perjury or obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have decided the trial will  
proceed as scheduled next Tuesday, even though Clinton will be 
delivering his State of the Union speech in the House chamber that 
night. The president's attorneys are expected to begin presenting 
his defense during that day.

	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson, on the verge of quitting,  
changed his mind today and will remain as coach of the Miami 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away  
offensively from getting that championship,'' Johnson said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said former Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt, a former  
Johnson assistant in Dallas, will join the Dolphins as assistant 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the death of his mother a month ago had made him  
realize that he needed to spend more time with his family, 
especially since he was marrying his longtime girlfriend, Rhonda 
Rookmaaker. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga convinced Johnson today that  
hiring Wannstedt would allow him to have more time off from the 
15-hour workdays during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga had rushed back from a baseball meeting in California  
after word surfaced late Wednesday that Johnson had been prepared 
to end his tenure after three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	That stunning news came less than a week after the Dolphins were  
eliminated from the NFL playoffs with a 38-3 loss in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``My determination and my committment is not one bit less than  
it was before,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I will spend a few more hours with my family.''  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's voice broke and he turned emotional when he spoke of  
going to his mother's funeral last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's time you pull back and you say, `Be with people you  
care about. Don't short-change them.' That's what I plan on 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Wannstedt would be a ``true'' assistant coach, and not a  
figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will work with all three areas -- offense, defense, special  
teams, just like I do,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who will wear the headset on Sundays, Johnson said:  
``We'll both have headsets on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Johnson is under contract through 2000 after  
signing a one-year extension in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's father, C.W., earlier had confirmed Johnson's  
retirement plans and his change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy has to do what he wants to do,'' C.W. Johnson said by  
phone from his home in Port Arthur, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's loss was the most lopsided postseason defeat in  
Dolphins' history. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Miami Hurricanes to the 1987 national  
championship and led the Dallas Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl 
titles in 1992-93. He was hired by the Dolphins in January 1996 and 
said he would have the team in the NFL title game in three years, 
but he has won only one playoff game with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has made steady progress since Johnson replaced Don Shula.  
The Dolphins went 8-8 in his first season, 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached the playoffs in 1997 and earned their first playoff  
victory in four years this season, beating the Buffalo Bills 24-17. 
Johnson's competitive zeal seemed as intense as ever after that 
game, when he celebrated by crushing a box of Flutie Flakes in the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said recently that he believes Miami needs only a couple  
of offensive playmakers to join the NFL's elite. Following the 
Denver debacle, he said he didn't consider the loss devastating, 
but said Miami simply must earn a higher seed in next season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson simplified the team playbook this season to put more  
emphasis on the run and less pressure on his 37-year-old 
quarterback, Dan Marino, but the offense frequently sputtered. The 
defense, however, allowed the fewest points in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries and playing at Denver were too  
much for the Dolphins to overcome. Johnson was uncharacteristically 
pessimistic before the game, saying the Dolphins faced almost 
insurmountable odds to win the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Gearing Up for Long Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Toni Kukoc knows just what to do with the  
Chicago Bulls now that the Airless Era is here. 
</P>
<P>
	Gut the team.  
</P>
<P>
	That might sound like strange answer coming from a guy with  
three championship rings and two years left on his contract, but 
Kukoc hates the thought of mediocrity even more than losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get the team with a few good guys that cannot reach the  
playoffs, they're always short of the playoffs,'' he said and then 
stopped, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Michael Jordan retired, the brutal reality of what  
the Bulls will be like without him is starting to sink in. Only 
four players -- Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are 
under contract, with Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Bulls say they want to bring back Scottie Pippen and  
the rest of the championship team, the prospects of that are 
looking less and less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, one of the Bulls' free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for starting center Luc Longley, who appears headed for  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pippen and the rest of the gang do leave, the Bulls would  
have enough money to make some deals in the free-agent market, 
which includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse 
and Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Chicago could pick up a few big names, don't expect  
to be partying in Grant Park any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's certainly 
probably not going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. Regardless of what happens to  
the rest of the championship team, the Bulls still plan to run 
their trademark triangle offense. The system isn't complicated, but 
it's not easy to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable with 
it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other out on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As painful as it might be to watch, this is the best time to  
rebuild if the Bulls are going to do it, Kukoc said. The 
lockout-shortened season will last only three months, so at least 
the agony won't go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls end up with a high draft pick and make some big  
moves in free agency over the summer, they could be well on their 
way to rebuilding a good team by next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, this has been a long time coming, Kukoc said. It's  
better to just get it over with now and move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was not this year, we would be here next year talking  
about the same thing. Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings 
than six, but we would be here and talking about, `What do you 
think about rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that 
it's better to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Cigarette Tax Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who has been rolling out a  
series of spending initiatives, will propose paying for them with a 
new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax, an administration official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigarette tax, which will surely be opposed by Republicans  
in Congress, would raise some $8 billion for the domestic spending 
initiatives, according to the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also will insist that states turn  
over some of the money they will get from a giant settlement with 
tobacco companies, but not this year. Clinton's plan doesn't count 
on that money until 2001, meaning he does not need it for the 
fiscal 2000 budget he will submit to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Clinton has touted a number of new ideas but  
avoided discussing how he would pay for them. Still, he has 
promised his budget will be balanced without reaching into the 
budget surplus -- making it nearly impossible to pay for new 
spending without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On almost a daily basis, Clinton has put forward spending  
proposals, including more money for after-school programs, new 
defense spending, tax incentives for long-term care and money to 
help people with disabilities go to work. The plans announced 
Thursday were for more money to fight crime and to aid people with 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional Republicans have consistently warned Clinton  
against paying for his plans with increased taxes, including 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes has never been the answer to our nation's  
problems,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, wrote the president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Thursday Republicans are  
concerned that other tax increases may be in the offing: ``This 
(cigarette) tax hike is not enough to pay for all the president's 
new spending programs, not even close,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton proposed paying for new domestic spending  
with a massive fine on the tobacco industry, envisioned as part of 
sweeping tobacco legislation. But that legislation fell apart under 
criticism that it was too hard on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The states responded by settling lawsuits with tobacco companies  
on their own. Cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion 
over 25 years, raising prices by 45 cents a pack. That contributed 
to a 30 percent jump in cigarette prices in December, the 
government reported. Four other states previously had settled their 
suits independently. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers and governors are already debating how to spend  
the money, but the federal government has long held that it has a 
right to much of it. Many state lawsuits had sought to recover 
money spent by Medicaid on sick smokers, and the federal government 
pays for at least half of Medicaid costs in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed a deal was possible. Administration  
officials indicated they might let states keep the money if they 
agreed to spend it on certain public health, anti-smoking programs. 
But now Clinton envisions using some of the money for the federal 
budget, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House still wants federal legislation imposing new  
restrictions on the tobacco industry, while also giving the federal 
government a financial settlement of its own. But that requires 
congressional action. The administration hopes states will press 
Congress for such legislation if their settlement money is on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to create an environment and pressure for a  
bipartisan agreement on tobacco,'' an administration official 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The states aren't pleased. They argue that some of the suits  
were based on consumer fraud claims, not Medicaid. They say the 
federal government should file its own lawsuit if it wants money. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire was told  
about the administration's plans and spread the word to other 
states Wednesday night.	   ``The federal government didn't assist us in any way,'' Gregoire 
said Thursday. ``Our taxpayers took the risk. We assumed all of the 
work.''

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Defense Unsettled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Kip Kinkel's lawyers refused to say Thursday  
whether they would use an insanity defense for the teen-ager 
accused of killing two classmates and wounding 22 in a school 
cafeteria shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge entered innocent pleas on Kinkel's behalf to charges the  
16-year-old shot his parents to death at his home last May, then 
went to Springfield's Thurston High School and opened fire on the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers previously hinted they will use an insanity  
defense, but told the judge they have not decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
	That angered prosecutors, who contend they need to know so they  
can arrange psychiatric evaluations and keep an April 6 trial date. 
Prosecutor Kent Mortimore said a delay would damage the state's 
case because students would be leaving school and witnesses' 
memories would fade. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings, part of a string of school violence across the  
nation, began May 20 after Kinkel was suspended for having a gun on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel faces up to life without parole if convicted as an adult  
on four counts of aggravated murder and 26 counts of attempted 
aggravated murder.

<HEADLINE> Hyperactivity Drug Researched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of American children take drugs daily  
to calm hyperactivity, but medical science has been uncertain how 
the drugs affect the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet  
hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a 
neurotransmitter, in the brain. A study appears Friday in the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer  
from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
or ADHD. These children are restless and impulsive and have 
difficulty concentrating. Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine have 
a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Duke University  
discovered the serotonin action of Ritalin by eliminating the 
possibility that the drug was acting on other brain chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	They used a laboratory mouse strain that had been genetically  
manipulated to lack a key protein in the processing of dopamine, 
another neurotransmitter. Such mice have symptoms similar to those 
of ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mice lacking normal dopamine were given Ritalin, they  
were calmed, proving that the drug was not acting on dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then blocked the effects of norepinephrine,  
another brain chemical, but this had no effect on the ADHD 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the researchers gave the mice Prozac, a drug that  
inhibits the action of serotonin. The ADHD symptoms declined 
dramatically in the mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, said the researchers, show that Ritalin acts on the  
serotonin levels in the brain by restoring a proper balance between 
serotonin and other natural brain chemicals.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than an hour into the day's  
history-making, Democratic Sen. John Breaux popped a second piece 
of gum into his mouth. Across the aisle, Republican Sen. John 
McCain kept brushing things away, as if under attack by dust 
bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators simply aren't used to sitting still this long.  
</P>
<P>
	But sit they did, dutifully, for hours on end, as 13 House

removal of President Clinton, using charts, slides, video and 
oratory about the meaning of the oath ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a dismal, gray day when the Capitol looked like a low cloud  
billowing from the end of rain-slicked Pennsylvania Avenue, the 
three branches of government came together in a common enterprise -- 
something rarely seen except in the happier January ritual of a 
presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist, presiding, told everyone of his

briefcase, eyebrows raised, head bent, mouth drawn down at the 
edges into what appeared to be a permanent look of skepticism.

<P>
	``We ask for a special measure of wisdom,'' Senate chaplain  
Lloyd J. Ogilvie prayed at the start. ``Now, dear Father, help us 
through this difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee and essentially leader of the prosecution, gave an 
introductory speech that marked the drama's turning from high 
ceremony to painstaking business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are now stewards of the oath,'' he said gravely. He  
invoked Sir Thomas More, who chose to die rather than swear to an 
oath that he could not live by. Senators, sworn to be impartial, 
paid rapt attention at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the particulars. The prosecution team got out the  
charts and the senators began to fidget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their demeanor was, 'Let's cut to the quick -- I've heard this  
all before,'' said Nora Owen, an Irish member of Parliament 
watching from the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' eyes closed and his  
head dropped several times. Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, 
battling a cold, leaned his head heavily on his hand, eyes also 
drifting shut.

<P>
	``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than  
hell to stay awake.'' But he praised the House team's presentation.

seemed to be paying attention for the most part. ``They looked like 
they were taking notes. They could have been writing grocery lists 
for all I know.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Jordan Good Wishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today offered his good  
wishes to the newly retired Michael Jordan, and urged Americans to 
``take a day or two to ooh and ahh'' as they remember the exploits 
of the greatest basketball player of his time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish Michael Jordan well,'' the president said during a  
ceremony at which he announced a plan to help disabled people find 
jobs. ``We admire him, we like him very much and we thank him for 
years of thrilling exploits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke while Jordan, 35, was announcing his  
retirement in a news conference at Chicago's United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised the Chicago Bulls star as a man of superior  
athletic prowess who ``had a body that would do things no one 
else's would do'' and willed himself to accomplish anything he 
decided to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my life, I don't know if I ever saw another athlete with  
such a remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit,'' 
Clinton said. ``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans 
around America take a day or two to ooh and ahh, and hold their 
breath again, and be glad again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president offered his salute to Jordan on behalf of himself  
and ``my wife from Chicago.'' First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was 
in her hometown today to dedicate a new epilepsy monitoring center 
at a hospital.

	House Presents Case Against Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first day of President Clinton's  
impeachment trial remained in session until after dark as a string 
of House Republicans laid out their evidence for the 100 senators 
acting as jurors. Later, Senate Republican leaders suggested 
Clinton might be invited to testify. The prosecutors charged that 
President Clinton ``piled perjury upon perjury'' and obstructed 
justice to conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. They 
buttressed their presentation with images of Clinton on videotape, 
many of them of his testimony before the grand jury. White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart sharply accused the House of making a 
case so partisan ``it isn't on the level.'' 

</P>
<P>
	It's Business As Usual for Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the opening of his impeachment trial,  
President Clinton moved ahead with a busy schedule today, tending 
to an anti-crime initiative, the budget and plans for the State of 
the Union address. He visited a Virginia police station this 
morning to announce a five-year, $6 billion proposal to put more 
police officers on the streets. He ate lunch with Vice President Al 
Gore, then worked on his speech and talked to his budget advisers. 
Tomorrow, Clinton is to be in New York to urge Wall Street firms to 
invest in neglected inner cities and rural areas.

	U.S. Offers Help for Iraqis  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States, countering a French  
proposal to lift the oil embargo on Iraq, outlined a proposal to 
let Baghdad sell unlimited amounts of oil -- but only if the 
proceeds go to buy humanitarian supplies. The plan would allow Iraq 
to borrow against a U.N. escrow fund to buy food and medicine and 
encourage humanitarian contributions to Iraq. Deputy U.S. 
Ambassador Peter Burleigh presented the proposal to the U.N. 
Security Council today.

	Gulf War Vets Face More Illness  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new study of British troops has found that  
Persian Gulf War veterans have a rate of general ill health at 
least twice as high as forces sent to Bosnia or those who stayed 
home. The study confirms what previously has been reported in 
studies of Canadian and U.S. veterans -- that going to the Persian 
Gulf in 1991 affected troops' health, but no definable disease 
could be found. The British troops reported a variety of 59 
ailments, including chronic fatigue, hair loss, rashes, headaches, 
joint pain, memory loss, heart problems and nervous system 
disorders.

	Sierra Leone's Rebels OK Cease-Fire  
</P>
<P>
	ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- After a month of furious attacks  
against Sierra Leone's cities and towns, the country's feared rebel 
alliance is prepared for a cease-fire, rebel and U.N. officials 
said. But it was unclear whether President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's 
democratically elected government -- or the Nigerian-led coalition 
force fighting in its defense -- support the proposal, U.N. special 
envoy Francis Okelo said. 

</P>
<P>
	Winter Chills Midwest, Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snow and freezing rain extending from the  
Midwest to Northeast closed schools, canceled flights and forced 
drivers to take it slow and steady. The Maine hamlet of Allagash 
plunged to the lowest temperature ever recorded in the state: 55 
below zero. The weight of 53 inches of snow brought down sections 
of barns, churches and other buildings in Buffalo. And in Detroit, 
people were told if they wanted their mail, they'd have to come out 
into the streets and get it. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Dive; Dow Ends Down 228.63  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today for the second day in a  
row. On Wall Street, the Dow industrials fell 228.63 to 9,120.93. 
On the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,166-901. The Nasdaq fell 39.92 to 
2,276.89. The Japanese financial markets are closed Friday for 
Coming of Age Day, a national holiday.

	A New Breed of Internet Surfers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll finds people going online today are  
less computer-savvy, less affluent and include more women than the 
band of early Internet devotees. Sending or receiving electronic 
mail is the most popular activity for the 41 percent of adults who 
now use the Internet, according to the survey by the Pew Research 
Center for the People and the Press. And weather is the type of 
news they seek most often. There are now 74 million Internet users 
in the United States.

	Nine IOC Members Face Expulsion  
</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Nine International Olympic  
Committee members face possible expulsion for ``serious'' offenses 
in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and four others must answer 
to lesser charges, the Olympics' top official said today. And IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch was less than categorical on 
whether the 2002 Winter Games would definitely stay in Salt Lake 
City, saying it was the IOC's ``hope'' and ``desire'' that they go 
ahead in Utah.

<HEADLINE> A New Breed of Internet Surfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People going online today to find news or  
pursue other interests look increasingly like America as a whole -- 
they're less computer-savvy, less affluent and include more women 
than the band of early Internet devotees, according to a poll 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That more mainstream audience is interested in more mainstream  
topics than those first drawn to the Internet, indicates the survey 
of American adults by the Pew Research Center for the People and 
the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending or receiving electronic mail is the most popular  
activity for the 41 percent of adults who now use the Internet. And 
weather -- that most common of topics -- is the type of news they 
seek most often. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, about 23 percent used the Internet, and news items  
related to technology were the top draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message here is that more (people) on the Internet does  
not necessarily mean more of the same,'' said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found women have overtaken men among newcomers. Of  
people who said they began using the Internet within the previous 
year, 52 percent were women and 48 percent men. That's close to the 
breakdown of the population as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle-aged and middle-income people of both sexes are also  
coming to the Internet in increased numbers, as are people with 
less than a college education. Among Internet newcomers, 40 percent 
never attended college, and 23 percent have household incomes below 
$30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are more middlebrow, they're less affluent,'' Kohut said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Internet was given life by eggheads -- researchers, academics  
and bureaucrats who are among the best-educated people in America. 
The most significant change, said Kohut, is the broadening of the 
network's use to people who never attended college. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very different demographic pattern, and it's a very  
different use pattern,'' Kohut said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that rapid move to the mainstream, the 74 million  
Internet users in the United States are still generally younger, 
better-educated and more affluent than the population at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 80 percent of Internet users are under age 50, compared  
with 63 percent of all Americans, and 39 percent of Internet users 
are college graduates, compared with 22 percent of the nation at 
large, the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide telephone survey of 3,184 adults, taken in  
November, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points for the public as a whole and for Internet users. For 
smaller subgroups, the margin of error was 3.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found 35 percent of American adults use e-mail, up  
from 19 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Internet news users, 64 percent said they looked for  
weather information online. In 1996, 47 percent sought out such 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, online news consumption is up dramatically. In 1995, 4  
percent of Americans went online for news at least once a week. The 
figure is now anywhere from 15 percent to 26 percent, based on 
recent Pew surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who seek news online cited three main reasons: to get  
information unavailable elsewhere, for convenience and because they 
can search for particular subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	More people getting more news online may mean fewer people  
getting their news from television, the survey found. On the other 
hand, heavy Internet users seem to read newspapers and listen to 
the radio as often as those who don't use the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Create Internet Watchdog Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading companies ranging from IBM to German  
publisher Bertelsmann have formed a global group to discourage 
governments from imposing Internet taxes and other measures that 
could hurt business over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, representing businesses in technology, media and  
finance, plans to present suggestions on policy to governments 
around the world as well as send a general message against 
government regulation of the exploding medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by 24 companies, the Global Business Dialogue on E-Commerce  
on Thursday said it would speak in coming weeks with European 
Community officials against a new European privacy measure that 
would make it tougher for companies to transmit personal data about 
their customers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some firms doing business in Europe fear the directive could bar  
them from using customers' confidential information for everything 
from financial transactions to junk mail, stifling business 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take action now,'' said Thomas Middelhoff, chairman  
and chief executive of Bertelsmann AG, the German publishing 
conglomerate whose U.S. headquarters in New York housed a press 
conference launching the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's formation follows the success of U.S. firms in  
lobbying the U.S. government on issues important to the high-tech 
industry, which this year won a temporary ban on Internet taxes and 
new copyright protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is ``now big enough to matter,'' said Steve Case,  
chairman of America Online Inc., the nation's largest online 
service and Internet access provider. ``It's still young enough and 
small enough to be shaped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While group leaders said they represented a broad cross-section  
of industry opinion, software titan Microsoft Corp., the largest 
Internet player, is not a member. They said Microsoft did not seek 
to join. A Microsoft spokesman was not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other executives announcing the initiative include IBM chairman  
Louis Gerstner, Time Warner Inc. chairman Gerald Levin and Netscape 
Communications Corp. chief executive James Barksdale. Also included 
are executives from Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and 
NEC, Finland's Nokia, France Telecom and British retailer Marks &AMP; 
Spencer.

<HEADLINE> Bill Cosby Buys Share in N.J. Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Bill Cosby is a comedian, actor,  
author and now part owner of an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby was approved to join the ownership group of the New Jersey  
Nets on Wednesday, attracted by the team's commitment to a trust 
that benefits inner-city youth, said team officials and his 
spokesman, David Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal owner Lewis Katz, a college friend of Cosby at Temple,  
asked Cosby to join the ownership group and support his vision to 
help revitalize Newark with an arena and to help inner-city youth, 
Brokaw said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Cosby has had a longstanding respect for the ideas and the  
vision that Lewis Katz has,'' Brokaw said. ``He is respectful of 
why Mr. Katz and Mr. (Ray) Chambers wanted to purchase the club ... 
how they wanted to make it responsive to the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby also bought two courtside seats for home games and stock  
in the Community Youth Organization, a trust to benefit urban area 
youth that is the largest shareholder in the New Jersey Nets with 
35 percent to 40 percent ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Any profits the trust makes either in a season or from the  
team's future sale will be dedicated to minority education, 
scholarship and mentoring in New Jersey cities, including Newark, 
Trenton, Paterson, Camden and Jersey City. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby will use his ``star quality and enormous energy to attract  
more people into the goals and mission'' of urban youth in inner 
cities, Nets president Michael Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership group headed by Katz and Chambers, a Newark  
philanthropist, bought the team last year and pledged to move it 
from the Meadowlands Complex in East Rutherford to an arena in 
downtown Newark or sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz wouldn't say how much Cosby paid for his share of the Nets,  
only saying it was millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes our team, knows Jayson Williams well and likes what  
this represents in terms of setting a good example,'' Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby's friendship with Williams may help the team negotiate a  
new contract with the All-Star free agent. Williams and the team 
were said to be millions of dollars apart on a proposed seven-year 
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Romo a Monster Only on Sundays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Critics despise Bill Romanowski for late hits, for  
incessant taunting and, in particular, for spitting in the face of 
San Francisco's J.J. Stokes and breaking the jaw of Carolina 
quarterback Kerry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents can't talk about him without using obscenities. And as  
if proof of his evil nature, Romanowski haters note that he is best 
friends with Claude Lemieux of the Colorado Avalanche, one of 
hockey's dirtiest players. 
</P>
<P>
	But to insist that the dark side is all there is to Romanowski  
is to miss the essence of one of the NFL's real Jekyll and Hyde 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also a devoted family man with a weakness for romantic  
dinners with his wife, Julie. He apologized profusely for the 
spitting incident and was most concerned how it would impact his 
wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	His Denver Broncos teammates, meanwhile, love him for his  
studious preparation, his physical conditioning and his maniacal 
play on Sunday. He's a leader in the locker room and a player that 
coach Mike Shanahan has the utmost respect for. 
</P>
<P>
	Said teammate Bubby Brister, ``Off the field, he's the best  
person you'd ever want to meet. He would do anything for his family 
and his friends. On the field, he's the best person you could ever 
have on your side. Nobody wants to play against him. That's a 
compliment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Broncos' 38-3 rout of Miami in an AFC divisional  
playoff game last week that propelled Denver into Sunday's AFC 
championship game, Dolphins receiver O.J. McDuffie said Romanowski 
``is a heck of a football player. Then McDuffie used an expletive 
to describe Romanowski's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins offensive guard John Bock said ``some of the things he  
did I didn't appreciate. You can look at the films and see the crap 
he does when the play is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's transformation begins on Sunday mornings, when the  
linebacker goes virtually into a trance about four hours before 
kickoff, mentally reviewing the game plan and pumping himself up to 
make every tackle on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go all out on every play, that's what I try to do,'' he said  
Thursday. ``I try to leave it on the field. Sometimes people call 
me dirty, but I just call it playing hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he like to play against himself? ``No, probably not,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said Romanowski is ``going  
to give all he has on every play, more than anybody I've ever seen 
in my life. I feel sorry for the players who have to play against 
us. He plays the game at a level that a lot of guys can't achieve. 
His intensity is way off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister has seen a slight change this season in Romanowski, who  
played six years in San Francisco and two in Philadelphia before 
signing with Denver in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this year he's cleaned it up a little bit on the  
field,'' Brister said. ``He's still playing aggressive, but he puts 
that other stuff behind him and he was rewarded by going to the Pro 
Bowl, so there's a lot of other players around the league that feel 
the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski, who also went to the Pro Bowl in 1996, has always  
been a winner, regardless of his reputation. He owns three Super 
Bowl rings, two from his days with the 49ers. After making six 
tackles and intercepting a pass against Miami, he has the Broncos 
one win away from getting a shot at a fourth ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some incidents when he did things he wasn't proud  
of,'' Shanahan said, ``but people who think Bill Romanowski is a 
bad guy don't know him. He prepares himself as well as anyone I've 
ever been around. He works out constantly in the offseason to give 
himself the best chance for success. That's part of the reason he 
hasn't missed a game in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner, he's a great competitor, he's a class act.''

<HEADLINE> Boat Racer Presumed Shot To Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A champion boat racer is missing and  
presumed slain, and a convicted kidnapper has been charged with air 
piracy in his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have searched mountain and desert areas near  
Albuquerque for Harry Christensen, 48, who was reported missing by 
his family Jan. 6. That night, Christensen's blood-spattered 1973 
Cessna 340 was found at a small airport near town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We unfortunately have to conclude that Harry Christensen was  
shot to death,'' FBI agent Doug Beldon said Thursday. ``We are 
looking for a body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have arrested Bobby Joe Keesee and charged him with  
stealing the plane -- air piracy -- and with taking it from the 
airport in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit said Keesee, 64, admitted being with  
Christensen when Christensen was shot twice in Lake Havasu City. 
Beldon said the charges against Keesee could be upgraded to reflect 
a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	When Keesee was arrested in Las Cruces on Jan. 7, he had  
Christensen's rings, Rolex watch and credit cards and had put his 
picture on Christensen's Arizona driver's license, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee was being held without bail. His attorney declined  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee has served time for posing as a federal official in two  
schemes to obtain airplanes, for attempting to bilk a company in a 
purchasing scam, for theft of a plane and for conspiracy in the 
death of a U.S. consul in Hermosillo, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Keesee was released from prison in August after a term for  
kidnapping and ransom, Beldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen is known in the boat-racing world and owns a  
high-end custom boat factory in Lake Havasu City. He won a major 
powerboat championship in 1997 in Biloxi, Miss.

<HEADLINE> Snow Shuts Schools in Several States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Out in his 1979 pickup to deliver meals to  
shut-ins, Jim Lahr discovered a way to navigate the city's snowy 
side streets: Drive backward. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place to turn around when you get to the end, and  
you get stuck,'' he explained after stopping at the house of an 
82-year-old woman. ``When you back in at least you're facing in the 
right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's just one way people in this snow-savvy city have learned to  
adapt to the relentless winter of the past two weeks. Elsewhere, 
the unrelenting weather continued to wreak havoc, as public schools 
were closed today in parts of the Midwest and Northeast and 
freezing rain caused treacherous morning driving conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo usually gets 93.2 inches of snow every year -- that's  
more than 7 feet -- but this winter season started off fairly dry. 
In this month alone, however, the city has recorded nearly 53 
inches, including 5 inches on Wednesday, a record for Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow resumed falling during the rush hour commute this  
morning, and up to 6 inches were predicted for today. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little hibernating going on. Aside from a driving ban  
that shut down the city Jan. 4 and a daily list of school closings 
and meeting cancellations, the city and its suburbs have, for the 
most part, remained open and functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of life,'' said Lahr's wife, Marcie, who runs the  
Meals on Wheels chapter for which her husband volunteers. ``Life 
does not stop when it snows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It does slow down, though. In Ohio, where up to 7 inches fell  
across the state Wednesday, the snow continued to fall overnight in 
the northern part of the state, while freezing rain hit central and 
southwestern counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow closed airports and highways, collapsed roofs, canceled  
classes and sent some workers home early. A coating of ice in 
Columbus forced Ohio State University to shut down Wednesday for 
the first time since 1978. Classes resumed this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, public schools were closed indefinitely today  
because some city streets were still not plowed. Bitter cold swept 
through the area Wednesday, freezing hoses as firefighters tried to 
battle an apartment complex blaze. At Detroit Metropolitan Airport 
this morning, the wind chill was as low as minus 37. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Postal Service said today that it was declaring a snow  
emergency and overhauling normal delivery procedures in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to beep horns going down streets and ask people to  
get their mail, let us park in their driveways,'' postal 
spokeswoman Diana Pritchard said. ``This is never-before stuff. 
This isn't in the regs book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon has asked the federal government for  
help in defraying the state's ballooning snow-removal costs. 
Freezing rain struck the state Wednesday, causing dozens of 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern New Hampshire, school officials weren't worried  
about buses sliding off icy roads because it was too cold to get 
them started at all this morning. Schools were closed in Colebrook, 
where was the temperature was 40 below zero, and Pittsburg, at

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Cigarette Tax Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to pay for an abundance of new  
programs, President Clinton plans to offer a new 55-cent-a-pack 
cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan recalls the president's budget a year ago when he  
counted on a massive fine on the tobacco industry to pay for his 
spending initiatives. Tobacco legislation never passed last year, 
although the president got some of his spending requests 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	The new tax plan, certain to be opposed by congressional  
Republicans, would raise $8 billion for the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1, an administration official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at 24 cents a pack, the federal cigarette tax already is set  
to jump to 39 cents in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also will insist that states turn  
over some of the money they will get from a giant settlement with 
tobacco companies, but not this year. Clinton's plan does not count 
on that money until 2001, meaning he does not need it for the 
fiscal 2000 budget he will submit to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Clinton has touted a number of new ideas but  
avoided discussing how he would pay for them. Still, he has 
promised his budget will be balanced without reaching into the 
budget surplus, which makes it almost impossible to pay for new 
spending without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, proposals have included more money for after-school  
programs, new defense spending, tax incentives for long-term care 
and money to help disabled people go to work. Plans announced 
Thursday were for money to fight crime and to aid people with 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have consistently warned Clinton  
against paying for his plans with increased taxes, including 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes has never been the answer to our nation's  
problems,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, wrote the president last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tobacco legislation fell apart under criticism that  
it was too hard on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The states responded by settling lawsuits with tobacco companies  
on their own. Cigarette makers agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion 
over 25 years, raising prices by 45 cents a pack. That contributed 
to a 30 percent jump in cigarette prices in December, the 
government reported. Four other states previously had settled their 
suits independently. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers and governors are already debating how to spend  
the money, but the federal government has long held that it has a 
right to much of it. Many state lawsuits had sought to recover 
money spent by Medicaid on sick smokers, and the federal government 
pays for at least half of Medicaid costs in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed a deal was possible. Administration  
officials indicated they might let states keep the money if they 
agreed to spend it on certain public health, anti-smoking programs. 
But now Clinton envisions using some of the money for the federal 
budget, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House still wants federal legislation that would  
impose new restrictions on the tobacco industry while giving the 
federal government a financial settlement of its own. But that 
requires congressional action, and the administration hopes states 
will press Congress for such legislation if their settlement money 
is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to create an environment and pressure for a  
bipartisan agreement on tobacco,'' an administration official 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The states are not pleased. They argue that some of the suits  
were based on consumer fraud claims, not Medicaid. They say the 
federal government should file its own lawsuit if it wants money. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire was told  
about the administration's plans and spread the word to other 
states Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position very emphatically is this money should go to the  
states,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. 
``We believe we have a moral and a political claim because we are 
the ones who brought the lawsuits.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Eyes Broncos Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Having apparently struck out with Gary  
Barnett and Joe Tiller and having a handful of other potential 
candidates withdraw from consideration, the University of Colorado 
is looking closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kubiak, the Denver Broncos offensive coordinator, emerged  
Thursday as Colorado's coach du jour as the school's search for a 
successor to Rick Neuheisel began to resemble a coaching carousel 
spinning out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Broncos haven't given permission for the  
university to talk to Kubiak, the Colorado assistant appeared to be 
the latest front-runner for the job Neuheisel vacated on Saturday 
to move to the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Other coaches whose names have surfaced as candidates for the  
job include Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, 
Louisiana State coach Gerry DiNardo, Texas Christian's Dennis 
Franchione, Oklahoma State's Bob Simmons, Air Force's Fisher 
DeBerry, Northern Colorado's Joe Glenn, Arvada West High School 
coach Dave Logan and five current Colorado assistants -- A.J. 
Christoff, Karl Dorrell, Jon Embree, Brian Cabral and Tom Cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the names we've gone through is amazing,'' Buffaloes  
offensive lineman Brad Bedell said. ``I'm waiting to see when Vince 
Lombardi's comes up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, word was that Barnett, who guided Northwestern to  
a Rose Bowl appearance in 1995, would sign with the Buffaloes 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barnett and Colorado officials couldn't reach agreement on  
financial terms, and suddenly Tiller, the former Wyoming coach who 
has led Purdue to a two-year record of 18-7, was the leading 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, Tiller said he was not a candidate at  
Colorado or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how these rumors get started,'' Tiller said.  
``There's nothing to this ... just like there was nothing to it 
last week about the Washington job. The contract extension Purdue 
has offered me puts to rest any rumors about our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett has nine years left on an 11-year, $5 million contract  
he signed with Northwestern in 1996. Last month, Tiller signed a 
two-year extension worth an estimated $450,000 annually through 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak's name surfaced on Thursday as the Broncos continued  
preparations for Sunday's AFC championship game against the New 
York Jets. SportsFan Radio Network reported that Kubiak will be 
Colorado's new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Dick (Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp)  
earlier in the week, and we are aware of the interest that the 
University of Colorado has in Gary Kubiak,'' Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan said Thursday. ``But there has been no contact between 
Gary and CU, and certainly no offers or agreements have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will grant permission for CU to talk with Gary after this  
Sunday's game, regardless of the outcome. Our entire focus at this 
time is on the New York Jets and in winning the AFC championships, 
and nothing else will occur until this game has been played. Right 
now, there's nothing going on, only speculation.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson-Botha Lacks Wallop With Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The last time Mike Tyson fought at the MGM  
Grand Hotel, a melee erupted in the ring after he bit Evander 
Holyfield and panicked gamblers forced the casino shut for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop the MGM from shelling out millions of dollars  
to sign Tyson again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, crowd control may not be the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales for Tyson's return to the ring have been mixed, and  
hotel officials concede the arena won't be filled Saturday night 
when he meets Francois Botha in a scheduled 10-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's hurry to get back into the ring as quickly as he could  
after getting his boxing license in October is one factor in the 
lukewarm reception the fight has gotten. Two straight losses to 
Holyfield also may have turned off some who may not see Tyson as 
the fighter he once was. 
</P>
<P>
	A bad date -- competing with two NFL playoff games -- didn't help,  
and the weekend also falls during a slow tourism period in this 
gambling city. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the final prefight news conference was seemingly jinxed,  
overshadowed by Michael Jordan's retirement announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, hotel officials are counting on the high rollers to be on  
hand, and the MGM contract includes three additional fights that 
could turn into much bigger events if Tyson can keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to have Mike Tyson back,'' said Alex  
Yemenidjian, president and chief operating officer of MGM Grand 
Inc. ``He adds more value to the sport than any of the other 
fighters put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel officials hope for a crowd of some 10,000, paying from  
$200 to $1,500 a seat at the MGM Grand's arena, which was scaled 
back a few thousand seats to 14,000 seats for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The big money will be generated by pay-per-view, though, with  
Showtime executive producer Jay Larkin predicting the fight could 
be bought by up to 1 million homes at a price of about $45 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty confident it will do well,'' Larkin said.  
``People are intrigued by Mike's personal story and they will watch 
him fight in the same way they watch car races, to see the 
wrecks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose purses in his six-fight comeback after being in  
prison totaled more than $100 million, will earn millions to fight 
Botha, although the exact amount is a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's managers had suggested he would make some $20 million,  
and Tyson himself said earlier this week that he would be making 
$35 million. But contracts to be filed with Nevada boxing officials 
are expected to show a base purse of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw big gamblers to his fights makes him a  
valued commodity, despite any misgivings the hotels may have about 
some of his antics. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM hasn't staged a bout since the Tyson-Holyfield debacle  
on June 28, 1997, but was quick to sign Tyson to a four-fight deal 
once the Nevada Athletic Commission reinstated his boxing license. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about redemption and about us getting back in a big  
way in the boxing business,'' hotel president Bill Hornbuckle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemenidjian said the fight is important for the hotel's image as  
a place of big events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really places the MGM Grand yet again as the venue where  
the best sporting events take place,'' Yemenidjian said. ``We look 
at the high rollers and the wide exposure we get. As you can 
imagine, interest is at an international level in Mike Tyson.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet Venezuelan Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has agreed to a  
get-acquainted session with Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez, 
who staged a bloody but unsuccessful coup six years before his 
election, a senior official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the administration has been encouraged by the  
moderate rhetoric Chavez has used since winning the Dec. 6 election 
as an anti-establishment, anti-corruption candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez gained fame in Venezuela in 1992 when, as a lieutenant  
colonel in the Army, he led the coup against a democratically 
elected president. He was imprisoned for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He raised eyebrows here in December 1994 when on a visit to Cuba  
he praised the island as a ``bastion of Latin American dignity'' 
and showered plaudits on President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his election, however, Chavez has been giving assurances  
that he is a committed democrat and has spoken of the need for 
fiscal discipline and national reconciliation. When Argentine 
President Carlos Menem met with Clinton this week, he urged Clinton 
to establish contact with Chavez, said the official, who asked not 
to be identified. Menem and a number of other presidents have met 
with Chavez since his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet briefly with Chavez, probably no longer than  
15 minutes, during the last week of January. In recent months, 
Clinton also has met with presidents-elect of Ecuador, Costa Rica 
and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who will be sworn in on Feb. 2, also will use his visit  
to meet with officials of the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank. He is expected to touch base as well with leading 
financial institutions in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Chavez's election, Clinton sent a letter  
congratulating him and expressing confidence that Chavez ``will 
address the challenges facing his administration in a democratic 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics of Chavez see him as a potential authoritarian  
strongman, and he took aim at them Tuesday during a visit to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of talking about important issues, they are starting a  
dirty war in which I am being compared to Mussolini, Hitler or even 
the devil. But I am a social fighter and a democrat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on his 1992 revolt, Chavez was placed in a U.S.  
immigration service lookout list of people who should be barred 
from entering the United States. Weeks after his election, Chavez's 
name was removed from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his electoral triumph, Chavez had a long breakfast  
meeting in Caracas with U.S. ambassador John Maisto, who brought up 
Chavez's 1994 visit to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source familiar with the conversation, Chavez  
dismissed his remarks at the time as those of a young rebellious 
soldier and should not be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials will be weighing Chavez's words Saturday when  
he makes a return visit to Cuba. The main topic will be how to end 
the long-running civil war in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chavez turned up in Cuba four years ago, Castro seemed to  
see him as a potential ally, warmly greeting the visitor at the 
airport. ``I don't deserve this honor,'' Chavez said. ``I hope to 
deserve it in the months and years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time we have come to Cuba physically,'' he  
said, ``but in our dreams we have come an infinity of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting at the time on being barred from the United States,  
he said, ``They honor us as rebel soldiers in not allowing us to 
enter North American (U.S.) territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And ``we swear to dedicate our lives to the construction of a  
revolutionary movement and the revolutionary struggle in 
Venezuela.''

<HEADLINE> Powell Comfortable With Opting Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell says he's  
comfortable with his decision to remain in private life and likely 
will stay away from politics in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
	``My place in life is in private life, serving the nation in  
private life and doing something I think is quite important,'' he 
said Thursday while in town to talk to business leaders and tour a 
youth club. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell referred to Michael Jordan's announcement Wednesday that  
he was retiring from basketball. Jordan said he was ``99.9 
percent'' sure he wouldn't play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found Michael a little wishy-washy,'' Powell said. ``He said  
99.9 percent. I'm more sure than that. I have been comfortable with 
it from the day I made it, 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who played a  
prominent role in the Gulf War, Powell is viewed as a serious 
presidential contender. A black moderate, he is considered by some 
as the sort of candidate Republicans should field if they want to 
win back the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last presidential election, Powell was mentioned as a  
potential GOP contender but he opted against running. He said last 
year he wouldn't run in the next election either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be entering political life,'' Powell  
reiterated Thursday. ``I am not seeking any political office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would probably would not get involved in other  
candidate's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule that out, but right now I don't expect to be  
taking an active role in politics,'' he said. ``It just generates 
too much speculation about my own place in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring from the Army and moving away from politics,  
Powell has been active with a volunteer group seeking to improve 
programs for young people.

<HEADLINE> CBS Premieres `60 Minutes II' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The watch ticks on Wednesday, too. Long may it  
tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years after ``60 Minutes'' signed on, CBS on Wednesday  
night debuted its much-anticipated spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' clearly aims to be a clone of the original,  
legendary CBS News magazine. Based on opening night, it's poised to 
pull that off. 
</P>
<P>
	With executive producer Jeff Fager at the helm, the new show  
felt instantly familiar and mostly satisfying. It even had a bona 
fide ``Hey, Mildred!'' story -- that's ``60 Minutes'' creator Don 
Hewitt's term for a piece so interesting you call your spouse in to 
watch it with you -- by visiting Krasnoyarsk-26, a secret Siberian 
city where plutonium is made for nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, good as it was, the segment was oversold as something of a  
scoop. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter George Crile was described by Dan Rather as ``the first  
American journalist to enter Krasnoyarsk-26 with a television 
crew.'' But this morning a representative of rival ``Dateline NBC'' 
distributed a tape showing the ``Dateline'' had covered much of the 
same ground in a piece that aired in December 1994, with 
correspondent Fred Francis reporting from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Francis didn't gain access to the nuclear plant buried  
deep inside a mountain, as Crile did, ``Dateline's'' report 
included similar footage obtained from ``an expatriate Russian 
filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an important story of nuclear proliferation that we  
advanced,'' CBS spokeswoman Kerri Weitzberg said today. ``It was a 
rock-solid piece, and if the reaction by critics and viewers means 
anything, they seem to agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' was born of economic, not journalistic,  
necessity. CBS needs a hit and the bosses figured another 
newsmagazine with the ``60 Minutes'' label has a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiercely protective of the original's heritage and Top 10  
status, Hewitt and fellow ``60 Minutes'' stalwarts were initially 
against any such brand extension. But they were won over. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the familiar ``tick, tick, tick'' that begins at 9 p.m. EST  
Wednesday hopes to win over enough viewers from ABC's ``Drew 
Carey'' and even Fox's ``Party of Five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary Nielsen ratings declared victory: In 40 metered  
cities, the broadcast was the night's most-watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the ticking stopwatch, the popular Sunday components  
were there. The magazine cover (here revealing a Roman numeral II 
as the corner of the page dog-ears). A correspondent introducing 
each story, laid out as a magazine spread for the background. And 
most important, three stories told grippingly and with no nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Mike Wallace was on hand for the debut, updating a story he  
did 17 years ago on Vietnam children fathered by American 
servicemen and left behind after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	This ```60 Minutes' Classic'' (to be a regular feature) was the  
hour's only disappointment. The reprised report dragged in its 
retelling, and the update, although heartwarming, was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has promise, however -- a little nourishment from the  
other show's archives and stars can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two pieces came from the new show's own team, which  
includes correspondents Rather, Charlie Rose, Bob Simon and Vicki 
Mabrey, as well as contributor Carol Marin. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time for the Senate's impeachment trial of President  
Clinton, Marin profiled David Schippers in ``Leading the Charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marin showed how Schippers -- a Democrat who is the chief  
investigator for the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee -- has 
played a major role in the drive to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final ``tick, tick, tick,'' the show's surrogate Andy  
Rooney, humorist Jimmy Tingle, offered the first installment of his 
``Uncommon Sense.'' He reflected on the peculiar happenings of 
1998, among them that ``Newt Gingrich resigned, practicing what he 
preached: term limits.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Satisfied With IOC Briefing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An International Olympic Committee official  
briefed executives of Atlanta-based corporate sponsors about the 
investigation of the Salt Lake City corruption allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC's top marketing officer, made the rounds  
of three companies the last two days. He began with a dinner 
meeting Tuesday night with Coca-Cola Co. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that they are going to do what they said they  
would do -- take swift and decisive action,'' Coke spokesman Ben 
Deutsch said Wednesday after what he called a very productive 
meeting between company executives and IOC marketing director 
Michael Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne answered questions and briefed Coke, a major Olympic  
sponsor since 1928, about the IOC's response to allegations of 
bribery in the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games, Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne also met Wednesday with officials of two other sponsors,  
United Parcel Service and The Home Depot, at their Atlanta 
corporate headquarters. He launched a series of meetings this week 
to reassure sponsors worried about the scandal's impact on the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said the company ``felt really  
comfortable'' after the meeting about its sponsorship of the 2000 
Summer Games in Sydney. UPS plans to decide later this year whether 
to extend Olympic sponsorship past then. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Payne described a tenacious and complex IOC  
investigation that will result in action against individuals 
involved and also recommendations for future safeguards in the 
awarding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Atlanta-based sponsor, Delta Air Lines, didn't have a  
session with Payne, but said it is following developments. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will release a report on the allegations  
Jan. 24. The U.S. and Salt Lake City Olympic committees are also 
investigating, as is the U.S. Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Changes in Federal Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore recommended Thursday a  
global coalition to reform governments so they serve people better. 
For the United States, he proposed a plan to pay federal managers 
according to performance rather than seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need governments that are as flexible, as dynamic, as  
focused on serving their customers as the best private companies 
around the world,'' Gore told delegates from almost 40 countries at 
a global conference on ``reinventing government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He announced three U.S. initiatives: to reform civil service pay  
for government managers, to funnel more federal dollars to helping 
children and to conduct the first governmentwide ``customer 
satisfaction survey'' for federal services. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil service reform, which would require approval of  
Congress, would ``significantly change the way many federal workers 
are hired, rewarded and paid,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want our government to be accountable for every  
taxpayer's dime, then we need a work force that will be held 
accountable for real results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's program to overhaul the nation's civil  
service code would permit flexible pay and bonus systems in 
government agencies, allow them to evaluate their managers and 
provide them with more flexible policies on hiring, a summary 
released by Gore's office said. It said the proposal is in response 
to federal employees' complaints about poor managers and the need 
to improve labor-management relations in the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of providing automatic pay increases based on seniority,  
federal managers would ``have a significant portion of their pay 
determined by how well they do their jobs and meet the people's 
needs,'' Gore said. He said it would cost no more than the current 
salary system. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to spend more federal funds on children would involve  
setting up pilot programs for 10 state or city governments, Gore 
said. He did not name local governments that might be involved but 
said the program would give them more flexibility in spending 
federal money as long as the funds go to help children. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this fast-moving, fast-changing global economy, when the  
free flow of dollars and data sustains economic and political 
strength, and whole industries are born every day, governments must 
be lean, nimble and creative or they will surely be left behind,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised reform successes in New Zealand, Australia, Hungary,  
Poland and Britain. ``We have a lot to learn from one another,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Canada's Treasury Board, Marcel Masse, said in an  
interview that the Canadian approach to government reform has put 
less emphasis on making government operate like private companies 
and more on defining government's role in helping people. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the conference, Enrique V. Iglesias, president of the  
Inter-American Development Bank, announced plans to boost the 
multinational bank's lending for state reform programs to $6 
billion over the next few years. The bank handed out $5 billion 
over the last four years in loans to reorganize, streamline or 
decentralize government agencies in Latin American countries, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> How Networks Dealt With Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Big Three networks carried President  
Clinton's Senate impeachment trial Thursday afternoon -- at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Before long, most of their affiliates had resumed usual  
programming, leaving coverage to public TV and specialized cable 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to providing viewers with an overview of  
what's happening,'' said ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``We are 
continuing to monitor the trial, and if news warrants, we'll break 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like CBS and NBC, Murphy's network made an ongoing feed of the  
trial available to its stations but gave them the option to break 
away at about 2:30 p.m. EST. By then, viewers had heard opening 
remarks from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee, and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, broadcast network PBS and cable's CNN, Fox News  
Channel and MSNBC, as well as Court TV and C-SPAN II, carried the 
day's testimony in its entirety. All planned to continue 
gavel-to-gavel coverage Friday, when the Big Three resume their 
selective coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Visually, Thursday's proceedings were mostly no-frills:  
representatives speaking in turn from the well of the Senate 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, D-Tenn., played a videotape that showed the  
president taking his oath of office on the steps of the Capitol. 
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., showed clips of Clinton's Aug. 17 grand 
jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Most visual aids, however, were white-text-on-blue-background  
charts. And CNN senior analyst Jeff Greenfield observed that among 
the speeches, stemwinders were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people viewing at home might say, `This is pretty  
cut-and-dried stuff,''' Greenfield remarked during a mid-afternoon 
recess. ``Brilliant rhetoric just doesn't really work when you're 
addressing 100 sophisticated men and women who are waiting to hear 
the facts of the case.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone's Rebels OK Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- After a month of furious attacks  
against Sierra Leone's cities and towns, the country's feared rebel 
alliance is prepared for a cease-fire, rebel and U.N. officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear whether President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's  
democratically-elected government -- or the Nigerian-led coalition 
force fighting in its defense -- support the proposal, U.N. special 
envoy Francis Okelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Okelo said the Nigerian-led force had apparently taken control  
of Freetown after several days of fierce fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Coker, an aide to rebel commander Gen. Sam Bockarie,  
declined to give details of the cease-fire plan. He spoke by 
telephone from an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Kabbah's government could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But already there was confusion over when the break in the  
fighting would begin and how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	Coker said the cease-fire was set to begin at 6:00 p.m. local  
time (1 p.m. EST) on Saturday. But Okelo said Bockarie told him 
that his troops planned to end hostilities on Monday -- and then 
only for a seven-day period to allow civilians to get out of harm's 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Okelo, rebel leaders are demanding to speak with  
their imprisoned founder, Foday Sankoh, this weekend and insisting 
on his release next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This message has been conveyed to President Kabbah and there  
will be further consultations before we know if it is a genuine 
development,'' Okelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier cease-fire proposal collapsed last week after rebel  
field commanders rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh, who remains the rebel Revolutionary United Front's  
inspirational leader although he has no daily contact with them, 
has been imprisoned in a secret location since he was convicted of 
treason and mass murder in October. 
</P>
<P>
	If both sides lay down their arms, it would end a round of  
fighting that began in mid-December, when the rebels launched a 
series of attacks around the country, shooting their way into the 
capital, Freetown, earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The upsurge of fighting has uprooted hundreds of thousands of  
people and inflicted an unknown number of casualties. Raging fires 
and artillery explosions have destroyed large areas of Freetown's 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic news agency MISNA  
said the rebels told church officials they would release Freetown's 
kidnapped archbishop, Monsignor Joseph Henry Ganda, in exchange for 
a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganda was seized earlier this week and held along with an  
Italian priest, the Rev. Mario Guerra, who was abducted in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his freedom, Sankoh has demanded official recognition of  
the rebels, who have been accused by aid officials and locals of 
mass atrocities against unarmed villagers.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Markets Bigger Business Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Sick of that interminable airline jingle  
while you wait on hold for a reservation? Tired of standing in line 
with your boarding pass, or getting cross looks when you try to 
cram your carry-on into the overhead compartment? 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has just the plane for you: the Boeing Business Jet, a  
derivative of its popular 737 commercial airliner. The Seattle 
company is marketing them to anyone willing to pay $35 million -- 
and that does not include a paint job or the interior. 
</P>
<P>
	You can easily drop another $10 million adding queen-sized beds  
and a private office. But if you are smart about it, you can fly 
away for not much more than you would pay for other corporate 
planes. The big difference? The amount of room. 
</P>
<P>
	With 807 square feet of floor space, the size of the passenger  
compartment is more than twice that found in competing planes. 
Indeed, it is bigger than the average studio apartment in 
Manhattan, which runs a cozy 600 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that space to fill, buyers are running the gamut with  
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are all business, picking lots of seats -- first-class size,  
of course -- and a conference room. Others are indulging themselves, 
partitioning the cabin into a living room, dining room, library and 
master bedroom suite. 
</P>
<P>
	A few have installed galleys with dishwashers. Middle East  
customers are showing an inclination toward ovens for their roast 
lamb. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Boeing has sold 46 -- including two for General  
Electric's globetrotters. It has also sold nine to Net Jets, a 
fractional ownership program that lets the wealthy use planes part 
time, like vacation timeshares. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman, the professional golfer, put in an order, but he  
backed out late last year when the Asian economic crisis crimped 
his plans to crisscross the Pacific Rim building golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	While private jets have long been the domain of heads of states,  
celebrities and the Fortune 500 crowd, the BBJ is in some ways more 
comprehensible to the average flier. The 737 is the world's most 
widely used passenger jet. All 280 jets in the Southwest Airlines 
fleet, for example, are 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	Step inside a mockup at Teterboro Airport, though, and it is  
clear the BBJ is not the typical 737 that 150 people pile into for 
a commercial flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We provide space, space that affords the chief executive to do  
more than just travel from A to B,'' BBJ President Borge Boeskov 
says in a promotional video. ``He's able to have a meeting in this 
airplane, he's able to sleep in this airplane and he's able to eat 
a proper meal in this airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Bolen, president of the General Aviation Manufacturers  
Association, said the jet is especially attractive to global 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	It allows companies ``to go into some parts of the world and  
stay on the aircraft,'' Bolen said. ``They can basically make that 
their office, hotel room and boardroom in a country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Boeing has found success, competitors such as Gulfstream  
consider the BBJ more of a niche player than a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BBJ is a larger aircraft, a slower hybrid aircraft which  
flies at lower altitudes,'' said company spokesman Keith Mordoff. 
``Undoubtedly there are some customers who would want a very large 
cabin despite the many tradeoffs and they will purchase a BBJ, but 
these customers are not typically Gulfstream customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head-to-head, the BBJ consumes up to 50 percent more fuel than  
Gulfstream's new G-V. It also takes about 20 minutes longer to fly 
from New York to London, and the purchase price can be a few 
million dollars more, depending on the amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing says it closes the gap by offering more durable  
equipment, cheaper replacement parts and access to bulk fuel 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The BBJ is being marketed by Boeing and GE. While Boeing  
recently announced up to 48,000 layoffs because of the Asian 
financial crisis, the BBJ is a company blessing. It brings a new 
kind of customer to an existing production line. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales also help GE, because the plane is powered with engines  
made by the company and its French partner, Snecma. The idea has 
prompted Boeing's European counterpart, Airbus Industries, to offer 
its A319 model to corporate titans. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two Boeing Business Jets were delivered to customers  
just before Thanksgiving, with 44 more on order. They are plucked 
from the 737 assembly line at a rate of two per month, so new 
customers will have to wait two years. 
</P>
<P>
	They had better be ready with their checkbooks. Under Boeing's  
standard terms, buyers have to hand over their first $2 million 
when they place their orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a Peanuts Fare with  
this airplane.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Appeals Judge's Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. appealed a federal judge's  
ruling that ordered the software giant to rewrite parts of its 
Windows 98 operating system, calling it overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte ordered Microsoft in November  
to change Internet Explorer 4.0 and other software incorporating 
the Java programming language -- including Windows 98 -- or stop 
shipping the products within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by Palo Alto-based  
Sun Microsystems Inc., which claimed Microsoft designed a 
Windows-only form of Java that is incompatible with rival software. 
Sun has tried to promote its form of Java as a universal 
programming language that can be used with any software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft filed papers Wednesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals, accusing Whyte of wrongly ruling that compatibility 
requirements Sun had imposed on Microsoft's Java limited how 
Microsoft could distribute Sun's technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte ``abandoned (his) role by ignoring the plain language of  
the agreement,'' Microsoft's lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company also said Whyte's order was so  
broad that it restrains Microsoft from distributing other 
unspecified products that make no use of Sun's copyright material. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun is effectively given control over future Microsoft  
products in which it has no intellectual property rights,'' 
Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun said Whyte had ruled correctly.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to maximize compatibility and minimize switching  
costs is a central value of the Java platform -- millions of 
developers and users rely on that value,'' Sun said in a statement 
Thursday. ``They would be best served if Microsoft would come back 
into compliance with the Java specifications.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Launch Foreign Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Experimental satellites from South Africa and  
Denmark are ready to be launched into space this week by an Air 
Force Delta II rocket, a critical milestone for the space programs 
of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Liftoff is scheduled for 2:39 a.m. Friday from Vandenberg Air  
Force Base, about 120 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a spectacular celebration of South Africa's return  
to the international science and engineering community,'' said 
Garth Milne, South Africa's project leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a giant step for Danish space research,'' added Jens  
Langeland-Knudsen of the Danish project. 
</P>
<P>
	The South African satellite, Sunsat, was designed and built at  
the University of Stellenbosch, near Cape Town. It carries 
remote-sensing experiments and its goal is to produce images from 
space at lower costs than larger systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has caught the nation's imagination and driven its  
dreams to become a world player in electronics, Milne said. An 
educational spin-off of the project involved 40,000 schoolchildren 
assembling electronic kits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our aim is to grow the capability of engineers entering  
industry,'' said Milne, who is also a professor of engineering at 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danish satellite, Orsted, will study Earth's magnetic fields  
and electrical properties. The information is expected to help 
scientists understand more about the interaction between the Earth 
and the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket will also carry its primary payload.  
</P>
<P>
	Argos, the Air Force's largest research satellite, has more than  
30 research objectives. They involve sensor technology for possible 
use in the international space station, superconductivity and 
measuring dust and debris in crowded space orbits.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Ends First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a jury of 100 silent senators, House  
prosecutors on Thursday demanded President Clinton's removal from 
office, charging he had ``piled perjury upon perjury'' and 
obstructed justice. Senate Republican leaders suggested Clinton 
might be invited to testify at his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should be invited, or at least I don't have a  
problem with him being invited,'' GOP Whip Don Nickles told 
reporters at the conclusion of the historic, six-hour trial 
session. Majority Leader Trent Lott also had expressed at least 
passing interest in the idea, Republican sources said. Lott's 
office declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Senate chamber, where monumental issues of war and  
peace have been thrashed out for over a century, the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years trial unfolded in an 
atmosphere of uncommon gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to bring President Clinton to account ... will cause a  
cancer to be present in our society for generations,'' asserted 
Wisconsin Republican James Sensenbrenner, standing in the well of 
the chamber to address the senators and a nationwide television 
audience counted in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 42nd president was in the White House, preparing  
for next Tuesday's State of the Union address, when Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist rapped the gavel and announced that the Senate 
would ``convene as a court of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeant-at-Arms James Ziglar admonished all to remain silent  
``on pain of imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silent they were, the senators at their seats; those spectators  
lucky -- or influential -- enough to have space in the galleries 
above; the president's lawyers and House prosecutors seated around 
separate custom-made curved tables at the base of the rostrum and 
Rehnquist, presiding in his judicial robe. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of two brief breaks, the trial remained in  
session until after dark as a string of House Republicans laid out 
their evidence. They buttressed their presentation with numerous 
images of Clinton on videotape, many of them of his testimony 
before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is,''  
Clinton was seen to say in one snippet, a now-famous utterance that 
his critics have seized on as evidence of legal hairsplitting -- or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors repeatedly used the word ``conspiracy'' to  
describe Clinton's efforts to thwart court proceedings against him, 
making the argument that senators should hear from witnesses, 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Oval Office 
Secretary Betty Currie among them. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman James Kennedy attacked the Republican case  
even as it continued. It is ``both unsubstantial and 
circumstantial,'' he said. ``We look forward to presenting our 
defense based on the facts, the law and the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators sat attentively at their desks throughout the day, but  
there was no indication that any of the evidence had shaken the 
support Clinton has among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I don't think there was anything new from any of the  
House'' speakers, said one, Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner's Midwestern monotone belied the gravity of the  
moment. The Founding Fathers wrote impeachment into the 
Constitution as a way of reining in a corrupt chief executive, but 
their script has been played out this far only once before -- in the 
case of Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted by a single vote in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day wore on, prosecutors moved methodically through the  
minutiae of the case. Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, for example, 
led senators through a series of timelines that cross-referenced 
telephone calls by the president with actions taken by other 
principals in the case, evidence, he said, of a frantic effort on 
the chief executive's part to keep his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest by the television networks dwindled.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice for  
attempting to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, the former 
White House intern. He has admitted to an improper relationship, 
but he and his lawyers maintain that the charges, even if proven, 
do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	His trial is expected to last at least two more weeks -- far  
longer if the Senate agrees to the House's demand to call witnesses 
and if the White House's follow-up request for a long delay to 
prepare is also approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. James Rogan of California., speaking with  
reporters after the session, said that under the Senate's rules 
``the president cannot be compelled to testify.'' But he added, 
``We certainly favor the Senate inviting the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles made his comments as he left the Capitol at day's end.  
But the Republican sources, commenting only on condition of 
anonymity, said the idea had been broached to Lott before the trial 
session convened for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, point man for the House impeachment team, had  
suggested to reporters on Wednesday he might want Clinton to 
testify, but the White House has repeatedly said it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, went first for  
the prosecutors. ``We are here, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished 
senators, as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice under 
the law and for the sanctity of the oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and others put Clinton's oath of office -- and his alleged  
violation of it -- at the heart of the case against him. Senators 
were twice shown videotaped snippets of Clinton raising his hand 
and swearing an oath: first on Inauguration Day in 1993 and then 
when he testified in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his presentation, Sensenbrenner laid out the familiar  
allegations: that Clinton had lied before Starr's grand jury, had 
lied in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and had taken a 
variety of actions to obstruct Starr's investigation. According to 
the accusations, these included coaching his secretary, Betty 
Currie, to give false testimony, to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in 
New York, and to encourage her to give false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show that the president piled perjury upon  
perjury,'' Sensenbrenner said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking a pillar of the White House defense argument,  
Sensenbrenner argued that perjury is an impeachable offense. He 
cited the case of judicial impeachments in the Senate, one as 
recently as 1989. ``The truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. 
There cannot be different levels of truth for judges than for 
presidents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defense lawyers -- including private attorney  
David E. Kendall as well as Charles Ruff and Bruce Lindsey of the 
White House counsel's office -- listened attentively, some of them 
writing notes. Their turn to argue before the court of impeachment 
will come next week, coincidentally on the day of the State of the 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, senators sat quietly at their seats, adhering  
carefully to the suggested rules of decorum. Some leafed through 
notebooks containing impeachment material, others simply sat at 
gleaming, clean desks listening intently. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mere presence as silent participants was remarkable.  
Customarily, only a few senators are on the floor at a time, and 
when they all converge to vote, the chamber is filled with dozens 
of conversations proceeding simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Rehnquist made one personal announcement. He  
wanted all parties to know he would ``stand on occasion to stretch 
my back,'' and didn't intend for the proceedings to be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Chaplain Lloyd J. Ogilvie offered a prayer, asking for a  
``special measure of wisdom for the men and women'' who hold 
Clinton's fate in their hands. Then he, too, took a seat along the 
rear of the chamber and sat back to watch history. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner appealed to senators not to shrink from a task  
made tougher by the ``public opinion polls, the popularity and 
unpopularity of individuals, even questions over the strength of 
our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to the political subtext to the entire  
impeachment proceedings, in which Clinton has been buoyed by high 
poll ratings, even in the wake of embarrassing disclosures about 
his personal life.

<HEADLINE> Johnson To Stay With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson changed his mind about quitting  
today and will remain coach of the Miami Dolphins, his father told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	C.W. Johnson said his son telephoned him today to inform him of  
his new plans. A source close to Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga also 
confirmed that Johnson was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga rushed back from a baseball meeting in California and  
apparently persuaded Johnson to stay in a meeting early today, 
hours after the news surfaced that the coach planned to resign at 
the end of his third season with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a big get-together this morning,'' the source said,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Players were putting some 
pressure on him as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference to explain the stunning series of events was  
scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	C.W. Johnson also told the AP that Dave Wannstedt would be  
joining the Dolphins as assistant head coach. Wannstedt, a former 
Johnson assistant, was fired as the Chicago Bears' head coach two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes me happy,'' the father quoted his son as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy has to do what he wants to do,'' C.W. Johnson said by  
phone from his home in Port Arthur, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN and Miami radio station WQAM also reported today that  
Johnson was staying. Fox Sports News reported that Huizenga and 
quarterback Dan Marino talked Johnson out of taking a job with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's retirement plans surfaced late Wednesday and were  
confirmed by his father. That surprising news came less than a week 
after the Dolphins were eliminated from the NFL playoffs with a 
38-3 loss in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy told me he was ready to retire and wanted to start  
enjoying himself,'' C.W. Johnson said Wednesday. ``He said the 
season wore on him. I told him I was glad and that was the best 
news I had heard in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Johnson is under contract through 2000 after  
signing a one-year extension in April. Saturday's loss was the most 
lopsided postseason defeat in Dolphins' history, but Johnson talked 
optimistically after the game about next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Johnson's mother, Allene, on Dec. 20 and his  
father's battle with cancer may have been factors in his wavering 
about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also complained frequently in the past season about  
officiating, media criticism and the attitudes of modern players. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Miami Hurricanes to the 1987 national  
championship and led the Dallas Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl 
titles in 1992-93. He was hired by the Dolphins in January 1996 and 
said he would have the team in the NFL title game in three years, 
but he has won only one playoff game with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins fans reacted badly to reports that Johnson was leaving.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're shocked, disappointed and mad,'' said WQAM talk-show  
host Joe Rose, a former Dolphins player. ``They feel he didn't 
finish what he started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has made steady progress since Johnson replaced Don Shula.  
The Dolphins went 8-8 in his first season, 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached the playoffs in 1997 and earned their first playoff  
victory in four years this season, beating the Buffalo Bills 24-17. 
Johnson's competitive zeal seemed as intense as ever after that 
game, when he celebrated by crushing a box of Flutie Flakes in the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said recently that he believes Miami needs only a couple  
of offensive playmakers to join the NFL's elite. Following the 
Denver debacle, he said he didn't consider the loss devastating, 
but said Miami simply must earn a higher seed in next season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson simplified the team playbook this season to put more  
emphasis on the run and less pressure on the 37-year-old Marino, 
but the offense frequently sputtered. The defense, however, allowed 
the fewest points in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries and playing at Denver were too  
much for the Dolphins to overcome. Johnson was uncharacteristically 
pessimistic before the game, saying the Dolphins faced almost 
insurmountable odds to win the Super Bowl.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Teen-age rocker Jonny Lang is rolling along  
with the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang will replace Green Day as the Stones' opening act in  
Minneapolis on Feb. 15, one of Lang's managers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert comes two days before Lang opens for the Rolling  
Stones in his hometown of Fargo, N.D. Lang, who has opened for the 
Stones previously, also is scheduled to open for the Stones for two 
weeks in April.

<P>
	``He loves it. He loves the guys,'' said Lang's co-manager,  
James Klein. ``They're like old buddies, already.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Fate of the President Is Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The conventional wisdom holds that everyone  
knows how the impeachment trial against President Clinton will wind 
up: short of the 67 votes needed to convict him and throw him out 
of office. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a year of unexpected twists and turns, the  
prognosticators have been dead wrong about this case more often 
than right. And there is plenty of uncertainty ahead as the Senate 
wrestles over thorny questions such as whether to call witnesses, 
dismiss the case, vote on articles of impeachment or censure the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The only certainty is that the math of the Senate favors  
Clinton. There are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats. If all the 
Republicans stand united, 12 Democrats would have to desert the 
president to force his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Republican prosecutors opened their arguments Thursday,  
the spirit of Senate bipartisanship that marked the beginning of 
the trial began to fade, foreshadowing divisions that are certain 
to emerge in a historic clash of political interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complained that a team of Republican senators selected  
by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had consulted with the 
House impeachment prosecutors on criteria for calling trial 
witnesses -- before the Senate had decided whether to call any 
witnesses at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., told senators they need to call  
witnesses such as Clinton pal Vernon Jordan to ``look into his 
eyes'' and listen to the tone of his voice as he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP prosecutors also opened themselves to charges of  
overreaching by contacting Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey to 
discuss possible testimony about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (the bipartisanship) is being broken apart,'' said  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Even some GOP senators were 
uncomfortable about the contacts, but grumbled that Democrats also 
were wrong to be talking with White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hushed Senate chamber, the opening day of prosecution  
arguments lacked any drama or hint of new evidence. It was easy to 
imagine television viewers changing the channel as Rep. F. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., began explaining the GOP case by reading 
unemotionally from a script, his droning voice belying the gravity 
of his words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the walls of the Capitol and throughout this great  
country, there rages an impassioned and divisive debate over the 
future of this presidency,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``The Senate now 
finds itself in the midst of the tempest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many people, it is stunning the case has come this far, to  
the first Senate impeachment trail against a president in 131 
years. After all, public opinion has remained solidly in Clinton's 
corner despite a year of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was widely believed, wrongly, that the dismissal of Paula  
Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton early last year would 
slow the momentum of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Later, it 
was thought that Starr, frequently accused of overplaying his hand, 
had finally gone too far when he sent Congress an X-rated account 
of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it was believed the impeachment drive would shrivel up  
after Republicans suffered unexpected election losses. Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, of course, fueled Republican fury with his  
finger-wagging denial, his angry televised speech after his grand 
jury testimony and his legalistic answers to 81 questions posed by 
the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It all added up to a year that confounded expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even the most shameless of Beltway talking heads, the Sam  
Donaldsons that have been so completely wrong on this from the 
beginning, are tentative now,'' said Norm Ornstein, a political 
analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ``They have been 
shamed into tentativeness. We don't know where everything is going 
to go here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to make a compelling case for calling witnesses  
to keep their case alive and perhaps turn up evidence that would 
finally turn Americans against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there also is a risk that prolonging the trial will  
reinforce the view that Republicans simply want to get Clinton at 
any cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major tests begin Jan. 25 when the Senate begins  
considering motions to dismiss the case or subpoena witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question then becomes is there anything ... that can get  
12 or more Democrats to join all the Republicans to vote to remove 
Bill Clinton from office,'' said Ornstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer is -- not unless there is some blockbuster  
revelation or unless this drags on so long, and threatens to drag 
on even longer, that Americans say the only way we can get this out 
of the way is to get rid of the guy,'' Ornstein said. ``The odds of 
either of those things happening are small.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Adds $10 Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has added a $10 surcharge,  
effective Friday, for passengers who want a paper ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharge only covers those paper tickets bought directly  
from Alaska Airlines or its regional affiliate Horizon Air, 
spokesman Jack Evans said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluded are those tickets purchased from a travel agent or when  
an electronic ticket is unavailable because a passenger is 
traveling four or more legs on a trip, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharge is primarily to offset delivery costs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The fee will only be assessed per purchase, rather than per  
ticket. So there would be one $10 charge if more than one paper 
ticket is purchased at the same time, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly want to encourage people to use electronic  
tickets. Right now, more than 50 percent of people who purchase 
tickets from us get electronic tickets,'' he said. ``By and large, 
it's a small percentage of people who still ask for paper 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Alaska doesn't anticipate losing any customers to other  
airlines who offer paper tickets without a surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows Delta Air Lines' action earlier this week that  
it has added a $2 surcharge to domestic round-trip bookings except 
for those made at its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Alaska and Horizon serve 70 cities in eight Western  
states, Canada and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Leaves With Bragging Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The best thing about retiring from the NBA when he did, Michael  
Jordan said, was taking the bragging rights with him. That, and 
leaving a few long-suffering friends behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick will never be able to live with himself because he  
can't beat Michael Jordan in a playoff series,'' he said. ``And I 
told Charles he'd never win because he didn't dedicate himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley, but had Jordan  
gone down the list of people he called to gloat the night before 
his I'm-outta-here announcement, the retirement bash might be going 
on still. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of the 1994 and 1995 finals -- Jordan was  
playing baseball the first year and scraping the rust off his game 
the second -- the road to the NBA championship during the decade 
didn't so much go through Jordan and Chicago as dead-end there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing found himself staring at that brick wall more times than  
he cares to remember. Barkley played a brilliant Game 5 in the 1993 
finals, bragged about saving the city from a championship-sized 
riot, then went back to Phoenix and got beat, anyway. The club they 
belonged to was hardly exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone and John Stockton, Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp,  
Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway, Alonzo Mourning and Larry 
Johnson, Clyde Drexler -- all were issued membership cards and 
badges. So were coaches Pat Riley, Lenny Wilkens, Larry Bird and 
Jeff Van Gundy, who looked beat-up even before Jordan laid a finger 
on him -- all of them had cameos in those championship videos the 
NBA sells for $19.95 at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt those tapes will be harder to peddle at the end of this  
one. Beyond Jordan's departure, there will be lingering resentment 
over the six-month lockout and the perception that 50 games is more 
a quiz than a full exam. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only thing the league has going for it at the moment  
is unpredictability. That will be the theme, if not the buzzword, 
in league slogans this year. (So much for ``fan-tastic.'') 
</P>
<P>
	All we know is who won't win: the Bulls. And the Clippers, not  
just because of their star-crossed past, but because of their 
star-crossed present. Shades of Danny Ferry: No. 1 draft choice 
Michael Olowokandi got tired of waiting for the lockout to end and 
signed with Kinder Bologna in the Italian League, where he is 
committed to play until Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After eliminating the Clippers, though, rule out anyone at your  
own risk. The new contract means less mobility for free-agents in 
coming years, and this season, it means the signing period will be 
measured in days rather than weeks. The balance of power could 
shift daily. With Jordan gone, anything will seem possible once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Deals will forge new allies; Latrell Sprewell could wind up  
working for Pat Riley. Other alliances will have to be shored up. 
Word is already circulating among the players that Detroit 
superstar Grant Hill and San Antonio's Tim Duncan are in for rough 
treatment because they weren't militant enough for some of their 
union brothers while the negotiations dragged out. On such things 
will the season turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, a little anarchy will be a good thing. It will  
create new rivalries, new heroes and villains, shift the focus away 
from who left to those he left behind. The older Jordan got, the 
more the desperate the NBA became trying to line up his successor. 
Shaq, Penny, Hill, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant -- all those players 
and more have auditioned for the part. But the lesson the league 
should have learned from Jordan is that stardom is grasped, not 
handed to somebody because they look good in a shoe commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan could do that, too. But it wasn't a means for him, or an  
end, just a way to pocket some extra money. He issued more 
challenges and talked more smack on the basketball court than he 
did in all those clever ads combined. And he came ready to back it 
up every night. 
</P>
<P>
	When that changed, when he had doubts, rather than coast through  
even one game, Jordan walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be `on' every game, not one-fourth of the time,'' he  
said. ``I can't honestly say it will be there 82 times when I walk 
into the building. I've always been sure about that; now, I'm 
unsure about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things could change over the next few weeks, but right now only  
one team looks ready to bring it every night. It's the same team 
that has been working out together most every day. Its attitude was 
adjusted by a coach who knows a little about competitive demands 
and it was beaten last season by the guy who practically wrote the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	That's right. The championship road this year runs through  
Indiana. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. OKs Cheap Casket Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved a plan  
Wednesday by family-owned funeral homes to cooperate in obtaining 
cheaper caskets by joining together to buy them at bulk discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing stiff price-cutting from direct retail sellers of caskets  
and from corporate funeral home chains that have obtained quantity 
discounts from casket manufacturers, the independent, family-owned 
funeral homes sought permission from the department's antitrust 
division to engage in joint purchasing to get similar discounts. 
This would allow them to compete better for price-sensitive funeral 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	They made their request through National Selected Morticians, a  
trade association that represents 865 of the mom-and-pop funeral 
homes. NSM members own 6.3 percent of the nation's funeral homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein concluded the plan  
would not harm either casket sellers or consumers, because NSM 
members buy a small share of the nation's caskets, caskets account 
for just 16.9 percent of the cost of an adult funeral, and the 
association adopted measures to reduce antitrust risks. A National 
Funeral Directors Association survey showed that in 1997 more than 
half of their customers chose an 18-gauge steel, velvet-lined 
casket with an average retail price of $2,175.57. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint purchasing would be conducted by a full-time buying  
agent and staff who are not employed by or members of NSM. The 
agent would keep competitively sensitive data confidential and not 
share it among NSM members. 
</P>
<P>
	And the agent would be able to obtain caskets for family-owned  
funeral homes that are not NSM members. Members, in turn, would be 
free to buy caskets outside the joint purchasing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	NSM bylaws will limit its membership to prevent it from  
exceeding 35 percent of U.S. casket purchases. Lawyers will attend 
all joint venture meetings, and members who sign up will have to 
agree to comply with antitrust laws.

<HEADLINE> Wannstedt Joins Johnson -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson is still coaching because of  
Dave Wannstedt, and Wannstedt is back in coaching because of 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The two close friends gave each other a career boost Thursday.  
Johnson decided not to resign as the Miami Dolphins' coach, instead 
delegating some of his duties by hiring Wannstedt as assistant head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's somebody who's going to help us take that next step,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt was reunited with Johnson two weeks after being fired  
as the Chicago Bears' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do want to be a head coach again,'' Wannstedt said. ``But my  
focus right now is winning and getting the Dolphins to the Super 
Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 55, was on the verge of retirement because he wanted to  
spend more time with his family. But in a meeting Thursday, team 
owner Wayne Huizenga persuaded Johnson to cut down on his workload 
by hiring Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, 46, was an assistant to Johnson when the Dallas  
Cowboys won the 1992 NFL title and the Miami Hurricanes won the 
1987 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy's someone I respect on a professional and personal  
level,'' Wannstedt said. ``He and I have had an awful lot of 
success together over the years. That's the plan here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt, who arrived for a news conference via Huizenga's  
helicopter, becomes the heir apparent to Johnson. Wannstedt 
struggled to a 40-56 record in Chicago with just one playoff 
victory, but he was popular with his players and remains 
well-regarded in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Wannstedt would be a true assistant head coach, not  
a figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will work with all three areas -- offense, defense, special  
teams -- just like I do,'' Johnson said. On Sundays, he said, 
``we'll both have headsets on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is actually Wannstedt's second stint with the Dolphins. Don  
Shula hired him as linebackers coach in 1989, but seven weeks later 
Wannstedt joined the Cowboys after Johnson became their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back in the Dolphins organization,''  
Wannstedt said. ``Hopefully this time it will be a longer stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt was introduced as Johnson's assistant before they even  
negotiated a contract. Wannstedt still has two years and $2.5 
million remaining in his deal with the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave is a great addition to the team and has a special  
relationship with Jimmy, and that's so important,'' team president 
Eddie Jones said. ``That brings something special to the table and 
will allow Jimmy to do what he wants to do.''

<P>
	FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- About 1,000 packages of clam meat  
fishcakes made by the Doo Rae Trading Corp. are being recalled 
because they contain egg white and wheat gluten not declared on the 
ingredient label. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pusan Fishcake Corp.-brand products in 12.3-ounce packages  
were distributed to retailers and wholesale distributors in 
California and New York, said Indy Kim, a company spokesman, on

</P>
<P>
	Egg white and wheat gluten may cause serious and  
life-threatening reactions to people who are allergic to them. No 
allergic reactions have been reported.

<HEADLINE> Tyson, Botha Set To Weigh In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson recently discovered a fund worth  
$200,000 that was established for him by the late Cus D'Amato, the 
man who saw boxing greatness in a 13-year-old reform school inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed,'' Tyson said. ``He must have known I was  
going to screw up my money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has gone through many millions of dollars and has had many  
well-documented ups and downs in and out of the ring since D'Amato 
died in Nov. 4, 1985, about a year before Tyson became, at age 20, 
the youngest heavyweight champion in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, Tyson opens a new chapter in his colorful,  
controversial career with a new manager (Shelly Finkel), a new 
promoter (America Presents) and a new trainer (Tommy Brooks). He 
also has two new tattoos to go with the likenesses of Chairman Mao 
and Arthur Ashe on his biceps -- a likeness of Che Guervara on his 
stomach and a tiger on his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	And a new attitude, says Finkel, who has replaced John Horne and  
Rory Holloway as Tyson's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 32 now and a lot more mature,'' Finkel said.  
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people are waiting for Tyson to prove it.  
</P>
<P>
	There will be a tie to the past in Tyson's 10-round fight  
against Francois Botha in the MGM Grand Garden. It was in that 
arena on June 28, 1997, that Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears, 
leading to his disqualification and the revocation of his license. 
It was restored last Oct. 19 by a 4-1 vote by the Nevada State 
Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was fined $3 million, but he lost many more millions of  
dollars by not being able to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Some astronomical figures have been reported for Tyson's purse  
for Saturday's night's pay-per-view bout, but Dan Goosen of America 
Presents said the contract is for $10 million. Not bad for a 
10-round non-title fight, but Tyson faces a $13 IRS lien. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight also is being held midway between New Year's and Super  
Bowl weekends, two of the biggest Las Vegas weekends of the year. 
And the crowd probably will be closer to 10,000 than a sellout of 
some 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be fighting,'' Tyson said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he also said, ``I don't remember the last time I was truly  
happy without worrying about something happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, Tyson will be sentenced in Maryland, where he  
pleaded no-contest to two misdemeanor assault charges stemming from 
a fender-bender involving his wife, Monica. He has settled out of 
court with two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Super Court Judge Patricia Gifford, who sentenced Tyson  
to 10 years in prison, suspending four years, for a rape 
conviction, then could take action that could send him back to 
prison for a parole violation. Tyson's probation is scheduled to 
end in March. He served three years in prison and was released 
March 25, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Key players in Tyson's career do not seem to think he will be  
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Larkin, in charge of boxing for Showtime, which has  
multiple-fight deals with Tyson, said he hopes Tyson can fight 
again April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's fight will be the first on a four-fight deal Tyson  
has with the MGM Grand. Tyson said it wants to fight four times 
this year. Both he and Larkin would like to cap the year with a 
third fight against Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	America Presents will promote the first two fights of Tyson's  
latest comeback, replacing Don King. Tyson and King are suing each 
other. Tyson also is involved with litigation with Horne and 
Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is the fifth trainer Tyson has had in a pro career that  
began in 1985. Jay Bright trained Tyson for his 11th-round loss to 
Holyfield, and Richie Giachetti was the ref for the Bite Fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that happened to Mike was, he probably wasn't in  
shape and was getting hit with some stuff that he had no idea he 
could get hit with,'' said the 44-year-old Brooks, who has worked 
with Holyfield. ``He just lost it. I don't think he had a fight 
plan in either of the two fights with Holyfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my best is over,'' Tyson said. ``I just had a  
drought for a moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST. The Tyson-Botha match is  
expected to start no later than 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a world title fight on the card. Roberto Garcia of  
Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF junior lightweight championship 
against John John Molina, a former IBF junior lightweight champion 
from Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> FAU May Head to Division I-A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Howard Schnellenberger, who turned two  
Division I-A college football programs into winners as a coach, 
told the Board of Regents on Thursday that Florida Atlantic 
University could be next. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger updated the panel that will decide whether the  
Boca Raton university can add football in 2001 on his progress in 
starting a program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen a market so ready for football,'' said  
Schnellenberger, who took Miami to a national title in 1983 and 
rebuilt Louisville into a quality program, winning a Fiesta Bowl 
with a 10-1-1 team in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger, hired at FAU to bring football to the  
university, said he has already raised $2 million in private 
donations toward putting a team on the field, and hopes to have $5 
million by March and $10 million total. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the regents approved a student athletic fee  
increase at FAU of 75 cents, from $7 to $7.75 per credit hour, that 
would help fund the football and other athletic programs. Plans are 
to add along with football two additional women's sports for gender 
equity at the university of 21,000 students at seven South Florida 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Catanese, president of FAU, said he is confident the  
regents will approve the program, possibly as soon as the group's 
March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting all kinds of serious requests for tickets,''  
Catanese said. ``Without exaggeration, I'd say we probably could 
sell 5 or 6,000 tickets right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catanese, who briefly donned an FAU football helmet for the  
meeting, said the team would play in Lockhart Stadium in Fort 
Lauderdale and that the revenue the program would generate would 
more than support itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger told the regents that in football crazy South  
Florida, he thought the team would easily sell out, and it would 
generate school spirit at FAU like the addition of football two 
years ago did at the University of South Florida in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extraordinary university with an extraordinary  
need,'' Schnellenberger said. ``We have seven satellite campuses. 
Many students don't come to our main campus with the exception of 
graduation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After presenting the school's plan to the regents,  
Schnellenberger said he wouldn't likely be the coach, but that he 
would help find one, preferably by this fall in time to start 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll start looking for the best coach we can find, but the  
process won't start until we get officially licensed to play 
football,'' by the regents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Owls would play in Division I-AA, the second-to-the-top  
division in college football.

<HEADLINE> Australia Off in Olympic Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hosting the 2000 Olympics will cost  
Australia $441 million more than the government had estimated, the 
New South Wales auditor-general said in a report released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit, finally produced after several delays, estimated the  
direct costs of the games at $3.7 billion with direct revenues of 
$2.27 billion, leaving a net cost to the government of $1.45 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the $441 million in extra costs came because the  
auditor, Tony Harris, did not count $379 million the government 
expected to earn from activities surrounding the games and which it 
included in the 1998 Olympic budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the extra revenue -- from areas such as payroll taxes  
-- was an indirect benefit of hosting the games and should not have 
been included. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics minister Michael Knight said the auditor-general's  
report did not include any allegations of waste or mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Significantly, nowhere in his report does Mr. Harris point to  
excessive spending or money wasted on preparation for the Olympic 
and Paralympic Games,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Depardieu Returns to French Stage </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Gerard Depardieu returned to the French stage for  
the first time in 13 years and said he felt more comfortable there 
than in movies or on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different kind of performance. It's more human, more  
free. I don't have my career mapped out,'' he told the daily Le 
Figaro. ``I do my job like a blue-collar worker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Gates of Heaven,'' a murder mystery that opened  
Wednesday at the Theatre de Paris, Depardieu plays Charles Quint, a 
16th-century emperor who abdicates to seek redemption through 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Depardieu, whose award-winning roles include Cyrano de Bergerac,  
had not performed on stage since 1986, when he starred in the

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Enquirer Names Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ward H. Bushee, editor of the Reno (Nev.)  
Gazette-Journal, has been appointed editor/vice president of The 
Cincinnati Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee, 49, appointed to the position Wednesday, has been editor  
of the Reno newspaper since 1994 and was executive editor from 1990 
to 1994. The Reno paper and the Enquirer are among 75 daily 
newspapers owned by Gannett Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has extensive experience in the industry and has long been  
recognized as one of the leading editors in the company,'' said 
Enquirer Publisher and President Harry M. Whipple. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee promised to work to produce a high-quality metropolitan  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard for so long that this is a dying business,'' he  
said. ``In truth, it has been a stagnant business. I want to keep 
the momentum going that has been building for several years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee succeeds Lawrence K. Beaupre, who left the newspaper in  
November to become a corporate executive at Gannett. Beaupre had 
been editor since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee's appointment comes seven months after the Enquirer  
renounced a series of stories critical of the business practices of 
Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International. The paper said in 
June the lead reporter used illegal means to obtain voice-mail 
messages and paid Chiquita a settlement of more than $10 million. 
Beaupre said his departure was not due to the Chiquita series. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee has been involved with newspapers most of his life. He  
joined Gannett when The Californian at Salinas was bought by the 
company in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushee was sports editor at the Marin Independent Journal in  
Marin County, Calif., from 1979 to 1982. From 1982 to 1985, he was 
assistant content editor/sports at USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was assistant managing editor/sports at Gannett  
Westchester Newspapers in New York from 1985 to 1986, when he took 
over as executive editor of the Argus Leader at Sioux Falls, S.D. 
He remained in that position until moving to Reno in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from the first full day of the Senate impeachment  
trial against President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	--The trial resumed at 1:04 p.m. EST, after a week recess, with  
the Republican House prosecutors beginning their opening argument. 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided, and the president's legal 
team observed. 
</P>
<P>
	--House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde introduced his  
prosecution team and outlined their schedule. Hyde told the Senate 
that Clinton violated the oaths he took to tell the truth as a 
witness and to uphold the nation's laws as president and ``what you 
do over the next few weeks will forever affect the meaning of those 
two words, 'I do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton attended a crime prevention event in Alexandria, Va.,  
and worked on his State of the Union speech. He postponed a trip to 
New York because of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin opened the prosecution  
arguments by charging Clinton engaged in a ``conspiracy of crimes 
to prevent justice from being served'' in the Paula Jones case and 
the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reps. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and  
James Rogan of California described to senators the evidence and 
how they believed it supported the two articles of impeachment 
against Clinton. They used charts and extensive video clips from 
the president's testimony in the Jones lawsuit and before the grand 
jury to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several prosecutors urged senators to allow them to call  
witnesses later in the trial -- a decision the Senate won't make for 
another week. 
</P>
<P>
	--The White House accused the House prosecutors of laying out a  
case ``that is both unsubstantiated and circumstantial'' and 
provided no grounds for Clinton's removal from office.

<HEADLINE> Club Shampooing Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Woodstock? Greenwich Village?  
Haight-Ashbury? 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they are all testaments to '60s nostalgia, but the true  
roots of the Age of Aquarius are being kept alive for the young 
folks of the '90s in a converted North Philadelphia warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	While love and peace were the era's stated goals, its most  
visible feature, as proclaimed in the era's epoch-summing musical, 
was ``Hair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, when a group of avant-garde nightclub owners set out  
to revive those days of sky-high afros and tresses down to there, 
they made sure to have the professionals on hand. Every other 
weekend at Club Shampoo, skilled hairdressers stand ready with 
scissors, dye, flowers, glitter -- everything needed to turn 
lackluster locks into a wild mane. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are totally into their hair here,'' said staff makeup  
artist Rosina Oriti, her face glittering and hair shimmering under 
muted lights. ``They crowd around to see this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Gutin, one of four owners who operate several theme clubs  
around the city, named Club Shampoo after the 1975 film starring 
Warren Beatty as a shaggy-haired hairdresser-gigolo who motorcycled 
from one sex-hungry client to the next with a blow-dryer stuffed 
into the waistband of his bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
	But while ``Shampoo'' satirized the notion that great hair was  
the key to a great life, movie fan Gutin believes there's something 
wonderful about those long-gone days of loose coifs and loose sex. 
After nearly two years working with contractors and construction 
workers, he's created a scene reminiscent of the era's freedom, 
style and state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '60s and '70s, nightlife was less restricted. And this  
is where people come to get that real feeling of freedom and 
unrestricted fun again,'' Gutin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the crowd at this hot hangout is barely old  
enough to remember the days of burning draft cards and bras. 
Nevertheless, the young adults jammed onto the dance floor know 
exactly how to mix and enjoy the old and the new; their sweaty 
bodies are clad in hip-hugging pants and Doc Martens military-style 
work boots or tube tops and Oakley brand shades. 
</P>
<P>
	Old hair-salon chairs and rows of red velvet couches line the  
walls. Holographic wallpaper decorate the rooms. A bartender waits 
on customers in the unisex bathroom. And near-naked drag queens 
perform under smoky haze. Down its dark hallway, past the hologram 
of a woman shampooing her hair, past the plastic bubbles and past 
the male dancers in Speedos hanging from the ceiling, sits The 
Hairdresser's Chair. In this corner, where the strobe lights barely 
hit, the transformations begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even misses with short tresses and jocks with long locks can  
flop in this chair with their favorite drink in hand, get a quick 
new 'do and a splash of makeup, and be out on the dance floor in 30 
minutes -- all for free. The cover is $10. 
</P>
<P>
	But dancers beware. Considering the dim lights, the lack of  
mirrors, the distraction of pounding techno music and potential 
tipsiness of both customer and haircutter, submitting a head to the 
scissors seems very risky. 
</P>
<P>
	``But don't worry, they trust me. I get a lot of thank-you  
kisses from this,'' hairstylist Artur Kirsh said in a thick Russian 
accent. He walked into the club toting a silver briefcase loaded 
with a blow-dryer, scissors and gels of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from stage-shy, Kirsh was eager to work his art before the  
crowd of hundreds. He considers the flash of the scissors and the 
wafting of hair clippings as much a part of the entertainment as 
the strobe lights and dancers' muscles glistening with sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the freedom to do what I want here,'' he said. ``When I  
cut hair, it's like a fountain of hair flying around in the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Blanck was among the last patrons of the night and walked  
away satisfied. ``I felt like being a guinea pig tonight,'' said 
Blanck, standing in a pile of hair on the floor. ``It was a 
spur-of-the-moment thing I thought might be kind of fun. And it 
was.''

<HEADLINE> Carly Simon Opera Back in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six years after its debut, an opera written  
by Carly Simon is back in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Opera Company of North Carolina has chosen ``Romulus Hunt,''  
about how a young boy and his imaginary friend come to grips with 
divorced parents, to open its season tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	It will mark the first time a professional company has performed  
the opera since its initial runs in New York and Washington in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the Opera Company had hoped to have Simon be a part  
of the casting and rehearsal process. But because of scheduling 
conflicts, she only had time to be part of several fund-raising 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was expected to be on hand for tonight's performance.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Needs Hip Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the last 40 years, April in Augusta usually meant azaleas in  
bloom and Jack Nicklaus making a Sunday charge in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first green jacket as a chubby, brash 23-year-old and  
his record sixth Masters title 23 years later with one of the 
greatest back nines Augusta National has ever seen. Even as a 
58-year-old grandfather with an ailing left hip, Nicklaus managed 
to leave the gallery on the edge of its seats, wondering if he had 
more magic left in his aging body. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Nicklaus was around, hope followed.  
</P>
<P>
	Not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss the Masters this year for the first time  
since 1958 after deciding to have hip replacement surgery that will 
keep him out of golf until at least the summer. He had hoped that a 
strenuous exercise program would strengthen his degenerative hip, 
but finally concluded that he could not play competitively again 
without surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I do feel stronger and in better condition, I am not  
strong enough to play the best golf I possibly can to start the 
year,'' said Nicklaus, who turns 59 next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation is scheduled for Jan. 27.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry if Jack will not be able to compete in this  
year's Masters,'' Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson said 
Thursday. ``Jack is very special to Augusta National, both as an 
individual and a player. We wish him a speedy recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus also withdrew from two Senior PGA Tour events this  
month, the MasterCard Championship and the Senior Skins Game. He 
was replaced in the Skins game by Jim Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Masters, he is expected to miss the first two  
majors on the senior circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I feel strong enough and able to play golf at a  
competitive level, I will continue to play tournament golf,'' said 
Nicklaus, the winner of 18 majors and two U.S. Amateur titles. ``If 
I want to play later this year and in the future, now is the time 
for surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, George Archer became the first player with an  
artificial hip to win a senior tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion, did not say when he might  
return, although later this year is not out of the question. With 
his youngest son getting married Feb. 20, wife Barbara told The 
Palm Beach Post, ``I expect to have him dancing by then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was hobbling so badly at times last year that he  
stopped his streak of 146 consecutive majors when he pulled out of 
the British Open. This will be the third straight major he has 
failed to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can hit golf balls all I want. And I can walk,'' he said in  
October. ``But the two of them -- they don't like each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus' record at Augusta goes beyond his six green jackets.  
He won his first Masters in 1963 and his last one in 1986, when he 
shot a 30 on the back nine. He was a runner-up four times and 
finished in the top 10 in every Masters in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at 58, he showed he could still compete with the best. He  
dazzled the gallery again in April by closing with a 68 and 
finishing just three strokes behind Mark O'Meara. His tie for sixth 
made him the oldest player in Masters history to finish in the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, captain of the U.S. team that was crushed in the  
Presidents Cup, has said he wants to be able to play all four 
majors in 2000, particularly because of their locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open will be at Pebble Beach, where Nicklaus won in  
1972. The British Open will be at St. Andrews, where he won two of 
his three claret jugs. The PGA will be at Valhalla outside 
Louisville, a course Nicklaus designed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is not so much '99,'' he said recently. ``I want to  
get myself to where I can possibly do what I have to do to be 
reasonable in the year 2000.''

<HEADLINE> EU To Abolish Duty Free Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE PRIDE OF BRUGES (AP) -- Many passengers on this ferry  
chugging across the English Channel are afraid of losing a 
cherished institution -- duty-free shopping -- that is also a $7 
billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a reprieve, the European Union will abolish duty-free  
perks June 30 -- perks enjoyed by millions in search of cheap booze, 
cigarettes and perfume as they fly or sail from one EU nation to 
another. Such goods bought in duty-free stores on a traveler's way 
out of a country are not subject to that nation's taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The impending ban provoked strong reactions from shoppers in the  
Pride of Bruges' duty-free store during the hourlong crossing from 
Dover, England, to the French port of Calais. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should leave it alone,'' said Albert Edward Bentley, 75.  
The pensioner from around Dover said he regularly makes the trip to 
Calais to fill his duty-free quota of one liter of strong liquor 
and two liters of wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to pay the supermarkets' high prices, but if I've  
got company coming, I can't just give them tea, can I?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Such arguments carry little weight with Mario Monti, the EU's  
tax commissioner, who estimates the tax breaks enjoyed by duty-free 
stores give them a yearly $2.3 billion advantage over other 
retailers. Furthermore, he insists duty-free has no place in a 
border-free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	His office noted that traveling within the EU is now like  
traveling within a single country: ``You cannot buy duty-free goods 
if you are traveling by plane from Paris to Marseilles. There is no 
good reason why you should ... if you are traveling from Paris to 
Glasgow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban won't apply to duty-free sales for people traveling to  
or from the EU from countries outside the 15-nation bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	With annual duty-free sales within the EU estimated at more than  
$7 billion, the industry is fighting hard to stay in business. 
Posters in airports, ports and ferry boats around Europe warn 
``traveling will never be the same again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the International Duty Free Confederation, more is  
at stake than saving a few dollars on a bottle of gin. The lobbying 
group says 140,000 jobs could be lost; ferry companies and airlines 
will be forced to raise prices; small airports and ferry routes 
will shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	``If duty free goes, the effects are going to be very quick,  
very sharp and very harmful,'' says John Hume, spokesman for the 
confederation in Brussels, Belgium. ``It's not just a perk for 
travelers. It's real jobs and real problems for real people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His message is getting through. Governments in Germany, Britain  
and France recently have reversed their stance and are calling for 
a stay of execution. Still, such heavyweight support may not be 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, EU nations all voted for abolition, granting a  
seven-year grace period for the industry to prepare. Overturning 
that ruling needs another unanimous vote and some governments -- 
notably the Netherlands and Denmark -- are determined to kill off 
duty-free shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is the same as it was seven years ago. There is  
no reason for us to change it,'' said Frits Kemperman, spokesman 
for the Dutch Finance Ministry. ``It would be very strange if we 
kept duty free when the frontiers have gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popular pressure to save duty-free shopping is strongest in  
nations where liquor duties traditionally have been high, such as 
Britain, Ireland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	A top brand of scotch costs about $65 a liter in Stockholm, but  
just $35 on the ferry from Sweden to Finland. A 24-can pack of 
bitter ale was $21 on the boat to Calais, nearly half the price on 
land in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Britons can and do buy their drinks in France, where  
duty is much lower and there is almost no limit on how much they 
can carry home, duty-free shopping is a treasured tradition. 
Indignation at the proposed abolition was near unanimous on the 
Pride of Bruges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total farce. It's ludicrous,'' Joe Robinson, a truck  
driver from Colchester, England, said clutching his duty-free 
cigarettes. ``I'd just have to stop smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty appalled,'' said Martin Pickard, a property  
developer from Kent who has written his representative in 
Parliament on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told his EU colleagues last  
month that no European issue was more important to British citizens 
than saving duty free. Prime Minister Tony Blair took the campaign 
to the EU's year-end summit in Vienna, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France and German  
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Blair persuaded other leaders to 
commission a study into the impact of duty-free's extinction, 
raising hopes that the ban will be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got the big hitters on our side,'' said Hume, of the  
duty-free lobby. ``I think eventually the Danes and the others will 
see sense.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Livent Execs Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ousted founders of Broadway theater producer  
Livent Inc. and other former executives were charged in an 
indictment today with conspiring to inflate the company's earnings 
and taking kickbacks worth $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the Securities and Exchange Commission  
brought securities and accounting fraud charges against the former 
top managers of the troubled Canadian company known for its lavish 
Broadway productions that included ``Ragtime'' and ``Kiss of the 
Spider Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment and the SEC lawsuit were filed in U.S. District  
Court in Manhattan this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC lawsuit, between 1990 and 1994, Livent  
founders Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb engaged in a kickback 
conspiracy to siphon off approximately $4.6 million for themselves 
by inflating invoices paid to vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky, the company's former chairman and chief executive  
officer, and Gottlieb, its former president and director, allegedly 
ordered the company's former senior vice president of finance and 
administration, Gordon Eckstein, to write most of the amount off as 
preproduction expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	This resulted in the company allegedly overstating pretax  
earnings and understating pretax losses in fiscal years 1991 and 
1992, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckstein also was named in the lawsuit, as were five other  
former company executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky and Gottlieb were fired in November by Livent's new  
management team, headed by former Walt Disney Co. president Michael 
Ovitz. They were accused of engaging in widespread fraud that cost 
Livent and its shareholders $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the company sought protection under Chapter 11 of  
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It later obtained $25 million in 
financing to keep itself afloat for six month while it reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto-based Livent owns or controls theaters in New York,  
Chicago, Toronto and Vancouver. Its Broadway productions have won 
18 Tony Awards.

<HEADLINE> Senate Works Despite Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators managed a bit of regular business  
after listening to six hours of arguments for President Clinton's 
removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the impeachment trial recessed at about 7 p.m.  
Thursday, the Senate agreed by unanimous consent to meet in a joint 
session early next week in the House to hear the president's annual 
State of the Union address to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-sentence resolution, approved by the House on Jan. 6,  
states: ``That the two Houses of Congress assemble in the Hall of 
the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Jan. 19, 1999, at 9 p.m., 
for the purpose of receiving such communication as the President of 
the United States shall be pleased to make to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that same day in the Senate chamber across the Capitol,  
White House lawyers are to begin laying out Clinton's defense on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House members outlining the case for Clinton's removal from  
office will not finish their presentation until Saturday afternoon, 
posing a conflict of interest for at least one of the 100 senators 
serving as impartial jurors in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case will interfere with Sabbath observances for Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat and the Senate's only Orthodox 
Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman usually spends the Sabbath -- the hours between sundown  
Friday and sundown Saturday -- attending religious services and 
huddling with family. Use of mechanical and technological devices 
is shunned, and work is avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously not going to be the kind of Sabbath I normally  
like to spend, but I think we can ... work it out,'' Lieberman said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lieberman, who will not answer the phone, ride an elevator  
or flick a light switch during the Sabbath, said his responsibility 
as a juror outweighs his personal preferences, even in matters as 
dear to him as his religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the continuing pursuit of justice takes  
precedent, and therefore, without any hesitation, I'll be there,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial could be very accommodating, however, since senators  
must sit silently during the proceedings and turn off beepers and 
cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The date of Jan. 14 is significant in the annals of Senate  
history for reasons other than Thursday's opening arguments in the 
first impeachment trial of an elected president. On that day, in 
1881, the Senate acquired its first telephone service, according to 
an informational pamphlet prepared by the Senate Historical Office. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	By and large, senators stuck to the rules requiring them to sit  
silently at their desks during the day's proceedings, leaving the 
Senate floor only for scheduled breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers took notes, read or listened to the unfolding  
presentation, sometimes fidgeting in their seats or rubbing weary 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pages were kept busy bringing glasses of water.  
</P>
<P>
	A striking scene in the chamber, however, was Sen. Ernest  
``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., who covered his eyes with dark 
sunglasses. An aide said they were ordered by a doctor after 
Hollings underwent eye surgery on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the ban on talk, some senators were seen engaging in  
brief, whispered conversations or pointing to passages in printed 
copies of speeches they received.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Organizers Target IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers may put pressure on  
the International Olympic Committee to cough up more money and 
expect less pampering during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the possibility of changing the contract will be broached when 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch visits in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can adjust some of the expenses. One of them  
might be a reduction of protocol expenses, in the fancy treatment 
of the Olympic community,'' Garff told the Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bullock, a member of SLOC, said he has tallied up $10  
million worth of IOC expenses that SLOC has agreed to pay and which 
he considers extravagances ``that would turn your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference Thursday afternoon, IOC member Anita  
DeFrantz deflected questions about whether the IOC would 
renegotiate the contract to protect Salt Lake in the event of a 
scandal-caused revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC believes that the money will be raised for these  
games,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she bristled at the suggestion IOC members will be getting  
perks in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not assume the IOC is all take. We provide a lot of  
money to organizing committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, also a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
spoke to reporters from around the world who came for a SLOC 
meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled 
pending completion by Feb. 11 of an outside ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was adamant on two counts: that Samaranch should remain  
at the helm of the IOC and that Salt Lake will keep the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the hour, I have spoken with President Samaranch. He  
was very clear. We are 100 percent behind the Games being here,'' 
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC expenses that Bullock questions in SLOC's $1.45  
billion budget are $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 
suite for Samaranch and $30,000 in lobby decorations; a $1.1 
million transportation system including chauffeurs; $650,000 in 
breakfasts; and $16,000 for trailers at outdoor events so IOC 
members won't have to sit in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Olympics are about. You're taking money  
to put into the day care of these individuals that could be put 
into venues, athletes or community programs,'' Bullock told the 
Deseret News. ``It shows how out of whack the priorities have 
become.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a renegotiation of the deal. Bullock did not  
return calls to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz defended one of the expenses for IOC: chauffeured cars.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need drivers because we don't know the community. They're  
drivers, not chauffeurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the press conference, Garff said only that he knew no  
details about the IOC expenses and that in almost daily 
conversations, SLOC, IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee officials ``are 
always fine-tuning our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps suggested by some Salt Lake leaders is to use a  
clause of the contract to pressure the IOC to share more of its 
sponsorship revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause exempts the IOC from responsibility for the cost of  
the Games, except in the instance of ``willful misconduct or gross 
negligence by the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake, IOC and USOC organizers are scurrying to shore up  
sponsor support in the wake of revelations that Salt Lake bid 
executives gave lavish gifts and cash payments to IOC members 
before the 1995 vote giving Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt has already called on the IOC to help should

<HEADLINE> Plea Changes in Murder of Calif Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A drifter who has admitted knifing a  
9-year-old boy to death in a public beach restroom changed his plea 
Thursday to innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	At his arraignment in November, Brandon Wilson told the judge  
``I killed the little boy'' after public defender Curt Owen entered 
an innocent plea for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not whether he committed the act; he's  
admitted to that,'' Owen said after Thursday's preliminary hearing. 
``The question is whether he was sane when the act was committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A court-appointed psychiatrist determined last month that  
Wilson, 21, was mentally competent to stand trial, but did not 
evaluate Wilson's sanity at the time he killed Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read at the hearing, Wilson said he spent two  
days hunting for a victim to kill when he saw 9-year-old Matthew 
Cecchi go into a public beach restroom at Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he smiled at Matthew because he didn't want Matthew  
to realize that he was about to kill him. The little boy smiled 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt turned back towards the urinal and within two or three  
seconds, Wilson came behind Matthew. Wilson pulled out of his belt 
a sharp hunting knife and grabbed Matthew from behind,'' the judge 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilson grabbed Matthew from the full head, pulled Matt's head  
back, bearing Matt's throat. Wilson plunged the knife into the left 
side of Matt's throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Rubin said the testimony was hard for the  
family to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first time they had heard some of the details,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is charged with first-degree murder with special  
circumstances of lying in wait and using a knife. Conviction on the 
charge carries an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without 
parole. The special circumstances make him eligible for the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered Rubin to report Feb. 4 whether prosecutors will  
seek the death penalty. If they do not, a trial will begin March 5. 
If they seek the death penalty, a trial will be held later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wilson is found insane, he will be sent to a state mental  
hospital. If he is found sane, the trial will move into the penalty 
phase.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Fall by 4,000 / Jobless Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New applications for unemployment benefits  
dipped by 4,000 last week, the second straight weekly decline after 
an unusual surge during Christmas week, the Labor Department 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline pushed the number of people filing new claims for  
jobless benefits down to 352,000 for the week ending Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims had fallen by an even larger 16,000 the week before. But  
both of those declines followed a surge of 83,000 in the week 
ending Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	While that had been the biggest increase in six years, analysts  
blamed much of that surge on weather-related factors, including 
flooding in the Northeast that boosted layoffs in the construction 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims rose to 342,250, an  
increase of 13,000 from the previous week. That marked the highest 
level for the four-week average since mid-July when layoffs were 
boosted by the General Motors strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the small upward trend in jobless claims, analysts said  
the nation's job market remains exceptionally tight. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported last week that the unemployment rate for  
December fell to a low of 4.3 percent, capping a year in which the 
jobless rate averaged just 4.5 percent, the best performance since 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in labor markets reflected the strong economy,  
which has so far been able to withstand a big drop in export 
earnings caused by economic crises overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the state data, the largest increase in jobless  
claims for the week ending Jan. 2 was in North Carolina, a gain of 
15,543 that was blamed on higher layoffs in construction, textiles 
and furniture plants. Other big increases in jobless claims were 
recorded in New York, up 13,512; Tennessee, up 12,761; Michigan, up 
10,735; and South Carolina, up 9,131. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest declines in benefit applications were in Illinois,  
down 7,311; California, down 4,014; Texas, down 3,804; Oregon, down 
3,072; and Washington, down 3,055. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-by-state information is one week behind the national  
claims figures.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Delays Flight to New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton canceled plans to fly to New  
York Thursday evening because of a winter storm that socked the 
Northeast with snow, sleet and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Clinton will make the trip Friday morning  
if weather conditions permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is scheduled to deliver the keynote address Friday at a  
conference in New York on encouraging Wall Street firms to invest 
in neglected inner cities and rural areas. He also was to have 
addressed a black tie gala Thursday night in connection with the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow blanketed much of New York state Thursday for the second  
time in a week, and freezing rain and sleet made for icy roads from 
Ohio into Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey. Freezing rain and 
icy roads also were a problem in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Hustler Publisher Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who  
won a conditional delay in his obscenity trial, has been 
hospitalized in Los Angeles with an infection that might be related 
to his planned surgery for a urological problem, one of his lawyers 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a flu-type of condition, and he has been having a lot  
of bronchial problems,'' attorney Alan Isaacman said from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt was in intensive care at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, Isaacman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The infection that he has that is requiring surgery could have  
made him prone to the lung infection,'' he said. ``Doctors said it 
was a systemic kind of infection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 55, and his brother, Jimmy, 49, were indicted April 7 on  
charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material harmful to a 
juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the alleged sale of a sexually explicit  
video to a 14-year-old boy at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store 
that Jimmy Flynt manages. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, each brother could get 24 years in prison and  
$65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flynts were to stand trial next Tuesday. But earlier this  
week, defense lawyers filed a surprise motion asking for a 
continuance, saying that Larry Flynt suffers from a urological 
problem common among paraplegics and must have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt has been in a wheelchair since he was shot in 1978.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Organizers Target IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers may put pressure on  
the International Olympic Committee to cough up more money and 
expect less pampering during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the possibility of changing the contract will be broached when 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch visits in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can adjust some of the expenses. One of them  
might be a reduction of protocol expenses, in the fancy treatment 
of the Olympic community,'' Garff told the Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bullock, a member of SLOC, said he has tallied up $10  
million worth of IOC expenses that SLOC has agreed to pay and which 
he considers extravagances ``that would turn your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference Thursday afternoon, IOC member Anita  
DeFrantz deflected questions about whether the IOC would 
renegotiate the contract to protect Salt Lake in the event of a 
scandal-caused revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC believes that the money will be raised for these  
games,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she bristled at the suggestion IOC members will be getting  
perks in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not assume the IOC is all take. We provide a lot of  
money to organizing committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, also a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
spoke to reporters from around the world who came for a SLOC 
meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled 
pending completion by Feb. 11 of an outside ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was adamant on two counts: that Samaranch should remain  
at the helm of the IOC and that Salt Lake will keep the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the hour, I have spoken with President Samaranch. He  
was very clear. We are 100 percent behind the Games being here,'' 
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC expenses that Bullock questions in SLOC's $1.45  
billion budget are $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 
suite for Samaranch and $30,000 in lobby decorations; a $1.1 
million transportation system including chauffeurs; $650,000 in 
breakfasts; and $16,000 for trailers at outdoor events so IOC 
members won't have to sit in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Olympics are about. You're taking money  
to put into the day care of these individuals that could be put 
into venues, athletes or community programs,'' Bullock told the 
Deseret News. ``It shows how out of whack the priorities have 
become.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a renegotiation of the deal. Bullock did not  
return calls to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz defended one of the expenses for IOC: chauffeured cars.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need drivers because we don't know the community. They're  
drivers, not chauffeurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the press conference, Garff said only that he knew no  
details about the IOC expenses and that in almost daily 
conversations, SLOC, IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee officials ``are 
always fine-tuning our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps suggested by some Salt Lake leaders is to use a  
clause of the contract to pressure the IOC to share more of its 
sponsorship revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause exempts the IOC from responsibility for the cost of  
the Games, except in the instance of ``willful misconduct or gross 
negligence by the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake, IOC and USOC organizers are scurrying to shore up  
sponsor support in the wake of revelations that Salt Lake bid 
executives gave lavish gifts and cash payments to IOC members 
before the 1995 vote giving Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt has already called on the IOC to help should  
Salt Lake lose sponsor money -- the biggest source of Olympic 
funding -- because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	No sponsors have said they'll back out, but organizers worry  
about lining up new sponsors. The 2002 Games still need $250 
million from sponsors to meet the $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC receives money from product sales, international  
sponsorships and sale of broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said Thursday the SLOC believes it can still meet its  
revenue target, since sponsors are holding tight and IOC appears 
poised to oust any members found culpable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, the investigation should not end there. ``We  
would like the process to look into other cities, other nations so 
that the evil is rooted out.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading

</P>
<P>
 *Motorola fell 4 3/8 to 66 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The maker of telecommunications equipment, based in Schaumburg,  
Ill., reported net income of $159 million, or 26 cents a diluted 
share, compared with year-earlier net income of $321 million, or 53 
cents a diluted share after special charges. The results, announced 
late Wednesday, beat analysts' expected 23 cents a share. However, 
in a Thursday morning conference call with analysts, Motorola 
disclosed that Brazil's currency devaluation will lower 
first-quarter earnings by $15 million and could slow the 
electronics giant's sales growth in Latin America. 

</P>
<P>
 *Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 7/16 to 22 5/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The computer chip maker's fourth-quarter net earnings were 15  
cents per diluted share, compared to a year-ago loss of 9 cents, 
and analysts' consensus expectation of 19 cents. AMD said its 
production problems are behind it, but that it faces heightened 
competition from Intel Corp., which is bent on recovering share in 
low-cost PC chips. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities 
downgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``top pick,'' and Sutro &AMP; Co. 
cut it to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Planet Hollywood International Inc. rose 9/16 to 3 3/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The trendy restaurant company said it expects to record a  
fourth-quarter pretax charge of $130 million to $160 million, 
mainly for asset writedowns that are part of a plan to lower 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge, Planet Hollywood expects to report  
negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter.

</P>
<P>
 *Apple Computer rose 5 1/4 to 41 1/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Wednesday that its first-quarter net profit  
more than tripled, boosted by strong sales of its new iMac 
computer. Apple earned 95 cents a share on a diluted basis, up from 
33 cents a year ago and easily beating Wall Street forecasts. 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities upgraded the stock to 
``buy'' from ``market perform,'' but Salomon Smith Barney 
downgraded it to ``neutral'' from ``buy,'' citing high inventories 
of iMac computers at the end of December. 

</P>

 *Sunglass Hut rose 1 3/4 to 9 1/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said it bought two e-commerce World Wide Web sites,  
shades.com and SwissArmyDepot.com, in a $4 million deal. Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter and Gruntal &AMP; Co. both upgraded the stock. 

</P>
<P>
 *Golden Books rose 1 7/32 to 1 31/32.    	
</P>

	Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co., said that  
Disney might be interested in acquiring the troubled children's 
publishing company, The New York Times reported.

<HEADLINE> Unisys Reports 4th Quarter Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Unisys Corp. on Thursday reported a  
fourth-quarter profit that edged Wall Street forecasts, rebounding 
from a year-ago loss amid stronger sales of computer services to 
business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys said it earned $138.6 million, or 42 cents a share on a  
diluted basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31, 1998. That 
compared to a loss of $965.7 million, or $4.75 a diluted share, in 
the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew to $2.05 billion from $1.90 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the news, sending Unisys stock rising 2.8  
percent on a day when major stock indexes were tumbling. Unisys 
rose 93 3/4 cents to close at $34.37 1/2 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter 1997 loss was mostly due to a $1.1 billion  
charge to cover lingering costs from the merger of Burroughs Corp. 
and Sperry Corp. that created Unisys in 1986. Earnings before the 
charge were $86.9 million, or 25 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results bear the trademark of chairman and chief executive  
officer Lawrence A. Weinbach, hired in September 1997, who is 
overseeing a change in emphasis from computer manufacturing to 
computer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys outsourced production of notebook, personal and more  
powerful computers while seeing more than 20 percent growth in 
information services to clients that include more than 40 banks, 
1,500 government agencies and 200 airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our information services business continued its turnaround,''  
Weinbach said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Unisys reported net income of $387 million, or  
$1.06 a diluted share, on revenue of $7.21 billion, compared with a 
1997 loss of $853.6 million, or $5.30 a diluted share, on revenue 
of $6.64 billion.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Proposes Sports Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday proposed the  
city develop a sprawling sports, convention and entertainment 
complex that would bring into the same neighborhood a domed 
football stadium, a new Madison Square Garden and the Jacob K. 
Javits Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor described the proposal as an economic engine that  
would bring new vitality to the largely underdeveloped area on 
Manhattan's West Side, as well as an opportunity to lure back the 
New York Jets, the football team that left for the Meadowlands in 
New Jersey years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Details were sketchy. The mayor didn't put a price tag on the  
project or set a date when it might be built, and provided only a 
vague outline on how the development would be funded, apparently 
through a combination of public and private dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He also alluded only generally to how the land could be  
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, he boasted it would become a stage for huge  
concerts, major sporting events and conventions, lucrative business 
that New York now often loses to cities with domed stadiums and big 
convention centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you would see in development in this whole area would pay  
for this many, many times over,'' the mayor said in his annual 
address to the City Council. ``This would become the most famous 
sports facility in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes at a time when the city has been negotiating  
new stadiums with baseball's New York Yankees and Mets. The Mets 
plan to stay in Queens, but Giuliani has faced some of his toughest 
criticism over his openness to the possibility of moving the 
Yankees out of the Bronx, a proposal reviled by many New Yorkers. 
One of the sites under consideration for a new stadium is the same 
neighborhood where Giuliani proposes building a football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by Cablevision Systems Corp., which owns the  
Garden, said the company had ``great interest'' in the mayor's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do everything we can to support this development,''  
said Cablevision president James L. Dolan. ``While Cablevision is 
very happy with the current location of the Garden, we are also 
very supportive of the mayor's goal of rejuvenating the West 
Side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets owner Leon Hess issued a statement saying he would have no  
comment on the proposal. The Jets' lease agreement with the 
Meadowlands runs until 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who has battled with  
Giuliani over any attempt to move the Yankees, signaled a 
willingness to look at the mayor's West Side plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor called for building the football stadium along the  
Hudson River, between 29th and 33rd streets in an area earlier 
proposed as a site for a new Yankee Stadium. It's just south of the 
Javits center. He said a new Garden could be built across from the 
stadium on Eleventh Avenue, and parking could be constructed in an 
area of adjacent warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Land in the area is in public and private hands.  
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for a Yankee Stadium on the site came under wide  
criticism, particularly because of concerns over traffic in the 
congested area, which isn't far from the Lincoln Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Giuliani advanced the idea of using a city business  
tax to help fund construction of sports stadiums, including new 
homes for the Yankees and Mets.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Snow and freezing rain made for a white-knuckle Thursday across  
the Northeast and Midwest, while in Detroit's snowbound 
neighborhoods, people were told if they wanted their mail, they'd 
have to come out into the streets and get it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine hamlet of Allagash, people stayed indoors to avoid  
the lowest temperature ever recorded in the state: 55 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	And Hell froze over.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're at 1 degree,'' said Jim Ley, owner of the  
Devil's Den, a clothing and souvenir store in Hell, a Michigan 
village about 60 miles west of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow extended from Ohio through Pennsylvania and into New  
York state, closing schools, canceling flights and forcing drivers 
to take it slow and steady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was slipping all over. My big question is, where are the  
sanders?'' secretary Vicki Piccione said in Mineola, N.Y., on Long 
Island. ``I saw a plow on the side of the road. Very helpful, 
wasn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	South of the snow, freezing rain and sleet fell from the Ohio  
Valley east into the mid-Atlantic states. Roads were icy from Ohio 
into Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, with numerous traffic 
accidents reported during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, where more than 23 inches of snow has accumulated  
since the beginning of the year, few neighborhood streets have been 
plowed, and the public schools have been in session only four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Postmaster Lloyd Wesley Jr. said letter carriers will operate  
``like the Good Humor man'' -- driving their trucks to the front of 
an impassable street and honking their horns for 60 seconds so that 
people can come and get their mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is never-before stuff,'' said postal spokeswoman Diana  
Pritchard. ``This isn't in the regs book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Allagash, where the old record of minus 48, set in the town  
Van Buren in 1925, was broken overnight, many of the roughly 250 
people living in the hamlet near the Canadian border plugged their 
cars into electric outlets to keep the engines warm and hunkered 
down indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow resumed Thursday in Buffalo, N.Y., which by Wednesday  
had recorded nearly 53 inches this month alone. Buffalo usually 
gets 93.2 inches of snow every year, or more than 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 2 1/2 feet on the ground Thursday, prison inmates were  
out with shovels uncovering fire hydrants and clearing walkways. 
More than 100 National Guardsmen and 80 state transportation 
workers also helped out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Erie, Pa., where snowplow crews have worked 12-hour shifts  
for 16 days straight, ``the guys are starting to come to me after 
eight hours and saying, `I can't take it anymore,''' said Dan 
Leone, chief of the Streets Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Cincinnati, plumber Mike Lemke was happily digging out  
water lines in 9-degree weather: ``They say if you like your job, 
you don't ever have to go to work.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Nuclear Plant Fire Put Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCRIBA, N.Y. (AP) -- A fire erupted Thursday near the electric  
turbine at the James FitzPatrick nuclear power plant near Oswego. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was under control shortly after it started at about 1  
p.m., but wasn't completely extinguished until Thursday evening, 
according to Woody Berzins, spokesman for the New York Power 
Authority, the plant's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believed the fire was out late in the afternoon  
because hydrogen burns so cleanly, they couldn't see the flames, 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Neil Sheehan said. But they 
discovered the fire was still going as they advanced toward it. 
Fire fighters kept hoses trained on the fire until the gas burned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The 762-megawatt plant began operation in 1975.  
</P>
<P>
	NRC spokesman Joe Gilliland said the fire began in an area of  
hydrogen tanks near the plant's electric turbine generator. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no danger to the reactor building,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters from local areas helped control the fire. The power  
plant continued to operate at full power during the fire, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One fireman was injured when he was struck in the leg by a hose  
and a plant worker was slightly burned, Berzins said. Both were 
treated and released at Oswego Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliland said there are no plans to order the plant to shut  
down, although NRC response teams are monitoring the incident. NRC 
resident inspectors were on the site.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lesbian Health a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long-awaited study of lesbian health  
uncovered a problem: Doctors know very little about it, including 
whether lesbian women are at higher risk for cancer and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The government asked the prestigious Institute of Medicine to  
investigate lesbian health, and the scientific experts concluded 
Thursday that this population has been largely overlooked by 
doctors and researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the report's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--There is some evidence lesbians may be at higher risk for  
breast cancer, because of perceived higher rates of alcohol 
consumption, overweight and childlessness, and they may be at 
higher risk for ovarian cancer, because they're less likely to bear 
children or use birth control pills. But nobody knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
	--There's a myth that lesbians don't need Pap smears to detect  
cervical cancer, but in fact they do need them. 
</P>
<P>
	--The stress of dealing with societal attitudes toward  
homosexuality may affect lesbians' physical and mental health, 
including their suicide risk, but too little research has been done 
to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors, particularly gynecologists, have little training in  
treating lesbian patients, which can affect quality of care and 
discourage patients from seeking care. One of the few studies on 
lesbians found 20 percent of lesbians surveyed in Michigan reported 
encounters with doctors who knew nothing about homosexual women. 
Also, lesbians are less likely to have health insurance, often 
because of bans against spousal benefits for unmarried partners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Research is lacking because it's hard to define who makes up  
this subset of women and then recruit them for studies, and because 
there is a stigma associated with studying lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academy of  
Sciences, urged the government and other scientists to conduct and 
fund research promptly to answer the questions.

<HEADLINE> Fate of the President Is Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The conventional wisdom holds that everyone  
knows how the impeachment trial against President Clinton will wind 
up: short of the 67 votes needed to convict him and throw him out 
of office. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a year of unexpected twists and turns, the  
prognosticators have been dead wrong about this case more often 
than right. And there is plenty of uncertainty ahead as the Senate 
wrestles over thorny questions such as whether to call witnesses, 
dismiss the case, vote on articles of impeachment or censure the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The only certainty is that the math of the Senate favors  
Clinton. There are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats. If all the 
Republicans stand united, 12 Democrats would have to desert the 
president to force his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Republican prosecutors opened their arguments Thursday,  
the spirit of Senate bipartisanship that marked the beginning of 
the trial began to fade, foreshadowing divisions that are certain 
to emerge in a historic clash of political interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complained that a team of Republican senators selected  
by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had consulted with the 
House impeachment prosecutors on criteria for calling trial 
witnesses -- before the Senate had decided whether to call any 
witnesses at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., told senators they need to call  
witnesses such as Clinton pal Vernon Jordan to ``look into his 
eyes'' and listen to the tone of his voice as he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP prosecutors also opened themselves to charges of  
overreaching by contacting Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey to 
discuss possible testimony about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (the bipartisanship) is being broken apart,'' said  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Even some GOP senators were 
uncomfortable about the contacts, but grumbled that Democrats also 
were wrong to be talking with White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hushed Senate chamber, the opening day of prosecution  
arguments lacked any drama or hint of new evidence. It was easy to 
imagine television viewers changing the channel as Rep. F. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., began explaining the GOP case by reading 
unemotionally from a script, his droning voice belying the gravity 
of his words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the walls of the Capitol and throughout this great  
country, there rages an impassioned and divisive debate over the 
future of this presidency,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``The Senate now 
finds itself in the midst of the tempest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many people, it is stunning the case has come this far, to  
the first Senate impeachment trail against a president in 131 
years. After all, public opinion has remained solidly in Clinton's 
corner despite a year of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was widely believed, wrongly, that the dismissal of Paula  
Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton early last year would 
slow the momentum of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Later, it 
was thought that Starr, frequently accused of overplaying his hand, 
had finally gone too far when he sent Congress an X-rated account 
of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it was believed the impeachment drive would shrivel up  
after Republicans suffered unexpected election losses. Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, of course, fueled Republican fury with his  
finger-wagging denial, his angry televised speech after his grand 
jury testimony and his legalistic answers to 81 questions posed by 
the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It all added up to a year that confounded expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even the most shameless of Beltway talking heads, the Sam  
Donaldsons that have been so completely wrong on this from the 
beginning, are tentative now,'' said Norm Ornstein, a political 
analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ``They have been 
shamed into tentativeness. We don't know where everything is going 
to go here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to make a compelling case for calling witnesses  
to keep their case alive and perhaps turn up evidence that would 
finally turn Americans against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there also is a risk that prolonging the trial will  
reinforce the view that Republicans simply want to get Clinton at 
any cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major tests begin Jan. 25 when the Senate begins  
considering motions to dismiss the case or subpoena witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question then becomes is there anything ... that can get  
12 or more Democrats to join all the Republicans to vote to remove 
Bill Clinton from office,'' said Ornstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer is -- not unless there is some blockbuster  
revelation or unless this drags on so long, and threatens to drag 
on even longer, that Americans say the only way we can get this out 
of the way is to get rid of the guy,'' Ornstein said. ``The odds of 
either of those things happening are small.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Today is Friday, Jan. 15, the 15th day of 1999. There are 350  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, 1929, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was  
born in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1559, England's Queen Elizabeth I was crowned in Westminster  
Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1777, the people of New Connecticut declared their  
independence. (The tiny republic later became the state of 
Vermont.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1844, the University of Notre Dame received its charter from  
the state of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1870, the Democratic party was represented as a donkey for  
the first time in a cartoon by Thomas Nast in ``Harper's Weekly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1919, pianist and statesman Ignace Jan Paderewski became the  
first premier of the newly created Republic of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, work was completed on the Pentagon, now the  
headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the first Super Bowl was played as the Green Bay  
Packers of the National Football League defeated the Kansas City 
Chiefs of the American Football League, 35-10. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, President Nixon announced the suspension of all U.S.  
offensive action in North Vietnam, citing progress in peace 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, Sara Jane Moore was sentenced to life in prison for her  
attempt on the life of President Ford in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Yugoslav federation, founded in 1918, effectively  
collapsed as the European Community recognized the republics of 
Croatia and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: NATO, the Warsaw Pact and 12 other European  
countries adopted a human rights and security agreement in Vienna, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton paid solemn tribute to victims  
of Stalinist purges and German occupation during a six-hour stop in 
the former Soviet republic of Belarus before continuing on to 
Geneva. Singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson died in Agoura Hills, 
Calif., at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Henry Cisneros' ex-mistress, Linda Medlar Jones,  
pleaded guilty to misleading federal authorities investigating the 
former U.S. housing secretary's payment of alleged hush money to 
her. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman denied allegations that she had 
sold her influence in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Nuclear physicist Edward Teller is 91. The  
Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Cardinal John J. O'Connor, 
is 79. Singer Don Van Vliet (aka ``Captain Beefheart'') is 58. 
Actress Andrea Martin is 52. Actress-singer Charo is 48. Rock 
singer Martha Davis is 48. Actor-director Mario Van Peebles is 42. 
Actor Julian Sands is 41. Singer Lisa Lisa (Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam) 
is 32. Actor Chad Lowe is 31. Actress Regina King is 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Thought for Today: ``I refuse to accept the idea that the  
`is-ness' of man's present nature makes him morally incapable of 
reaching up for the `ought-ness' that forever confronts him.'' -- 
Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968).

<HEADLINE> Senators Free To Talk About Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-five minutes before the Senate  
impeachment trial resumed Thursday, two senators were discussing 
the case on live television. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they were commanded to remain silent inside the chamber  
``on pain of imprisonment,'' Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sam 
Brownback, R-Kan., were free to talk outside the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike jurors in regular court cases -- sometimes closeted in  
hotels to avoid public contact and kept from talking to relatives 
about testimony -- the only guide in making public comments for the 
100 highly political impeachment jurors is their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether somebody makes the decision to curtail any public  
pronouncements, I guess that's an individual decision,'' said Sen. 
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	No policy exists on public statements for either Democrats or  
Republicans. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``is not inclined 
to do a lot of media on the trial,'' his spokesman said, but that 
could change as events unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	Some comments have seemed to cross the line on impartiality,  
such as Sen. Tom Harkin's recent pretrial characterization of the 
House case as ``a pile of dung.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harkin, D-Iowa, stressed that the Constitution does not  
envision the Senate as an anonymous sequestered jury -- one like the 
O.J. Simpson murder panel that couldn't even be shown during those 
famous televised court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the framers of the Constitution had wanted this in a court  
of law, they would have given that power to the federal courts,'' 
Harkin said. ``They gave it to the Senate, understandably, as a 
political procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said they will continue to discuss the case but  
refrain from comments on whether the evidence is swaying their 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the trial starts, I think we'd be better off not to talk  
about the facts in the case,'' Brownback said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House opening statements Thursday, several senators  
walked past reporters gathered outside the chamber. Most smiled or 
nodded but made no comment. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, muttered 
that the House has made a ``very good presentation,'' but that was 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona was scheduled to appear  
on the CNN ``Crossfire'' program, which has a format that 
encourages its guests to make provocative comments. And Republican 
Sen. John Warner of Virginia and Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of 
Connecticut were to appear on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said senators should take great  
care in making pronouncements about the case because they could 
appear to be ``trying to affect public opinion so that it will 
affect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We took an oath last week to do impartial justice,'' Lieberman  
said. ``Part of our responsibility as jurors in an impeachment 
trial is to filter the comments ... particularly off the floor of 
the Senate.''

<HEADLINE> Astros Trade Ausmus, Nitkowski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers got some familiar faces, and  
the Houston Astros got some prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, who depleted their farm system to get Randy Johnson  
and Moises Alou last season, returned catcher Brad Ausmus and 
reliever C.J. Nitkowski to the Detroit Tigers on Thursday in 
exchange for five players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros get pitchers Dean Crow, Mark Persails and Brian  
Powell, catcher Paul Bako and infielder Carlos Villalobos. Ausmus 
and Nitkowski came to the Astros in a 1996 trade with the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps us to replace players we've lost in our system due  
to other trades we have made -- especially the Moises Alou and Randy 
Johnson deals, which were each three-for-one,'' Houston general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	By dealing Ausmus, the Astros could be making room for catching  
prospect Mitch Meluskey, who hit .353 with 41 doubles, 17 home runs 
and 71 RBIs in Triple-A last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone in the Astros organization was happy with the  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about it. I don't think it's a great baseball  
trade,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell told KRIV-TV of Houston. 
``Of course, I don't know anything about the kids we got. Brad 
Ausmus is a proven catcher. I think he did a tremendous job for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what. You make a championship run and a chance to  
go back to the playoffs. It's tough to do it with a rookie catcher. 
It's going to be tough for a rookie catcher to gain the respect of 
his pitching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meluskey and backup Tony Eusebio will compete for the starting  
job when spring training begins next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I see it, we've got two able bodies coming to camp,''  
Hunsicker said. ``The most probable scenario would be we start the 
season with both catchers splitting time and see where we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus, who hit .269 with 45 RBIs last season, played 75 games  
for Detroit in 1996 before being traded to the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus was scheduled to earn $2.5 million this season and $3.5  
million for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a feeling that this might happen,'' Ausmus said. ``I  
could see that the payroll in Houston was getting higher than 
(owner) Drayton McLane wanted. I'd like to think they'll miss me, 
but I don't think losing me will be the difference in their 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nitkowski was 3-3 with a 3.77 ERA and three saves in 43  
appearances with the Astros last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bako became Detroit's primary catcher after an April 29 recall  
from the minors. He started 83 games and hit .272. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow pitched 45 2-3 innings in 29 games last year while  
splitting time between Triple-A and the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell started last season at Double-A and was summoned by the  
Tigers after three months. He finished the season 3-8 with a 6.35 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting, knowing that I wanted this opportunity to play  
in the big leagues,'' Meluskey said. ``It's flattering, too, that 
they think enough of me to give me the chance.''

<HEADLINE> Nagano Olympic Records Are Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Olympic bribery investigation in Salt Lake City  
has Japan fretting. However, don't expect much of an inquiry into 
Nagano's 1998 bid -- the records have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, an official with the Nagano bidding committee told  
Friday's Asahi newspaper that a 90-volume accounting book was 
burned in 1992 because it carried ``secret information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, IOC executive Marc Hodler set off a bribery scandal  
with accusations of vote-buying by Salt Lake bidders for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese were alarmed -- but not too surprised -- to hear  
that Nagano was listed, along with Sydney, Australia; Atlanta; and 
Salt Lake City as an Olympic city with dubious bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Lavish gifts and expensive wining and dining have long been an  
established way of doing business in Japan. And accusations of 
bribery during Nagano's 1989-1991 bidding effort aren't new. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment by geisha, gifts of expensive paintings, not to  
mention the more general entertaining that accompanies Japanese 
hospitality, are said to have been part of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of that has ever been proved, and it probably never can  
be. The accounting book that kept records of the Nagano bidding 
expenses has mysteriously disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	When a group of Nagano residents filed a lawsuit in 1992  
demanding to know how their taxes were spent in winning the games, 
Nagano bidders said the book couldn't be found. The question of who 
lost or destroyed the records was never answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Junichi Yamaguchi, a senior official with the bidding committee,  
was quoted by Friday's Asahi as saying that he had ordered its 
accounting materials burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The books took up too much space and contained information that  
was ``not for the public,'' such as ``who had wined and dined with 
IOC officials and where,'' he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nagano city hall and Olympic organizing committee offices  
were closed Friday for a national holiday and were not immediately 
available for comment on the news report. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada, a member of the bidding committee,  
recently denied any wrongdoing, calling his city's bid a ``clean'' 
effort. Tsukada told The Associated Press he sees ``no need'' to 
investigate Nagano's bid because the bidders gave IOC officials 
only crafts and other Nagano-made trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	Tadashi Arai, an official at the Education Ministry, which  
oversees the Olympics, said the government is ``gathering 
information'' on possible bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although increasingly frowned upon, golfing trips, cash-filled  
envelopes and gourmet restaurants where skimpily clad waitresses 
wear no underwear are facts of life in top Japanese political and 
business circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest suspicion concerns whether Nagano hired a Swiss-based  
agent to buy votes. Hodler has said that agents -- promising to 
secure votes for a fee -- are the key players in the bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada initially denied Nagano ever hired an agent. But a  
report written by the bidding committee when their work was taken 
over by the Nagano Olympic organizers clearly states that Nagano 
hired an agent. The report does not give a name or the amount of 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned by the AP, Tsukada said the agent was hired  
merely to gather information about the IOC and other rival cities. 
He would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee's report says nearly $18 million was spent on  
Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of that went into ``public relations efforts,''  
including entertainment, payment to the agent, air and hotel fees 
for visiting IOC officials and Nagano officials heading to IOC 
meetings abroad, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Where exactly the money went remains a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Masao Ezawa, one of the Nagano residents who filed the suit  
against the Olympics, is so frustrated with Japanese authorities' 
refusal to take him seriously that he is asking the FBI, the U.S. 
Justice Department and the U.S. Olympic Committee to carry out a 
bribery investigation of Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nagano bought the games with Japan money,'' Ezawa said in a  
letter sent to the U.S. organizations on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezawa said by telephone he respected Americans for trying to  
find out about the Salt Lake bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, everyone is all dead set on hiding what happened,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Witness-Boy's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police today arrested a man sought for  
questioning in the killing of an 8-year-old boy who was expected to 
testify against him in a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler was found Wednesday and placed under arrest  
shortly after midnight on a weapons charge, said state police Sgt. 
Scott Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was being held without bond on a charge of possession of  
a stolen firearm and was to be arraigned this morning in Superior 
Court in Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Peeler on Wednesday morning at the home of his  
father, along with the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler had been free on $900,000 bond in a murder case in which  
the boy, Leroy Brown Jr., was exptected to be a key witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not say whether Peeler is a suspect in the killings  
last week of Leroy and his mother, Karen Clarke, who were shot to 
death in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Although police have not said the killings of Leroy and his  
mother are connected to Peeler's case, the slayings have sparked 
widespread outrage about why the boy was not protected as a witness 
in a violent crime case. His mother had turned down special police 
protection after a few days; she said it was too disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have questioned why Peeler was free on bond when Leroy and  
his mother were killed. His lawyer has said he was at home at the 
time the boy was killed, monitored by an electronic bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler is charged in the May 29, 1998, fatal shooting of Rudolph  
Snead Jr. -- Clarke's boyfriend -- and an earlier attempt on his 
life. Leroy identified Peeler as the gunman in a Sept. 2, 1997, 
drive-by shooting in which Snead was slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Connecticut Violent Crime Fugitive Task Force  
also were searching for Peeler's brother, Adrian, who was wanted 
for allegedly escaping from a halfway house, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	During that search, they raided a home owned by Peeler's father  
and is a short distance from the duplex where Clarke and Leroy were 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a weapon had been reported stolen early last year  
from a Milford gun shop, officials told the Connecticut Post.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reassures Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying to restore  
confidence in financial markets after an abrupt devaluation of 
Brazil's currency called into question his strategy for dealing 
with the 18-month-old global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Wednesday he and members of his economic team were  
monitoring the crisis in Brazil closely and had been in contact 
with Brazilian authorities, the International Monetary Fund and 
U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have  
worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward 
with its economic reform plan and succeed, and we certainly hope 
that they will,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America accounts for 20 percent of U.S. export sales.  
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, with the financial crisis threatening to claim Brazil  
as its next victim, the administration convinced the IMF to try a 
new approach -- offering bailout money up front as a way of keeping 
nervous investors from fleeing developing nations rather than 
offering assistance only after a country's economy has been 
leveled. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil became the first test case of that strategy in November  
when the IMF put together a $41.5 billion bailout package, 
including $5 billion from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort bought time, but there has been renewed turmoil in  
Brazil in recent weeks as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ran 
into roadblocks in starting the economic belt-tightening he pledged 
in return for the IMF money. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt resignation of the head of the Brazilian bank and the  
effective devaluation of Brazil's currency by 7.6 percent sent a 
jolt through financial markets Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial 
average lost more than 250 points in the first hour of trading 
before recouping some of those loses to close down 123.48 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists have warned that more turbulence is likely.  
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's test case is looking shaky right now,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute 
think tank. ``The problem is that the Brazilians haven't been able 
to get their act together and that is posing a lot of real dangers 
for the rest of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials, informed by Brazilian authorities of  
their intention to devalue Tuesday night, spent Wednesday on the 
telephone to other rich G-7 nations and developing countries in an 
effort to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said what's needed is  
``implementation of a strong, credible economic program'' by 
Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Papal Web Sites Dispute in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A Web site with information on Pope John Paul  
II's upcoming visit and links to sexually explicit material 
confuses people and infringes on the Archdiocese of St. Louis' 
trademark, Catholic officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a very confusing message to people,'' said Monsignor  
Ted Wojcicki, coordinator of events for the pope's visit here. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court hearing was held Wednesday to determine if the  
site, created by Seattle-based Internet Entertainment Group, should 
be removed permanently from the Internet. The hearing was continued 
to Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	IEG's Web site, called ``Papal Visit 1999,'' included John  
Paul's schedule for the Jan. 26-27 visit, the only known stop in 
the United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also had links to adult entertainment venues in St.  
Louis and a link to IEG's erotic Web site, Clublove. 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese complained that the site infringes on its  
trademark, Papal Visit 1999, and U.S. District Judge Stephen 
Limbaugh ordered the site removed. 
</P>
<P>
	IEG lawyer Leonard Frankel argued for the temporary restraining  
order to be lifted. He said the site includes a disclaimer that 
says the page is not affiliated with the Catholic Church, the 
Vatican or the Archdiocese of St. Louis, which has its own site on 
the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have yet to show any confusion in this case. They have a  
problem with the context of the pages with the adult 
entertainment,'' Frankel said.

<HEADLINE> Text of Jordan Michael Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of Michael Jordan's remarks Wednesday announcing his  
retirement: 
</P>
<P>
	Well, we do this again for the second time. I was telling my  
wife coming down, I felt like I was getting married. I guess the 
first and foremost thing that I want to do and I think everybody 
here, today is not just a day for Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	I think there's a lot of other serious things happening in the  
world. I think I wanted to take time out from my family and 
hopefully from you guys to give condolences to the officer that was 
killed in action who so happened to have his funeral presentation 
today at the same time, which is kind of unfortunate, and I think 
that puts a lot of things in perspective in terms of what life is 
really about. 
</P>
<P>
	My responsibility has been to play the game of basketball and  
relieve some of the pressure of everyday life for people who work 9 
to 5, and I've tried to do that to the best of my abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	I think what's happened with his family and certainly the  
unfortunate circumstances that happened, I'd like to pass on my 
condolences from my family to his, and I'm pretty sure you guys 
mean the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	I am here to announce my retirement from the game of basketball.  
There won't be another announcement to baseball or anything to that 
nature. I think everyone has their own reasons. There's been a lot 
of speculation in terms of why. I'm pretty sure I could to that 
point once you guys get to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	I want to say thank you to both of the gentlemen here. Mr. Stern  
and Mr. Reinsdorf for presenting me with the opportunity to play 
the game of basketball and certainly giving me the opportunity to 
come to Chicago and meet my beautiful wife and build a family here 
and my family in North Carolina and a lot of my friends who came up 
here to support this day and who supported me once I stepped on the 
basketball court and even when I didn't play on the basketball 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	I want to say thanks to both those gentlemen and to all the fans  
in Chicago for allowing me to come here and they've adapted me to 
be one of theirs, and in response I've tried to step on the 
basketball court and get rid of the gangster mentality that Chicago 
was known for for a long time. I think successfully, myself and my 
teammates and the whole organization has made an effort to change 
the perspective about Chicago. And we're hopefully going to be 
known as a championship city. 
</P>
<P>
	I hope it continues on even when Michael Jordan is not in  
uniform. I will support the Chicago Bulls. I think the game itself 
is a lot bigger than Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	I've been given an opportunity by people before me. To name a  
few: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dr. J, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, these 
guys played the game way before Michael Jordan was born. And 
Michael Jordan came on the heels of all that activity. And Mr. 
Stern and what he's done for the league and gave me the opportunity 
to play the game of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	I played it to the best that I could play it. I tried to enhance  
the game itself. I've tried to be the best basketball player I 
could be. And next thing you know, here we are as a league. I think 
the league is going to continue on although we've had our troubles 
over the last six months. I think that's a reality check for all of 
us. It is a business but yet it's still fun, it's still a game and 
the game will continue on. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, I've had a great time. And I can't say enough for  
the people who've supported me and my life will take a change. And 
a lot of people say, 'Well, Michael Jordan doesn't have any 
challenges away from the game of basketball.' Well, I dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a parent is very challenging. If you have kids you know  
that. I welcome that challenge and I look forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
	I will live vicariously through my kids as they play the game of  
basketball. If they don't, I will support that. My wife and I will 
do the same. We will do what we can as parents to make sure that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the challenge that I have in front of me and I look  
forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, my mother my family, my brothers and sisters  
could not be here. But as you see me you see them. 
</P>
<P>
	My father, my mother, and certainly my brothers and sisters, so  
they are here through me. They along with myself say thank you for 
taking me in and showing me the respect and certainly the gratitude 
that you have shown me over the years that I have been here. 
</P>
<P>
	I will be in Chicago for my career hopefully and for the rest of  
my life. My wife won't allow me to move nowhere else. So I will be 
in Chicago and I will support the Chicago teams. And that's all I 
really truly have to say. I thought of saying just two words: ``I'm 
gone.'' But I figured I owe the fans and certainly the media a 
little bit more than that. So tht's one of my reasons for being 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	I guess Jerry wants to speak first before David. I pass it over  
to Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
	 *JERRY REINSDORF   	
</P>
<P>
	Well this a day that I think I hoped would never come. It has to  
be the toughest day in the history of the Chicago Bulls. It's a 
tough day for Chicago, it's a tough day for the NBA, it's a tough 
day for basketball fans all over the world and for Michael Jordan 
fans all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing here in the United Center where Michael Jordan has  
given us so many wonderful moments, performances and championships 
it's hard to imaging games being played here without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael is simply the best player who ever put on a basketball  
uniform. He has defined the Bulls, the city and the NBA for more 
than a decade. He will always represent a standard of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	His statue out in front of the building will greet everybody who  
ever enters this building again. 
</P>
<P>
	When Michael retired in 1993, we retired his No. 23 and hung it  
in a position of prominence from the rafters. When Michael came 
back from baseball, he asked me to take it down. He felt funny 
about playing when his number was hanging up above and so we took 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Michael, we are returning your No. 23 to its rightful  
place of honor, where it will forever serve as a reminder of your 
dominance on this court and your dominance of this game. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, Michael, the White Sox might retire 45.  
</P>
<P>
	And to my leader David Stern, the truth is that for what  
Michael's meant to the NBA, this number could very well be retired 
in every arena. Certainly, we in Chicago think that anybody who 
wears No. 23 with a basketball uniform would look like a pretender. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Michael, I have one thing to present to you. For the  
last season, for the last game, for the last shot, I would like to 
present to you the 1998 world championship Ring, which certainly 
means a lot to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Michael, thank you very much for what you have meant to all  
of the world, there'll never be another one like you. 

</P>
<P>
	 *DAVID STERN   	
</P>
<P>
	Michael, I get to say thank you for 29 teams and hundreds of  
millions of fans around the world. Thank you for what you've meant 
to our game, thank you for being who you were, not only for your 
leadership and greatness on the court, but for who you were and 
will continue to be off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Your contributions to the NBA are immeasurable, despite the fact  
that every newspaper in the country has an insert to detail those 
today and every network has a series of programs to do it. I don't 
think they could ever capture all that you've meant to us. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you for gracing our court for 13 seasons, and I disagree  
with Jerry. This is not a sad day. This is a great day, because the 
greatest basketball player in the history of the game is getting 
the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his play. 
</P>
<P>
	So to you and to Juanita and to the challenge that you define of  
parenthood, I wish you nothing but continued success and hope that 
you continue to have the good health that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Michael when did you decide to retire and why did you  
wait until today to announce it? 
</P>
<P>
	ANSWER: Maybe I'm not supposed to answer that question.  
Actually, I talked to Jerry last year once the season ended. I told 
Jerry at that time that mentally I was a little exhausted, I didn't 
know if I would play next year. I wanted to put him on awareness so 
that he could possibly prepare going to next season. And Jerry, 
once we had our conversation, wanted me to take time as I did in 
'93, to make sure it was the right decision because it was going to 
be a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And he encouraged me to wait until the time came to where I made  
that announcement. In the middle of that process, with the lockout, 
I wanted to support the players. I wanted to be there and voice 
some of the opinions of some of the players and give my input 
because I felt that as an obligation to the players of tomorrow, 
just as the players before me have stood up and supported the 
collective bargaining agreement for me to utilize in my 
negotiations. I felt obligated to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when the lockout ended, I felt it was appropriate to at this  
particular time to announce my retirement so that it could give the 
Bulls an opportunity to do what they had to do to in terms of 
getting their future on, and utilizing the financial gains of my 
contract being renounced or terminated, to where they can rebuild 
or build another structure amongst the team. So that's one of the 
reasons I waited until this point. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A. Very similar. Mentally, I am exhausted. I don't feel I have  
the challenge. Physically, I feel great. The last time, in '93, I 
had other agendas. I knew wanted to play baseball. I felt that at 
my age, it was a good opportunity and time to do it. With the death 
of my father, I was basically trying to deal with that. This time, 
I'm at peace with a lot of those things. I know from a career 
standpoint I've accomplished everything I could as an individual. 
Right now, I don't have the mental challenges that I've had in the 
past to proceed as a basketball player. Sure I'm pretty sure people 
say, well, there's a lot of different challenges that could evolve. 
And for me to start something and then in the middle of the season 
lose interest, and lose my motivation, it's unfair to the people 
that I'm working with and working for, and to the fans. So I 
alleviated that opportunity by saying this is a perfect time for me 
to walk away from the game and I'm at peace with that. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, we've had some problems in the collective  
bargaining agreement but I think those situations have been solved 
and we have to get past them. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A. I don't know if you guys have heard that question. I can  
restate it. The question was, although the differences between 
management and myself apparently was not the same, and did that 
have any impact on my decision. Plus, if Phil Jackson had been the 
coach, would I have played on. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big ``if.'' I retired the first time when Phil Jackson  
was the coach. I think that even with Phil the coach, I would have 
had a tough time mentally finding the challenge for myself, 
although he could somehow present challenges for me. I don't know 
if he could have presented a challenge for me to continue on with 
this season -- even though midway in the season I wanted to continue 
to play a couple more years. But at the end of the season, I was 
mentally, mentally drained and tired. So I can't really say that he 
would have restored that. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of my disagreements with management about some of the  
decision-making, that's always been my opinions. It hasn't been 
ultimatums or twisting the arms. The good thing about all of this, 
the good thing about any team, you may have disagreements but that 
doesn't mean the focus is not there in terms of trying to achieve 
what you're trying to achieve. Management may take a different 
approach in terms of rebuilding or whatever. And that's their 
prerogative. I would never, never say that that's wrong. That's 
their prerogative to make that statement or make that notion to do 
that. And I'd support them even though I'm not playing. But the 
matter of difference of opinion I don't think would have changed my 
mind in terms of my retirement at this stage of going into next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A. It was difficult, because you're giving up something that you  
truly, truly love. My love for the game is very strong. It's hard 
to give up that love. For the sake of the mental challenges that 
Michael Jordan needs to drive himself to be the best basketball 
player that he can be, I don't want to fool myself going into a 
situation knowing that I'm not 100 percent challenged mentally. 
Physically I feel fine, with the unfortunate thing with my finger. 
But other than that, I'm fine. But mentally, I just felt like I 
didn't have the challenges in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Michael, I guess the question a lot of people around town  
want to know is what do you see next for the Bulls? How do you see 
them competing this year and do you think that they could possibly 
carry on the legacy that you established of being one of the 
premier, the elite teams in the league? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, I think it presents a challenge for them. To live up to  
the standards that we have brought here in the city of Chicago, and 
I think it's part of the challenge for Jerry Krause and Jerry 
Reinsdorf and Tim Floyd to maintain that, and I think they welcome 
that challenge, and that's good, and it depends on how they take 
that in action. I can't -- I don't know what decisions they're going 
to make in terms of free agency or I'd like to see them keep 
Scottie Pippen around and give him the just due that he's very 
deserving, but that's just my opinion once again. But we set high 
standards here and the pressure's on them to maintain that. Now how 
long will that last? Will it be next year? I think that's hard for 
me to say, but I'm pretty sure they've got to live with that as 
they move further, and I'm pretty sure they want that, they want to 
live up to the standards and that's a part of the challenge and I 
support that. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael. Two questions. The first one, I want you to tell me  
whether the second ``threepeat'' was more precious than the first, 
and the second question is, are you leaving with absolutely no more 
desire to play? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Lacy, you're great. I like you, Lacy. The second  
``threepeat'' by far is the one that you have to cherish the most 
because it's the hardest, I thought it was hard to achieve. 
Especially when the team was dismantled to some degree and then 
brought back with different talent, players from programs that 
never really experienced the expectations that we had the 
experience with here in Chicago, and I thought it was harder. We 
overcame that. We won three in a row. So, I would say that's better 
than the first three. Now which team is better, I would think the 
first team is the better of the second team that won three in a 
row. But it was definitely the harder to win the second three in a 
row than the first three. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of desire, desire's always going to be there. If the  
desire is not there, the love was never there. But I have to make a 
judgment in terms of the desire all the time I step on the 
basketball court, not one-fourth of the time but every time I step 
on the basketball court and I can't honestly say that's going to be 
there every time I step into this building for 82 games or a 
hundred and some games that we play in the course of a year. And 
I've always been sure about that. And now I'm unsure about that, 
and so with that doubt I choose to make my own decisions about 
retirement. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, is this a true story? That you came back, one reason  
that you came back was because your son, Jeffery, told you that 
Shaquille O'Neal was the greatest basketball player? And if it is 
true, if you have another child, might you come back again? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No, that's not true but my middle kid loves Dennis Rodman and  
he wants red hair. I don't think that's going to drive me back. But 
that is not a true statement and I'm not against my kids analyzing 
other people 'cause that means they see as their father and they 
really don't see me as a basketball player and that means my wife 
and I are doing our jobs in terms of being the great parent that we 
have to be. So, if they see other players as being like their 
idols, I don't have a problem with that. Just no red hair in my 
household. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, which you were more proud of, your athletic skills  
or the mental skills that you brought to the game, and which was 
more difficult to keep up? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, I came in here with the physical skills. To some degree  
I was born with the appetite to enhance it as I got older and as I 
played the game, but the mental skill came with the education of 
the game that I learned either from Coach Smith before I got here 
or I learned in the course of the coaching staffs that I have been 
endeared with, Tex Winter probably being the most, because he was 
probably the one that would criticize my game more than anybody. To 
me that's a plus, that's a driving force for me. The mental part is 
hard because you have to really learn, taking everything that 
you've learned over a period of time, and apply that to your game 
and tie that into the physical aspect of your game and make the 
complete basketball player that you try to become. So physically, 
it's a little bit easier, but the mental part is the hardest part, 
and I think that's the part that separates the good players from 
the great players.

<P>
	Q: Michael, is there any chance whatsoever that you'll change  
your mind somewhere down the road and return? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No. I never say never, but 95 -- 99.9 percent, I'm very secure  
with my decision. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, we heard Jerry Reinsdorf say this is a sad day, we  
heard David Stern say it is a happy day. What are you thinking? 
What kind of emotions do you have as you make this announcement? 
Are you mixed about it, have you been overcome yet? What's going on 
inside? 
</P>
<P>
	A: It's tough. I'm doing a good job of trying to hold back the  
emotions, because it's like taking away something that I truly have 
loved the for last, I started when I was 12 years old, I'm 36 next 
month, so 24 years I've been playing the game, and it's part of 
both. It's sad that I have to -- that I'm leaving the game, but it's 
happy because my life is starting to go into a whole other stage. 
Basketball for me was the first stage, it got me to this point in 
my life. I knew it had to end. My life takes on a different stage 
now and it's a different challenge, and I welcome that and I knew 
it was coming so I'm happy that it's gotten to this point and I'm 
happy that you guys didn't run me out of the game. I chose to walk 
away knowing that I can still play the game, and that's what I've 
always wished for my career to end -- that's exactly the way I 
wanted to end it. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: (Unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A: I think the next step is -- It's a lot of different  
components. I enjoy taking my kids to school, which I did that this 
morning. I normally enjoy picking my kids up from school, which I 
look forward to doing. And watching my kids play. My wife and I 
have a fun time watching our kids play one-on-one, which is very 
entertaining. So those are things that seem so simple in a lot of 
people's lives and never really been enjoyed by me because of my 
schedule and because of the things that I've done over the last 14 
years, and now I get to dissect some of those simple things to 
enjoy and I look forward to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure there's a lot of business opportunities there and that  
won't consume me, but that certainly will take away some of the 
competitive juices that will be left over from not playing 
basketball. For the most part, I'm just going to enjoy life and do 
some of the things that I've never done before. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, two questions, like Lacy. Is there a record that you  
wish you could get that you can't get now that you're not playing? 
And two, are you worried about the spirit of the young players in 
the game? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No, there's not a record that I didn't get that I would have  
loved to have gotten. I mean, I'm pretty sure people would say that 
I'd like to score the most points in the history of the game. I'd 
rather give up that to get six titles. So, there's compensation 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of the youth of the game, we really have to be very  
patient with them and apply more guidance to them to still enjoy 
the game and play the game with a lot of energy. The unfortunate 
thing either myself or some of the other players before me has 
brought more to focus is the financial aspect of the game. I think 
that's going to have to dissipate a little bit and get more back to 
the love of the game. The love of the game is what you do on the 
basketball court. And I'm pretty sure that David wants that to 
happen, I'm pretty sure every owner wants that to happen. But no 
matter what happens in this business of basketball, if you didn't 
get paid a dime, you still would play the game of basketball 
somewhere, and that love has to be illustrated in the way that you 
play the game and the way that you carry yourself on and off the 
court and I think that's something that we all as athletes -- not 
just professional basketball players, but all professional athletes 
-- have to take into account when they're stepping out in the 
public's eye. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, you've had so many thrills in your career. You've  
provided so many highlights and thrills for everyone. From college 
all the way to that last shot against the Jazz in Game 6 last June, 
could you perhaps point out one or two of them that really stick 
out in your mind, that just stands above the rest? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, my first shot. First and last shot, those are the two  
that you just can't erase because it started and ended my career, 
to some degree. The year we got past the Pistons, because that was 
getting over the hump and we got to the hump but we never really 
could get over the hump. I think the year that we beat Cleveland 
where no one thought that we could beat Cleveland. I think that 
gave the city or got the city behind the Chicago Bulls, that if you 
put your mind to something you can accomplish what you believe in, 
and a lot of people didn't give us a chance. But we went out and we 
beat Cleveland, and I think that showed to the public here in 
Chicago that either you're with us or you're not, we got to make a 
change here in the Chicago Bulls' organization and we've got to do 
it with the belief starting within and then hopefully extending 
outside of that, and I think that was a major step and it ended our 
whole thought process. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: (Unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A: Not right now. I can't say. I would never say never, but I  
want to get away from basketball a little bit and look at it from 
afar. If the interest evolves somewhere down the road, that's fine, 
I wouldn't mind that. But right now, the only coaching I can do is 
at home and I'm having a tough time doing that. But it's -- I'd 
rather get away from the game a little bit. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, you said you'd only play for Phil Jackson.  
Hypothetically, if Phil Jackson ended up somewhere else, let's say, 
Madison Square Garden, would you ever play for Phil again? 
</P>
<P>
	A: That's not even envisioned in my mind right now, and so I  
don't think that's going to happen. I'm pretty sure that's not 
going to happen. If Phil ends up in New York, I'm happy for Phil. 
And although I love New York, I can't see myself coming out of 
retirement and playing in New York. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: (Unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A: No, but it kind of looked that way. Up to that point, all of  
my shots were short because I was getting tired and I guess the 
lessons that you learn over the years is stick with that shot a 
little longer make sure you get that extra little bit. And that was 
my thinking, was to make sure that I extend and do the necessary 
fundamentals to get the ball to the basket. It turned out to look 
as if I was posing for all the photographers, but that was not the 
case. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: (Unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A: The most unfortunate thing, it was an accident, trying to cut  
a cigar, and I severed a tendon, which I have to have surgery on in 
the next couple of weeks. Hopefully, it doesn't alter my golf game, 
but my decision was made before this happened, and if -- from what 
doctors have told me that even if I chose to play, I wouldn't be 
able to play for two months. But that never had any factors in 
terms of my decision. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: You've been able to transcend geographical, racial, social  
barriers. With your stature and respect, do you go into seclusion 
now or do you try to maybe solve some of the world's problems? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, too big nose, I don't think I can go into seclusion and  
certainly I can't solve the world's problems. There's a lot of 
problems out there, there's a lot of things I can lend my support 
to, and I will do that. Seclusion is, to me, will back away from 
the public eye to some degree. I still have obligation with 
endorsements that will require me to be in the public's forefront 
for a little while, but -- so hopefully I will be on a minor scale 
in terms of I will still be doing commercials that's simple, but I 
can't save the world by no means. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, as someone who's created motivation for himself in a  
lot of different instances, do you look at all the people 
surrounding you telling you that you couldn't give the game up as I 
don't know, maybe some motivation to give it up? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No. I just heard people saying that they didn't know Michael  
Jordan. It's mostly speculation and I tried not to let that 
influence my decision in terms of what I know what's best for 
Michael Jordan and conversations with my wife and my friends and I 
once I get feedback from them, I make my own decision. Not based on 
what I read or what I hear. Those are a lot of speculation that was 
totally untrue. I'm pretty sure people had a chance to read it an 
enjoy it, but it didn't influence my decision by no means. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Michael, last time you used the terminology ``Not slamming  
the door shut.'' You're not using it this time either with the 
``99.9.'' Does that mean you're still not slamming it shut? Also, 
now that you've got your ring, will you still show up the night of 
the ring ceremony here? 
</P>
<P>
	A. That's what I asked Jerry, if there was going to be a ring  
ceremony night. I'd love to still come and support the rest of the 
players and see some of the players that may not be here. So I look 
forward to doing that if that happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine-point nine'' is as you read it. It's not really  
100 percent, but it's close. So, that's where I stand. I'm not 
going to say, ``Never, never.'' Say ``99.9'' and you take for what 
it's worth. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A. There's never going to be another Michael Jordan. There's  
never going to be another Dr. J. I knew that. There's never going 
to be another Elgin Baylor. I knew that. So the kids of tomorrow, 
there's never going to be another Michael Jordan. You can be a 
Grant HIll, you can be Anfernee Hardaway, you can be Kobe Bryant 
but Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan. And you may pick bits and 
pieces of his game or his personality, and somehow correlate it to 
yours, but either way you have to evolve to be the person that you 
are. Sure, you're going to use comparisons as your standard of 
measurement, yes, it happens. But it's different circumstances that 
you have to deal with in each era. 
</P>
<P>
	I didn't have the same things facing me as Dr. J had in his era.  
And I'm pretty sure Kobe and some of the guys who're coming behind 
me is not going to have the same, so they have to evolve to be the 
players that they are and they're going to be, with maybe my 
influences and other influences, but you're right. There's not 
going to be another Michael Jordan and I wouldn't advise the other 
guys to try to be that or do that. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: You've talked so much about all the positives and everything  
regarding your career. During your career, what were the most 
difficult things for you to go through? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Losing, early on. And I guess the part of losing that you had  
to change your game to, to the criticisms that you were receiving. 
``Michael Jordan doesn't make his basketball players around him 
better.'' There was some truth to that because I didn't really know 
how and I had to learn to do that. So that was a challenge. But it 
was negative toward Michael Jordan and I used that negative as a 
positive. There was a lot of negative things that happened to me in 
my life, within the game of basketball and outside basketball. But 
I've always been able to take that negative and turn it into a 
positive, as a learning experience, but yet move forward from it. I 
wouldn't change anything. I wouldn't change any of the lessons that 
I've learned from the negative and the positive, because I think 
they've helped me evolve to be the person that I am. But it was a 
lot of negative things that enhanced me as a person and as a 
player. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, did you anticipate the lockout taking this long and  
did you think the agreement was fair? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I didn't anticipate it being this long. I think the players  
were willing to sit out for the best deal that they felt was fair, 
and I'm in favor of what the majority says. If the players and 
everyone feel this is a fair deal, I'm happy. I always felt, and I 
said it even before, in the last collective bargaining agreement, I 
could be pleased under any collective bargaining agreement, but the 
majority has to be pleased with the collective bargaining 
agreement, and it's very evident that they were. Patrick Ewing and 
the whole negotiating team, as well as myself when I tried to 
contribute, we were fighting for the best deal that the majority 
would accept. And the majority accept it. In terms of fairness, 
we'll see. We'll see how things happen, some of the awareness of 
some of the things that the owners wanted to address is addressed, 
but yet the players felt the sticking points are still addressed 
and it turns out to be a fair deal for the game, I'm happy with 
that. That's all I ever wanted, from both sides. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, it's going to be difficult for the Bulls to get back  
to where it was with you not being there. At some point in the 
future, could you see yourself reconciling yourself as to being 
part of the club as far as helping them out marketing or helping to 
rebuild this club at any point in the future? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I'm not against that. I think -- but the best way to survive  
without Michael Jordan is to somehow start to live without him, in 
some respects. But I'm always going to support the Chicago Bulls 
because it's given me a great joy to be a part of the organization. 
But life without Michael Jordan somehow has to be and sometimes has 
to be without Michael Jordan's input. But I will, if need be, if 
they need my support in anything, I will certainly consider that 
and lend my two cents to it. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Michael, I would assume that you would say the sacrifices  
that you had to go through in terms of everything, sacrifices of 
privacy and things like that, were worth it on some level because 
of the success you've had. But are there any things that you had to 
give up that bother you or do you have resentment toward, and also 
what do you think the future life will be in terms of public versus 
private? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Well, I mean, it's a lot of things about my lifestyle that I  
truly don't like, but I've come to accept because I've stepped into 
the form that I have to deal with it. So much speculation about 
things that are totally untrue, but you have to deal with it and 
you have to let it roll off the back and deal with it, and you 
learn not to bring it too much to focus because it's not worth the 
headache. But hopefully that will subside some as I step away from 
the spotlight. It may not, but I have to deal with it in whatever 
respects and that's the only unfortunate things a celebrity has to 
deal with is the speculations and some of the untrue things that 
have been printed about them. It's unfair but it's a part of the 
whole picture I guess, to some degree. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	A. I like that, Bill, because I've talked to Patrick, I've  
talked to Charles, I've talked to Karl, I've talked to all of them. 
I'm pretty sure they feel the same. They all wanted me to come back 
just so if they win a championship, they can say they've gone 
through Chicago and Michael Jordan to win it to give it the meaning 
of taking the title away from Chicago. And that's the good thing 
about it, that they won't ever have the chance to say that. That's 
why I was so glad that Magic played and Bird played when I won my 
titles, because I had to go through, to some degree, Boston and 
L.A. Patrick, I don't know, he won't be able to live with himself -- 
he can't beat Michael Jordan in a series. Charles Barkley, I told 
him he would never win because he doesn't dedicate himself to win. 
All of them joked with me and hated to see the possibility of me 
retiring just because they didn't have an opportunity to beat me in 
the finals or get past me. That is the cute thing about retiring. 
And I will always hold that in high respect when I see these guys 
socially. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. Juanita, what are your feelings about the retirement. How is  
this going to change your life? 
</P>
<P>
	JUANITA JORDAN: Actually my life won't change at all. I see  
Michael doing more carpooling. That's about it. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. (unintelligible)  
</P>
<P>
	MICHAEL JORDAN: None. Phil and I, we talked all season long  
about what the possibilities may be at the end of the season. Once 
he made his decision, he didn't want his decision to influence 
mine. And I said it wouldn't. And I didn't want my decision to 
influence you. Sure I'm saying that I would rather play for Phil 
Jackson if he's here, but that's just my opinion. That doesn't tell 
me -- that shouldn't have you make the best decision suited for Phil 
Jackson because that, first and foremost to me is to make sure 
you're happy. And he didn't have any influence in terms of -- he 
didn't know, I haven't even talked to Phil since somewhere midway 
in the summer. And if the season would have started in October, I'm 
pretty sure I would have made the same decision. I don't think that 
changed by doing it now. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. Michael, one last time for the record. Why do you have to  
walk out of here with that 1 percent in your pocket? 
</P>
<P>
	A. Because it's my 1 percent and not yours. That's why.  

</P>
<P>
	Q. Michael, you used to consult with your father throughout your  
life about so many important decisions. If he were here today, what 
type of advice do you think he would have given you about making 
this choice? 
</P>
<P>
	A. I think it wouldn't have been any different than what I've  
said. What you see from me is what you see from -- he would've done 
the same thing. He probably would've love to answer the questions 
before I would have answered the questions. He would've probably 
told me this is the perfect time. The writing is on the wall. Take 
it, and walk away with your head held high. Enjoy your kids and 
move on. Nothing different from what I'm doing. My second father, 
Gus, said the same thing. Wherever Gus is, he's been saying the 
same thing for a while. I guess he just liked to get out of Chicago 
for the warm weather. It's no different from what's happened. My 
father basically would've given me the same advice, and my mother 
basically did. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. Michael, thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	A. Thank you. Thank you, Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates on Delaware Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating Thursday  
whether a prominent attorney who admitted dumping his mistress' 
body at sea and lying about her death also killed the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in the Thomas Capano case were sequestered in a hotel  
because the icy weather closed down the courthouse. The judge said 
that if jurors reach a verdict, they must wait until Friday to 
deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Capano, 49, murdered Anne Marie Fahey on June  
27, 1996, because she wanted to end their secret, three-year 
affair. But they have no body, no murder weapon and no eyewitness. 
They presented a mountain of circumstantial evidence to try to 
prove Capano planned to murder the governor's scheduling secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, a former state prosecutor from a wealthy family, long  
insisted he didn't know what became of Ms. Fahey, 30, after they 
dined together at a Philadelphia restaurant -- the last time she was 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month during his trial, Capano acknowledged lying about  
Ms. Fahey's death, cramming her body into a cooler and dumping it 
at sea from his brother's boat. He told jurors he did so to protect 
another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, who he said accidentally shot 
Ms. Fahey in a jealous, suicidal rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre, Capano's lover for 18 years, denies the  
accusation.

<HEADLINE> London Shares Close Lower / British Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After rising for most of Thursday, share prices on  
the London Stock Exchange tumbled to close 29.9 points, or 0.5 
percent, lower at 5,820.2. Traders cited the plunge of the Dow 
Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index  
rose as much as 87.7 points before giving up its gains. Provisional 
volume was 1.235 billion shares, up from 1.104 billion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the index to recover Thursday, following  
its 3.1 percent slump Wednesday on Brazil's decision to widen the 
band in which its currency trades against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recovery attempt was undercut by the falling Dow, which  
was down about 130 points at late morning when British markets 
closed and wound up the day down 228.63, or by 2.4 percent, at 
9,120.93.

<HEADLINE> USDA Makes Organic Meat Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move long awaited by organic foods  
advocates, the Agriculture Department agreed Thursday to allow 
organic labels on naturally produced meat and poultry products. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be in place while USDA develops national  
standards for all organic foods, said Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic certification generally means no pesticides, herbicides  
or preservatives are sprayed on organically grown fruits and 
vegetables. For livestock, organic producers shun the use of 
antibiotics and confined feeding areas, opting instead to give 
organic animals access to the out-of-doors, fresh air and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement means more information and more choice for  
American consumers,'' Glickman said. ``It will help organic family 
farmers and ranchers further expand their already growing 
markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade  
Association, called the decision ``a victory for the organic 
industry and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on this issue for about eight years,''  
DiMatteo said. ``I think people have an interest in having choices 
in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMatteo said consumers could see the first organic meat,  
poultry and egg products in stores by early spring. Certified 
organic meat processors will have to apply to USDA for label 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally grown fruits, vegetables and other products have been  
allowed to carry the organic label for some time but USDA 
prohibited the label for meat, which is more strictly regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the disparity and respond to a growing organic  
industry, USDA is developing national standards to cover the entire 
organic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman chose to allow meat labels in the interim, partly  
because development of national standards is taking longer than 
expected, officials said. Aides said he also thought the rule would 
boost organic farmers, who tend to be smaller family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The development of national standards has drawn thousands of  
comments. Glickman last May agreed that items that have been 
irradiated, genetically engineered or grown in sewage-sludge 
fertilizer would not carry the organic label after getting a record 
200,000 letters, faxes and e-mails from concerned consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive response, supporters say, is proof that the organic  
industry is growing, as more and more consumers become worried 
about the health effects of pesticides and other chemicals in food 
-- and about the Earth's ability to sustain conventional farming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organic Trade Association estimates that the organic  
industry is growing at least 20 percent each year, with overall 
sales of about $4.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Time Works Two Ways for the Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday's NFC  
championship game is about time. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, it's the first time in their 33-year history that  
the Falcons have gone this far in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, if the Falcons want to reach their first Super  
Bowl, they'll have to control the clock Sunday against the 
Minnesota Vikings, who set an NFL scoring record with 556 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will help our defense the most,'' says Falcons coach Dan  
Reeves, ``will be our offensive team keeping our defense off the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key to that will be Jamal Anderson, who set an NFL record  
with 410 carries this season and gained 1,846 yards, the ninth best 
single-season mark in league history. That helped the Falcons lead 
the NFL in time of possession with an average of 33 minutes, 10 
seconds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings, of course, know that. But Anderson thrives on  
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor when the other team tries to shut me down,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's a negative, too -- the crowd noise in the Metrodome,  
augmented by recorded booms and horns, that prevents visiting teams 
from hearing signals. The result is illegal procedure and delay of 
game penalties that can negate good running back -- second-and-11 or 
third-and-8 are not conducive to handing off. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it almost has to work for the Falcons against a team that  
was 15-1, scored on more than half its possessions and averaged 
nearly 35 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons figure that if they can hold Minnesota to seven  
possessions instead of 10, the averages are in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta, which had a 14-2 record and beat San Francisco last  
week, has a problem even if it can control the ball -- the Vikings 
actually held the ball four fewer seconds per game than their 
opponents this season: 29:58 to 30:02. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need 15-play drives,'' says Randy Moss, the rookie  
wide receiver who's one of the reasons the Minnesota offense is so 
potent. ``We can get it down the field almost as quickly as we 
want. If they stop one part of our game, we go to the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also know Minnesota can control the ball if needed.  
In last week's playoff game with Arizona, the Vikings held the ball 
for all but 54 seconds of the first period, sandwiching two long 
drives around a three-and-out by the Cardinals that was caused by -- 
what else -- a false start penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they put an awful lot of pressure on the other team's  
offense,'' Reeves says. ``You've got the crowd noise against you 
and everything. Our concentration and everything has to be greater. 
But if we take care of the football, make them earn what they get, 
I think it should be a great football game. You're talking about 
two teams that have earned the right to play in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves has complained to the NFL about the noise, but while the  
league says there may be minor alterations, there's still sure to 
be a din when Atlanta has the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Falcons, who have been piping in all sorts of noise at  
practice this week, are learning to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's impossible,'' Reeves says. ``We can't do anything  
about the Minnesota Vikings. We have to worry about ourselves and 
only ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Targets $520M in Banana Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States presented the World Trade  
Organization with a hit list Thursday of $520 million in European 
imports targeted for punitive tariffs in a bitter trade fight 
involving bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the $520  
million represents the administration's estimate of the amount of 
harm being done annually to U.S.-based banana companies in terms of 
lost sales in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	While fancy French handbags and expensive cashmere sweaters are  
on the list, they don't fall in the biggest price categories. The 
top category is plastic packing material, which the administration 
valued at $88 million in European imports annually. Sweet biscuits 
and pastries were in second place at $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric batteries ranked third at $34 million, followed by hand  
bags at $33 million and coffee makers at $29 million. European pork 
imports, which were added to the target list late at the request of 
American pork producers seeking government help for falling world 
prices, total $13 million, according to the administration's 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	All $520 million in European goods will be subject to punitive  
tariffs of 100 percent, effectively doubling their price, by March 
3, unless the two sides reach an agreement before then. 
</P>
<P>
	With its formal notification of the tariffs, the administration  
requested through the WTO that both sides make another attempt to 
resolve the dispute through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky characterized the request as ``another attempt to try  
to work this out while there is still time to do so.'' The WTO 
previously ruled that Europe's banana import restrictions were a 
violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Peter Scher said that the  
higher tariffs will go into effect within a matter of weeks, 
possibly as soon as Feb. 1 but no later than March 3, if there is 
no settlement by then. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. announcement puts the matter on the agenda of the WTO's  
Dispute Settlement Body for its Jan. 25 meeting. The WTO also has 
before it a separate EU request that it rule on whether the changes 
it made to its banana import policy on Jan. 1 satisfy the 
objections to the previous rules. The United States has called the 
new import rules cosmetic changes that still discriminate against 
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The American companies involved, Chiquita Brands International  
Inc. and Dole Food Co., contend that the European import 
restrictions are costing them millions of dollars in lost sales in 
the European market. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement of support, an American farm coalition led by the  
American Farm Bureau Federation said the administration's tough 
response was ``necessary to force the EU to comply with laws it has 
been evading for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said the products targeted for punitive tariffs were  
selected in an effort to maximize the pressure on European nations 
backing the banana rules while minimizing the impact on American 
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-House Member Wants Bush for GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two decades ago, as a freshman member of the  
House, Gerald B.H. Solomon tried to get his Republican colleagues 
to support Ronald Reagan for president over GOP primary opponent 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, who recently retired from the House and is now a  
lobbyist, again is getting involved in presidential politics -- this 
time for Bush's son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. While the governor 
has yet to disclose his presidential intentions for 2000, Solomon 
is trying to enlist his former colleagues in a Draft Bush movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the most electable and one I think is almost guaranteed  
to be elected,'' Solomon said. ``He is a conservative with 
compassion. That's what Ronald Reagan was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon said some lawmakers have already signed on, but he would  
not disclose any names. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is expected to make a decision on a presidential run in the  
spring.

	Clinton Trial Arguments Open  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a jury of 100 senators, House  
prosecutors today alleged that President Clinton ``piled perjury 
upon perjury'' and obstructed justice to conceal his sexual affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. They demanded his removal from office. Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and 
one of 13 house managers prosecuting the case, said Clinton's oath 
of office -- and his alleged violation of it -- was at the heart of 
the case against him. Clinton has admitted to an improper 
relationship, but he and his lawyers maintain that the charges, 
even if proven, do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. 
The White House will present its case next week.

	Stocks Plunge; Dow Ends Down 228.63  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were pummelled for the second day in a  
row, as deepening economic worries in Brazil caused concerns that 
profits of U.S. multinational companies operating there could 
suffer. Brazil itself takes up only 2 percent of U.S. exports, but 
it is the biggest and most important economy in Latin America, 
which accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports. The Dow industrials 
ended down 228.63 at 9,120.93, its lowest point in the session. On 
the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,166-901. The Nasdaq fell 39.92 to 
2,276.89. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Backs Business Incentives  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton wants the government to offer  
financial incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Wall 
Street firms and small businesses to resurrect the economies of 
underserved rural and urban areas. The president left Washington 
today -- as his impeachment trial began -- and headed to New York. He 
is to announce his economic proposals tomorrow at a conference 
organized by the Wall Street Project, an initiative of Jesse 
Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition that aims to expand business 
opportunities for minorities and women. Jackson particularly wants 
to see agencies created that offer the same kinds of incentives the 
government now offers U.S. businesses going overseas.

	Panel Urges Vets' Program Overhaul  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan panel urged broad expansion of  
military and veterans benefits, including a new GI Bill promising 
full college scholarships in exchange for four years of active 
duty. In all, the panel recommended 100 changes, representing the 
biggest projected overhaul in benefits since the 1950s. Anthony J. 
Prinicipi, chairman of the Commission on Servicemembers and 
Veterans Transition Assistance, said the package may help boost 
enlistment of high school graduates. The program ``will open the 
door of the military to a much broader cross section of America's 
youth,'' Principi said.

	U.S. Wants Iraq Oil Ceiling Lifted

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States today proposed removing a  
U.N. ceiling on Iraqi oil sales provided the proceeds are used to 
purchase humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people. Iraq currently 
is permitted to sell $5.2 billion worth of oil every six months to 
purchase food, medications and other supplies. That ceiling would 
be lifted if the U.S. proposal were to be accepted by the Security 
Council.

judge's order to rewrite parts of its Windows 98 operating system 
to conform with Sun Microsystems' version of the Java programming 
language. In papers filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, Microsoft said U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte wrongly 
ruled that compatibility requirements Sun had imposed on 
Microsoft's Java limited how Microsoft could distribute Sun's 
technology. Whyte had ordered Microsoft in November to change 
software that incorporates Java programming, or stop shipping the 
products within 90 days.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A vaccine that attacks HIV at a vulnerable  
moment of the deadly virus' infection cycle has been shown to be 
effective in laboratory tests, researchers say. In studies at the 
University of Montana, researchers developed antibodies in mice 
that attacked HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, just as the virus 
was in the process of fusing with target cells. This fusion 
process, the researchers said, exposed HIV molecules that are not 
open to attack at other times in the infection cycle. A report on 
the study is appears in tomorrow's issue of the journal Science.

New Jersey Nets, attracted by the team's commitment to a trust that 
benefits inner-city youth, according to team officials. The NBA 
approved Cosby as a Nets owner yesterday. Lewis Katz, the principal 
owner and a friend of Cosby's from their days at Temple, wouldn't 
say how much Cosby paid for his share of the Nets, only saying it 
was millions.

<HEADLINE> Florida Pulls Plug on Bullet Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush pulled the plug Thursday  
on a $6.3 billion project to build a bullet train that would whisk 
passengers between Miami, Orlando and Tampa at nearly 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under then-Gov. Lawton Chiles, the state signed a deal in 1996  
with Florida Overland eXpress, a private consortium that planned to 
run French-designed trains on new tracks that would use underpasses 
and overpasses instead of road crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	The state planned to pay for its portion by selling $2 billion  
in bonds and borrowing $2 billion from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has spent $22.4 million planning the venture, but Bush  
said he will stop future spending and veto any attempt by lawmakers 
to restore it. The newly elected Republican said the venture is too 
expensive and risky for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that would be the death knell for it,'' said  
Dave Goodstein, vice chairman of a group called Derail the Bullet 
Train. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans called for the trains to roll between Miami and Orlando in  
2005. Tampa service would have begun in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar effort to link Florida's urban areas by high-speed  
rail failed in the early 1990s when the developer asked for public 
money.

<HEADLINE> Admin Judges Call for Court Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Administrative judges are recommending the  
reversal of a reform enacted to speed cases, which has instead 
caused more delays in a clogged court system. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform, known as vertical prosecution, was put in place in  
September 1997 and entails having the same judge and prosecutor 
follow each case from arraignment to sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as productive as we had hoped it would be,'' said the  
court's chief administrative judge, Joseph H.H. Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Circuit Court's six-judge management committee on Wednesday  
approved a proposal to return to the system previously used in 
which arraignments were centralized and handled by one or two 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal will be presented to the full bench next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Vertical prosecution has come under increased criticism this  
month, after five accused murderers were released due to repeated 
postponements. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases prompted Gov. Parris Glendening to call for state  
takeover of Baltimore's circuit court system. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant was released Tuesday after waiting more than three  
years to be tried on charges of shooting a man in a pool hall. His 
trial had been postponed more than 17 times since his December 1995 
arrest. Prosecutors also said they had lost a file crucial to their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 5, a judge threw out murder charges against four men  
awaiting trial in a 1995 gangland slaying. Their cases had been 
postponed a dozen times. Baltimore Circuit Judge Roger Brown said 
the defendants were deprived of their constitutional rights.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lesbian Health a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors know too little about the health of  
lesbians, says a new study that urged the government to rectify a 
lack of research on the health needs of these women. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had asked the Institute of Medicine, an  
independent science organization, to investigate lesbian health. 
The panel concluded Thursday that this population has been so 
ignored that no one knows if lesbians are at higher risk for cancer 
and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the report's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--There is some evidence that lesbians may be at higher risk for  
breast cancer, because of perceived higher rates of alcohol 
consumption, overweight and childlessness, and for ovarian cancer, 
because they are less likely to bear children or use birth control 
pills. But nobody knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is a myth that lesbians do not need Pap smears to detect  
cervical cancer. They do need them. 
</P>
<P>
	--The stress of dealing with societal attitudes toward  
homosexuality may affect lesbians' physical and mental health, 
including their suicide risk, but too little research has been done 
to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors, particularly gynecologists, have little training in  
treating lesbian patients, which can affect quality of care and 
discourage patients from seeking care. One of the few lesbian 
studies found 20 percent of lesbians surveyed in Michigan reported 
encounters with doctors who knew nothing about homosexual women. 
Also, lesbians are less likely to have health insurance, often 
because of bans against spousal benefits for unmarried partners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Research is lacking because it is hard to define who makes up  
this subset of women and then recruit them, and because there is a 
stigma associated with studying lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine urged the government and other  
scientists to promptly conduct and fund research to answer the 
questions.

<HEADLINE> Early Humans May Have Eaten Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ancestors of modern humans were more than  
tree-climbing plant-eaters, according to a new study. The ape-like 
creatures millions of years ago probably also caught and ate small 
animals -- even before the invention of stone tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who studied tooth enamel from the fossilized remains  
of hominids called Australopithecus africanus found the chemical 
signature of foods that grew on the open plains of South Africa, as 
well as in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that ``africanus was not just a tree dweller,'' said  
Matt Sponheimer, a researcher at Rutgers University in New 
Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study shows that this early human ancestor found its food  
both in the forest and in the open areas,'' said Sponheimer, 
co-author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies, based on bones in the jaw, arms, hands and  
feet, had suggested the species subsisted only on leaves and fruits 
plucked from forests -- rather like the diet of present-day 
chimpanzees, the nearest animal relative to modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sponheimer said the tooth chemistry study proves the species  
had a much more varied diet. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, up to 25 percent of their diet came from grass or  
grass-eating animals, said Sponheimer. ``For one specimen, it was 
50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study makes clear the early hominids were eating something  
different from what researchers had assumed, said John Kingston, a 
Yale University expert on early human-like species. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the things they could have been eating is meat, which is  
a fascinating possibility,'' Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study didn't conclusively determine if the species ate  
meat from grass-eating animals or merely the seeds and roots of 
grassland plants, which would give the same tooth-enamel signature, 
Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossils of the species have been found only in South Africa. It  
lived 2 million to 3 million years ago and resembles Lucy, the 
famed, nearly complete hominid skeleton found in Ethiopia in North 
Africa. Lucy, however, is slightly more ape-like and is identified 
as A. afarensis, an earlier human ancestral species. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanus was not much bigger than a chimpanzee, at about 4 feet  
and 90 pounds, but had a slightly larger brain. It walked on its 
hind legs, but some specimens suggest an opposing big toe rather 
like a tree-climbing ape, said Sponheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	This feature, along with teeth that resemble those of apes, have  
led other researchers to conclude the species lived in the trees 
and ate only plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, Sponheimer and co-author Julia A. Lee-Thorp of  
the University of Cape Town in South Africa extracted tiny bits of 
tooth enamel from the specimens and then analyzed the carbon 
isotope ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have a different  
number of neutrons. For instance, trees and bushes contain more 
carbon-13 than do grasses that grow in open areas. The isotopic 
ratios in the enamel reflect which of these plants the animals ate. 
Meat-eaters acquire the isotopic signatures of their prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect,'' said Sponheimer, ``you are what you eat.''  
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, if the species ate animals that fed on grasses,  
their tooth enamel would show the carbon-13 signature of grassland 
plants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The specimens analyzed had carbon-13 signatures between that of  
forest animals and plains-dwelling grass-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	That indicates the species ate foods from both the forests and  
the plains. It also suggests they fed on high-protein animal foods, 
perhaps insects or small mammals, that lived on grasses. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no evidence the species had stone tools, but it is  
possible the hominid killed small game with rocks or used twigs to 
gather insects, a technique observed among chimpanzees grazing on 
termites, Sponheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hominids that appeared later, such as Homo habilis, used stone  
weapons to kill larger mammals. It is thought this higher-protein 
food may have played a role in the evolution of the larger brain of 
modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sponheimer and Lee-Thorp write that ``the primary dietary  
difference between A. africanus and Homo may not have been the 
quality of their food, but their manner of procuring it.''

<HEADLINE> Three Jaguars Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive backs Cordell Taylor and  
Travis Davis and defensive lineman Joel Smeenge of the Jacksonville 
Jaguars underwent surgery Thursday to repair injuries suffered 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a backup safety, injured his right knee and underwent an  
arthroscopy to repair torn cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a second-round draft pick last year at cornerback, had  
an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee and a small ``clean-up'' 
procedure on his left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
	Smeenge had a shoulder arthroscopy to repair a torn muscle.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Taylor are expected to begin rehabilitation next week  
and participate in the team's offseason conditioning program 
beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Smeenge will spend time in a sling and should return for the  
1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three, Smeenge was the only regular starter. He led the  
Jaguars with 7 1/2 sacks last season.

<HEADLINE> Loquacious Madden Gets Speechless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Minn. (AP) -- For once, John Madden was speechless.  
</P>
<P>
	The TV football analyst got a warm welcome and a key to the city  
of 22,000 Wednesday when he visited Austin, the town where he was 
born in 1936 and left four years later when his family moved to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden, normally unflappable on the air, blushed as Mayor Bonnie  
Rietz handed him several gifts, including a Spam apron and a 
membership card to the Austin Spam Fan Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Spam is made by Austin-based Hormel Foods Corp., which also gave  
Madden a 3-pound bag of pork chops, named Madden Chops. Hormel is 
selling Madden Chops in local stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden, 62, could barely get off his personal bus because of a  
crowd of more than 100 people and several TV crews closing in for a 
glimpse. Inside the City Council chambers, the mayor led a 
30-minute this-is-your-life ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left here on a train in 1940 and came back on a bus,''  
Madden said. ``There's been a lot of years in between, but 
everything about this day, the warmth of the people here, makes me 
feel very grateful. This is so overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE> Study Targets Welfare in Wisconsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The state's first effort to document how former  
welfare recipients have fared since Wisconsin moved to a work-based 
system found more than a third were unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Wednesday said 38 percent were not working  
for pay when they left state welfare rolls in the first three 
months of 1998. A third of them said they could not find a job or 
did not have the necessary skills or experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a high number'' of unemployed people, said state Sen.  
Gwendolyne Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat and critic of the state's 
welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about an unemployment rate here,'' she said.  
``If Alan Greenspan thinks 5 (percent) or 6 (percent) is bad, 
compare that to 38 percent of any given population. That's a 
crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was one of the first states to implement its  
work-focused program after Congress overhauled welfare regulations 
in 1996. President Clinton called Wisconsin's program one of the 
``boldest, most revolutionary'' welfare plans in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on interviews with 375 people who left the  
rolls of Wisconsin Works or the program it replaced, Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children. Interviews were conducted in the 
first three months of 1998, when 3,564 recipients left the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 83 percent had worked at least part of the  
time since leaving welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-eight percent of former recipients said getting a job was  
easier than living on welfare, though the same percentage said they 
were just barely making it financially. 
</P>
<P>
	About 62 percent said they were employed when they were  
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased the statistic is as high as it is,'' said Jean  
Rogers, economic support administrator for the Department of 
Workforce Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers said state officials are satisfied with the study and  
don't think the 38 percent unemployment figure is a concern. She 
added that many of those who were not working said they have other 
sources of income, such as Social Security, pensions, or spouses 
with steady jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of unemployed former recipients does not mean the  
program is failing, said Pamela Fendt, a policy analyst with the 
Center for Economic Development at the University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what you'd want to know is how that 38 percent are  
faring without working, and this doesn't really answer that,'' 
Fendt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the unemployment figure worried advocates for the poor.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we have to look very seriously at the reasons for  
people not working and what it would take to help them get and 
retain jobs, '' said Anne Arensen, director of the Wisconsin 
Council on Children and Families. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who found work after leaving welfare earned an average of  
$7.42 an hour, the study said. And 87 percent said they had health 
insurance, either through Medicaid or through their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Works requires recipients to work or receive job  
training to receive benefits. In return, the state pays for child 
care, transportation and other job-related costs. There were 13,818 
families in the program in November, less than half the number who 
were on welfare when the program began in September 1997.

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors Argue Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House prosecutors sought Thursday to build  
a conspiracy case against President Clinton, but along the way they 
misstated a few of the facts and stretched some others in an effort 
to portray the evidence in the most dramatic light. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Rep. James Sensenbrenner incorrectly said that  
Paula Jones was ``forced to quit'' her job with the state of 
Arkansas after Clinton allegedly propositioned her and she turned 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Mrs. Jones -- whose sexual harassment lawsuit against  
Clinton led to the impeachment controversy -- said she quit 
voluntarily in order to move to California with her husband. In 
between, she received merit raises in her state job. Mrs. Jones' 
failure to prove she had been harmed in her job led to the 
dismissal of her lawsuit last April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner also took aim at White House Counsel Charles F.C.  
Ruff, saying the president's defender ``did not'' give a direct 
answer when asked before the House Judiciary Committee whether 
Clinton had lied. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Ruff twice declared that the president testified  
truthfully to the grand jury last Aug. 17. Clinton ``surely did'' 
tell the truth, Ruff testified last month when questioned by 
Sensenbrenner whether his boss had told the truth under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	After the trial adjourned, the White House sought to score  
political points. Special Counsel Greg Craig charged that 
Sensenbrenner had ``misled the Senate'' and ``falsely 
characterized'' Ruff's earlier testimony. ``Mr. Sensenbrenner 
surely knew that, and I would urge him to correct the record,'' 
Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner issued his own statement later Thursday, insisting  
he was accurate in his characterization and the White House was 
arguing such points because there is no defense on the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plainly quoted and summarized from my earlier questions to  
Mr. Ruff,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``They can't refute the facts, so 
they try to divert attention from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first day of arguments, House prosecutors made their  
points vigorously -- that Clinton engaged in a conspiracy to keep 
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky secret and they needed to call 
witnesses at the trial to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's conspiracy, they argued, included encouraging Ms.  
Lewinsky to file a false affidavit by helping her find a job, 
coaching Oval Office secretary Betty Currie on potential future 
testimony, seeking to hide gifts the president gave the intern and 
falsely denying a sexual relationship with her in his own 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president knew that he had to keep Monica Lewinsky on the  
team so that she would continue to be a part of the conspiracy,'' 
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., argued at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson identified six potential witnesses for the Senate  
trial: Clinton, presidential friend Vernon Jordan, Mrs. Currie, Ms. 
Lewinsky, White House chief of staff John Podesta, and presidential 
aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had Mr. Jordan on the witness stand ... you could decide  
whether he is telling the truth or withholding information,'' 
Hutchinson said in pressing the case. ``You could probe where his 
loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice, look into his eyes 
and determine the truthfulness of his statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In assembling their case in the most dramatic terms, however,  
the prosecutors made several assertions certain to be challenged by 
White House lawyers in the defense presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Hutchinson argued that Ms. Lewinsky took ``a signed  
copy'' of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit to Jordan ``so Jordan can report 
to the president'' on its contents. But Hutchinson didn't mention 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she never gave Jordan the signed copy 
and that when she offered it to him to see ``I think he may have 
said, 'You know, I don't need to see it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner also addressed Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit,  
asserting that Clinton ``knew'' that the affidavit Ms. Lewinsky 
would file in the Jones case would be ``perjurious, false and 
misleading.'' However, Clinton testified he never saw her affidavit 
before it was filed -- Ms. Lewinsky says she offered it to him but 
he declined to look at it. In addition, Clinton said he thought she 
could file a truthful document. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner also focused on the return of presidential gifts  
to the former intern at a time when the gifts were under subpoena. 
He asserted that Mrs. Currie had no reason to pick up the presents 
``unless directed by the president.'' Mrs. Currie has testified 
that to the best of her recollection the president never instructed 
her to pick up the gifts and she believes Ms. Lewinsky initiated 
the retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers weren't the only ones having occasional  
trouble with the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	In rebutting the obstruction charge in a written filing with the  
Senate, Clinton's lawyers highlight the testimony of Mrs. Currie 
that she didn't feel any pressure ``whatsoever'' when Clinton asked 
such questions as ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers didn't bother to mention another section of  
Mrs. Currie's grand jury testimony when the secretary said she felt 
as though Clinton wanted her to agree with his statements.

<HEADLINE> Cox Ride Could Reach Mountaintop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- He carries a reputation he might never  
erase, no matter how well he behaves. ``Crazy Cox,'' he has been 
called. Or ``Wild Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Cox shrugs when asked about his past. He's enjoying the  
present too much and is so optimistic about the future that he 
regards his personal history -- filled with fines and antisocial 
on-field behavior -- as something from another life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy here, I love what's going on here,'' the New York  
Jets linebacker said as he prepared for Sunday's AFC championship 
game at Denver. ``I'm in an organization that knows how to treat 
its players and I'm with a coach who cares. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the best situation I've had in football.''  
</P>
<P>
	It's also been a terrific marriage for the Jets. When Marvin  
Jones tore up his knee in training camp, coach Bill Parcells 
immediately called Cox, who was in a tentative retirement after 
being released by the Bears. Cox wasn't certain he wanted to play 
again, but after talking with Parcells, he signed a $500,000 deal 
with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox came with baggage. He was fined $136,000 in his first seven  
seasons (he drew another $10,000 fine for two dangerous hits 
against Tennessee in November). He has a vicious temper that often 
got the best of him, leading him at times to spit at opponents -- 
shades of Denver's Bill Romanowski -- and fans, berate game 
officials and accuse the NFL of being racist. 
</P>
<P>
	He also came with talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knows what he is doing. This kid knows how to play the  
game,'' Parcells said. ``He has run some defenses for other teams, 
so it's not like he doesn't have a clue what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about his judgments, it's about his temper, that is  
what has gotten him in trouble. He does make good decisions on the 
field most of the time. He's a good kid. He gets worked up, he's 
got some pretty strong opinions. That doesn't bother me. He doesn't 
do anything to hurt his team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, nobody has helped the Jets defense more. New  
York yielded just one point more than Miami, which had the 
stingiest defense in the league. Cox has played in Jones' spot on 
the outside, where he can best use his speed, and has lined up in 
rush positions at end and tackle to utilize his power. He's dropped 
into coverage, and he's been a sacker, getting to quarterbacks six 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as significantly, he has been a locker room presence, a  
leader. Cox attracts attention because he is so well-spoken and so 
outspoken -- All-Pro linebacker Mo Lewis recently shouted in the 
dressing room, ``It's the Bryan Cox Show, starring the man who 
never stops talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox might talk a lot, but he usually has something constructive  
to say. Parcells believes Cox would make a good coach, because of 
his knowledge of the game and his ability to get other players to 
follow his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teammates who had seen Cox's tirades on highlight reels  
or read about the fines envisioned a monster joining the team in 
August. One Jet, tackle Jumbo Elliot, had some personal experience 
with Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember playing against Cox and I'd be blocking him and  
he'd be trying to hit me in the gut,'' Elliott said. ``So I 
thought, `Who is this guy? We picked this guy up?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he is a really solid guy. And Bryan and Bill are like best  
buddies. Hey, they hang together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not really, although both are horse lovers and have been to the  
racetrack together. Several Jets kid Cox that he is a management 
spy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is telling me I'm a coach and that Parcells has a  
microphone in my locker,'' Cox said, pointing to a sparse locker 
around which is gathered a dozen reporters and five television 
cameras. ``I think Bill sees some of himself in me, because he 
knows I'll fight anybody, anytime, about anything, if I think I am 
right. He likes that.''

	He also likes where Cox has helped the Jets get: within one  
victory of their first Super Bowl appearance in 30 years. Not bad 
for a guy who came off the golf course in midsummer not entirely 
sure he belonged back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me awhile to ease into things here,'' Cox admitted.  
``If nothing else, it has given me a chance to end my career on my 
terms and go out the way I wanted to go out. It's been a blessing. 
You couldn't ask for anything more.''

<HEADLINE> City May Help Boston Tenants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Three months after federal drug raids led Boston  
to take over the nation's first tenant-run housing project, several 
city councilors want to put management back in the hands of the 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
	The councilors also want to help the former employees of  
Bromley-Heath Housing Complex save their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council unanimously passed a resolution Wednesday  
asking Mayor Thomas Menino to meet with Bromley-Heath workers to 
discuss their job status. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,200-unit complex was nationally acclaimed for its  
management by tenants who negotiated rents and hired their own 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
	But management was taken over by the Boston Housing Authority  
after a drug sweep in October netted 28 arrests, many of them 
Bromley-Heath residents. Housing officials said the tenant managers 
had been negligent. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the takeover, about 60 maintenance workers and  
other employees lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilor Maura Hennigan said the employees were being  
unfairly shut out of their jobs and management should be returned 
to the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Housing Authority had proposed guidelines for returning  
control. But lawyers for the tenants rejected that proposal in 
December, saying it ``makes a mockery of resident management.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial New for Rehnquist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist intoned a  
scripted series of housekeeping duties to open President Clinton's 
impeachment trial proceedings Thursday and asked senators to ignore 
him when he stands to stretch his ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he faded mostly into the background.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate will convene as a court of impeachment,'' the chief  
justice said as he began the first Senate session since 1868 to 
hear arguments on a president's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist went through housekeeping matters with Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., such as receiving trial documents and ordering 
them printed. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice, who has long had back problems, added: ``I  
would like to inform members of the Senate and the parties in this 
case of my need to stand on occasion to stretch my back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention that the proceedings should be in any way  
interrupted when I do so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the chief justice invited House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, R-Ill., and other House prosecutors to begin laying out their 
case against Clinton. From that point, Rehnquist spoke only 
occasionally, announcing the next speaker or calling for a recess. 
</P>
<P>
	He did show up in an exhibit offered by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,  
a videotape of Rehnquist swearing in Clinton as president in 
January 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice is known as a stern enforcer of decorum and  
time limits at the Supreme Court, but he gave little clue Thursday 
about whether he will be as strict in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to play a more active role next week when  
senators will be allowed to submit questions for him to ask lawyers 
on both sides. If the Senate decides to call witnesses and receive 
new evidence, Rehnquist also may be asked to rule on whether 
evidence can be admitted. Such decisions can be overruled by a 
majority of the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Farm-State Senators Petition Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns grow about consolidation in  
agriculture, farm state Democratic senators have asked Attorney 
General Janet Reno to investigate concentration in livestock and 
farm commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe conditions have reached a point that our producers  
are being denied the opportunity to receive a fair price for their 
products through fair, free and open markets,'' said the letter, 
dated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed by Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North  
Dakota, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Reno did not immediately return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently asked the Justice  
Department and the Federal Trade Commission to examine pricing 
problems within the pork industry, where farmers are receiving 
record-low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers have expressed concern about plans by Cargill  
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, to buy the 
worldwide grain operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
Justice is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., has  
scheduled a hearing Jan. 26 on the concentration issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators wrote that the top four firms control 87 percent of  
beef slaughter, 60 percent of pork slaughter and 73 percent of 
sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same in commodities markets, they said, writing that  
four firms control 59 percent of port facilities, 62 percent of 
flour milling, 74 percent of wet corn milling and 76 percent of 
soybean crushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department should investigate ``whether such  
powerful concentration is squeezing farm prices and denying farmers 
the opportunity to receive a fair return for their production,'' 
the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Neighbors Keep Close Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's financial turmoil raised  
concerns on Thursday that economies from Argentina to Venezuela 
could be dragged into a recession this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, to  
devalue its currency by about 8 percent sent shudders throughout 
the region and reignited fears that the global economic crisis, 
which broke out in Thailand in 1997, is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts raised the possibility that other countries would be  
forced to slice the value of their currencies, that their economies 
would contract and that jittery investors would pull money out of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil controls whether things go well or bad,'' said  
Argentine economist Mario Vicens. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this gets out of control all of Latin America could  
suffer,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. 
in Minneapolis. ``When Brazil sneezes, the rest of Latin America 
catches a cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No country worries more about Brazil's economic ills than its  
southern neighbor, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 percent of Argentine exports go to its giant northern  
neighbor. Cars made in Argentina are sent to Brazil. Many of the 
dairy products coming from the vast Argentine Pampas go north to 
Brazil. So do oil products. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued drop in Brazil's currency would make those products  
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries' economies are intertwined through the  
Mercosur trading bloc, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of Argentina's link to Brazil, Argentine stocks  
tumbled 10 percent Wednesday following the announcement that the 
Brazilian real was devalued. It was the biggest drop in the region 
and stocks continued to falter on Thursday, closing down 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, Sao Paulo's market fell 10 percent, while stocks on  
the Rio de Janeiro exchange plunged 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of economic trouble in Latin America also hit Wall Street  
where the Dow Jones average fell 228.63 points. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade ties of other Latin American countries are less  
closely linked to Brazil, the consequences of persisting economic 
woes there have many worried. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued devaluation of Brazil's currency would threaten the  
stability of Venezuela's money known as the bolivar, which many 
analysts already believe is overvalued and in need of adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Should foreign investors continue to withdraw their money from  
Brazil, it would also dampen Mexico's economic health. Many 
investors hold Brazilian and Mexican stocks in the same portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Steinberg, a chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York,  
said Mexico was better prepared than other countries to weather any 
looming storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexico might squeak by with weak growth because of its close  
trade links to the U.S. but that will depend on how the contagion 
effects play out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru has already slipped into a recession, and should the  
troubles in Brazil draw out, it would exacerbate an already severe 
debt crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxiously waiting to see how the exchange rate will  
react. Who doesn't owe money in dollars here?'' said Peruvian 
journalist Igancio Brasombrio. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the concern of a burgeoning crisis, officials throughout  
South America rushed forward on Thursday to calm rising fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's President Carlos Menem insisted the Brazilian crisis  
would not force a devaluation of the Argentine peso. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are enough reserves in our Central Bank to resolve any  
emergency situation,'' he told Clarin, a Buenos Aires daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Massad, Chile's Central Bank president, also said his  
country was prepared should the crisis require more 
belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is in a position of great strength and we are in  
excellent position to face any effects of the Brazilian crisis,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Mexico Governor Guillermo Ortiz told a local radio  
station that if Brazil's troubles don't last ``it's probable that 
we won't see a major impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's devaluation was an eerie reminder of how  
susceptible the region is to the 18-month financial crisis that has 
crippled Asia and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Missing Secretary Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating today whether  
to believe the word of Thomas Capano or the circumstantial evidence 
of prosecutors who say the prominent lawyer killed his mistress and 
dumped her body. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has found a murder weapon or the body of Anne Marie  
Fahey, the governor's scheduling secretary and Capano's mistress of 
three years before she vanished June 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano denied knowing anything about her fate until his murder  
trial. Then, last month he testified Ms. Fahey was accidentally 
shot to death by another mistress in a suicidal, jealous rage. He 
said he dumped the body in the ocean to protect the other woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began deliberations today at a Wilmington area hotel  
where they were sequestered. The judge has told them to set their 
own hours, adding that if they reach a verdict during evening hours 
they must wait until the following day to deliver it. If convicted 
of first-degree murder, Capano could be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors ridiculed Capano's story in closing statements  
Wednesday, and questioned why it took him 2 1/2 years to explain the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``That story is ludicrous. It defies common sense,'' said  
prosecutor Colm Connolly. ``The defendant thought he would get away 
with murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's defense stood by the lawyer's story, blaming Deborah  
MacIntyre, who had an affair with Capano for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Tom Capano planned to kill Anne Marie Fahey, what kind of  
moron would kill her in his own house?'' said Joseph Oteri, 
Capano's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied being at Capano's home the night Ms. Fahey,  
30, disappeared. She testified she bought Capano a gun at his 
request a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, a former state prosecutor from a wealthy family, long  
insisted he didn't know what became of Ms. Fahey after they dined 
together at a Philadelphia restaurant -- the last time she was seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said at trial he crammed her body into a cooler and, with  
his brother's help, dumped it at sea the day after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Oteri urged the jury to set aside any resentment for Capano's  
conduct, including his many affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things may offend you, and many of them should, but ...  
you can't vote guilty because you don't like Tom Capano or what he 
did,'' Oteri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said Capano lied to police, psychiatrists, even his own  
lawyers when asked what happened to Ms. Fahey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ms. MacIntyre had indeed accidentally shot Ms. Fahey, Capano  
could have called the police for help, Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody was going to be given the benefit of the doubt, it  
was the defendant with his political connections,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oteri said his client didn't got to authorities because he was  
in a panic and felt they never would have believed him.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Ends First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a jury of 100 silent senators, House  
prosecutors demanded President Clinton's removal from office on 
Thursday, charging he had ``piled perjury upon perjury'' and 
obstructed justice. Senate Republican leaders suggested Clinton 
might be invited to testify at his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should be invited, or at least I don't have a  
problem with him being invited,'' GOP Whip Don Nickles told 
reporters at the conclusion of the historic, six-hour trial 
session. Republican sources said Majority Leader Trent Lott had 
also expressed at least passing interest in the idea. Lott's office 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Senate chamber, where monumental issues of war and  
peace have been thrashed out for over a century, the trial unfolded 
in an atmosphere of uncommon gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to bring President Clinton to account ... will cause a  
cancer to be present in our society for generations,'' asserted 
Wisconsin Republican James Sensenbrenner, standing in the well of 
the chamber to address the senators and a nationwide television 
audience counted in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 42nd president was in the White House, preparing  
for next Tuesday's State of the Union address, when Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist rapped the gavel and announced that the Senate 
would ``convene as a court of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeant-at-Arms James Ziglar admonished all to remain silent  
``on pain of imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silent they were, the senators at their seats; those spectators  
lucky -- or influential -- enough to have space in the galleries 
above; the president's lawyers and House prosecutors seated around 
separate custom-made curved tables at the base of the rostrum and 
Rehnquist, presiding in his judicial robe. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of two brief breaks, the trial remained in  
session until after dark as a string of House Republicans laid out 
their evidence. They buttressed their presentation with numerous 
images of Clinton on videotape, many of them of his testimony 
before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is,''  
Clinton was seen to say in one snippet, a now-famous utterance that 
his critics have seized on as evidence of legal hairsplitting -- or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman James Kennedy attacked the Republican case  
even as it continued. It is ``both unsubstantial and 
circumstantial,'' he said. ``We look forward to presenting our 
defense based on the facts, the law and the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators sat attentively at their desks throughout the day, but  
there was no indication that any of the evidence had caused minds 
to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I don't think there was anything new from any of the  
House'' speakers, said Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan of North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner's Midwestern monotone belied the gravity of the  
moment. The Founding Fathers wrote impeachment into the 
Constitution as a way of reining in a corrupt chief executive, but 
their script has been played out this far only once before -- in the 
case of Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted by a single vote in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day wore on, prosecutors moved methodically through the  
minutiae of the case. Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, for example, 
led senators through a series of timelines that cross-referenced 
telephone calls by the president with actions taken by other 
principals in the case, evidence, he said, of a frantic effort on 
the chief executive's part to keep his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest by the television networks dwindled.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice for  
attempting to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, the former 
White House intern. He has admitted to an improper relationship, 
but he and his lawyers maintain that the charges, even if proven, 
do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	His trial is expected to last at least two more weeks -- far  
longer if the Senate agrees to the House's demand to call witnesses 
and if the White House's follow-up request for a long delay to 
prepare is also approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. James Rogan of California., speaking with  
reporters after the session, said that under the Senate's rules 
``the president cannot be compelled to testify.'' But he added, 
``We certainly favor the Senate inviting the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles made his comments as he left the Capitol at day's end.  
But the Republican sources, commenting only on condition of 
anonymity, said the idea had been broached to Lott before the trial 
session convened for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, point man for the House impeachment team, had  
suggested to reporters on Wednesday he might want Clinton to 
testify, but the White House has repeatedly said it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The House pressed its case for other witnesses during the day,  
as Hutchinson, Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Rogan urged the 
Senate to grant their request to summon Ms. Lewinsky, at a minimum, 
to testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, went first for  
the prosecutors. ``We are here, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished 
senators, as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice under 
the law and for the sanctity of the oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and others put Clinton's oath of office -- and his alleged  
violation of it -- at the heart of the case against him. Senators 
were twice shown videotaped snippets of Clinton raising his hand 
and swearing an oath: first on Inauguration Day in 1993 and then 
when he testified in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his presentation, Sensenbrenner laid out the familiar  
allegations: that Clinton had lied before Starr's grand jury, had 
lied in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and had taken a 
variety of actions to obstruct Starr's investigation. According to 
the accusations, these included coaching his secretary, Betty 
Currie, to give false testimony, to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in 
New York, and to encourage her to give false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show that the president piled perjury upon  
perjury,'' Sensenbrenner said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking a pillar of the White House defense argument,  
Sensenbrenner argued that perjury is an impeachable offense. He 
cited the case of judicial impeachments in the Senate, one as 
recently as 1989. ``The truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. 
There cannot be different levels of truth for judges than for 
presidents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defense lawyers -- including private attorney  
David E. Kendall as well as Charles Ruff and Bruce Lindsey of the 
White House counsel's office -- listened attentively, some of them 
writing notes. Their turn to argue before the court of impeachment 
will come next week, coincidentally on the day of the State of the 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, senators sat quietly at their seats, adhering  
carefully to the suggested rules of decorum. Some leafed through 
notebooks containing impeachment material, others simply sat at 
gleaming, clean desks listening intently. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mere presence as silent participants was remarkable.  
Customarily, only a few senators are on the floor at a time, and 
when they all converge to vote, the chamber is filled with dozens 
of conversations proceeding simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Rehnquist made one personal announcement. He  
wanted all parties to know he would ``stand on occasion to stretch 
my back,'' and didn't intend for the proceedings to be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Chaplain Lloyd J. Ogilvie offered a prayer, asking for a  
``special measure of wisdom for the men and women'' who hold 
Clinton's fate in their hands. Then he, too, took a seat along the 
rear of the chamber and sat back to watch history. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner appealed to senators not to shrink from a task  
made tougher by the ``public opinion polls, the popularity and 
unpopularity of individuals, even questions over the strength of 
our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to the political subtext to the entire  
impeachment proceedings, in which Clinton has been buoyed by high 
poll ratings, even in the wake of embarrassing disclosures about 
his personal life.

<HEADLINE> Home Sweet Home, Home Sweet Dome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last week, all four home teams won playoff games -- after having  
a week off. Which is why you never laugh at teams talking about the 
importance of home field advantage in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the home teams are Minnesota and Denver, both  
unbeaten this year on their own turf, with the Broncos riding an 
18-game winning streak at Mile High. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, the home teams are favored.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                   	Atlanta (plus 11) at Minnesota 	
</P>
<P>
	``They were 14-2 and nobody else was in the NFC,'' Dennis Green  
says of the Vikings. ``That makes them the best team we've faced 
all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are a solid team with some veterans who have been  
this far, notably Cornelius Bennett and Eugene Robinson. Jamal 
Anderson gives them the means to control the ball and keep the 
nearly unstoppable Minnesota offense off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they win?  
</P>
<P>
	The noise at the Metrodome forced Green Bay into five illegal  
procedure penalties on one series in their game there this year. 
And it clearly rattled Jake Plummer and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta doesn't have the passing game to get caught too often in  
third and long, which is what those penalties do. And the Falcons' 
best cornerback, Ray Buchanan is 5-9, which means he concedes eight 
inches to Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have had a nice season.  
</P>
<P>
	It ends here.  
</P>
<P>
	VIKINGS, 37-20   	

</P>
<P>
                   	New York Jets (plus 9) at Denver 	
</P>
<P>
	The Jets really are a pretty decent team, even if Bill Parcells  
likes to have people think that they're a bunch of stiffs that he's 
willed into the AFC title game. The Jets also match up against 
Denver pretty well, especially on offense, where Keyshawn Johnson, 
Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward can win one-on-one matchups with the 
Broncos secondary and Curtis Martin should be able to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon closer inspection, the Jets are a lot like Parcells' 1990  
Giants, although those Giants were better on defense and not as 
good on offense. The relevant thing is that they won in San 
Francisco, 15-13, then upset Buffalo in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be more scoring in this one.  
</P>
<P>
	Denver toyed with Miami's defense last week, and the Dolphins'  
unit is better than the Jets. They also get a huge advantage from 
the crowd, probably the loudest outdoors in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the key. If Vinny Testaverde can stay as unruffled as he's  
been most of the year, the Jets have a chance. If not, they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny will be OK.  
</P>
<P>
	But ...  
</P>
<P>
	BRONCOS, 35-31   	
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Last Week: 3-1 (spread); 4-0 (straight up).  
</P>
<P>
	Playoffs 4-4 (spread); 5-3 (straight up).  
</P>
<P>
	Regular season: 120-115-5 (spread); 155-85 (straight up).  
</P>
<P>
	Combined: 124-119-5; 160-89.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Appeals Judge's Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. appealed a federal judge's  
ruling that ordered the software giant to rewrite parts of its 
Windows 98 operating system, calling it overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte ordered Microsoft in November  
to change Internet Explorer 4.0 and other software incorporating 
the Java programming language -- including Windows 98 -- or stop 
shipping the products within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by Palo Alto-based  
Sun Microsystems Inc., which claimed Microsoft designed a 
Windows-only form of Java that is incompatible with rival software. 
Sun has tried to promote its form of Java as a universal 
programming language that can be used with any software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft filed papers Wednesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals, accusing Whyte of wrongly ruling that compatibility 
requirements Sun had imposed on Microsoft's Java limited how 
Microsoft could distribute Sun's technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte ``abandoned (his) role by ignoring the plain language of  
the agreement,'' Microsoft's lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company also said Whyte's order was so  
broad that it restrains Microsoft from distributing other 
unspecified products that make no use of Sun's copyright material. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun is effectively given control over future Microsoft  
products in which it has no intellectual property rights,'' 
Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun said Whyte had ruled correctly.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to maximize compatibility and minimize switching  
costs is a central value of the Java platform -- millions of 
developers and users rely on that value,'' Sun said in a statement 
Thursday. ``They would be best served if Microsoft would come back 
into compliance with the Java specifications.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Back for Another Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway is back for another shot at an NFL  
title. Vinny Testaverde is going for his first shot at professional 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Few quarterbacks have followed such divergent paths since being  
the top pick in the NFL draft as Elway and Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became not only the cornerstone of a franchise, but an  
icon throughout the Rocky Mountain region. As teammate Shannon 
Sharpe says, ``John Elway is Denver, is Colorado and is the 
Rockies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Testaverde generally has been linked with  
disappointment. He flopped in Tampa Bay and was moderately better 
with the Cleveland-Baltimore franchise before being cut following 
the 1997 season. He linked up with the Jets ostensibly as a backup 
to Glenn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	So how in the world did Elway, who had one foot in retirement  
early in 1998, and Testaverde -- who was jobless -- wind up ranked 
1-2 in AFC passing this season? How did they guide their teams into 
Sunday's AFC championship game? 
</P>
<P>
	``As a quarterback, you rely on everyone around you, and they  
are the ones who give you a chance to be successful,'' said Elway, 
who is hedging on whether this will be his final game at Mile High 
Stadium before heading out of the NFL and toward the Hall of Fame. 
``The more people around you, the more you can succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot of pressure off me to have Terrell Davis back  
there, a 2,000-yard rusher, so people worry about our running game. 
I have Shannon Sharpe, Ed McCaffrey, Rod Smith, the great line. As 
a quarterback, that is all you can ask for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's something Testaverde might have asked for, but never  
received before landing in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around Vinny a couple times in the offseason and  
watched him on film over the years,'' said Elway, who along with 
Dan Marino is the only man to throw for more than 50,000 yards in 
his career. ``I always felt he had the talent to be one of the top 
quarterbacks in the league, and he moved around a couple times and 
found his home. This seems to be the perfect situation. He is 
comfortable with what they're doing, has good people around him and 
has taken full advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons the Jets are in the championship game is  
what Vinny has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Testaverde has done is similar to what Elway has achieved  
in his later seasons. While both once were gunners with wild 
streaks, they have settled into relying on balanced attacks, not 
looking to be the focal point of the offense all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elway tamed his notion to run whenever things broke down --  
he's still good at it, but at 38, is not inclined to or encouraged 
to high-tail his way downfield -- he became a more efficient 
quarterback. And a better leader. 
</P>
<P>
	As Testaverde learned not to force things -- coach Bill Parcells  
emphasized making good decisions over everything else when he 
signed Testaverde -- he, too, became more efficient. And more of a 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get in the huddle and he's a take-charge guy, but he's  
very calm,'' Jets star receiver Wayne Chrebet said. ``That funnels 
down to us. Just like if he was acting crazy in the huddle, it 
would filter down in a negative way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde is 13-1 as a starter since taking over for Foley for  
good in Game 6. He's had a healthier, more impressive season than 
Elway, who missed most of four games with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he'd ever compare himself with Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the way John has handled himself, he always found a  
way to get his team into the playoffs,'' Testaverde said. ``He has 
been a guy I think made some transitions along the way and been 
successful doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you look around the league, at a Marino, a Montana when he  
was playing, or a Phil Simms, or Elway, I tried to find what makes 
them so successful. And I think you pick up a little from each guy 
without really realizing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But can Testaverde pick up what Elway finally got last year -- a  
Super Bowl ring?

<HEADLINE> Former USAC President Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former USAC president Thomas W. Binford, who  
guided the group during its early years and was the Indianapolis 
500's chief referee for 22 years, died Thursday following a 
cerebral hemorrhage. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford was stricken at his downtown Indianapolis office  
Wednesday and taken to Methodist Hospital, where he died Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis native, who was one of the city's leading  
bankers, served as president of the United States Auto Club from 
1957-1969. He also was chief steward of the Indianapolis 500 from 
1974-1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Binford's leadership helped guide our organization through  
its formative years and his insight into our sport will be 
irreplaceable,'' said USAC president Johnny Capels. ``His 
enthusiasm will be sorely missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George praised  
Binford for his contributions to the IMS and the Indy 500. Binford 
was tapped as chief steward after the chaotic, rain-delayed 1973 
race, which was marred by crashes that killed two drivers and 
injured 11 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Binford has been recognized as one of racing's most  
highly-respected leaders for four decades. His unique leadership 
was recognized by my grandfather, Anton Hulman Jr. and the two 
worked closely together in building our type of racing, as we know 
it today,'' George said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford had been chairman and chief executive officer of  
Heritage Management Inc. and former head of Indiana National Bank. 
At the time of his death, he continued to serve on the boards of 
numerous Indiana corporations and civic organizations, including 
the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. Over the year, he had been 
honored for his support of civil rights and social reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Binford is survived by his wife, Kai A. Binford of Indianapolis;  
a son, Wilson Clark Binford of Zionsville, Ind., and a daughter, 
Florence ``Florrie'' Kichler of Carmel, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be Jan. 19 at 2:30 p.m. at Second  
Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis, followed by burial at Crown 
Hill Cemetery. Leppert &AMP; Hensley Mortuary is handling arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Falcon's Dad Has Tyson Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jamal Anderson's father hopes to attend Sunday's NFC  
championship game between the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	But James Anderson might have a little trouble getting away from  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Anderson runs a security firm that is responsible for  
guarding Mike Tyson, who will make another return to the ring 
Saturday night to fight Francois Botha in a heavyweight bout in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy that the Falcons are going to the conference  
championship,'' Anderson said Thursday. ``I just wish they could 
have gone a week later so I could be there without any stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the fight, Anderson hopes to catch an overnight flight  
that would arrive in Minneapolis about 7 a.m. CST. The game is 
scheduled to begin about 4 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	If the travel arrangements don't work out, Anderson plans to  
watch the game at Tyson's Las Vegas home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little leery about attending an away game,'' Anderson  
said. ``I usually just make Jamal's home games, so I'm a little 
leery about breaking my streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey police officer has been protecting the  
rich and famous since he got an assignment to guard Muhammad Ali. 
``It's the domino effect,'' Anderson said. ``When people see you 
with Ali, you get calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to California and launched his own security business.  
His clients have included entertainers such as the Jacksons, 
Richard Pryor and Boyz II Men and boxing stars ranging from Ali to 
Sugar Ray Leonard to Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	His son never showed any interest in boxing, but demonstrated at  
an early age that he would be tough to stop on the gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was 6 years old, he started playing Pop Warner  
football and was dominating his age peers running the football,'' 
the elder Anderson said. ``He always wore the 32. He took that from 
Jim Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamal's father also taught him at a young age to stiff-arm  
potential tacklers, a technique he used very effectively on his way 
to rushing for 1,846 yards in an All-Pro season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal's way of running was to keep running until someone came  
after him, then just try to run them over,'' his father said. ``In 
one of our conversations when he was 7 or 8 years old, I told him, 
`You need to learn how to stiff arm so you can keep those guys off 
of you.' He perfected that move and has been doing it ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Jamal Anderson got a call from his father, who  
predicted he would only rush for 40 or 50 yards against the 
Vikings. It's a familiar technique that James Anderson uses to fire 
up his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my little way of motivating him to play harder,'' the  
father said. ``I usually tell him stuff like that before the big 
games.''

<HEADLINE> More Mental Health Grants Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- The White House will ask Congress for a 24  
percent increase in mental health grants for states, Tipper Gore 
told a group of doctors Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the many advances we have made in science, research  
and treatment, mental illness continues to be treated differently 
from physical illness,'' said Mrs. Gore, the vice president's wife 
who's also a mental health adviser to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will ask for $358 million in mental health block  
grants for fiscal year 2000, about $70 million more than this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also plans to hold a conference on mental  
illness in the spring and Clinton plans to seek exemptions from 
competitive hiring practices for federal jobs for people with 
psychiatric disabilities, Mrs. Gore said in a speech to doctors at 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Such exemptions already are available for the mentally retarded  
and those suffering severe physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The block grants pay for treating mentally ill people outside of  
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Mental Health Association in Alexandria, Va., said  
better community-based care is needed because improvements in 
medications have allowed more patients to be treated in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an administration that knows it is time to fulfill the  
30-year-old promise of de-institutionalization and community mental 
health care,'' association President Michael Faenza said.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Organizers Target IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers may put pressure on  
the International Olympic Committee to cough up more money and 
expect less pampering during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the possibility of changing the contract will be broached when 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch visits in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can adjust some of the expenses. One of them  
might be a reduction of protocol expenses, in the fancy treatment 
of the Olympic community,'' Garff told the Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bullock, a member of SLOC, said he has tallied up $10  
million worth of IOC expenses that SLOC has agreed to pay and which 
he considers extravagances ``that would turn your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference Thursday afternoon, IOC member Anita  
DeFrantz deflected questions about whether the IOC would 
renegotiate the contract to protect Salt Lake in the event of a 
scandal-caused revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC believes that the money will be raised for these  
games,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she bristled at the suggestion IOC members will be getting  
perks in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not assume the IOC is on the take. We provide a lot of  
money to organizing committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, also a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
spoke to reporters from around the world who came for a SLOC 
meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled 
pending completion by Feb. 11 of an outside ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was adamant on two counts: that Samaranch should remain  
at the helm of the IOC and that Salt Lake will keep the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the hour, I have spoken with President Samaranch. He  
was very clear. We are 100 percent behind the Games being here,'' 
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC expenses that Bullock questions in SLOC's $1.45  
billion budget are $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 
suite for Samaranch and $30,000 in lobby decorations; a $1.1 
million transportation system including chauffeurs; $650,000 in 
breakfasts; and $16,000 for trailers at outdoor events so IOC 
members won't have to sit in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Olympics are about. You're taking money  
to put into the day care of these individuals that could be put 
into venues, athletes or community programs,'' Bullock told the 
Deseret News. ``It shows how out of whack the priorities have 
become.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a renegotiation of the deal. Bullock did not  
return calls to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz defended one of the expenses for IOC: chauffeured cars.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need drivers because we don't know the community. They're  
drivers, not chauffeurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the press conference, Garff said only that he knew no  
details about the IOC expenses and that in almost daily 
conversations, SLOC, IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee officials ``are 
always fine-tuning our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps suggested by some Salt Lake leaders is to use a  
clause of the contract to pressure the IOC to share more of its 
sponsorship revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause exempts the IOC from responsibility for the cost of  
the Games, except in the instance of ``willful misconduct or gross 
negligence by the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake, IOC and USOC organizers are scurrying to shore up  
sponsor support in the wake of revelations that Salt Lake bid 
executives gave lavish gifts and cash payments to IOC members 
before the 1995 vote giving Salt Lake the games. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Organizers Target IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers may put pressure on  
the International Olympic Committee to cough up more money and 
expect less pampering during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the possibility of changing the contract will be broached when 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch visits in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can adjust some of the expenses. One of them  
might be a reduction of protocol expenses, in the fancy treatment 
of the Olympic community,'' Garff told the Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bullock, a member of SLOC, said he has tallied up $10  
million worth of IOC expenses that SLOC has agreed to pay and which 
he considers extravagances ``that would turn your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference Thursday afternoon, IOC member Anita  
DeFrantz deflected questions about whether the IOC would 
renegotiate the contract to protect Salt Lake in the event of a 
scandal-caused revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC believes that the money will be raised for these  
games,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she bristled at the suggestion IOC members will be getting  
perks in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not assume the IOC is on the take. We provide a lot of  
money to organizing committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, also a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
spoke to reporters from around the world who came for a SLOC 
meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday but was canceled 
pending completion by Feb. 11 of an outside ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was adamant on two counts: that Samaranch should remain  
at the helm of the IOC and that Salt Lake will keep the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the hour, I have spoken with President Samaranch. He  
was very clear. We are 100 percent behind the Games being here,'' 
DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC expenses that Bullock questions in SLOC's $1.45  
billion budget are $2.6 million for hotels, including a $60,000 
suite for Samaranch and $30,000 in lobby decorations; a $1.1 
million transportation system including chauffeurs; $650,000 in 
breakfasts; and $16,000 for trailers at outdoor events so IOC 
members won't have to sit in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Olympics are about. You're taking money  
to put into the day care of these individuals that could be put 
into venues, athletes or community programs,'' Bullock told the 
Deseret News. ``It shows how out of whack the priorities have 
become.''. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a renegotiation of the deal. Bullock did not  
return calls to The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz defended one of the expenses for IOC: chauffeured cars.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need drivers because we don't know the community. They're  
drivers, not chauffeurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the press conference, Garff said only that he knew no  
details about the IOC expenses and that in almost daily 
conversations, SLOC, IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee officials ``are 
always fine-tuning our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the steps suggested by some Salt Lake leaders is to use a  
clause of the contract to pressure the IOC to share more of its 
sponsorship revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause exempts the IOC from responsibility for the cost of  
the Games, except in the instance of ``willful misconduct or gross 
negligence by the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake, IOC and USOC organizers are scurrying to shore up  
sponsor support in the wake of revelations that Salt Lake bid 
executives gave lavish gifts and cash payments to IOC members 
before the 1995 vote giving Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt has already called on the IOC to help should  
Salt Lake lose sponsor money -- the biggest source of Olympic 
funding -- because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	No sponsors have said they'll back out, but organizers worry  
about lining up new sponsors. The 2002 Games still need $250 
million from sponsors to meet the $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC receives money from product sales, international  
sponsorships and sale of broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said Thursday the SLOC believes it can still meet its  
revenue target, since sponsors are holding tight and IOC appears 
poised to oust any members found culpable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, the investigation should not end there. ``We  
would like the process to look into other cities, other nations so 
that the evil is rooted out.''

<HEADLINE> `Dateline' Takes CBS To Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS' ``60 Minutes II'' premiere won praise from  
critics and lots of attention from viewers, but one rival had a 
bone to pick Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dateline NBC,'' the competing TV newsmagazine, cried foul over  
a ``we're-first'' claim made in ``II's'' top story. ``Dateline'' 
said it was there first. 
</P>
<P>
	The story in question, titled ``Secret City,'' took viewers to  
Krasnoyarsk-26, a Siberian city where plutonium is made for nuclear 
bombs. The piece described CBS reporter George Crile as ``the first 
American journalist to enter Krasnoyarsk-26 with a television 
crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised'' at that claim, said NBC spokeswoman Hilary  
Smith, ``when in fact NBC News' Fred Francis was there reporting 
the story over four years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC made available a tape showing that ``Dateline,'' and  
Francis, had indeed covered much of the same ground in a piece 
called ``Russian Roulette'' that aired in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Francis didn't gain access to the nuclear plant buried  
deep inside a mountain, as Crile did, the ``Dateline'' report 
included similar footage from a source identified as ``an 
expatriate Russian filmmaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other, almost comic parallels in the two stories.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, ``60 Minutes II'' spoke to a disgruntled worker in  
the plutonium plant who, because of Russia's bankrupt economy, said 
he hasn't been paid in three months. In 1994, ``Dateline'' found a 
disgruntled senior manager at the plant who likewise said he hadn't 
been paid in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The same old story? Some would say it's the ongoing tussle  
between network newsmagazines, particularly the successful but 
flashy ``Dateline'' and the solid, no-frills ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said CBS spokeswoman Kerri Weitzberg, ``We are very disappointed  
that NBC has gone to such great lengths to disparage a strong piece 
of journalism from one of its competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of ``60 Minutes II,'' praised by one critic as ``a  
careful, almost reverential copy'' of its legendary forebear,'' had 
the highest Nielsen rating of any other network show Wednesday 
night.

<HEADLINE> Two Shot at Salt Lake TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman carrying a grocery bag filled with  
bullets entered a television studio lobby Thursday afternoon and 
opened fire. At least two people were wounded, one critically, 
according to hospital personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Craig Gleason said ``people were injured'' when the  
shooting began at about 3:15 p.m. at the KSL television and radio 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Video West technical operator Dan Nestel said he saw a woman  
wearing a light-colored parka, a hat and shooting range ear 
protection enter the KSL lobby and demand to speak to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	When her request was denied, Nestel said, she began firing  
random shots in the lobby. KSL radio employee Mary Kammeyer entered 
the lobby after hearing shots and was confronted by the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying, `Newsroom, newsroom, where's the newsroom?'''  
Kammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman eventually made her way to the fourth floor, where  
Gleason said she was apprehended. Her condition wasn't immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	LDS Hospital spokesman Jess Gomez said two victims were taken  
from the scene. One was transported to LDS and another to 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We received a 30-year-old female who is presently listed in  
extremely critical condition with a gunshot wound to the side of 
the head,'' Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Utah Medical Center spokesman John Dwan said a man  
admitted to his hospital was not seriously injured. He is under 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
	KSL is Salt Lake City's NBC affiliate and is owned by the Mormon  
Church.

<HEADLINE> Canada Rejects Hormone Use / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian health officials have rejected the  
genetically engineered dairy hormone BGH, upholding a ban on its 
use in cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, several groups have asked the federal  
government to pull the growth hormone off the market and 
re-evaluate the research it used to declare the compound safe in 
1993. The two senators from Vermont have asked the U.S. Health and 
Human Services Department to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, known as bovine growth hormone and also by the  
scientific name of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), is 
injected in cows to increase the amount of milk they give. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been approved in 29 countries.  
</P>
<P>
	But Health Canada, in a decision disclosed Thursday, rejected  
its use. An independent committee of scientists decided the risks 
posed to cows is too great. A separate committee found the drug 
poses no direct risks to human health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a decision that's based on more than nine years of  
comprehensive review,'' said Joel Weiner, an acting director of the 
Health Protection Branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we take the findings of the animal safety committee and  
combine them with our own assessment, it's pretty clear we have to 
reject the request for approval to use rBST in Canada. In our view, 
it presents an unacceptable threat to the safety of dairy cows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto, the St. Louis-based company that made the request, has  
invested millions of dollars developing the hormone, which is a 
bio-engineered version of a hormone cows produce naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said the company is not about to let all that go to  
waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not finished with the approval process,'' said Ray  
Mowling, a vice president of Monsanto Canada. ``We're going to 
respond to the animal side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The animal report said BGH increases the chance of mastitis, a  
bovine udder infection, by 25 percent, increases infertility by 18 
percent and increases the chance of lameness by about 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mowling said the 400-page report was riddled with errors. He  
also said Monsanto never got a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the Wisconsin Farmers Union said the Canadian  
decision was likely to revive debate over BGH. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a variety of people within this country that have  
never been satisfied that the right decision was made (on BGH), 
including some farmers,'' said Bob Denman, assistant to the 
president of the 2,000-member farmers union. ``Some farmers are for 
it and some farmers are against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His group's policy on BGH is to favor labeling to give consumers  
a choice whether they want dairy products from cows that were not 
injected with the hormone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cropp, an assistant professor of the University of  
Wisconsin Extension, said the Canadian action might prompt 
legislative efforts to restrict BGH use. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Center for Food Safety, Rural Vermont and other  
groups filed a petition asking that BGH be banned so that the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration can re-evaluate the research used to 
declare it safe. The groups said research in Canada suggests U.S. 
officials overlooked or ignored data about potential health risks 
that pointed to the need for additional testing.

<HEADLINE> Ford Expects $630M After-Tax Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. expects to slice $630  
million from its after-tax fourth-quarter earnings, or 51 cents a 
diluted share, in large part because of its early retirement 
program that reduced the company's work force by nearly 9,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time charges total $950 million before taxes. The  
largest portion, $730 million before taxes, is for the cost of the 
early retirement program that reduced Ford's work force by about 
2,200 people in North America, 2,000 in Europe and 4,600 in South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also will take a $110 million pretax charge to write off  
the loss related to its investment in Korea's bankrupt Kia Motors 
Corp. Ford sold its stake in Kia last month after its failed bid to 
take over the automaker in an auction. Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. 
won the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also expects to take a $110 million charge before taxes for  
the transfer of its Batavia, Ohio, transmission plant to a new 
joint venture formed by Ford and ZF Friedrichshafen AG of Germany 
to make a new high-tech transmission. That deal should be completed 
during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to release its fourth quarter earnings report next  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tyson, Botha Weigh In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson recently discovered a fund worth  
$200,000 that was established for him by the late Cus D'Amato, the 
man who saw boxing greatness in a 13-year-old reform school inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed,'' Tyson said. ``He must have known I was  
going to screw up my money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has gone through many millions of dollars and has had many  
well-documented ups and downs in and out of the ring since D'Amato 
died on Nov. 4, 1985, about a year before Tyson became, at age 20, 
the youngest heavyweight champion in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, Tyson opens a new chapter in his colorful,  
controversial career with a new manager (Shelly Finkel), a new 
promoter (America Presents) and a new trainer (Tommy Brooks). He 
also has two new tattoos to go with the likenesses of Chairman Mao 
and Arthur Ashe on his biceps -- a likeness of Che Guevara on his 
stomach and a tiger on his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	And a new attitude, says Finkel, who has replaced John Horne and  
Rory Holloway as Tyson's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 32 now and a lot more mature,'' Finkel said.  
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people are waiting for Tyson to prove it.  
</P>
<P>
	There will be a tie to the past in Tyson's 10-round fight  
against Francois Botha in the MGM Grand Garden. It was in that 
arena on June 28, 1997, that Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears, 
leading to his disqualification and the revocation of his license. 
It was restored last Oct. 19 by a 4-1 vote by the Nevada State 
Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was fined $3 million, but he lost many more millions of  
dollars by not being able to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Some astronomical figures have been reported for Tyson's purse  
for Saturday's night's pay-per-view bout, but Dan Goosen of America 
Presents said the contract is for $10 million. Not bad for a 
10-round non-title fight, but Tyson faces a $13 million IRS lien. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight also is being held midway between New Year's and Super  
Bowl weekends, two of the biggest Las Vegas weekends of the year. 
And the crowd probably will be closer to 10,000 than a sellout of 
some 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson officially weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds, the heaviest  
of his career by one pound. Botha weighed 233 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be fighting,'' said Tyson, who saw no  
significance in his weight. ``I've been training hard. I'm 32 years 
old, I've been putting on weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While saying he was happy to be fighting again, Tyson also said,  
``I don't remember the last time I was truly happy without worrying 
about something happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, Tyson will be sentenced in Maryland, where he  
pleaded no-contest to two misdemeanor assault charges stemming from 
a fender-bender involving his wife, Monica. He has settled out of 
court with two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford, who sentenced  
Tyson to 10 years in prison, suspending four years, for a rape 
conviction, could then take action that could send him back to 
prison for a parole violation. Tyson's probation is scheduled to 
end in March. He served three years in prison and was released 
March 25, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Key players in Tyson's career do not seem to think he will be  
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Larkin, in charge of boxing for Showtime, which has  
multiple-fight deals with Tyson, said he hopes Tyson can fight 
again April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's fight will be the first of a four-fight deal Tyson  
has with the MGM Grand. Tyson said he wants to fight four times 
this year. Both he and Larkin would like to cap the year with a 
third fight against Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	America Presents will promote the first two fights of Tyson's  
latest comeback, replacing Don King. Tyson and King are suing each 
other. Tyson also is involved with litigation with Horne and 
Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is the fifth trainer Tyson has had in a pro career that  
began in 1985. Jay Bright trained Tyson for his 11th-round loss to 
Holyfield, and Richie Giachetti was the trainer for the Bite Fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that happened to Mike was, he probably wasn't in  
shape and was getting hit with some stuff that he had no idea he 
could get hit with,'' said the 44-year-old Brooks, who has worked 
with Holyfield. ``He just lost it. I don't think he had a fight 
plan in either of the two fights with Holyfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my best is over,'' Tyson said. ``I just had a  
drought for a moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST. The Tyson-Botha match is  
expected to start no later than 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a world title fight on the card. Roberto Garcia of  
Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF junior lightweight championship 
against John John Molina, a former IBF junior lightweight champion 
from Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Media Fights Marine Corps Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A CBS lawyer told a military judge  
Thursday there was no good reason for prosecutors to seek notes and 
tapes from a yet-to-be-aired ``60 Minutes'' segment about the 
American military jet that sliced a ski gondola in Italy, killing 
20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor, however, argued that the interview with the pilot  
of the Marine jet that clipped the gondola cable Feb. 3 could shed 
light on what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he would rule on the motions by CBS and Rolling  
Stone magazine to quash prosecutors' subpoenas for notes and tapes 
sometime after the ``60 Minutes'' segment airs Jan. 24. Rolling 
Stone's story ran Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors especially want tape shot when the pilot, Capt.  
Richard Ashby, retraced the fatal flight Oct. 26 in a helicopter 
with CBS correspondent Mike Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the `60 Minutes' case, what more probative evidence is  
there than Ashby flying the down the route, telling ... how he 
maneuvered the jet in the air,'' said Maj. Daniel Daugherty, a 
prosecutor. ``That information is not available anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said CBS and Rolling Stone, which has off-the-record  
notes from its interview with Ashby, were duty-bound to help 
prosecutors determine why the tragedy occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to use the material at the courts-martial  
scheduled in February for Ashby, 31, pilot of the EA-6B Prowler, 
and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, the jet's navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar-jamming jet struck the ski gondola cable at 621 mph  
while flying at 370 feet, well below the 1,000-foot minimum that 
had been set for military training flights. Prosecutors contend the 
pilot flew recklessly, too low and too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer each are charged with 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter, 20 counts of negligent homicide as well 
as charges of destroying property and dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, said he might require CBS and  
Rolling Stone to submit the notes and tapes to him for a review, so 
he could decide what prosecutors should see. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS lawyer Floyd Abrams said CBS most likely would appeal if the  
judge ordered the network to turn over the notes and tapes without 
first reviewing it. That would discourage potential news sources 
from approaching the media in the future, Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not made-up concerns that led CBS to resist this  
subpoena,'' he said. ``It is a strongly felt sense that the Captain 
Ashbys of the world won't talk to them if information immediately 
becomes available to the government.''

<HEADLINE> Steinway Still Means Piano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strolling through the Steinway &AMP; Sons piano  
factory in Queens feels a little like crawling through the inside 
of a baby grand. 
</P>
<P>
	The place smells of sawdust and varnish, and its warehouse-sized  
workrooms are littered with piano parts -- carved wooden legs, 
massive metal sound boards, tiny felt hammers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most eye-catching, though, are the giant piano skeletons -- thick  
strips of hard maple each molded to form the curvaceous outline of 
a concert grand. The raw frames are everywhere you turn at Steinway 
&AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	They're stacked upright and unfinished in the wood-conditioning  
room, laid out for sanding nearby, then stained, lacquered and 
stuffed with the intricate array of parts that translate motion 
into music. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 workers, many of them veterans who have been with  
Steinway for decades, handcraft 3,100 pianos a year at the Long 
Island City factory, the headquarters and main production center 
for the world's premier piano-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Techniques haven't changed much since William Steinway opened  
the factory in 1876, 23 years after Steinway &AMP; Sons went into 
business in lower Manhattan. Power tools make sanding, sawing and 
drilling a lot easier, but otherwise workers proceed pretty much as 
their 19th-century forerunners -- slowly, and very, very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	From the lumberyard to the tuning room, it takes a full year to  
make a Steinway piano. 
</P>
<P>
	At that painstaking pace, Steinway makes just 2,500 grands and  
600 uprights a year at the Queens factory. A branch factory in 
Hamburg, Germany, makes 1,300 more pianos. By year's end, the 
company expects to have taken all the orders it can fill through 
the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Yamaha makes about 100,000 pianos a year, and Kawai,  
60,000 to 70,000. The difference is that close to 95 percent of the 
world's concert pianists play Steinways, according to the company, 
and it is rare to find a major music hall without one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steinway is obviously synonymous with piano all over the  
world,'' said performer Emanuel Ax. ``I think there's just for me a 
better quality sound and a better quality feel than any other 
instrument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some performers choose brands like Baldwin or the Vienna-made  
Bosendorfer, but almost all acknowledge Steinway's impressive 
sound, said Brian Majeski, editor of The Music Trades magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinway workmanship doesn't come cheap. Prices start at $13,900  
for a basic upright and $30,300 for the cheapest baby grand. 
Special models like the 9-foot ``Rhapsody'' piano, a glossy blue 
grand, can sell for more than $150,000. An 1880s Steinway was 
auctioned last year for $1.2 million, thought to be the highest 
price ever paid for a piano. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steinway &AMP; Sons story began in 1850, when Heinrich Engelhard  
Steinweg -- who later changed his name to Henry E. Steinway -- 
immigrated to New York with his family from Seesen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinway had been a prosperous piano-maker at home, and he and  
his sons apprenticed themselves to New York piano manufacturers 
when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1853, the clan was ready to go into business on its own. The  
senior Steinway, along with sons Henry Jr., William and Charles, 
began making pianos by hand in a Varick Street loft. 
</P>
<P>
	They sold 11 their first year. By 1860, Steinway &AMP; Sons was the  
biggest piano-maker in New York and one of the best in the world, 
said Richard Lieberman, author of ``Steinway &AMP; Sons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What set them apart from the competition?  
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, Steinway had an obsession with quality,''  
Lieberman said. ``They would go to a party, and the first thing 
they would do was go to the piano, open it up and see what was 
inside, see if there was anything they could learn from. They loved 
pianos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family cultivated relationships with well-known pianists,  
sponsoring the Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein's only 
American tour and bringing the Polish pianist Ignace Paderewski to 
play in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Paderewski ``was the Babe Ruth of the whole thing,'' says Henry  
Z. Steinway, Heinrich's 83-year-old great-grandson and the last 
family member to run the company. ``That guy, who was apparently 
very handsome and had a lot of charisma, wowed everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, who appeared in advertisements  
for the company in the 1920s, was ``scary,'' Steinway said. ``He 
had this long, lugubrious face ... and as soon as he walked on the 
stage, you got this vibration that SOMEONE was there. ... Very 
imposing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Steinway legends included Vladimir Horowitz, who performed  
from the 1920s to the early '50s, and Artur Rubinstein whose piano 
genius reached glorious heights in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinway, wearing rumpled gray pants and an olive-green bow tie  
in his office at Steinway Hall in midtown Manhattan, recalled them 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubinstein ``was more sort of emotional. Lousy with charm. ...  
He liked girls, he liked cigars, liked living, good food. .... 
Horowitz was all piano, that was what he did. ... This guy had a 
feeling in his fingers that was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business boomed through the early years of the century but  
sagged during the Depression. During World War II, the company 
stopped making pianos altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies were scarce and many employees went off to war, so the  
company filled its Queens plant with women and made wooden glider 
planes for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, the Nazis ordered the Hamburg factory to make  
airplane decoys and other supplies; later, it was badly damaged by 
Allied bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition (in the United States) would spread a few  
happy words about how we were all Nazis,'' Steinway said. ``And in 
Germany, they would say, 'Don't buy from those Jews in New York, 
the Steinways are all Jews.' So we got it on both ends.'' The 
family is not Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were flat through much of the 1950s and '60s, and family  
members began pressuring Steinway, who headed the company for 22 
years, to sell. In 1972 he gave in, accepting an offer from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult for many people, especially my mother,'' he  
recalled. ``I didn't know until the last minute whether she was 
going to vote for it or against it at the stockholders' meeting. 
... I couldn't blame her, because she'd watched my father sweat it 
out through the tough times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, CBS sold Steinway &AMP; Sons to a pair of Boston investors,  
John and Robert Birmingham. The Selmer Company, owned by former 
Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bankers Dana Messina and Kyle 
Kirkland, paid $100 million for the company in 1995 and took it 
public a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Today business is solid. Sales for 1997 and 1998 were expected  
to show the first significant upturn in 20 years, Majeski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers say the devotion to quality that made Steinway &AMP; Sons  
famous still prevails. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part craftsmanship and it's partly artistic also, because  
there are so many fine points in doing this job,'' said Michael 
Selak, a 16-year Steinway veteran winding strings onto sound 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the man who sold Steinway &AMP; Sons sorry he let go of his  
family's greatest heirloom? 
</P>
<P>
	Steinway, who is long retired but spends much of his time  
rifling through the company's old papers, says no. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a natural progression in American business,'' he said.  
``It starts with a founder and an idea, and the family carries it 
on, and eventually the family bows out and it becomes public. ... I 
don't regret it at all.''

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Rate for Hispanics Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of diabetes among Hispanic adults in the  
United States and Puerto Rico is nearly double that of their white 
counterparts, the federal government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that a study  
based on data from 1994-97 found 6 percent of Hispanics age 18 and 
older had diabetes. When adjusted for the age differences between 
the two races, the prevalence of diabetes among Hispanics was 8 
percent compared to 4 percent for non-Hispanic whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hispanics 65 and older, 21.4 percent were diabetic,  
compared with 12 percent for those age 45 to 64 and 2.3 percent for 
those age 18 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that the prevalence of diabetes among  
Hispanics varies by geographic location. Those in Puerto Rico, the 
West and Southwest were more likely to have diabetes than Hispanics 
in other regions of the United States, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first study to show diabetes prevalence among all  
Hispanics in the United States and Puerto Rico, the CDC said. 
Previous studies focused on Hispanics were conducted on 
Mexican-Americans and found that one of every 10 Mexican-Americans 
age 20 and older was diabetic.

<HEADLINE> Bure Trade May Have To Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks will  
either trade holdout star Pavel Bure by early next week or wait 
until the March 23 trading deadline to make a deal, general manager 
Brian Burke said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the quality of the offers will improve,'' Burke  
said. ``If I'm close on something Monday night, it'll carry over 
one day. Otherwise we'll put it on hold until the deadline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he would postpone trade talks until the deadline,  
Burke said: ``We've waited this long. If the quality of the offers 
doesn't improve to the point where the trade makes sense, they're 
not going to before the deadline. I told teams to step up and do it 
now or you're going to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke believes it will be easier to make a trade in March when  
playoff contenders will be more desperate to deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who has scored 50 or more goals three times in his career,  
has missed the entire season after announcing he would never play 
again for the Canucks. Bure, suspended without pay, is in the final 
year of a five-year deal with Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> How Networks Dealt With Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When President Clinton's impeachment trial  
reconvenes, the Big Three TV networks plan to be there -- at least, 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial began in earnest Thursday, most network affiliates  
resumed usual programming less than two hours after it began, 
leaving coverage to public TV and specialized cable outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to providing viewers with an overview of  
what's happening,'' said ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``We are 
continuing to monitor the trial, and if news warrants, we'll break 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast network PBS and cable's CNN, Fox News Channel and  
MSNBC, as well as Court TV and C-SPAN II, planned to carry today's 
testimony in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	Like CBS and NBC, ABC made an ongoing feed of the trial  
available to its stations Thursday but gave them the option to 
break away at about 2:30 p.m. EST. By then, viewers had heard 
opening remarks from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee, and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Visually, it wasn't much -- simply congressmen speaking in turn  
from the well of the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, D-Tenn., played a videotape that showed the  
president taking his oath of office on the steps of the Capitol. 
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., brought clips of Clinton's Aug. 17 
grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Most visual aids were white-text-on-blue-background charts. And  
CNN senior analyst Jeff Greenfield observed that among the 
speeches, stemwinders were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people viewing at home might say, `This is pretty  
cut-and-dried stuff,''' Greenfield remarked during a mid-afternoon 
recess. ``Brilliant rhetoric just doesn't really work when you're 
addressing 100 sophisticated men and women who are waiting to hear 
the facts of the case.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Premieres `60 Minutes II' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The watch ticks on Wednesday, too. Long may it  
tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years after ``60 Minutes'' signed on, CBS on Wednesday  
night debuted its much-anticipated spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' clearly aims to be a clone of the original,  
legendary CBS News magazine. Based on opening night, it's poised to 
pull that off. 
</P>
<P>
	With executive producer Jeff Fager at the helm, the new show  
felt instantly familiar and mostly satisfying. It even had a bona 
fide ``Hey, Mildred!'' story -- that's ``60 Minutes'' creator Don 
Hewitt's term for a piece so interesting you call your spouse in to 
watch it with you -- by visiting Krasnoyarsk-26, a secret Siberian 
city where plutonium is made for nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, good as it was, the segment was oversold as something of a  
scoop. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter George Crile was described by Dan Rather as ``the first  
American journalist to enter Krasnoyarsk-26 with a television 
crew.'' But this morning a representative of rival ``Dateline NBC'' 
distributed a tape showing the ``Dateline'' had covered much of the 
same ground in a piece that aired in December 1994, with 
correspondent Fred Francis reporting from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Francis didn't gain access to the nuclear plant buried  
deep inside a mountain, as Crile did, ``Dateline's'' report 
included similar footage obtained from ``an expatriate Russian 
filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an important story of nuclear proliferation that we  
advanced,'' CBS spokeswoman Kerri Weitzberg said today. ``It was a 
rock-solid piece, and if the reaction by critics and viewers means 
anything, they seem to agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' was born of economic, not journalistic,  
necessity. CBS needs a hit and the bosses figured another 
newsmagazine with the ``60 Minutes'' label has a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiercely protective of the original's heritage and Top 10  
status, Hewitt and fellow ``60 Minutes'' stalwarts were initially 
against any such brand extension. But they were won over. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the familiar ``tick, tick, tick'' that begins at 9 p.m. EST  
Wednesday hopes to win over enough viewers from ABC's ``Drew 
Carey'' and even Fox's ``Party of Five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary Nielsen ratings declared victory: In 40 metered  
cities, the broadcast was the night's most-watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the ticking stopwatch, the popular Sunday components  
were there. The magazine cover (here revealing a Roman numeral II 
as the corner of the page dog-ears). A correspondent introducing 
each story, laid out as a magazine spread for the background. And 
most important, three stories told grippingly and with no nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Mike Wallace was on hand for the debut, updating a story he  
did 17 years ago on Vietnam children fathered by American 
servicemen and left behind after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	This ```60 Minutes' Classic'' (to be a regular feature) was the  
hour's only disappointment. The reprised report dragged in its 
retelling, and the update, although heartwarming, was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has promise, however -- a little nourishment from the  
other show's archives and stars can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two pieces came from the new show's own team, which  
includes correspondents Rather, Charlie Rose, Bob Simon and Vicki 
Mabrey, as well as contributor Carol Marin. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time for the Senate's impeachment trial of President  
Clinton, Marin profiled David Schippers in ``Leading the Charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marin showed how Schippers -- a Democrat who is the chief  
investigator for the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee -- has 
played a major role in the drive to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final ``tick, tick, tick,'' the show's surrogate Andy  
Rooney, humorist Jimmy Tingle, offered the first installment of his 
``Uncommon Sense.'' He reflected on the peculiar happenings of 
1998, among them that ``Newt Gingrich resigned, practicing what he 
preached: term limits.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Get List for Expansion Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Just what the Browns needed: more names to  
choose from. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shopping for a head coach, Cleveland will get a list from  
the NFL on Friday of 130 players the Browns can choose from for 
next month's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Resumes and scouting reports are piling up on desks at the  
team's Berea headquarters as fast as the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
	And as long as the airport stays open, Browns president Carmen  
Policy plans to interview Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris 
Palmer for the Browns' head coaching position on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will be the fourth candidate brought in by Policy, who  
has previously met with Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick, Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Atlanta 
offensive line coach Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer already has interviewed with Baltimore owner Art Modell,  
who also owned the old Cleveland franchise. Palmer also has been 
said to be headed to Northwestern if Wildcats coach Gary Barnett 
leaves for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, 26 teams submitted lists to the league office  
of five players they would make available to the Browns for the 
Feb. 9 draft in Canton. Only the four teams in this weekend's 
conference championship games were exempt from filing, but they'll 
have to submit five names when their seasons end. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those already known to be available: a Moose, a former  
Super Bowl MVP and a quarterback known for banging his head into a 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns, who already have signed 14 free agents, can  
select 30 to 42 expansion players. Cleveland must use 38 percent of 
its projected $60 million salary cap on such players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns inherit the salary of any draftee, making the size of  
his contract as important as his ability or stature. 
</P>
<P>
	Some intriguing names are out there. There are also some  
bargains and busts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Desmond Howard returned a kickoff 99 yards for a  
touchdown in Green Bay's Super Bowl victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl MVP bolted to Oakland, signing a four-year, $6  
million deal. He caught just two passes this season and could play 
his next one in Cleveland, where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Redskins once thought Gus Frerotte would be their  
QB after the seventh-round pick beat out Heath Shuler for the 
starting job in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frerotte, who after scoring a touchdown in 1997 injured his  
neck by head-butting a concrete wall, lost his job this year to 
Trent Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte's experience makes him attractive to the Browns. His  
annual salary of nearly $6 million does not. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Daryl Johnston, a k a ``Moose'' Johnston, a  
two-time Pro Bowl fullback for the Dallas Cowboys. Johnston turns 
33 next month and his base pay will jump to $1.25 million next 
season. That prompted Dallas to make him available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands this is today's NFL,'' Johnston's agent, Leigh  
Steinberg, said. ``His preference is to stay with the Cowboys on 
this contract, but if Cleveland picks him he'll graciously go and 
give them his best efforts.''

<HEADLINE> Morris Returns to Reds As Backup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- First baseman Hal Morris was reluctant to  
leave the Cincinnati Reds a year ago -- but the team's payroll 
slashing left him no option. 
</P>
<P>
	A free agent once again, Morris has decided to return for less  
money and less playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris agreed to a one-year contract Thursday and a role as a  
backup first baseman and pinch hitter. The nonguaranteed contract 
will pay him $400,000, according to a source speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also agreed to a one-year contract with pitcher Dennys  
Reyes, who came to Cincinnati in the midseason trade for closer 
Jeff Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who will be 34 on April 9, hit .309 in 127 games last  
season for Kansas City, which declined to offer him salary 
arbitration. Morris made $1 million with the Royals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the Reds from 1990-97, hitting better than .300 in  
five of those eight seasons. His best season was in 1996, when he 
hit safely in 29 consecutive games, led the team with 165 hits and 
drove in a career-high 80 runs even though he broke his elbow in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be a pinch-hitter and backup to Sean Casey, who is  
projected as the Reds' first baseman of the future. General manager 
Jim Bowden said Morris understands his role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going ahead with our youth movement, and Sean Casey will  
play first base and Dmitri Young will play left field and Hal is 
not going to get the opportunity to compete for a job,'' Bowden 
said. ``Once a player accepts his role, he becomes very valuable, 
like Lenny Harris was for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds let Morris leave as a free agent after the 1997 season  
because they were reducing their payroll. They chose not to pick up 
his 1998 option for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City signed Morris primarily as a designated hitter to  
replace Chili Davis. He started 40 games at first base and 37 in 
the outfield and was the DH in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pinch hit in 10 games and went 2-for-10 with one double  
and two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Morris got 472 at-bats and hit .309 with one homer and  
40 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can still hit. He's a left-handed bat,'' Bowden said.  
``This is a guy who's work ethic is phenomenal. He's a good 
influence on the younger players. As a left-hander, he gives you 
flexibility on a double-switch late in the game.''

President Clinton, telling senators in a rebuttal brief today that

	Brazil's Main Market Opens Higher  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's main market was sharply  
higher today in early trading, a day after its Central Bank 
president resigned and Brazil decided to let its currency slide 
against the U.S. dollar. Brazil's action raised fears that the 
18-month-old financial crisis that has battered Asia and Russia had 
not gone away and could bring down other economies in Latin 
America. Traders also worry that U.S. multinational companies 
operating in Brazil could take a big profit hit.

	U.S. Wants Inspectors Back in Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is huddling with  
U.S. allies to try to find a way to get weapons inspectors back to 
Iraq to spur the country's disarmament. But while the 
administration is seeking to keep the pressure on Iraq on 
inspections, it also is signaling a new U.S. willingness to ease 
restrictions on Iraqi humanitarian purchases. That could involve 
streamlining the way the U.N. sanctions committee clears supplies 
of food, medicine and other humanitarian items, U.S. officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Sues 76ers Guard for Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. has sued  
Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson for more than $28,500 in 
unpaid lease payments on three late-model cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed in Montgomery County Court also asks for the  
return of the cars and for the total buyout amount, about $300,000, 
on the 24-month lease vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's agent, David Falk, referred comment to the guard's  
attorney. Lawyer Larry Woodward said he was confident the claim 
would be settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it turns out he's behind (on his payments), we'll take care  
of it,'' Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Iverson makes more than $3 million a year from the  
76ers. But the NBA lockout forced players to miss several checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Pat Croce said Iverson had endorsement money coming  
in during the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he gets a very healthy income from Reebok, a  
seven-figure deal,'' Croce said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Iverson owes lease payments on 1997,  
1998, and 1999 Mercedes vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first problem Iverson has had with his Mercedes.  
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, two men driving a Mercedes registered to Iverson  
were arrested in Hampton, Va., on drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Fosse's Dance Musical Exhausting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Watching ``Fosse,'' Broadway's exhausting new  
dance musical, is a little like eating an entire box of chocolates 
at one sitting. Individual pieces are delicious, but the overall 
experience leaves you stuffed, with a twang or two of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuffed because despite the high energy and talent of the large  
cast, this three-act celebration of choreographer Bob Fosse churns 
on forever. And guilt because one feels the production at the 
Broadhurst Theater should be more satisfying, considering the 
genius this musical is saluting. 
</P>
<P>
	Fosse, who died in 1987, was an original, a man with a unique  
dance vocabulary. With Jerome Robbins, Gower Champion and Michael 
Bennett, he shaped the way Broadway musicals moved in the boom 
years following the Second World War. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mistaking Fosse's style, a combination of sex,  
sleaze and fondness for show biz. It dazzled audiences with quirky 
moves and odd angles. Fosse dances were not about character. They 
exuded attitude, flash and flesh. It's hard to build an entire show 
around all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Richard Maltby Jr. has not given ``Fosse'' much shape  
or forward motion. The evening doesn't build, chronologically or 
emotionally. The running order of the numbers could be reshuffled 
and there would not be much change in the musical's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because much of ``Fosse'' is rooted in pure dance.  
Several of the numbers are amalgamations, inspired by a parade of 
Fosse creations, rather than exact duplications of his work. After 
a while, the moves begin to look alike. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' another voluminous  
retrospective, ``Fosse'' makes no attempt to place the dance pieces 
from the master's various Broadway musicals, movies and television 
specials in the context of their original productions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robbins'' expensively recreated sets and costumes. Here, set  
and costume designer Santo Loquasto has come up with simple yet 
generic settings (for the most part, a series of proscenium arches 
and a bit of Las Vegas glitz). 
</P>
<P>
	There also are the signature Fosse black outfits, bowler hats  
and white gloves and serviceable costumes for several of the more 
elaborate numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are some amazing moments, recreated by  
co-choreographers Ann Reinking and Chet Walker. For much of the 
last 20 years, dance has been a Broadway orphan. Can you recall the 
choreography from such big Brit musicals as ``Les Miserables'' or 
``The Phantom of the Opera'' or ``Miss Saigon''? 
</P>
<P>
	``Fosse'' shows why dance could lift a musical higher than the  
biggest star or the most persistent melody. The best scenes here 
recreate dances from such hit musicals as ``The Pajama Game,'' 
``Damn Yankees'' and ``Sweet Charity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can almost hear the audience sigh with contentment as Jane  
Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex Sanchez strut, slouch and 
swivel their way through ``Steam Heat,'' a classic dance trio from 
``The Pajama Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the genial Scott Wise, the show's unofficial master of  
ceremonies, reiterates why he is probably the best song-and-dance 
man currently on Broadway. He exudes a sunny confidence, a genial 
vaudeville style equally at home in tap and the more athletic 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the show's few sung interludes, the vocally superb  
Valarie Pettiford smokes her way through ``Life Is Just a Bowl of 
Cherries,'' a standard used in Fosse's last musical, ``Big Deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show ends with a re-creation of Benny Goodman's ``Sing,  
Sing, Sing,'' which wowed audiences in the 1978 Fosse revue 
``Dancin'.'' It still does, particularly when the astonishing 
Elizabeth Parkinson takes over the stage in the number's trumpet 
section. I swear the woman levitates. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one serious misstep, the inclusion of two snippets from  
``Chicago,'' which is playing next door at the Shubert Theater. 
``Chicago'' -- hands down and feet first -- is still the best musical 
on Broadway, and the ``Fosse'' recreation of ``Hot Honey Rag'' just 
isn't in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its length, it's hard not to come away from ``Fosse''  
hungering for more. Not for the arty, abstract creations that stuff 
this show, but for the original musicals Fosse helped create and 
his dances that made them soar.

<HEADLINE> Old Essay Haunts Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An economist testifying for Microsoft at its  
antitrust trial was confronted Thursday by government attorneys 
with an essay he wrote 16 years ago that appeared to contradict his 
testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``My immediate reaction is, what could I have been thinking?''  
said economist Richard Schmalensee. ``But I'm happy to discuss it. 
....It does not provide a good indication of my present views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, testified Thursday that Microsoft's high profits are 
not sufficient evidence alone to conclude that the software giant 
wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies then showed Schmalensee a  
1982 essay in the Harvard Law Review in which he wrote that 
``persistent, excess profits provide a good indication of long-run 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft used its influence as the  
maker of the dominant Windows operating system to try to ``crush'' 
rival Netscape Communications Corp., whose popular Internet 
software competes with Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the government's most sensational charges is that  
Microsoft sought to illegally collude to divide the market for 
Internet software during a June 1995 meeting with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has called the charge ``an  
outrageous lie,'' saying the meeting ``was to discuss various 
technologies Microsoft proposed sharing with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before it ended the presentation of its case Wednesday, the  
government released more than 2,000 pages of documents, including 
some e-mail messages about the June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In one exchange, Microsoft's Dan Rosen told Gates that Netscape  
``seemed OK'' with the company's plans to build Internet software 
features into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But co-worker Thomas Reardon, who also was at the meeting,  
called Rosen's assessment ``bunk'' and told Gates, ``There was a 
noticeable increase in the level of tension'' on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates wrote to another executive praising Reardon for ``reading  
the situation pretty well,'' and he called Rosen's opinions 
``great, but I agree he is being a little naive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft executive  
wrote five weeks after the meeting confirming that the company had 
intended ``to leverage a relationship with Netscape ... to cede the 
(browser) to us or at least give us some major advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Rosen wrote: ``If no agreement, we should gear up  
to compete.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker's Theater Now a Courtroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 140 years the United States Senate chamber  
has served as a stage set for high statesmanship and low comedy, a 
theater whose only play is the developing story of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, for the second time in its 14 decades, the Senate  
chamber became a courtroom for a president. Represented by his 
lawyers, President Clinton went on trial before the current cast of 
100 senators for perjury and obstruction of justice in an 
impeachment case stemming from his relationship with a former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Senate chamber had been a legislative forum for a little  
more than eight years when, on May 16, 1868, senators rising one by 
one in utter silence failed by one vote to oust President Andrew 
Johnson from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The waiting newspapers exploded:  
</P>
<P>
	``EXTRA -- Impeachment! -- The Great Day! -- Intense Excitement!''  
The Washington Evening Star trumpeted in a column of bullet 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	And then the facts: ``On This Question, Yeas 35, Nays, 19. The  
Vote Admitted to be a Virtual Acquittal!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had staged a drama as full of tumult and meaning for  
the future as any played out in the meeting hall it had recently 
outgrown. Now known as the Old Senate Chamber, that room is 50 
paces or so down the Capitol's central corridor from the current 
chamber, which was built as part of an expansion of the Capitol in 
the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators first trooped through the double swinging doors of the  
new hall on Jan. 4, 1859. 
</P>
<P>
	The television audience watching the Clinton trial can see both  
the majesty of the chamber and relics of its storied past. C-Span 
television cameras were installed in the chamber in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two large brass spittoons in the front row, reminders  
of the age when gentlemen chewed tobacco. There are silver-mounted 
glass bottles fitted into each desk and filled with fine gray sand 
for drying ink, a necessity in the era before the ballpoint pen. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty of the 100 desks where senators will sit in unaccustomed  
silence through prosecution and defense are Senate originals. 
</P>
<P>
	They were built to order by New York cabinet maker Thomas  
Constantine in 1819 to replace the Senate furniture used for tinder 
and incinerated when the invading British army burned the Capitol 
five years before. The other 60 desks are replicas. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Webster, one of the Senate's giants, carved his name with  
a penknife under the top lid of his old desk, where it remains. 
</P>
<P>
	When the desk used by Sen. Jefferson Davis, before he became  
president of the Confederacy, was pointed out to a patriotic Union 
soldier he promptly stabbed it with his bayonet. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had stood beside it just a month earlier, telling senators  
he was going home to Mississippi ``not in hostility to you, but in 
love and allegiance to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, with the South's cause lost in war and the Senate  
chamber vacated by Union troops who broiled bacon in its marble 
fireplaces, the Davis desk was inherited by Sen. Hiram Revels, also 
of Mississippi. He was the first black ever to serve in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Much closer to the present, the late Democratic Sen. John  
Stennis, another Mississippian, enjoyed showing visitors the neat 
slice of veneer used to repair the Davis desk. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Stennis lost a leg to disease he still insisted on  
standing beside that desk to speak. Senators stand when they 
address the Senate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Senate moved to its new chamber it also took along the  
small, ivory, hand-held gavel that by tradition Vice President John 
Adams used to rap the very first Senate session to order in the 
spring of 1789. 
</P>
<P>
	Splintered with age, it was replaced by a new and similar ivory  
gavel supplied by the government of India and accepted by Vice 
President Richard Nixon. It will be used for the Clinton trial as 
the original was for Andrew Johnson's. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, as they did in 1868, House prosecutors faced the  
president's defenders at long tables placed near the front of the 
chamber. Extra chairs were provided on the floor for House members 
wishing to attend. Tickets were issued for the public galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Many changes to the chamber over the years will also be on  
display for the television cameras. At least one change came about 
in part because of TV -- the blue drapes and carpet replaced a beige 
decor that some senators complained looked shabby on TV.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Gear Up for Long Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- After playing with Michael Jordan and  
winning three NBA championships, Toni Kukoc has a few thoughts 
about being on a team that can't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	No way. No thanks. Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows how great it is to be at the top of the NBA. And he  
decided on the way up that he didn't like the view those lesser 
teams have. So with Jordan already gone and Scottie Pippen one foot 
out the door, Kukoc says the Chicago Bulls are better off just 
scrapping it all and starting over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Jordan retired, the brutal reality of the Bulls'  
future without him is sinking in. Only four players -- Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are under contract, with 
Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget about signing enough good players to make a mediocre  
team, Kukoc said. That's only prolonging the agony. The rebuilding 
threat has been hanging over Chicago for two seasons, so it's time 
to just go ahead and do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Kukoc said the timing couldn't be better. Instead of  
bad basketball for 82 games, the Bulls and their fans will only 
have to endure it for 50. When the season ends, Chicago could have 
a top draft pick and, with plenty of cap money, be a big player in 
free agency next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings than six, but we  
would be here and talking about, `What do you think about 
rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that it's better 
to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's coming soon. Pippen's name is popping up frequently on  
the NBA rumor mill. There's talk he could sign outright with 
Houston, or sign a long-term, big-money deal with the Bulls and 
then be traded away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, another one of the Bulls' free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Luc Longley appears to be headed for Phoenix. Fan  
favorite Steve Kerr might soon be wearing a Detroit Pistons 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bulls will get ... Does it matter?  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's certainly 
probably not going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. The Bulls are probably going to  
stick with the triangle offense, and while the system isn't 
complicated, it's not easy to learn, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him about 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable 
with it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other out on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need a new floor leader, too. Harper is liked and  
trusted by everyone on the team, but Kukoc said he's willing to 
step up, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe not in this kind of circumstances, but I'll accept it,''  
he said when asked if he wants to take on a bigger role. ``It's 
going to be different and it might take a while, but I'll take the 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Inflation Stayed Low in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big drop in gasoline prices last year shrank  
U.S. inflation to the lowest level since the 1960s, and Americans 
responded to the increased purchasing power with a spending spree 
on autos and other retail goods. 
</P>
<P>
	With a scant 0.1 percent rise in December, consumer prices rose  
just 1.6 percent for all of 1998, even less than the 1.7 percent 
increase in 1997, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the 
best back-to-back annual inflation performance since 1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, retail sales -- representing a third of the nation's  
economic output -- surged 5.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, 
an improvement over the 4.3 percent gain in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers just aren't leaving this party,'' said economist  
Bill Cheney of John Hancock. ``Buoyed by a strong job market, 
rising wages, low interest rates, almost nonexistent inflation, a 
soaring stock market ... they aren't even getting tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers got an added boost in December, when sales jumped 0.9  
percent -- 2.5 percent for autos and 0.4 percent for everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, auto sales increased 5.7 percent, despite strikes  
that halted General Motors' production in June and July. Auto 
companies sold 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year, the 
most in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in Americans' appetite for consumption came at an  
opportune time, offsetting weaker export sales and factory 
production, the result of slumping demand in Asia and elsewhere 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists are looking for the weakness to spread to the  
rest of the U.S. economy this year, slowing the growth in consumer 
spending for both services and retail goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the U.S. unemployment rate at the end of 1998 was at a  
29-year low of 4.3 percent, there are signs of trouble in the job 
market. The number of first-time applications for unemployment 
benefits soared 83,000 during the week ended Dec. 26, the biggest 
increase in six years. The number has only partly recovered in the 
weeks since, falling 16,000 the next week and an additional 4,000 -- 
to 352,000 -- during the week ended Jan. 9 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest threat to consumer spending is the labor market,  
if ... job losses aren't offset by new jobs,'' said economist Allen 
Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a speech in Charlotte, N.C., Michael J. Prell, the  
Federal Reserve's top staff economist, said ``the enormous increase 
in household wealth, owing primarily ... to the rise in the stock 
market ... probably is enough'' to fuel continued robust consumer 
spending for several more quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, though, continued jitters about Brazil, a major  
U.S. trading partner, sent stocks reeling again. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks plunged 229 points, on top of 
Wednesday's 125-point loss, to close at 9,121 -- down 5.4 percent 
since Jan. 8 and 0.7 percent since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, after the collapse of Russia's economy triggered  
panic on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve moved swiftly to calm 
markets, cutting short-term interest rates three times during the 
fall and stocks rebounded smartly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prell warned against ``an exaggerated confidence in the  
ability of the Fed to cushion the economy and financial markets 
against any and all shocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In details of last year's inflation performance, the Labor  
Department said energy prices fell 8.8 percent, the most in 12 
years. That included a 15.4 percent decrease for gasoline. Food 
prices rose 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Core prices, minus the volatile food and energy sectors, rose  
2.4 percent, up slightly from 2.2 percent in 1997. But a record 
31.8 percent increase for tobacco, reflecting tobacco companies' 
drive to recoup the multibillion-dollar cost of state liability 
settlements, accounted for all of the acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
	In other problem areas, prescription drug and education costs  
both jumped nearly 5 percent. But Asian competition helped hold 
prices unchanged for new cars, pushed down clothing costs 0.7 
percent and computer prices 36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales in 1998 were strongest at building-supply and  
hardware stores, up 10.3 percent, and furniture stores, up 8.6 
percent, both reflecting record home sales, which in turn reflected 
the lowest mortgage rates since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Department stores reported a 6.7 percent rise in receipts.

<HEADLINE> Bribery Scandal Reaches USOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The widening Olympic bribery  
scandal reached into the U.S. Olympic Committee for the first time 
on Thursday when a senior official resigned because of his 
relationship with the Salt Lake City bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the USOC said it had accepted the resignation of  
Alfredo La Mont, the organization's senior director of 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont, who had been on what the statement called  
``administrative leave,'' was the USOC's main contact official with 
international sports federations and other Olympic committees as 
well as with the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier this week,'' the USOC statement quoted executive  
director Dick Schultz as saying, ``Mr. La Mont provided us with 
information concerning a previously undisclosed business 
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee 
through the office of former SLOC President Tom Welch. We concluded 
that Mr. La Mont's activities, which he indicated he pursued 
independent of his USOC responsibilities, nonetheless constituted a 
conflict of interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC statement said that information on the La Mont-Welch  
relationship has been provided to two of the four organizations 
investigating the IOC bribery scandal, the USOC Special Commission 
chaired by former Sen. George Mitchell and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those panels, as well those representing the IOC and SLOC, are  
looking into possible influencing of IOC members in exchange for 
votes backing Salt Lake's candidacy for the 2002 Olympic Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members face possible expulsion for ``serious''  
offenses in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and four others face 
minor charges, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Thursday 
in an interview with The Associated Press at IOC headquarters in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. Samaranch didn't identify the IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont was a close associate of Robert Helmick, head of the  
USOC and a member of the IOC who became enmeshed in what until 
recently was the biggest scandal in the IOC's 104-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Helmick resigned both Olympic posts after an  
investigation by Arnold Burns, a former deputy U.S. attorney 
general, found the Des Moines, Iowa, lawyer had ``repeatedly 
violated conflict-of-interest provisions of the USOC and created a 
perception that he was trafficking on his Olympic positions for the 
benefit of private clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns report never was adopted by the USOC or the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned in 1997 as head of Salt Lake organizers amid  
allegations of spouse abuse, has said he used a privately funded 
program to pay for favors of IOC members. It was, he said, common 
practice in the Olympic bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, Welch's successor, resigned last week as the  
bribery scandal widened.

<HEADLINE> Surprise Strike at Air France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A surprise strike by some maintenance workers  
forced Air France to cancel at least 17 domestic flights on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run airline said about 20 maintenance workers blocked  
pilots' access to their planes at Orly airport, south of Paris, 
forcing the cancellations. Domestic and international flights also 
were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The day-long strike also affected Charles de Gaulle airport,  
north of the capital and the hub for transatlantic flights. Details 
on the impact there were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	An accord signed Wednesday between unions representing ground  
personnel and Air France that established a framework for a 35-hour 
work week triggered the strike, according to Air France. The 
airline said the workers also are demanding a bonus for working 
nights.

<HEADLINE> Crucial Phase for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four months after Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr brought the impeachment drama to Congress, House prosecutors 
seeking President Clinton's removal are getting to make their case 
in a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers start presenting their evidence today without  
knowing whether the Senate will accede to their request for 
witnesses, including former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and, 
perhaps, Clinton himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and the rest of  
the House managers have discussed calling Clinton but have made no 
final decisions, according to prosecution officials. Under Senate 
rules, Clinton is the only witness who could not be subpoenaed to 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers rejected a House request to interview  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said his opening statement on  
behalf of the prosecution team would focus on ``laying out the case 
and showing very clearly that the president committed an 
impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House case will continue Friday and possibly Saturday.  
Clinton's lawyers will follow next week with a vigorous defense 
contending he is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of justice 
and that the charges, even if proved, do not rise to the level of 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of the White House rebuttal, a trial brief  
submitted Wednesday asked, ``If the Senate removes this president 
for a wrongful relationship he hoped to keep private, for what will 
the House ask the Senate to remove the next president, and the 
next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyde insisted that the matter had to be pressed forward,  
regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the senators ``decide is perfectly acceptable to me. I  
won't lose sleep over either ... verdict. But I will lose sleep if 
we lay down on the job and didn't do our level best,'' Hyde said on 
ABC's ``Nightline'' program on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hyde also said threats have been made against  
his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House lawyers and the House prosecutors each can make  
arguments for 24 hours spread over three days, if all the allotted 
time is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges, in the first presidential impeachment trial since  
1868, relate to Clinton's attempts to cover up his sexual 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to prosecution staff members contacting Ms.  
Lewinsky's attorney, two House prosecutors joined staff members in 
speaking with another potential witness, Kathleen Willey, legal 
sources said on condition of anonymity. One source identified the 
lawmakers as Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Asa Hutchinson, 
R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey is a former White House volunteer who contends  
Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in a room near the Oval 
Office in 1993. House managers are divided over attempting to call 
her, since the House did not use any evidence of her involvement 
with Clinton in building its impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some House prosecutors believe there could be a connection to  
the obstruction charge if there was any attempt to intimidate her 
by the president or his allies. Starr is investigating that subject 
with a grand jury meeting in Alexandria, Va., a Washington suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	After The Associated Press reported that prosecution staff  
members spoke with Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, House Judiciary Committee 
spokesman Paul McNulty confirmed the contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee contacted Monica Lewinsky's attorneys to  
determine whether she would be available for an interview,'' he 
said. ``They declined to make her available. The committee is duty 
bound ... to be thoroughly prepared to present its case to the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty said the House committee was authorized under its  
existing subpoena power to compel her testimony, but has not chosen 
to do so. He also noted that if the Senate eventually OKs her 
appearance as a witness, she could be compelled to testify under 
Senate subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his first public comments in three weeks on the  
trial, said Wednesday that lawmakers ``have their job to do in the 
Senate, and I have mine. I trust that the right thing will be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House, the president said, ``The important  
thing for me is to spend as little time thinking about that as 
possible and as much time working on the issues we're here to 
discuss as possible. I need to work on the business of the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, officials said Democrats had suggested canceling  
next Tuesday's scheduled trial session to avoid an awkward 
appearance on the day of Clinton's scheduled State of the Union 
address. Senate Republicans discussed the issue at a closed-door 
meeting during the day. Most were opposed, according to sources 
familiar with the discussion, since Clinton had declined to 
reschedule his speech, but no final decision was made.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Gear Up for Long Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- After playing with Michael Jordan and  
winning three NBA championships, Toni Kukoc has a few thoughts 
about being on a team that can't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	No way. No thanks. Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows how great it is to be at the top of the NBA. And he  
decided on the way up that he didn't like the view those lesser 
teams have. So with Jordan already gone and Scottie Pippen one foot 
out the door, Kukoc says the Chicago Bulls are better off just 
scrapping it all and starting over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a team in the middle of the league, to not  
have a chance to get to the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. ``It will 
take a year or two, (but we should) get to the low point, maybe get 
the chance to grab a few free agents, draft picks and then start 
rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Jordan retired, the brutal reality of the Bulls'  
future without him is sinking in. Only four players -- Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth -- are under contract, with 
Harper the only starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget about signing enough good players to make a mediocre  
team, Kukoc said. That's only prolonging the agony. The rebuilding 
threat has been hanging over Chicago for two seasons, so it's time 
to just go ahead and do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Kukoc said the timing couldn't be better. Instead of  
bad basketball for 82 games, the Bulls and their fans will only 
have to endure it for 50. When the season ends, Chicago could have 
a top draft pick and, with plenty of cap money, be a big player in 
free agency next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it would be nicer to have seven rings than six, but we  
would be here and talking about, `What do you think about 
rebuilding?' '' Kukoc said. ``I don't want to say that it's better 
to be done earlier, but at one time, it had to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's coming soon. Pippen's name is popping up frequently on  
the NBA rumor mill. There's talk he could sign outright with 
Houston, or sign a long-term, big-money deal with the Bulls and 
then be traded away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see Scottie back in a Bulls uniform  
again,'' said Bill Wennington, another one of the Bulls' free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Luc Longley appears to be headed for Phoenix. Fan  
favorite Steve Kerr might soon be wearing a Detroit Pistons 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bulls will get ... Does it matter?  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope even this first year that we are able to get enough  
players to salvage enough out of what remains to be a decent 
team,'' assistant coach Tex Winter said. ``But it's certainly 
probably not going to be championship caliber for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be pretty, either. The Bulls are probably going to  
stick with the triangle offense, and while the system isn't 
complicated, it's not easy to learn, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who had a successful career in Europe before joining the  
Bulls, said it took him about 1 1/2 years before he felt comfortable 
with it. The new players will get two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a whole new team, there's going to be a lot of guys  
running into each other out on the court,'' said Dickey Simpkins, 
another free agent. ``It's a big learning process to learn that 
triangle. It's going to be tough if they try to bring in a lot of 
new guys, but it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need a new floor leader, too. Harper is liked and  
trusted by everyone on the team, but Kukoc said he's willing to 
step up, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe not in this kind of circumstances, but I'll accept it,''  
he said when asked if he wants to take on a bigger role. ``It's 
going to be different and it might take a while, but I'll take the 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Pak Aims for No. 1 in New Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Finally, Se Ri Pak can get back to golf.  
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA's most talked about rookie in 20 years arrived at Grand  
Cypress Resort for the start of the new season in the HealthSouth 
Inaugural with her sights firmly set on being ``everything No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is clear enough, even if the rest of her life seems  
muddled. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak is coming off a frenetic year, and not just because she took  
women's golf to its high level of notoriety since the 1978 rookie 
season of Nancy Lopez by becoming the youngest woman to win a U.S. 
Open and the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors. 
</P>
<P>
	First came the celebrated homecoming in South Korea, where she  
had to be hospitalized because of fatigue. She bought a house in 
Orlando while still trying to maintain her 27-tournament schedule, 
then had trouble deciding on her support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	During one two-week stretch, manager Steven Kil was fired,  
re-hired and then fired again. She also ditched swing coach David 
Leadbetter, went back to him and then lost him when Leadbetter said 
he refused to be a tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
	As the new season begins, Pak is trying to negotiate a  
management deal. International Management Group is close to signing 
her to a contract, but one source said Cornerstone Sports was 
expected to make an 11th-hour pitch to Pak this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that going on around her, the plush fairways of Grand  
Cypress must look like paradise to Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before end of season, I was getting famous,'' she said.  
``After, make news with coach and I fire my manager. All talk about 
things around me, talk about my private life. Coach should talk 
about players, swing, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything makes me more busy. No time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pak can do without the distractions. Her goal is to get to the  
top, but she knows it won't be easy. Proof of that is Annika 
Sorenstam, the three-time player of the year who also won four 
tournaments last year and led the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The new season also figures to recharge the batteries of Karrie  
Webb, who in 1996 became the first LPGA rookie to surpass $1 
million in a season, and Kelly Robbins, the defending champion of 
the HealthSouth Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, I try to play more better,'' Pak said. ``But golf ...  
we don't know what will happen. I want to finish top-10 all the 
time. I want to be player of the year, money list No. 1, everything 
No. 1. But it's not that easy. I do my best and work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam did win until June last year, and she usually doesn't  
start her season until the LPGA Tour moves out to the west coast. 
But having moved in to a new house in Orlando -- about 30 yards down 
the fairway from Nick Faldo -- she'll play two of the three Florida 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a continuation from last year,'' Sorenstam said.  
</P>
<P>
	That can't be good news to the rest of the field. Sorenstam  
finished out of the top 10 in just four of the 21 tournaments she 
played last year and became the first woman to break 70 in the 
season scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scoring average says everything,'' she said. ``To break 70  
is one of the best things I've ever done. Now I want to get it down 
to whatever I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question for this year is who will be trying to knock her  
off. The LPGA has not lacked for rivalries the past couple of 
years, and they always seems to include Sorenstam -- first Laura 
Davies in 1996, the Webb in 1997 and Pak last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam concedes that Pak's success during a 10-week stretch --  
the LPGA, the U.S. Open and two other wins -- motivated her to 
practice more and play better. The 28-year-old Swede responded in 
fashion and went over $1 million for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	She expects Pak to be at the forefront again this year -- Pak  
included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go in 1999,'' Pak said. ``I learned a lot last  
year. I am more strong. I don't have many tired. Everything is 
getting more comfortable. It is good.''

<HEADLINE>  Trading Halted in Brazil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Trading was temporarily halted in  
Brazil's main stock market this afternoon after the index fell 10 
percent, a day after its Central Bank president resigned and Brazil 
decided to let its currency slide against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's action raised fears that the 18-month-old financial  
crisis that has battered Asia and Russia had not gone away and 
could bring down other economies in Latin America. Traders also 
worry that U.S. multinational companies operating in Brazil could 
take a big profit hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo's market, the largest in Latin America, was up early  
this morning after closing 5 percent lower Wednesday but turned 
steeply lower in the afternoon, setting off a circuit-breaker that 
automatically halted trading for 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said there were unconfirmed rumors that some local hedge  
funds were having problems, coupled with the resignation today of 
the Central Bank's director for banking system supervision, Claudio 
Mauch. Mauch said his resignation had been planned for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Argentina, Buenos Aires stocks that closed off  
8.8 percent a day earlier had fallen 4.2 percent by the afternoon 
while Mexico's stock market was 0.6 percent lower at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican stocks posted their ninth straight drop Wednesday,  
failing to register a single session with gains so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank, meanwhile, said today that about $2.3 billion  
in currency outflows had left Brazil the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	New Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes announced that the  
Brazilian currency, the real, would trade in a wider band against 
the dollar. His move effectively devalued by 7.6 percent the 
currency, which continued trading today at the top of the range, 
1.32 reals to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets worldwide that reacted sharply with steep losses after  
Gustavo Franco's resignation were higher today in Japan and mostly 
up in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, stocks were sharply lower today, continuing a  
selloff that left the Dow down 125 points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden resignation of Brazil's Central Bank president and  
the subsequent currency devaluation rocked world markets, but may 
have actually spurred the government to reform its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation made Congress snap to attention Wednesday and  
approve some key reform measures deemed necessary to shore up the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts fear the government should have devaluated the  
currency by twice as much. Others wondered whether Brazil could 
hold the devaluation within the limits it set or whether the 
currency would continue the slide it started Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special session late Wednesday, the Senate approved a  
presidential decree raising corporate income taxes, a measure 
expected to yield $3.8 billion this year. It also approved a 
measure reducing long-term interest rates to 12 percent a year from 
19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But other key measures, which also are more controversial, will  
only be voted on next week. Analysts agree that Brazil, a major 
U.S. trade partner and the world's 11th-largest economy, must get 
things back on track quickly if it is to attract foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since August, investors have pulled $40 billion out of the  
country, dropping reserves to around $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep the crisis from spreading, U.S. and other  
international lenders in November came up with a $41.5 billion aid 
package. But to get that money Brazil had to commit to trimming $23 
million from its deficit in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Those commitments seemed less likely last week. Gov. Itamar  
Franco of Minas Gerais, Brazil's third-wealthiest state, declared a 
90-day moratorium on debt payments to the federal government. Other 
governors threatened to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, Rio de Janeiro Gov. Anthony Garotinho seemed to  
back away from that and praised the devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange policy needed to be more flexible because (the  
previous one) was unrealistic and was hindering Brazilian 
exports,'' Garotinho said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lesbian Health a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long-awaited study of lesbian health  
uncovered a problem: Doctors know very little about it, including 
whether lesbian women are at higher risk for cancer and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The government asked the prestigious Institute of Medicine to  
investigate lesbian health, and the scientific experts concluded 
Thursday that this population has been largely overlooked by 
doctors and researchers.

<P>
	Among the report's findings:

<P>
	--There is some evidence lesbians may be at higher risk for  
breast cancer, because of perceived higher rates of alcohol 
consumption, overweight and childlessness, and they may be at 
higher risk for ovarian cancer, because they're less likely to bear 
children or use birth control pills. But nobody knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
	--There's a myth that lesbians don't need Pap smears to detect  
cervical cancer, but in fact they do need them. 
</P>
<P>
	--The stress of dealing with societal attitudes toward  
homosexuality may affect lesbians' physical and mental health, 
including their suicide risk, but too little research has been done 
to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors, particularly gynecologists, have little training in  
treating lesbian patients, which can affect quality of care and 
discourage patients from seeking care. One of the few studies on 
lesbians found 20 percent of lesbians surveyed in Michigan reported 
encounters with doctors who knew nothing about homosexual women. 
Also, lesbians are less likely to have health insurance, often 
because of bans against spousal benefits for unmarried partners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Research is lacking because it's hard to define who makes up  
this subset of women and then recruit them for studies, and because 
there is a stigma associated with studying lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academy of  
Sciences, urged the government and other scientists to conduct and 
fund research promptly to answer the questions.

<HEADLINE> Padres, Williams OK Three-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Right-hander Woody Williams and the San Diego  
Padres avoided arbitration Thursday when they agreed to a $12.75 
million, three-year contract, with a club option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is slated to be the No. 3 starter behind Andy Ashby and  
Sterling Hitchcock. He was acquired in the deal that sent 
right-hander Joey Hamilton to the Toronto Blue Jays during the 
winter meetings last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 32, received a $250,000 signing bonus and will make $3  
million in 1999, $4.5 million in 2000 and $5 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	If the $6.25 million option is exercised, the deal would be  
worth $19 million over four years. The option would become 
guaranteed if Williams is traded, makes 30 starts in 2001 or 60 
starts during 2000 and 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made $1,615,000 last year.  
</P>
<P>
	In his second full season as a starter, Williams was 10-9 with a  
4.46 ERA in 32 starts, with 151 strikeouts in 209 2-3 innings. He 
threw 194 2-3 innings in 1997, when he went 9-14 with a 4.35 ERA. 
Williams was 28-34 with a 4.30 ERA in five-plus season for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got tremendous makeup and very good control,'' general  
manager Kevin Towers said. ``I think because of the more expanded 
strike zone in the NL, and taking away the DH, he should be more 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, MVP of San Diego's NL championship series win over  
Atlanta, and reliever Dan Miceli are the only remaining 
arbitration-eligible Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Towers said Hitchcock's agent rejected the Padres' three-year  
offer and the two sides were at least $1 million apart. He also 
said there's a ``sizable gap'' between Miceli and the Padres, who 
are offering a three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Salary arbitration figures are to be exchanged on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Committee To Probe Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Self-serving deals by members of the board  
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee will be investigated by 
SLOC's ethics committee, according to an Olympic official. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fowler, Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt's liaison to the organizing  
committee, said business conflicts on the board will be 
investigated by the independent ethics panel investigating 
allegations of bribery surrounding the bidding for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Fowler said Wednesday, the five-member panel is  
looking at contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its own 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	One example was the awarding of a $23.2 million Olympic contract  
to a construction company headed by board trustee Alan Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton Construction Co. will build a cable-suspended top for a  
speed skating oval in Kearns. The contract was awarded last October 
on the same day the organizing committee approved a $1.45 billion 
budget for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board trustee likely to profit from the Games is Earl  
Holding, owner of Snowbasin ski resort where the downhill races 
will be staged. The state, using federal funds, plans to build a 
$15 million shortcut to his resort -- a road Holding once planned to 
build himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding also is benefiting from a federal land trade allowing  
him to expand his ski resort and build condominiums at the resort's 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Board members with obvious conflicts of interest should  
resign,'' said Linda Hilton, director of the Coalition of Religious 
Communities in Salt Lake, who named Layton and Holding in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton and other Olympic critics spoke at a public forum  
Wednesday, peppering Fowler and SLOC executive board member Ken 
Bullock with questions about the burgeoning scandal that already 
has forced the resignations of SLOC's two top executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said he agreed that ``people who do business with SLOC  
shouldn't be on the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Councilwoman Deeda Seed said a number of SLOC trustees  
sit on the board despite business conflicts -- ``the Earl Holdings 
of the world who stand to make millions off the Games.'' She called 
it ``business as usual on the organizing committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said the ethics panel headed by former Utah Chief Justice  
Gordon Hall is likely to agree with this criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that the individuals on the ethics committee  
will not jeopardize their own outstanding professional reputations 
by inappropriately suggesting there is no conflict in the awarding 
of contracts when in fact there should be a concern raised,'' 
Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its report is not due until Feb. 11, the ethics board  
could present its findings as early as next week, one member told 
The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also calling for reforms Wednesday was Sen. Pete Suazo, D-Salt  
Lake. He said all SLOC employees, officers and board members should 
be required to disclose any personal or business conflicts. And he 
said SLOC should open its board meetings and appoint a citizen 
ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's erase the chalk board and start all over,'' Suazo said.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Fight Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- First it's on. Then it's off. Now it's delayed,  
or maybe it's off again. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing certain about the ``Battle of the Aged'' between  
former heavyweight champions George Foreman and Larry Holmes is 
that none of the principals seem sure of when -- or if -- the fight 
will ever come off. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrodome USA president Mike Puryear said Thursday that the  
on-again, off-again event has been postponed from Jan. 23 to March 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen on the 23rd, but we are near  
completion in having everything done to make it go on the 27th,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puryear spoke with fight promoter Roger Levitt on Thursday and  
said Levitt ``is very optimistic that an arrangement can be worked 
out for both fighters to appear on March 27.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt confirmed the report in an interview with Houston  
television station KRIV, saying, ``I'm delighted all parties are 
coming together to make this fight happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not return a telephone message from The Associated Press  
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes didn't sound so sure about the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say, `Yeah, it's going to come off,''' he  
said. ``If I see some things happening for the better by next 
Tuesday, then I will say `Yeah.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's lawyer, Henry Holmes, meanwhile said that he has no  
knowledge of a new date. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has ever mentioned to us postponing the fight or the  
date March 27,'' Henry Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight at the Houston Astrodome has been in jeopardy since  
Levitt missed two deadlines for payment of the remaining $9 million 
of Foreman's $10 million purse. Holmes has received $400,000 of his 
$4 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes spokesman Jay Newman said Levitt was trying to complete  
negotiations with Foreman over the next few days so that the fight 
can go on, albeit belatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it looks good,'' Newman said. ``Right now we're  
looking forward to fighting George March 27 in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has been dubbed the ``Battle of the Aged'' because  
Foreman turned 50 on Sunday and Holmes was 49 on Nov. 3. The bout 
is scheduled to be shown on pay-per-view TV.

<HEADLINE> IOC Displays Some Samaranch Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The ``Samaranch Collection,''  
containing everything from stamps to shotguns, was unveiled by the 
IOC Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled by the biggest corruption scandal in its history, the  
International Olympic Committee opened its storerooms for a glimpse 
of some of the gifts received by president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Among items on view in a basement of the lakeside Olympic  
Museum, in a section labeled ``Juan Antonio Samaranch collection,'' 
were a framed set of Dutch stamps, a commemorative plaque from the 
Atlanta Olympics, statuettes, portraits, a Japanese doll, a tray 
from Barcelona and a Greek icon. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 30 paintings given to IOC presidents past and present were  
also in the storage room. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the space is taken up by items bought by or given to the  
museum itself -- ``tens of thousands'' of pieces ranging from 
sportswear to Olympic torches, according to curator Jean-Francois 
Pahud. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small, cluttered room at the nearby IOC headquarters,  
reporters were shown a Browning Arms 9 millimeter single-action 
handgun and shotgun -- gifts from the bidders and organizers of the 
Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, at the center of the scandal over 
alleged bribes for IOC votes in the selection of the 2002 host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns were apparently unused, displayed in their cases with  
instruction manuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch denies he violated the IOC's rule prohibiting  
committee members from accepting gifts with a value of more than 
$150. He says he is not covered by the rule because he doesn't vote 
in the election of host cities.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Rate for Hispanics Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of diabetes among Hispanic adults in the  
United States and Puerto Rico is nearly double that of their white 
counterparts, federal researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that a study  
based on data from 1994-97 found 6 percent of Hispanics age 18 and 
older had diabetes. When adjusted for the age differences between 
the two races, the prevalence of diabetes among Hispanics was 8 
percent compared to 4 percent for non-Hispanic whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hispanics 65 and older, 21.4 percent were diabetic,  
compared with 12 percent for those age 45 to 64 and 2.3 percent for 
those age 18 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that the prevalence of diabetes among  
Hispanics varies by geographic location. Those in Puerto Rico, the 
West and Southwest were more likely to have diabetes than Hispanics 
in other regions of the United States, the CDC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first study to show diabetes prevalence among all  
Hispanics in the United States and Puerto Rico, the CDC said. 
Previous studies focused on Hispanics were conducted on 
Mexican-Americans and found that one of every 10 Mexican-Americans 
age 20 and older was diabetic.

<HEADLINE> Owners To Study Baseball Economics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- With some owners calling for a new  
economic system, baseball has appointed yet another study 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, former Federal  
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, Yale president Richard Levin and 
television commentator George Will were selected Wednesday for a 
``Blue Ribbon Task Force on Baseball Economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this time, frankly, I wanted to find some people  
outside the game who could bring a fresh approach, an insightful 
approach, whose credentials are impeccable,'' commissioner Bud 
Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig emphasized that he doesn't think baseball ``can take  
another work stoppage,'' but also said, ``We have to find other 
ways to make changes.' 
</P>
<P>
	Change is exactly what the players association, which vows to  
defend free agency and salary arbitration, is opposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	Eying the salary ceiling NBA owners got their players to agree  
to last week, some baseball owners have called for massive economic 
change -- which could lead to another labor confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced the current leadership of baseball will bring  
about change,'' said John Henry, whose $150 million purchase of the 
Florida Marlins was unanimously approved. ``I think Florida 
baseball would be in a sad state of affairs without change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volcker was head of the independent study panel appointed  
jointly by owners and the union following the 1990 spring training 
lockout. Mitchell, currently heading a panel investigating alleged 
bribes involving the awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt 
Lake City, was mentioned as a possible candidate for commissioner 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Will is on the boards of the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego  
Padres. Levin did economic study work for owners during the last 
round of collective bargaining. Fourteen club officials also were 
picked for the panel, which will be chaired by Boston's John 
Harrington and Colorado's Jerry McMorris. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the union won't be involved, but will be invited to  
attend some meetings. Union head Donald Fehr, reached at his home, 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stand here and tell you we don't have a disparity  
problem. You know that we do and I know we do,'' Selig said. ``The 
thing we can't ignore is the economic realities we confront. We 
need to address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners' desires to change the system led to the 232-day strike  
in 1994-95 that wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 
years. It was baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers' $105 million, seven-year contract with  
Kevin Brown -- baseball's first $100 million deal -- has prompted 
several teams to call for an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player compensation system we have is a Rube Goldberg  
contraption. It is completely out of whack,'' San Diego Padres 
president Larry Lucchino said. ``It is one thing to have the first 
million dollar player, it is another thing when you have the first 
hundred million player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's collective bargaining agreement runs through the 2000  
season, but the players association is expected to exercise its 
option to extend it for an additional year. If that happens, the 
earliest a confrontation could occur would be in spring training 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry purchased the Marlins from H. Wayne Huizenga, a  
billionaire who also owns the NFL's Miami Dolphins and heads the 
public company that owns the NHL's Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the Marlins, who started play in 1993. He  
became disenchanted in 1997 when Florida failed to fund a publicly 
financed ballpark with a retractable roof. He became convinced the 
government wouldn't finance a ballpark for a billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six years since the Huizenga family brought baseball  
to South Florida,'' he said. ``We did not want to sell our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team Henry takes over is a shell of the club that won the  
World Series in 1997. After the Marlins beat Cleveland to win the 
World Series in their fifth year of existence, Huizenga began a 
payroll purge. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who formally takes over after the deal closes next  
Tuesday, has said he would pay for a stadium if the government 
doesn't fund one. But he said that route would condemn the Marlins 
to low payrolls and perennial mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay for players or pay for a ballpark,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other business, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
was replaced on baseball's executive council by Seattle Mariners 
chairman John Ellis. In the NL, Houston owner Drayton McLane and 
Atlanta chairman Bill Bartholomay replaced Selig and New York Mets 
owner Fred Wilpon. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, owners cut the period for waiver claims from three  
business days to two and reset the claiming deadline from 2 p.m. 
Eastern to 1 p.m. Eastern. They also tightened a rule that allowed 
teams to use a player on the 60-day disabled list to make an 
additional player eligible for postseason play and expanded teams' 
coaching staffs from five to six. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Harrington, the realignment committee chairman, said  
no changes would be made until 2000 at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Business Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton wants the government to offer  
financial incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Wall 
Street firms and small businesses to resurrect the economies of 
underserved rural and urban areas from Appalachia to Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is to announce the proposals Friday at an economic  
conference organized by the Wall Street Project, an initiative of 
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. The project's mission is to 
expand business opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which will be included in Clinton's budget plan,  
are the culmination of talks Clinton has had with Congress, federal 
agencies, community groups, finance experts and Jackson, who has 
been pushing for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson particularly wants to see agencies created that offer  
the same kinds of incentives the government now offers U.S. 
businesses going overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, he cited, among other agencies, the Overseas  
Private Investment Corp., an arm of the government that finances 
U.S. businesses overseas. The corporation offers loans and loan 
guarantees and secures private investment funds while insuring 
overseas investments against political risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a domestic version of these vehicles,'' Jackson said.  
``Whether it's the Ozarks, East L.A. or Harlem, there must be 
vehicles ... to transport capital to people who need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hill, state treasurer of Oregon and president of the  
National Association of State Treasurers, praised the concept 
Thursday at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense to me to use the same ideas to serve  
underserved people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Cheap, president of South Shore Bank in Chicago, a  
leading investor in underserved neighborhoods, said the programs 
would work if the government creates sustainable institutions in 
communities as opposed to one-shot efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Jackson's second annual Wall Street conference, a  
two-day affair whose sponsors include a number of blue chip 
companies such as Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Ford and General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first conference, the president said it was in the U.S.'s  
interest to invest where the strong economy had not reached, 
bringing together ``the gleaming office tower and the dark 
shadows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he offered no plans, but this year he will get  
specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of it is taking from existing programs and ... funding  
them better as well as trying to propose some new initiatives,'' 
said Gene Sperling, chairman of President Clinton's National 
Economic Council, who declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	White House sources and others who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity said the initiatives would be worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiatives seek investment bankers to place capital, with  
guarantees, in the nation's underserved areas. Studies have shown 
that inner city dwellers both white and non-white have millions of 
dollars in disposable income but nowhere to spend them. Blacks, 
Latinos and Asians have an estimated $1 trillion in disposable 
income that could be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Via telephone, Clinton addressed conference participants  
gathered on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for a 
reception Thursday evening, saying he would talk about proposals to 
help the country's underserved areas in his talk the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso, chairman of the NYSE, said that in terms of Wall  
Street, ``I think it's going to be enormously well-received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said it was important that economic opportunities should  
not be just for profit, but help the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not take some of that capital and invest in underserved  
areas in America?,'' Grasso said. ``I applaud (the proposals.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., was  
equally effusive. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the administration has come up with, and I've been  
working with them around the clock, is to use the tax codes to 
invest in these types of communities and to (have investors) 
receive tax credits for the amount of monies they invest,'' said 
Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Wall Street Project thus far has achieved small, but  
measurable goals. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he intervened in a discrimination dispute  
involving workers and Con Edison, the big New York City utility, 
convincing the workers to enter a mediation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed also hired three minority firms to help manage its  
pension portfolio, an example that was followed Thursday by the 
telecommunications companies Bell Atlantic and GTE, which plan to 
do the same.

	Statements by members of Congress after the first day of  
arguments in the impeachment trial of President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska:  
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of interesting the way the web of associations  
were brought to the forefront. We've got a lot of questions, at 
least I have. I haven't made up my mind on witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On inviting the president to testify: ``That was certainly the  
innuendo that was left with one. That's the first time we've heard 
that. We'll just have to see what kind of a response other members 
have or whether that's going to be reinforced by further statements 
by the House. I'm not ready to make that decision.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.:  
</P>
<P>
	On having Monica Lewinsky testify: ``Frankly that would be a  
spectacle that most of the American people would not welcome.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., one of the House prosecutors:  
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be ``very very difficult'' to win the case  
without witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Develop Viagra Spray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Two University of Kentucky researchers  
have developed a faster- acting form of Viagra, but they've struck 
out trying to sell the drug's maker on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra, the anti-impotence pill made by pharmaceutical giant  
Pfizer Inc., usually takes an hour to take effect. The researchers 
say they can reduce that time to five to 15 minutes with their 
nasal spray delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they've got a product on the market, they want to leave  
sleeping dogs lie, they don't want to mess around with it,'' said 
University of Kentucky researcher Lewis Dittert who developed the 
nasal spray system with colleague Anwar Hussein. ``It takes a lot 
of effort to move these big companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer spokeswoman Marianne Caprino said her company is ``always  
interested in advancing our medicines... in a way that makes the 
medicine more patient-friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, she added, ``I wouldn't want to speculate about any  
relationship developing with these researchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Viagra pill, whose spectacular debut last year sparked a  
frenzy among impotence sufferers and inspired a thousand late-night 
television jokes, contains an active ingredient, sildenafil, that 
is not very water-soluble. 
</P>
<P>
	That means it can take the pill more than an hour to be digested  
and reach the small intestines, where the sildenafil can reach the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	A nasal spray version of Viagra, by contrast, would bring the  
drug in contact with the mucous membranes, offering the prospect of 
almost immediate absorption into the bloodstream and quicker relief 
for impotence sufferers, Dittert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said he and Hussein had contacted Pfizer officials in  
England, where Viagra was developed, but were given a chilly 
reception. ``They said, `We're looking at it, we'll call you,''' 
Dittert said. ``It's been a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to horn in on their patent,'' he added. ``We  
just think we've got a better mousetrap and we think they ought to 
be interested in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said he and Hussein, a colleague at Kentucky's College  
of Pharmacy, developed the idea of a nasal-spray version of Viagra 
shortly after the drug hit the market last spring and filed for a 
provisional patent in June. Each of the men has studied nasal drug 
delivery systems for over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said a spray that could offer impotency relief on the  
spur of the moment would probably appeal to Viagra users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel because of the nature of Viagra's use that people  
don't want to wait an hour for results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working at their University of Kentucky-affiliated company, New  
Millennium Pharmaceutical Research Inc., Hussein and Dittert added 
a secret compound to sildenafil that allows the drug to remain in 
solution without diminishing its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert said the compound is recognized as safe by the federal  
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the researchers sent a postgraduate student to the  
University of Iowa to study the effect of the sildenafil solution 
on rats. Those tests showed that the sildenafil was quickly 
absorbed into the rats' bloodstream, according to the professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we were really excited,'' Dittert said, because  
although not all medicines can be delivered through the mucous 
membranes, there are no known cases of a nasal delivery system 
working for rats but not for humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Pfizer owns all rights to sildenafil, Dittert and  
Hussein must work with the company if they hope to bring their idea 
to market, a process that could take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Caprino said consumers seem happy with their Viagra pills. ``We  
certainly have not heard with consumers that they are unhappy with 
this oral delivery system or that it is impeding their ability to 
effectively use this drug.''

<HEADLINE> Anzio Bell Found by GI Going Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A small bell recovered by an American  
soldier from a bombed-out church in Italy in 1944 is being sent 
home to mark the 55th anniversary of the village's liberation 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It meant so much to me to have it in my possession,'' said  
Herbert Roth, 84, who grabbed the bell as a war memento during an 
Allied offensive in and around Anzio, a Mediterranean village 40 
miles south of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to know that it's going back to where God had it in the  
first place is wonderful,'' the former Army sergeant said 
Wednesday. ``I honestly feel I saved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze bell, which was used for calling people into Mass at  
Saints Pio and Antonio Church, is just 9 inches tall and 5 inches 
in diameter. On its side is the protruding figure of a lion's head, 
a papal symbol marking the church's founding around 1850. 
</P>
<P>
	After keeping it on a shelf at home for a half-century, Roth  
donated it in 1997 to the Italian American Community Center in 
Gates, a Rochester suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Anzio Beach Museum found out the bell had  
survived from members of the community center who went to Anzio 
hoping to find old photographs of the church. The museum politely 
asked for its return. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center initially suggested sending a replica to  
the museum. But its board of directors finally agreed this week to 
return to bell in May, when Anzio commemorates its liberation by 
U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed at Anzio in one of the most  
ferocious encounters of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth had donated the bell to the newly opened community center  
because he'd been anxious to find a spot where his artifact would 
be properly appreciated. He's delighted the center is now giving it 
back to its ``rightful owners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not know how much time I would have on this Earth and I  
wanted to have a permanent home for it,'' said Roth, who suffers 
from heart problems and is too ill to attend the ceremonies in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my health the way it is, I couldn't buy what I have  
gotten out of this,'' he said. ``In my heart, I've gained more. We 
were given the honor of keeping the bell until we found where it 
actually belonged. It has a great deal more meaning in Italy than 
it does here.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics Mull WNBA Team for Hartford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Boston Celtics are interested in  
sponsoring a WNBA team and would consider having it play some games 
in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	But talk of a women's professional team affiliated with the  
Celtics is still preliminary, and nothing could happen before next 
year at the earliest, team spokesman Jeff Twiss told The Associated 
Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would it be considered for future years down the road? Yes it  
would,'' Twiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Basketball League folded in December and sought  
bankruptcy protection. Among its franchises was the New England 
Blizzard, who played in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut officials have been courting the rival WNBA to land  
a team for Hartford. The Celtics used to occasionally play in 
Hartford but have not had games there for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA teams are collectively owned by the 29 NBA franchises and  
are operated in conjunction with NBA teams. It is up to each NBA 
team to decide if it wants to sponsor a women's franchise, WNBA 
spokesman Mark Pray said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA team expresses interest, then the WNBA operating  
committee makes the decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twiss said the Celtics feel the WNBA has a future in New  
England. He could not say if the team considers Hartford -- where 
the ABL regularly drew more than 10,000 fans a game and the 
University of Connecticut men's and women's teams both sell out the 
downtown Civic Center -- the best location for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very early. Right now we are just batting around a few  
ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA currently plays in Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, New  
York, Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Sacramento and 
Utah. Orlando and Minneapolis were awarded expansion franchises 
last April and will begin play this summer. There are no other 
plans for expansion this year.

<HEADLINE> Plea Changed in Calif. Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- The way drifter Brandon Wilson remembers  
it, he smiled first and 9-year-old Matthew Cecchi smiled back. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, Wilson said, he pulled a hunting knife from his  
belt and cut the boy's throat as he stood at a urinal inside a 
public restroom at Oceanside Harbor. And then he walked past the 
boy's aunt as she stood outside waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 21, provided the details to Superior Court Judge John  
Einhorn at his preliminary hearing Thursday. He also changed his 
plea from innocent to innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not whether he committed the act; he's  
admitted to that,'' public defender Curt Owen said after the 
hearing. ``The question is whether he was sane when the act was 
committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was camping with his mother and 3-year-old brother as  
part of a weekend family reunion with her family at a beach in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
	His aunt escorted him to the restroom and noticed that Wilson  
followed him. She became worried when Wilson exited but the boy 
didn't. She went inside and found the boy covered in blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was arrested two days later in Hollywood when he  
allegedly stabbed a woman and attempted to steal her purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, of St. Croix Falls, Wis., said he spent two days hunting  
for a victim, passing on two women before overhearing Matthew tell 
his aunt he needed to go to the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's it. That's the one; follow him,'' Wilson said he told  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he smiled at Matthew because he didn't want Matthew  
to realize that he was about to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is charged with first-degree murder with special  
circumstances of lying in wait and using a knife. Conviction on the 
charge carries an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without 
parole. The special circumstances make him eligible for the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wilson is found insane, he will be sent to a state mental  
hospital. If he is found sane, the trial will move into the penalty 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The court appointed two psychiatrists to evaluate Wilson next  
month and Owen said he will seek an opinion from his own expert.

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan placed  
the first signature Thursday on a declaration in the name of Anne

intolerance of bigotry. 
</P>

imagine a better, peaceful world, a future free of suffering and 
persecution, then surely we can summon the will to make that day 
come to pass,'' Annan said at the signing ceremony, also attended 
by Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anne Frank Declaration pledges to ``remember the millions of  
children around the world who will not greet the new millennium 
with us because they were killed in wars and conflict'' and 
resolves to ``work together towards a better world, free of 
bigotry.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Virus Vaccine Tests Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A vaccine that attacks HIV at a vulnerable  
moment of the deadly virus' infection cycle has been shown to be 
effective in laboratory tests, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies at the University of Montana, researchers developed  
antibodies in mice that attacked HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, 
just as the virus was in the process of fusing with target cells. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the study is being published Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This fusion process, the researchers said, exposed HIV molecules  
that are not open to attack at other times in the infection cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	These molecules were then injected into laboratory mice. The  
injected mice, which had been genetically manipulated to respond to 
HIV, made antibodies against the fusion molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	When tested in laboratory dishes against actual samples of HIV,  
the mouse antibodies were able to neutralize 23 of 24 strains of 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana researchers said the study shows an encouraging new  
approach to HIV vaccine but the substances in the laboratory 
studies could not be used safely in humans. Also, it is not certain 
if humans could develop antibodies such as those produced by the 
laboratory mice, the researchers said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Nine IOC Members Face Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Nine IOC members face possible  
expulsion for ``serious'' offenses in the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal and four others must answer to lesser charges, the 
Olympics' top official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch said he has no intention of resigning as long as 
he has the support of the rest of the committee. He plans to stay 
in office ``until the last minute'' of his term in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was less than categorical on whether the 2002 Winter  
Games would definitely stay in Salt Lake City, saying it was the 
IOC's ``hope'' and ``desire'' that they go ahead in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC president declined to identify the members identified in  
the scandal or list their offenses, but said they were divided into 
two categories -- nine accused of ``serious matters'' and four of 
more minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC sent letters this week demanding explanations  
from 13 members implicated in the inquiry. He said four members had 
replied to the IOC. The deadline for the rest is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said some of the members may ask to appear before the  
six-man investigative panel when it meets in Lausanne on Jan. 23. 
The panel will report to the executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	If investigators recommend that members be expelled, the board  
will suspend them immediately, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual expulsion must wait until the next meeting of the full  
IOC assembly, scheduled next June in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, expulsion requires a two-thirds  
majority vote of the IOC session. However, any members facing 
expulsion would be free to resign before then, Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC leader said it was still uncertain what action would be  
taken against members cited for lesser violations. He said official 
warnings were possible but ruled out fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke for 40 minutes in his first one-on-one interview  
with the international media since the biggest corruption scandal 
in Olympic history broke last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had wonderful years,'' he said. ``We had very successful  
games. And now we are in a storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC has three priorities: close the Salt Lake  
City scandal, adopt special measures for the bidding on the 2006 
Winter Olympics, and change the voting procedure for all future 
site selections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system we have today is not working,'' he said. ``We have  
to change the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the changes could include selection of Olympic cities by  
the executive board or another small group, or conducting an open 
election among the 115 rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch appointed a high-level IOC panel last month to  
investigate allegations that IOC members received cash payments, 
scholarships, free medical care, lavish gifts and other inducements 
from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven IOC members have been linked with the Salt Lake  
City investigation by Olympic officials, investigators, press 
reports or the members themselves -- Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of 
Congo), David Sibandze (Swaziland), Bashir Attarabulsi (Libya), 
Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Sergio Santander (Chile), Anton Geesink 
(Netherlands) and Pirjo Haeggman (Finland). 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch discounted reports that Salt Lake City may have  
provided prostitutes or female escorts for IOC members, saying he 
had seen and heard nothing to confirm such activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC is considering a code of ethics for its  
members. This would replace the ethics rules drawn up by Swiss 
executive board member Marc Hodler, who rocked the IOC with 
widespread corruption allegations last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe (Hodler's rules) are not enough,'' Samaranch said.  
``Maybe for the future, we must think to have an ethics code. This 
is something we are studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top two officials in Salt Lake's organizing committee,  
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson, resigned 
last week in the escalating scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had spoken with Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who  
was determined to ``save the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The games must go on,'' Samaranch said. ``The International  
Olympic Committee will do its best to try to put in Salt Lake City 
in 2002 very successful games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could state with 100 percent certainty that the  
games would stay in Salt Lake, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I can speak only on behalf of the International Olympic  
Committee,'' he said. ``The hope, the desire of the IOC, is that 
the games will go on as planned in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler has suggested the games could be moved -- or some events  
held at other venues -- if Salt Lake fails to meet its $1.45 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said the IOC had no contingency plans in the event  
Salt Lake organizers face a shortage of sponsorship funds and 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sponsors and public opinion are waiting for the  
reaction of the IOC, how we can clean our house,'' he said. ``The 
reaction will be on the 24th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had no intention of resigning, despite calls  
from several Olympic-related officials in recent days for him to 
accept responsibility for the misconduct that took place during his 
leadership. He has been president since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received many, many letters from members of the IOC  
supporting the IOC, supporting me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he should accept some of the blame for the  
scandal, Samaranch said, ``I think the blame is not only for the 
president, the blame is also for the International Olympic 
Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had nothing unethical by accepting firearms  
from Salt Lake City during the 2002 bid. He said he received a 
pistol and a rifle -- reports put their total worth at more than 
$2,000 -- and put them in a storeroom with other gifts he has 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	Although IOC members are prohibited from accepting gifts with a  
value of more than $150 from bid cities, Samaranch said the rule 
does not apply to him because he does not vote. He said he is 
routinely presented with protocol gifts during his travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the executive board will take up his proposal to  
ban IOC members from visiting Olympic bid cities. These trips, in 
which members are provided first-class flights, luxury hotel 
accommodation and other hospitality, are seen as fraught with 
dangers of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the visits aren't necessary because the IOC has a  
group of experts who inspect the sites and compile a report on the 
logistical and financial merits of each bid. In addition, the 
cities make presentations to the IOC members at the session before 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the executive board will adopt interim measures,  
including a possible ban on visits, for the rest of the 2006 bid 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may call a special session in the next few months to  
get changes adopted by the assembly before the 2006 site is 
selected at the June meeting in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Friends Tape Heroin Addict Who Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- For hours, Luis Torres struggled to come  
off a heroin high, enduring body-wracking seizures and fighting to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	His friends videotaped Torres for six or seven minutes, thinking  
that showing the scene to him later would do him good. Then they 
left him to sleep it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres never saw the tape. He died a few hours later, apparently  
of an overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the drugs, the kid was perfect,'' said a  
teary-eyed Michael Shipman, standing in the doorway of his 
apartment, where Torres died. ``Anything I ever needed, he was 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police seized the tape to investigate whether Shipman and an  
undetermined number of other friends should face charges for not 
getting medical help for the 32-year-old Torres sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Terrence Hull said no charges will be filed. He  
said an investigation showed that those who videotaped Torres were 
trying to help him and didn't realize he was dying. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape was made at Shipman's apartment on Jan. 6. Torres, a  
carpet installer from Union City, had arrived at the apartment 
early that morning with a drug buddy after snorting some heroin. He 
was high when he got there. 
</P>
<P>
	When the taping started, Shipman said, he asked the man Torres  
was with if the breathing difficulty and seizures were anything to 
be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do drugs, and I don't have any experience with it,''  
Shipman said. ``This guy said he'll be all right ... I believed 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipman said he went to bed after checking to see that Torres  
was still breathing, and woke up about 2:30 p.m. His roommate came 
home, and around 3:30 p.m. asked, ``Does he always sleep with his 
mouth and eyes open?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipman said he called 911 and tried to give Torres  
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was too late. Torres was taken 
to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point was to show him how stupid he looked,''  
Shipman said. ``I didn't think anything was going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Other Fiennes: Patient Englishman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- O, what's in a name?  
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Fiennes, the United Kingdom's latest It Boy, has a very  
modern answer for that old William Shakespeare verse: not so jolly 
much, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, that's right: He's Ralph's kid brother.  
</P>
<P>
	``The name gets the door open but you still have to pass through  
it,'' Fiennes says. ``Does it hinder? Enhance? I don't know. I 
still have to do the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the latest addition to the burgeoning Britpack of stars that  
includes Ewan McGregor and Jude Law, the broodingly handsome 
Fiennes is well aware of the pitfalls of a famous moniker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand the interest and the parallels drawn, but I  
can't rely on them. People care or they don't -- it's really up to 
others to make up their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Happily, they already have. The 28-year-old thespian has won  
praise from critics and audiences for his performances in 
``Elizabeth'' opposite Cate Blanchett and ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
with Gwyneth Paltrow. Both films received Golden Globe nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than a little frightened at all this attention,''  
says Fiennes. On the day of the interview, he's wearing a gray 
herringbone suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hollywood is such a machine. It's a beast which I'm very wary  
of because I've got nothing to say, nothing to want, nothing which 
is sensible or that's going to change anyone's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph is the youngest -- along with his twin brother Jake -- of  
seven Fiennes, a gypsylike clan that moved more than a dozen times 
around England and Ireland during their early childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	That nomadic upbringing, Fiennes says, prepared him perfectly  
for a career in acting. ``When you're thrown into a new school 
every few years, you hone all your communication skills, you learn 
tricks at adapting. I was forever reinventing myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience also seems to have rubbed off on his siblings.  
All except one of the Fiennes brood is currently employed in the 
arts. ``We're a little mafia,'' he says happily. 
</P>
<P>
	Word that Ralph wasn't the only talented Fiennes was cemented  
during Joseph's six-month stint on London's West End in ``A View 
From the Bridge'' and his prized role opposite Helen Mirren in ``A 
Month in the Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiennes won raves during his two-year tour at the acclaimed  
Royal Shakespeare Company, where he tackled the prickly Troilus -- 
just five years after Ralph, the star of ``The English Patient,'' 
had taken the part. 
</P>
<P>
	So when director John Madden -- armed with a crackling script by  
Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard -- began casting about for a young man 
to portray Will Shakespeare, Fiennes emerged as a perfect 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began to wonder whether I was ever going to be able to find  
anybody of whom one would believe that he had written the plays,'' 
says Madden, who also directed ``Mrs. Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at him and he somehow seems perfect,'' adds Madden.  
``Shakespeare's been in his blood for a long time. He understands 
and celebrates the language. The role so unquestionably belongs to 
him. Joe is the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiennes is part Heathcliff, part Romeo in black leather.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have such a passion for Shakespeare that I didn't want to  
sell him out as a cheap cartoon character with floppy hair and that 
goatee,'' Fiennes says. ``I wanted him modern and sexy and dynamic 
and slightly enigmatic. Not a Disney idea of what he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, a makeover of Elizabethan proportions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look, he was a genius. Yes, of course. But he was also a gypsy  
and a wheeler-dealer and he stole and he plagiarized. He was a 
survivor,'' Fiennes says. ``He was a normal young guy who was 
exactly my age when he wrote these plays. He drank, he fought, he 
fell madly in love, he cursed. We have to humanize him.''
