<HEADLINE> Knicks' Dudley Playing Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He had two vicious slam dunks, heard the fans  
chant his name and finished with a boxscore line that made Patrick 
Ewing's pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was Chris Dudley's brightest day as a Knick.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've had better games in the regular season, but not  
in the playoffs,'' Dudley said after scoring 14 points, grabbing 12 
rebounds -- six on each end -- and blocking two shots in New York's 
90-77 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's performance was the biggest eye-opener in a victory so  
lopsided that Ewing, hobbled by Achilles' tendinitis and sore 
knees, was able to sit out the entire fourth quarter to save some 
strength for Game 4 Monday night and a possible series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest is big, especially for Patrick,'' Dudley said. ``We  
want to get Patrick healthy. We don't want to have to back down 
there to Atlanta, travel down there, extend the series and allow 
Indiana to have that rest while we're still in a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It became clear that a different Dudley was on the court during  
the first half when he followed a missed shot with an emphatic 
putback slam that electrified the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley had another shot almost exactly like it later in the game  
to contribute to a 6-for-7 shooting performance. When he fouled out 
late in the fourth quarter, the ovation was easily the loudest he 
had ever received at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans gave me that ovation, it was real nice,'' he said.  
``It was great to have that and it's great to be up 3-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, meanwhile, had a shooting percentage that loosely  
resembled something Dudley could have done from the free throw 
line: 2-for-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duds played a much better game than I did,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's playing time has been unpredictable during the  
playoffs. He sat out Games 4 and 5 of the first-round series 
against Miami, and coach Jeff Van Gundy lauded him for sacrificing 
minutes for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In this game, however, his 23 minutes were on par with the  
playing time the other eight Knicks regulars received, and his 12 
rebounds were more than anyone on either team had with the 
exception of Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Mutombo is they rely on him defensively to  
block shots. I tried to follow in behind him when he went to block 
shots,'' Dudley said, ``and in the second half I was able to beat 
him to the boards.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Station Part Is Noisy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Russian half of the  
international space station is so noisy that astronauts will wear 
earplugs when they drop off supplies later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blasting fans are making parts of the Russian-built Zarya  
control module as loud as a busy highway. And over on the space 
station's American-made side, the communication system is on the 
fritz. 
</P>
<P>
	The visiting shuttle astronauts will spend much of their time  
repairing the 6-month-old space station, already a fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
	Liftoff is set for Thursday, one week late because of hail  
damage to Discovery's giant fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven astronauts are taking earplugs to wear inside Zarya.  
The earplugs should also help the crew sleep better aboard 
Discovery, which is in a constant state of clatter but less so than 
Zarya. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts should be able to hear any alarms that go off in  
Zarya even if their ears are plugged. At the very least, said 
commander Kent Rominger, they will be able to hear warnings on 
their battery-powered speaker microphones, which they'll carry over 
from the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise level registers just over 72 decibels in parts of  
Zarya (Russian for ``sunrise''). Acoustic experts say that's 
roughly equivalent to a busy highway or a turned-up TV 10 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle limit is 68 decibels, although it's exceeded  
that on occasion because of unusually loud payloads, said Jerry 
Goodman, a NASA engineer who's in charge of space station 
acoustics. One crew even returned with temporary loss of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts who connected the first two pieces of the space  
station in December told their colleagues it was difficult for 
anyone in Zarya to hear someone speaking from the Unity module just 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the short term, it's not nearly the kind of noise that  
would damage our hearing,'' said Rominger. ``I guess at this point, 
it would be considered more of a nuisance than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is for astronauts who will be cooped up in the space  
station for three to four months. The first permanent crew is 
expected to move in early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	To make the station quieter and thereby safer, Rominger and his  
crew will install 15 foam covers over air-circulating fans, ducts 
and vents in Zarya while docked for nearly six days. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman hopes the mufflers will get Zarya's noise level down to  
the 60 decibels intended for the entire space station, or at least 
close. If not, permanent crews will have to wear earplugs inside 
the module -- hardly a desirable way to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The potentially dangerous din existed long before Zarya, the  
first station component, was launched by the Russians last 
November. The Russians simply did not pay as much attention to 
acoustics as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
would have liked, Goodman said. (The American-made Unity module, 
for instance, has a noise level of 58 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
	Other problems have since cropped up aboard the space station: a  
U.S. communication system isn't relaying data back to Earth and 
Russian batteries aren't charging properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight director Paul Hill likens the space station to a new car  
that needs to go back to the dealer for tweaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in this case, it's an extremely complicated car that we  
can't get our hands on after we threw the thing up into orbit,'' 
Hill said. ``It's been through a lot. But we're all really pleased. 
Of course, we'd rather have no failures at all, but that's not very 
realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberg, an independent consultant on Russian space affairs,  
said the battery problem could have been caught if Zarya's launch 
had been delayed to allow for more comprehensive testing of the 
power system. The noise problem also could have been remedied, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mufflers are little more than Band-Aids, Oberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the trend continues ... two years from now or four years  
from now, the crew will be doing nothing but work-arounds,'' Oberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarya isn't the only station compartment that's too noisy. Even  
worse is Russia's so-called service module, which is supposed to be 
launched as living quarters by year's end. The oft-delayed module 
also does not meet NASA standards for protection against space 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have what we have,'' said Frank Culbertson, deputy program  
manager for space station operations, ``and we're trying to 
aggressively deal with any deficiencies that we've found.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Star Goalie Misses Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Goaltender Dominik Hasek was on his way back to  
Buffalo for treatment of an injured groin after he missed Game 1 of 
the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury flared after practice Saturday, and the goalie  
removed himself from the lineup before the opener against the 
Toronto Maple Leafs, won by Buffalo 5-4. Backup goalie Dwayne 
Roloson made 28 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek didn't know if he would be able to start Tuesday's Game 2  
of the best-of-7 series. His status is day-to-day, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury sidelined Hasek for 12 games in February and March.  
He reinjured it in the playoffs against Boston, but started all six 
games of that series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek wanted to see how he felt after a night's sleep Saturday.  
But his condition did not sufficiently improve and he was not on 
the ice for the pregame warmup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For sure I knew this morning that it was impossible to play  
well,'' said Hasek, who ranked third among playoff goalies with a 
1.77 goals-against average going into Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek had won three of five games against the Maple Leafs during  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending two-time league MVP set career bests for  
goals-against average and save percentage during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't pay attention in warmup as to who was in net,'' Maple  
Leafs defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich said. ``I was surprised that 
(Roloson) was in net and got a little excited. Anybody except Hasek 
is good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson took a walk with a couple of teammates before the game  
to quiet his nerves. Martin Biron was recalled from the AHL farm 
club in Rochester, N.Y., to be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rollie had to make a lot of great saves,'' said Sabres center  
Stu Barnes. ``He doesn't get a lot of attention, but he's a real 
good goalie. Having him in there didn't change the way we played at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told last night that Rollie would start and we were  
very excited for Rollie,'' Sabres forward Dixon Ward said. ``He 
deserves the opportunity to play. It's always tough for a backup 
goalie playing behind Hasek. We had a winning record in the 12 
games with Rollie when Dominik was out, we knew he would be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek had not missed a start since April 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the defending two-time league MVP, set career bests for  
goals-against average and save percentage during the regular 
season. Hasek had won three of five games against the Maple Leafs 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't worry about injuries,'' Curtis Brown said. ``It just  
gives other guys a chance to get in there and play. It's tough when 
you lose a guy like Dom, but we also have a lot of confidence in 
Roloson.''

<HEADLINE> WWF Wrestler Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A World Wrestling Federation wrestler  
was injured Sunday when he fell 50 feet into the ring as he was 
lowered from the roof of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Owen Hart, who wrestles under the nickname ``Blue Blazer,'' was  
given CPR in the ring in front of the soldout event at Kemper Arena 
and then taken to a nearby hospital. The hospital did not 
immediately release the condition of the 33-year-old wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	The horrified crowd at first thought the fall was a stunt, but  
it quickly became apparent that it was an accident. The event was 
televised on pay-for-view and seen around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was supposed to be lowered down into the ring,'' said  
Michelle Hindorff, a paramedic and dispatcher for the city 
ambulance service. ``It didn't get hooked on to him. He thought it 
was hooked on. We gave him CPR in the ring. He was a trauma code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was injured in the second part of the event called ``Over  
the Edge.'' The first part of the event, ``Sunday Night Heat,'' was 
televised live on the USA network.

<HEADLINE> Gore: US Sees Barak Pushing Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is confident Israeli Prime  
Minister-elect Ehud Barak can help advance the Middle East peace 
process, Vice President Al Gore told a pro-Israel lobbying group 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Barak, who defeated the more hawkish Benjamin  
Netanyahu on Monday, ``an immensely credible voice in support of 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without going into specifics, Gore said he believes Israel and  
the Arabs ``are ready for the kind of hard but mutual steps that 
make for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the United States is committed to maintaining Israel's  
military edge, but that a lasting peace must take into account the 
interests of everyone in the Middle East. He said Israel must keep 
secure borders while letting the Palestinians determine their own 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the annual conference of the politically influential  
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Gore pledged that the 
United States would look out for Israel on the world stage. 
Condemning the ``Israel-bashing that goes on at the U.N. and other 
international forums,'' Gore said Washington will boycott the 
Fourth Geneva Convention, a U.N.-sponsored conference that seeks to 
stop Israeli settlement in the territories it occupies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our special relationship with Israel is unshakable,'' Gore  
said. ``It is ironclad, eternal and absolute. That is not a theory, 
a proposition, or a preference; it is a core principle of American 
foreign policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore invoked the Jewish experience to defend the  
administration's Kosovo policy. While cautioning that ethnic 
cleansing does not fully compare to the Holocaust, Gore said the 
conflict in Yugoslavia brings back images of the Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have learned any lesson from the Holocaust, we must  
respond,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Parade Honors Ex-POW Ramirez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A soldier recently released from captivity in  
Yugoslavia was honored Sunday with a parade through his native East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of admirers, many waving miniature American flags and  
clutching red, white and blue balloons, crammed the sidewalks of 
Whittier Boulevard to catch a glimpse of Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd often chanted ``An-dy! An-dy! An-dy!'' as the grinning  
soldier passed by. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I used to drive down (this street) in my  
mother's old car,'' Ramirez said. ``This is a lot different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd also joined in a loud rendition of ``Happy Birthday''  
for the soldier, who turns 25 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone of Smiths Creek, Mich.,  
and Spc. Steven Gonzales of Huntsville, Texas, were part of a U.N. 
peacekeeping force when they were captured by Yugoslav forces March 
31 as they patrolled the Macedonia border. 
</P>
<P>
	They were freed May 2 after an American religious delegation led  
by the Rev. Jesse Jackson negotiated their release. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson joined Ramirez in the parade and called the soldier an  
example to Hispanic youths. 
</P>
<P>
	``So often, people of color are marginalized,'' Jackson said.  
``But Andrew Ramirez stands for America.''

<HEADLINE> Several US Films Favored in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- An offbeat tale about a single mother in  
Spain and a lighthearted Japanese road movie were among the 
favorites for the coveted Golden Palm award at Cannes on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in strong contention were several U.S. films by well-known  
directors: David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch and Tim Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no question that the buzz favored ``All About My  
Mother,'' by the colorful director Pedro Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard's 13th film delighted audiences with its perfect  
balance of tragedy and humor and its offbeat family of four 
absorbing female characters: a resilient single mother, a 
transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a lesbian actress. 
</P>
<P>
	But many expected the winner to be a surprise, as it often is.  
This year, there also is an eclectic jury headed by ``Crash'' 
director David Cronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other favorites, some were enchanted with the lighthearted  
road movie by Japanese director Takeshi Kitano, who usually makes 
darker films. ``Kikujiro'' tells the story of a young boy searching 
for his mother with the help of a working-class tough. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of journeys, an impressive contribution was Atom  
Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,'' a haunting thriller by the Canadian 
director of ``The Sweet Hereafter.'' The film featured a chilling 
performance by British actor Bob Hoskins. 
</P>
<P>
	And three American films were well received, including ``The  
Straight Story,'' in which Lynch, the creator of dark and often 
quite violent films, departed from form to tell a heartwarming, 
true story of a 73-year-old man who travels across Iowa on his 
lawnmower to visit a dying brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Also successful was Jarmusch's latest effort, ``Ghost Dog: The  
Way of the Samurai,'' a sharp and funny look at the dying world of 
the Mafia and the ancient world of the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving mixed reviews -- but a lot of attention -- was Robbins'  
``Cradle Will Rock,'' a period piece set in 1930s New York against 
the background of congressional hearings into communist activity in 
the theater world. The film featured the most star-studded cast of 
the festival: Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, John and Joan 
Cusack, John Turturro, Bill Murray, Emily Watson and others. 
</P>
<P>
	For best actor, Richard Farnsworth of ``The Straight Story''  
appeared to have a good chance, along with Hoskins for ``Felicia's 
Journey'' and Fernando Lujan of the Mexican film ``No One Writes to 
the Colonel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For actress, many hoped the award would go to one of Almodovar's  
captivating players, especially Cecilia Roth or Marisa Paredes. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's jury includes actors Jeff Goldblum and Holly Hunter;  
directors Andre Techine, George Miller, Maurizio Nichetti and Doris 
Dorrie; playwright Yasmina Reza; classical singer Barbara Hendricks 
and French actress Dominque Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	Several films premiered at the festival outside the main  
competition, including Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam'' -- a brutal and 
powerful look at the summer of 1977, when New York was terrorized 
by the serial killer David Berkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Also notable was Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' a controversial  
religious satire featuring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as two very 
un-angelic angels trying to make it back to heaven.

<HEADLINE> IBM Opening Access To Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to spark new uses for supercomputers, IBM  
is providing free access to powerful software that can translate 
data into pictures, helping researchers find hidden meaning and 
uses for the mountains of otherwise mundane information gathered 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the source code for IBM's Visualization Data  
Explorer software is part of a new $29 million research 
collaboration with universities, government laboratories and other 
companies that IBM plans to announce Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-dimensional technology is already being used to  
improve weather forecasting and more specialized tasks like piecing 
together more than 5,000 ceiling fragments from a 1,200-year-old 
temple in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	New applications could include complicated medical research such  
as genetics, enabling doctors to ``see'' a person's DNA or cell 
structure and consider physical shapes in designing treatments for 
an illness. 
</P>
<P>
	But in addition to dealing with the complex, the software may  
help tackle the simple, yet voluminous storehouses of data now 
generated by the Internet and financial markets, said William 
Pulleyblank, the head of mathematical science for IBM research and 
director of the new Deep Computing Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer simulations make it easier to ``find the value buried  
in all this data'' by helping to ``uncover patterns, identify 
trends, and model 'what-if' scenarios,'' Pulleyblank said. ``Deep 
computing techniques can help find the proverbial needle in an 
entire field of haystacks, analyzing vast reservoirs of data to 
uncover key relationships between gene sequences needed to 
understand disease or identify critical risk in an unexpected area 
of a bank's portfolio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, with a better than 80 percent share of the market for  
supercomputers, IBM stands to benefit from any new demand for those 
high-capacity machines. Last month, the company introduced a new 
mainframe that can crunch up to 1.6 billion instructions per 
second.

<P>
	Still, ``if you can get something high-capacity in the hands of  
students and researchers, you get creativity,'' said Terry 
Winograd, a professor of computer science at Stanford University in 
California. ``Access to the kinds of computers that can handle 
large computations that can handle visualization is not the thing 
every (university research) department can go out and get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winograd said data visualization would be helpful in his work,  
which involves building a digital library of the information on the 
World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very nice to have a visualization to see patterns  
-- what kinds of material are linked to other kinds of material, by 
meaning, by topic,'' said Winograd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deep Computing Institute will be based at an IBM facility in  
Westchester County, N.Y., but will also conduct research at labs in 
California, Texas, Japan, Switzerland, Israel, China and India. 
Participants include scientists from the University of California 
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> Marshall Field's President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The head of the venerable Marshall Field's  
department store has resigned, two months after the retailer's 
decision to stop making its famous Frango Mints at its flagship 
department store in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Skoda announced his decision on Friday, saying he wants to  
spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my opportunity to play Michael Jordan,'' Skoda said.  
``The last couple of years have been really good in terms of 
business and personally. I don't need to work 60 to 70 hours a week 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skoda, who became president of Field's in December 1991, helped  
to revitalize its historic State Street store with $125 million in 
renovations. He also upgraded other stores in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	But he drew heavy criticism from Mayor Richard M. Daley and  
thousands of loyal Field's customers when the retailer's parent 
Dayton Hudson Corp. decided to move production of Frango Mints to a 
Pennsylvania candymaker. 
</P>
<P>
	For 70 years, the chocolates were made on the 13th floor of the  
downtown department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Skoda, whose resignation is effective June 5, will not be  
replaced. Instead, regional store directors will report directly to 
Dayton Hudson headquarters in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Field's operates 17 stores in Illinois, three in Ohio,  
two in Indiana and two in Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Drive-Ins Endure As Icon of America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The movie was about to start at the  
Starlite Drive-in and 5-year-old Corey Saul was still running 
circles around the family blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come and get another hot dog, Corey,'' his mother yelled from  
the car, as Corey's older sisters chatted and sipped sodas on the 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like coming here because I can play,'' Corey said before  
taking a man-sized bite, oblivious to the ketchup dripping onto his 
Rugrats T-shirt. At the indoor movie theaters, ``I'm not even 
allowed to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clunky gray iron speaker attached to the car's door frame  
crackled to life, playing the same big-band tune that has heralded 
the start of movies here for 50 years -- ``Stardust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Starlite is one of nine drive-in theaters left in Virginia,  
which had as many as 143 in 1968. There are 500 remaining 
nationwide, where there once were more than 4,000 according to the 
United Drive-in Theater Owners Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point, people thought that drive-ins would eventually  
all be gone, like the dinosaurs,'' said Don Sanders, author of 
``The American Drive-in Theater.'' ``I don't think that's the case 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and other advocates of drive-in theaters said there are  
indications they'll endure as an icon of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of drive-ins has stabilized in the last few years  
after nearly 30 straight years of decline. A few more have closed, 
but several new ones have opened as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of making a comeback, like the diners have,'' said  
Mark Bialek of Baltimore, Md., founder of the theater owners' 
association. ``It's part of America that I think people really want 
preserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the drive-in movie stamp will go on sale as part  
of the Postal Service's Celebrate the Century series. It shows a 
movie screen with a cowboy riding a horse across a canyon and rows 
of vintage cars in the foreground. Americans picked drive-ins as 
the top stamp subject to commemorate the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	The first drive-in opened in Camden, N.J., on June 6, 1933. But  
they didn't really catch on until the 1950s, a decade when more 
than 3,000 theaters popped up across the countryside, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers came in droves when the theaters started showing  
movies such as ``I Was a Teen-Age Werewolf'' and the beach-blanket 
movies starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders traces the beginning of the decline to the start of  
Daylight Savings Time. That pushed up movie starting times so they 
finished well past kids' bedtimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of color television in the 1960s kept people  
home, as did the video rental business. And some theater owners 
further tarnished the image of drive-ins by showing X-rated movies, 
Sanders said. In a more recent trend, drive-ins have been crushed 
by suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	But through it all, the Starlite has persevered. So has the  
Moonlite Theater in Abingdon, which has been open since 1949 and 
has been the subject of two country songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I caught a couple hiding in the trunk just last week,''  
Moonlite owner William Booker said. He let them stay after they 
paid. After all, that's how he got his start in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was caught in a car trunk many summers ago, Booker was  
forced to pick up the trash for two weeks. When the drive-in's 
manager eventually retired, Booker bought the place. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Moonlite, the Starlite only shows moves rated G, PG,  
and PG-13. Admission is $3 for adults and $1.50 for children. 
Corey's hot dog cost 75 cents, and the popcorn and candy bars are 
even cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's cheap family fun,'' said Tammy Saul, who drove her  
husband and children from Pulaski, a 45-minute drive, to see 
``EdTV'' at the Starlite. 
</P>
<P>
	Projectionist Patrick Huffman had to whack the film wheel with  
the heel of his hand to get it rolling smoothly and silence the 
honking by impatient drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been coming here since I was 8, when my dad drove an old  
Camaro and we would come an hour before the show to eat,'' Huffman, 
35, said. The hot dogs, he said, still taste the same.

<HEADLINE> DNA Thefts Prompt Change in Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Late one night during the embryonic stages  
of biotechnology, a patented DNA molecule disappeared from a 
refrigerator at the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended up at Genentech Corp., a pioneer in the industry and  
today one of its giants. A jury will begin deliberating today -- 
more than 20 years later -- over whether Genentech should pay as 
much as $1.2 billion for allegedly using the DNA without permission 
to develop the top-selling human growth hormone Protropin. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, which later paid the University of California, San  
Francisco $2 million for the DNA in 1979, claims the substance 
wasn't actually used for Protropin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter written earlier this month to the scientific journal  
Nature, researchers who worked on the drug and published an earlier 
article said they ``categorically deny this accusation that the 
data they submitted in the Nature paper were false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The theft highlights just how much a legal climate has crept  
into laboratories since New Year's Eve 1978, when Dr. Peter Seeburg 
says he filched the substance he helped create while working at 
UCSF and brought it to 3-year-old Genentech. But issues of 
intellectual ownership are far from resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Material transfers were simple in those days,'' said Mark  
Paller, director of the University of Minnesota's Research Services 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Paller said, ``You need attorneys merely to share some lab  
reagents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More and more research universities have developed these  
technology transfer offices to sift through the legalities of 
developing discoveries and handing over inventions to biotechnology 
firms and pharmaceutical companies for clinical trials and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Universities and biotech companies recognize that the  
Genentech-UCSF trial was born of inexperience, said Andrew Heyward, 
a health care and biotech analyst at Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each group will decide on their relationship based on their  
own merits,'' he said. This trial ``seems to be an isolated case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCSF researchers didn't return calls seeking comment. But citing  
over 900 transfers of research materials and technology to UCSF and 
a dozen research programs with the university, a Genentech 
spokeswoman insisted the case hasn't made for bad blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot let litigation put an end to these basic building  
blocks of science,'' said Marie Kennedy. ``We cannot stand by and 
let what has been a patent litigation case be turned into a 
question of scientific integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But just how far does the integrity of intellectual property go?  
Can one institution cry patent infringement if a former employee's 
knowledge in some way contributes to the creation of a product at a 
new job? 
</P>
<P>
	``The rules aren't clear yet, rules about who owns what, where  
authorship occurs -- even for students,'' said Diane Bartels, 
associate director at the Center for Bioethics at the University of 
Minnesota. ``If you're working in a lab it's not clear. People say, 
'I've worked three or four years of my life and how can I walk away 
and not take ownership?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts watching the case say that regardless of the verdict,  
Genentech is unlikely to be seriously hurt in reputation or in the 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, whatever the verdict is, it really has very little  
impact on Genentech as a company or an investment opportunity 
because Wall Street looks at forward earnings potential of the 
company,'' said Joel Sendek, senior vice president at Gerard Klauer 
Mattison &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the worst case scenario, Genentech has cash that would  
allow it to withstand any significant penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Genentech reported its first-quarter profits plunged  
nearly 65 percent as a result of a $50 million charge to settle a 
federal probe into its aggressive marketing of Protropin. The 
company, which had 1998 sales of $1 billion, was accused of 
promoting the hormone for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration.

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Station Part Is Noisy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Russian half of the  
international space station is so noisy that astronauts will wear 
earplugs when they drop off supplies later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blasting fans are making parts of the Russian-built Zarya  
control module as loud as a busy highway. And over on the space 
station's American-made side, the communication system is on the 
fritz. 
</P>
<P>
	The visiting shuttle astronauts will spend much of their time  
repairing the 6-month-old space station, already a fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
	Liftoff is set for Thursday, one week late because of hail  
damage to Discovery's giant fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven astronauts are taking earplugs to wear inside Zarya.  
The earplugs should also help the crew sleep better aboard 
Discovery, which is in a constant state of clatter but less so than 
Zarya. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts should be able to hear any alarms that go off in  
Zarya even if their ears are plugged. At the very least, said 
commander Kent Rominger, they will be able to hear warnings on 
their battery-powered speaker microphones, which they'll carry over 
from the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise level registers just over 72 decibels in parts of  
Zarya (Russian for ``sunrise''). Acoustic experts say that's 
roughly equivalent to a busy highway or a turned-up TV 10 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle limit is 68 decibels, although it's exceeded  
that on occasion because of unusually loud payloads, said Jerry 
Goodman, a NASA engineer who's in charge of space station 
acoustics. One crew even returned with temporary loss of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts who connected the first two pieces of the space  
station in December told their colleagues it was difficult for 
anyone in Zarya to hear someone speaking from the Unity module just 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the short term, it's not nearly the kind of noise that  
would damage our hearing,'' said Rominger. ``I guess at this point, 
it would be considered more of a nuisance than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is for astronauts who will be cooped up in the space  
station for three to four months. The first permanent crew is 
expected to move in early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	To make the station quieter and thereby safer, Rominger and his  
crew will install 15 foam covers over air-circulating fans, ducts 
and vents in Zarya while docked for nearly six days. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman hopes the mufflers will get Zarya's noise level down to  
the 60 decibels intended for the entire space station, or at least 
close. If not, permanent crews will have to wear earplugs inside 
the module -- hardly a desirable way to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The potentially dangerous din existed long before Zarya, the  
first station component, was launched by the Russians last 
November. The Russians simply did not pay as much attention to 
acoustics as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
would have liked, Goodman said. (The American-made Unity module, 
for instance, has a noise level of 58 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
	Other problems have since cropped up aboard the space station: a  
U.S. communication system isn't relaying data back to Earth and 
Russian batteries aren't charging properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight director Paul Hill likens the space station to a new car  
that needs to go back to the dealer for tweaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in this case, it's an extremely complicated car that we  
can't get our hands on after we threw the thing up into orbit,'' 
Hill said. ``It's been through a lot. But we're all really pleased. 
Of course, we'd rather have no failures at all, but that's not very 
realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberg, an independent consultant on Russian space affairs,  
said the battery problem could have been caught if Zarya's launch 
had been delayed to allow for more comprehensive testing of the 
power system. The noise problem also could have been remedied, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mufflers are little more than Band-Aids, Oberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the trend continues ... two years from now or four years  
from now, the crew will be doing nothing but work-arounds,'' Oberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarya isn't the only station compartment that's too noisy. Even  
worse is Russia's so-called service module, which is supposed to be 
launched as living quarters by year's end. The oft-delayed module 
also does not meet NASA standards for protection against space 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have what we have,'' said Frank Culbertson, deputy program  
manager for space station operations, ``and we're trying to 
aggressively deal with any deficiencies that we've found.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Trading Can Be Rocky Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Internet investors have to do more homework  
than ever if they want to succeed amid the push-button jungle of 
rumor, advice and -- most importantly -- fraud found in electronic 
trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ease of today's technology isn't an excuse to do less,''  
Arthur Levitt told investors Sunday at a business survival seminar. 
``It's an opportunity and a mandate to do more, to learn more, to 
be aware of more, to be informed of more and to achieve more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said the explosive growth of electronic trading has led  
to more opportunity -- and more scams. 
</P>
<P>
	While no one traded on the Internet five years ago, the number  
of online traders will soon match the combined populations of 
Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Atlanta and 
Chicago, Levitt said. By year's end alone, an estimated 10 million 
individual traders are expected to log on. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of complaints to the SEC about online brokers has  
jumped in lockstep: from 250 in 1997 to about 1,100 in the year 
ending Sept. 30, 1998. And those who complain are only a minute 
fraction of the number who get bilked, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt told the some 5,000 attendees at the Investment  
Strategies Conference in the Los Angeles Convention Center about 
both misconceptions and caveats in Internet trading. 
</P>
<P>
	He said novice Internet traders believe transactions happen the  
minute they punch their computer's ``enter'' button. In fact, they 
go first to a brokerage, where they can stack up waiting for 
processing while the stock price goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, pushing the ``cancel'' button doesn't mean the  
transaction is necessarily canceled, even if the broker sends back 
a confirmation notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may only mean your request to cancel was received, not  
that your order was actually canceled,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investors to ask their brokers how cancellations are  
processed and to use limit orders, which rescind a stock purchase 
if the price goes beyond a preset boundary, to lower their online 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also encouraged traders to seek out information on EDGAR,  
the SEC's electronic database of public company filings, to find 
out whether the companies made or lost money, whether insiders are 
buying the stock, and whether outside auditors think the company 
has problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also took issue with the tone of some online brokerages'  
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these commercials border on irresponsibility,'' he  
said. ``There is this cutesy, tongue-in-cheek advertising that I've 
been seeing too much of, which trivializes a process that is very 
serious and enormously important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said such companies take advantage of huge numbers of people  
who don't know about investing and have never experienced a down 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	A recently formed committee will look at the issue and come up  
with guidelines for the industry to police itself, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will keep talking about this,'' he said. ``We have no  
intention of trying to regulate, but every intention of trying to 
humiliate.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Airport Has Radar Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A series of radar problems resulting from a  
faulty computer processor caused the control tower at Philadelphia 
International Airport to lose part of its jet-tracking data for 
about an hour last week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure May 17 caused air traffic controllers to lose track  
of the types of planes aloft, their altitudes and destinations. The 
controllers had to resort to the information from written 
flight-progress reports, said Arlene Salac, Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman in New York, which oversees operations 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened eight to 12 times between 2:55 p.m. and 4:10 p.m.,  
temporarily halting incoming and outgoing flights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't lose track of any planes. Let me make that clear,''  
Salac said Saturday. ``There was no impact to safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Monday's incident, controllers have besieged their union  
with phone calls expressing their concern that the aging radar 
equipment might be too dangerous to use. A power failure earlier 
this month that knocked out radar scopes and radio contacts with 
jets in the air and on the ground for 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Salac said Philadelphia's equipment has a ``99.45 percent  
reliability.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Churchgoers Pray for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Churchgoers prayed Sunday for healing for  
Heritage High students injured in last week's shooting, making a 
particular point to include the 15-year-old suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas ``T.J.'' Solomon Jr., was being held in a youth detention  
center, charged with wounding six classmates with a rifle during 
Thursday's attack. Three days later, churchgoers said they saw the 
teen-ager not as a violent fiend, but a troubled youth badly 
needing God's peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did was wrong,'' The Rev. Martha Wright said at a  
prayer service Sunday afternoon at Ebenezer United Methodist Church 
for those injured in Thursday's attack. ``But him being wrong 
doesn't mean he is bad or devoid of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Wright spoke, her voice began to crack and she and many in  
the audience of about 200 began to wipe tears from their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	She continued, ``he too was created in your image and that image  
is somewhere in his distraught soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, who fellow students said was despondent over a recent  
breakup with his girlfriend, had been taking Ritalin, a drug 
commonly prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
The New York Times reported Saturday that Solomon had been under 
medical treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Simon's Episcopal, where several Heritage students  
worship, Solomon was listed in the bulletin's prayers of the week 
as one to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray for T.J., the young man who did this,'' said the Rev.  
Leon Watts Jr. ``We pray that this would never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Solomon's congregation, St. Pius X Catholic, erected  
three large sheets of blank paper at the back of the sanctuary for 
members' messages for Heritage students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a tomorrow and God will be there for you,'' was  
one of the hundreds of notes. ``God loves you,'' a child scrawled. 
</P>
<P>
	For Christians, Sunday was Pentecost, celebrated as the 50th day  
of Easter when the resurrected Christ bestows the Holy Spirit's 
peace on his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Zivic, who served as St. Pius' visiting priest, did not  
specifically address the shooting at Heritage in his homily. 
</P>
<P>
	``A direct reference to the incident would have been overkill,''  
Zivic said. ``People know what happened, and hopefully today they 
can make their own connections with God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cania Cullins, a 15-year-old sophomore who was shot in the back  
of the knee, arrived at church services in a white stretch 
limousine. Her pastor, Jim Earl Swilley of Church in the Now, had 
sent the car as a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	``In situations like this, it seems like the kid with the gun  
becomes the celebrity,'' Swilley said. ``I want to turn this 
around. I want to talk about surviving, I want to talk about 
victims who become victors.''

	He was replaced by Dwayne Roloson, who didn't look like he had  
only 19 minutes of NHL playoff experience. Roloson, facing nine 
power plays, made 28 saves as the Sabres beat the Toronto Maple 
Leafs 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson had the better of veteran Curtis Joseph, who played a  
shaky game in the Toronto net. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's injury flared after practice Saturday, and the star  
goalie removed himself from the lineup before the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the final decision this morning, but yesterday I tried  
really hard in the practice, but I could see that I cannot go up 
and down -- it hurt me too much,'' Hasek told Canadian Broadcasting 
Co. ``I knew almost 100 percent I could not go today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek wanted a night's rest to see if he felt better Sunday, but  
he did not and was not on the ice for the pregame warmpup. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Hart Trophy winner was unsure if he could play in  
Game 2 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to speculate,'' he said. ``I wish to wake up  
tomorrow and feel better, but with this kind of injury it's very 
difficult to say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said Hasek could be out more  
than one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have our doctors continue to work with him the  
next day or two and we'll see where it goes from there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson's only NHL playoff time came against Boston in the  
second round this spring after Hasek was lifted when the Sabres 
fell behind 4-1. Roloson faced eight shots and allowed no goals, 
and the Sabres lost 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson was backed up by Martin Biron, who was recalled from the  
AHL farm club in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ready since yesterday to play,'' Hasek said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 18 regular-season appearances this season, Roloson was 6-8-2  
with a 2.77 goals-against average and .909 save percentage. The 
29-year-old goalie was a free agent from the Calgary Flames when he 
signed with the Sabres last July.

<HEADLINE> Indy Field Set, Some Ready for Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Desperation was in the air Sunday at the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for some, and unhappily for others, so was rain.  
</P>
<P>
	The drizzle that ended the second of two days of time trials for  
the May 30 Indianapolis 500 four hours short, held off just long 
enough for Robbie Buhl to bump his way into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	His run was completed one minute before rain shut the 2 1/2-mile  
oval. With several other drivers still hoping to take a crack at 
the lineup, track officials waited 2 1/2 hours before making the end 
of qualifying official. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhl, a 35-year-old three-time Indy starter, had found nothing  
but frustration here this week until A.J. Foyt came to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he crashed while getting up to speed on a warmup  
lap for a qualifying attempt in a car fielded by underfinanced 
Sinden Racing Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Already struggling with a limited number of motors, Buhl tried  
to nurse the team's second car into the lineup shortly after 
qualifying resumed on Sunday, but blew his last engine. 
</P>
<P>
	With his chance to make the race seemingly gone, Buhl heard  
team-owner and four-time Indy winner Foyt, who already had Billy 
Boat in the first three-car row and Kenny Brack in the third row, 
might be able to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to see A.J. and it was a pretty casual conversation,''  
Buhl said. ``He was kind enough to say, `Hey, I've got two cars. 
See which ones works best for you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two teams pulled together and made a couple of calls that  
were right. I think we timed it just right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the air heavy and moist and rain obviously on the way, a  
nervous Buhl drove Foyt's Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara onto 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-lap, 10-mile average of 220.115 mph was just good  
enough to make Mike Groff the last of five drivers bumped out of 
the 33-car lineup on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens to a lot of people,'' said Groff, who had been in  
the race each of the last three years and five times overall. ``It 
was just difficult and we didn't make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhl was very happy to make the race, but he was still feeling  
frustration from what had happened before he stepped into Foyt's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest emotion I feel is that I'm still angry at myself  
for what I did yesterday,'' he said. ``The car was good and I felt 
comfortable in it. I should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the guys were up until 5 in the morning putting a motor  
in the backup car, just in case. I don't think you can understand 
how bad you feel as a driver when you do what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the field filled on Saturday, the first day of time trials,  
Sunday was dedicated to bumping the slower cars out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indy, it's the 33 fastest cars that start the race, meaning  
that non-qualified cars can take a run at knocking the slowest 
qualifiers out of the field until the 6 p.m. EST finish -- or until 
rain halts the action. 
</P>
<P>
	With wet weather in the forecast, there was a flurry of activity  
when qualifying resumed at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Boesel immediately drove onto the 2 1/2-mile oval and bumped  
out Lyn St. James, the only woman entered in the 83rd 500-mile race 
and the slowest first-round qualifier at 218.970 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating she would be bumped, St. James was practicing in  
her backup car on Sunday morning when her engine blew and she 
crashed, ending her shot at a seventh Indy start. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel, a 10-time Indy starter, easily blew St. James' speed  
away, turning in a four-lap, 10-mile average of 220.100. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, cousin of first-day qualifier Robby Unser,  
qualified for his fourth Indy start. He bumped out rookie Jaques 
Lazier, younger brother of 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, with a 
speed of 221.197. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buhl blew his engine, there was a long period of open  
practice before Jack Miller got into the field by bumping out 
Stephan Gregoire at 220.276. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the scene for what turned out to be the dramatic finish  
of the day's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Groff, who waved off two of his car's allowable three attempts  
on Saturday, made a desperation run and bumped Scott Harrington 
with a speed of 220.066. But that was just fast enough to put him 
``on the bubble'' as the slowest qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Michner, taking over the seat of John Paul Jr., who was  
injured in a crash during practice on Friday, aborted his second 
attempt after two laps just over 218. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, track observers were reporting light sprinkles.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when Buhl went out, getting the job done despite an  
uncomfortable seat that pushed him high in the open cockpit and had 
his helmet buffeting around throughout the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `This isn't perfect, but we don't have time to mess  
around.' I mean, this is the Indy 500,'' Buhl said. ``We just went 
out and ran what we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by two-time winner Arie Luyendyk's pole-winning speed of  
225.179 mph on Saturday, the final field averaged 221.558 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other former winners in the lineup are defending  
champion Eddie Cheever, who will start 16th, and Lazier, who is 
22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hollansworth Jr., who qualified 12th, is the fastest of  
four rookies. The other first-year drivers in the field are Jeret 
Schroeder, Robby McGehee and Wim Eyckmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the end of qualifications and next Sunday's race, the  
only time the drivers can get back on the track is Thursday during 
the traditional two-hour ``Carburetion Day'' practice.

<HEADLINE> New York Rep. May Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., said Sunday he is  
moving toward a Senate run in 2000, and challenged the 
qualifications of two well-known figures considering the race: 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and GOP Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm inching closer and closer,'' Lazio, in his fourth term  
from Long Island, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' He said he would be 
a strong candidate because ``I think I've been a good legislator, 
because I stand for the right values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Mrs. Clinton have said she is likely to form an  
exploratory campaign committee in June, an important step in 
deciding whether to seek the seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady scheduled a trip Monday to New York for a book  
party for Matilda Cuomo, the wife of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, 
D-N.Y. She also was to attend a dinner for Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., 
who plans to run for Moynihan's seat if Mrs. Clinton decides not to 
enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey, interviewed with Lazio, said the first lady's decision  
will be ``sooner rather than later.'' The one certainty, Lowey 
said, was that ``the next senator from New York will be a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lazio said Mrs. Clinton, who never has lived in New York, is  
not qualified to represent the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``She needs an exploratory committee to find Elmira'' and, as a  
native of Illinois, roots for the Chicago Cubs over the New York 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say bring her on. I think it's a great opportunity for us to  
talk about who we are and what we stand for,'' Lazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio was equally critical of Giuliani, who has formed an  
exploratory committee to raise and spend money while he decides 
whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is a reluctant Republican. I think he is the wrong  
candidate. I think we need to have somebody who has not endorsed 
Mario Cuomo,'' Lazio said. In 1994, the mayor endorsed the 
incumbent Cuomo, a liberal Democrat, over Republican George Pataki, 
who won. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio, a moderate, also referred to Giuliani's aggressive, often  
antagonistic style, saying Republicans have to be ``non-polarizing 
and inclusive'' and the candidate needs to have ``the right 
temperament to do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, attending a fund-raiser in Missouri for GOP Rep. Jim  
Talent, who is running for governor of his state, poked fun at the 
notion of the first lady running in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tremendous endorsement of our policies by  
Hillary Clinton, the fact that she has chosen to consider moving to 
New York State,'' he said. ``But on the other hand, you have 18 
million bright and talented New Yorkers. Any one of them is capable 
of being a fine senator in Washington. We don't need someone from 
Washington moving to New York. We need someone from New York moving 
to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide poll appearing Sunday in the New York Post indicated  
Pataki could be a strong contender in a Senate race against Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki is considered a potential GOP vice presidential candidate  
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, by Zogby International of Utica, N.Y., had Pataki as  
the choice of 49 percent compared with 45 percent for the first 
lady, a statistical dead heat given the survey's margin of error of 
plus or minus 4 percentage points. The telephone poll of 669 likely 
voters was conducted Tuesday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani was favored by 49 percent and Mrs. Clinton 44 percent  
in a possible matchup, according to poll.

<HEADLINE> Lucas Eyes Part of Former Army Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- George Lucas is going up against a powerful  
developer in a bid for a piece of the Presidio, a former Army base 
on prime coastal land. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidio's board of directors will choose Thursday between  
two proposals for 23 acres of the scenic 1,480-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who created the ``Star Wars'' movies, wants to house a  
visual effects archive and digital training institute. He envisions 
a 15-acre great lawn with terraced promenades and a cafe for public 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't feel like a tourist event, but something like a  
huge park that's open all the time,'' said Gordon Radley, the 
president of Lucasfilm and overseer of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorenstein Co. has proposed the 10-building Presidio Village,  
with offices for CNET and other technology firms, 459 units of 
housing arranged around two courtyards, retail space and a central 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would you need a 15-acre park when you've got 1,500 acres  
of park in the Presidio?'' company chief executive Doug Shorenstein 
said of Lucas' proposal.

<HEADLINE> California Gas Prices Finally Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices dropped 1.57 cents per  
gallon nationwide since May 7 to end a 2 1/2-month runup in pump 
prices, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades with taxes,  
was $1.218 per gallon Friday, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of 
the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gasoline stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The high prices had been blamed on oil refining industry's  
decision to increase its supply of fuel for early summer driving, 
Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, what seems most likely is further drops in pump  
prices, pre-Memorial Day and beyond, but there are two unknowns: 
crude oil prices and extra strong gasoline demand,'' Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first significant drop in prices since a 1 1/2 year  
slide in gasoline bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon average for 
all grades in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	A small rise in early March was followed by an 8 1/2 cent jump in  
mid-March due to higher crude oil prices, and the biggest jump of 
14 cents per gallon in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices topped out at an average of $1.2337 two weeks ago -- a  
total rise of 23.5 cents nationwide in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Friday's average was about 8 cents per gallon higher  
than late May of 1998, it was 7 cents lower than the same period in 
1997, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded on  
Friday was $1.1605, mid-grade gasoline averaged $1.2621 and premium 
$1.3469. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service pump prices were $1.5318 for regular, $1.6191 for  
mid-grade and $1.6930 for premium, Ms. Lundberg said.

	Wave of Refugees Heads to Macedonia  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands of refugees waited to cross  
the border into Macedonia today as Serb forces appeared to be 
intensifying a push to clear ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. The 
numbers were the biggest U.N. aid officials had seen since the 
first week of May. About 7,700 arrived yesterday and as many as 
8,000 were expected to enter Macedonia today, arriving on buses and 
trains from the provincial capital, Pristina, and the town of 
Urosevac to the south. Both are deportation hubs for the hundreds 
of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven out by Yugoslav forces. A 
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees also reported 
an increase in refugees crossing into Albania, although he did not 
have exact figures. 

</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Refugee Couple Weds in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- High school sweethearts seeking refuge  
here from Kosovo were married today, half a world away from their 
troubled homeland. Selvete Zakuti and Beqir Kraniqi had lost each 
other once, when Serbs forced them to flee their homes in Pristina. 
After a month apart, the 21-year-olds found each other again at a 
refugee camp in Macedonia. There, they boarded a flight to the 
United States with the first wave of refugees to be accepted from 
the Balkan province. The couple, who have been dating for three 
years, exchanged gold wedding rings, donated from a local jewelry 
store.

	Russians Seek Smooth Appointments  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's prime minister said today he would not  
advance candidates for Cabinet posts who might provoke opposition 
from the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament. Sergei 
Stepashin told NTV television that he would like to keep Mikhail 
Zadornov in the office of finance minister and propose Alexander 
Zhukov as a candidate for deputy prime minister in charge of the 
economy. Zhukov is budget committee chairman of the lower house of 
parliament, or State Duma. Stepashin said he and Yeltsin would go 
over the candidates for the key posts tomorrow, ``not dragging out 
this process but at the same time not rushing it, either.''

	Talks With Syria a Barak Priority  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The resumption of peace talks with Syria is a  
top priority for Ehud Barak, a lawmaker close to the prime 
minister-elect said today, and withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
will be linked to the degree of peace offered. Barak believes that 
reopening talks with Syria is the key to fulfilling his campaign 
pledge to pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon within a year, Labor 
party lawmaker Ephraim Sneh told The Associated Press. Syria is the 
main powerbroker in Lebanon, with a large military presence and 
control over supply channels to the Hezbollah guerrillas, who are 
fighting to force Israeli forces from a self-declared ``security 
zone'' in southern Lebanon.

	Clinton Pushes Family Help Plan

	GRAMBLING, La. (AP) -- President Clinton said today states could

member. ``We as a nation must find a way to give your generation of 
parents some of that time back,'' Clinton told graduates of 
Grambling State University. Clinton directed the Labor Department 
to develop rules so states could use surplus unemployment funds to 
pay for leave for parents of newborns and adopted children.

the Buffalo Sabres to a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Roloson, with not as much help from his teammates as he might have 
liked -- the Maple Leafs had nine power plays -- made 28 saves and 
Curtis Brown and Geoff Sanderson scored goals in the third period 
as Buffalo escaped with a close decision.

<HEADLINE> 20th Cent. Products That Were Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Let us now praise paper clips. Sure, 20th century manufacturing  
produced heaps of junk, but let's not overlook all those elegantly 
simple, everlastingly ingenious, often humble products that made 
life better. Ten standouts: 

</P>
<P>
	PAPER CLIPS -- The century wasn't even a year old when Johan  
Vaaler, a Norwegian then living in Germany, solved the age-old 
problem of corralling fly-away papers by squeezing them between the 
concentric loops of a couple of inches of bent wire. 

</P>
<P>
	ICE-CREAM CONE -- At the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, food  
venders Arnold Fornachou (ice cream) and Ernest Hamwi (sweet, 
rolled wafers) collaborated in a way that seems inevitable now. 
There are other versions of the ice-cream cone's origin. Italo 
Marconi received a 1903 patent for pastry cornets to hold ice cream 
he sold. 

</P>
<P>
	NEON LIGHT -- Two English chemists had discovered neon 11 years  
earlier, but in 1909 French physicist Georges Claude captured the 
gas in a glass tube that glowed orange. Within a year, his ``liquid 
fire'' was used to illuminate a Paris building and soon after to 
advertise everything from car dealerships to hairdressers. 

</P>
<P>
	CELLOPHANE -- When comedian Mel Brooks' character, The  
2000-Year-Old Man, had to pick the greatest invention in history, 
he didn't hesitate. ``Saran Wrap,'' he said. Well, before Saran 
Wrap there was cellophane, developed in 1912 by Jacques 
Brandenberger, who wanted a film to shed the wine and coffee stains 
on Paris cafe tablecloths. 

</P>
<P>
	ZIPPER -- ``The Judson C-curity Fastener'' was a forerunner, but  
in 1913 Gideon Sundback patented an easy-to-use design. 
``Z-z-zip,'' it went, fastening rubber galoshes for B.F. Goodrich 
Co., which coined the name zipper. (Note: Velcro was developed in 
1957 after a Madame de Mistral's zipper jammed. The creator: George 
de Mistral.) 

</P>
<P>
	BAND-AID -- Earle Dickson was a cotton buyer for the Johnson  
gauze bandage company. Marriage made him an inventor: His bride 
kept hurting herself in minor ways, and so he devised a small, 
ready-made sterile bandage strip. Since 1921, Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
estimates 100 billion Band-Aids have covered skinned knees and 
other cuts and scrapes. 

</P>
<P>
	PHOTOCOPIER -- Think about what once was involved in making a  
copy. Monks toiling over medieval manuscripts. Smudgy carbon paper. 
Enter Chester F. Carlson. In a neighborhood in Queens, N.Y., he 
used powdered ink and an electrical charge to create a photocopy. 
``10-28-38 Astoria,'' the reproduced page said, identifying the 
date and place. 

</P>
<P>
	BALLPOINT PEN -- World War II could not stop Laszlo Biro's  
invention; indeed it hastened production. Biro was working on a 
ballpoint when he fled his native Hungary, and he patented it in 
1943 in Argentina. Some 30,000 pens were soon manufactured in 
England so RAF navigators could write in unpressurized cockpits 
where fountain pens failed. 

</P>
<P>
	FRISBEE -- Working independently at mid-century, Bill Robes in  
New Hampshire and Frederick Morrison in Los Angeles created the

the name Frisbee derives from a pie company whose tins Yale

	STICKY NOTES -- First came Spencer Silver's 1973 invention of an  
indifferently sticky stuff. But what to do with it? His 3M 
colleague, Arthur Fry, had the application: He first used paper 
gummed with the stuff to mark songs in his choir book. Today, these 
scraps of square pastel are our universal reminders.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Peach Crop Expected / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLANTON, Ala. (AP) -- Despite a winter described as the warmest  
in 40 years, peach farmers in Chilton County, Alabama's major 
producer of the fruit, say they're optimistic about this year's 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot better crop than we ever dreamed we'd have this  
year,'' said Steve Wilson of Durbin Farms, who grows 150 acres of 
peaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Peach crops are notoriously fragile and can sustain damage from  
too much rain, drought or late freezes. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year's problem was the opposite: a mild winter. Last  
year, record cold threatened the peaches. In 1996, a late freeze 
wiped out all but 5 percent to 10 percent of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather factors perhaps are more critical for peaches than for  
other crops,'' said Gary Gray, Chilton County extension agent. 
``Fruit crops have chilling requirements, unlike annuals that you 
plant every year. Some peaches have high or low chill 
requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The persnickety peaches lacked a hard freeze this year, Gray  
said. Peaches need freezing temperatures to break dormancy. In 
Chilton County, about 1,100 to 1,200 winter hours typically are 
below 45 degrees; this year, the average was about 700 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the least amount of cold weather we've seen since we  
started recording chill hours in 1957,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trees requiring the coldest temperatures probably won't  
produce this year, he said. But others were assisted by a new 
growth regulator that boosts the plant out of dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like giving them a cup of coffee,'' Gray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was among Chilton County farmers using the product for  
the first time. He said he expects to harvest a full crop, although 
some fruit dropped off the trees prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice McCraw said her peaches are small this year because of  
the mild weather, but they will be ready to grab by the first of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started out thinking we weren't going to have a crop,'' she  
said. The McCraws' 43 acres is a U-Pick farm, where customers can 
collect peaches, nectarines and plums. 
</P>
<P>
	Peach production is Chilton County's largest industry, with  
about 100 peach growers. The county produces about 90 percent of 
Alabama's peaches. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	TWIN FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- Freezing temperatures are damaging the  
already late-starting sugar beet crop in Idaho's Magic Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 5,000 to 6,000 acres may have to be replanted in the  
Twin Falls area alone, said Len Kerbs, agricultural manager for the 
Twin Falls Amalgamated Sugar Co. plant. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be the worst start Magic Valley growers have seen since  
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerbs' five field agents have been traveling from farm to farm,  
working with growers to determine which fields survived and which 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers are weighing whether the surviving plants will produce  
more yield than a late-planted field of new ones. By counting the 
number of living plants in several rows around the field, farmers 
can determine the percentage left and make a decision, Kerbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	After this spring's slow start, that decision has not been hard  
for Hidden Valley grower Paul Robertson, who also sits on the Snake 
River Sugar Growers' Minidoka County committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had to replant 350 acres,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Robertson generally has 80 to 120 plants every 100 feet. After  
the morning freezes, he was finding stretches with 35 to 40.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Finding Kamensky Lucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Maybe Valeri Kamensky was the answer all along.  
</P>
<P>
	Since his return from a two-month layoff with a broken arm,  
Colorado has won five straight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's bringing us a new dimension to our offense,'' coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``He generates a lot defensively with his speed and 
his skill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche have gone from a 2-0 deficit to Detroit in the  
second round to a 1-0 lead over Dallas in the Western Conference 
finals. Game 2 is Monday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won the opener 2-1 Saturday night with Kamensky  
assisting on the first goal and scoring the winner. He also had a 
possible goal nullified on replay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky has two goals and four assists in five games. Colorado  
has outscored opponents 21-8 in that span and Kamensky is plus-six. 
</P>
<P>
	Having the 33-year-old Russian back on the front line with Peter  
Forsberg and Claude Lemieux improves Colorado's third and fourth 
lines because good players are dropped in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky also has helped Forsberg and Lemieux.  
</P>
<P>
	In five games with Kamensky playing left wing, Forsberg has 10  
points, two in each game, and Lemieux has seven. Forsberg had nine 
points and Lemieux had five in the eight games Kamensky missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Val's a great skater,'' Lemieux said. ``When he uses his feet,  
he's a force out there. I knew it wouldn't take any time for him to 
jump in and help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After missing 23 games because of the injury, Kamensky had an  
assist in his first game back and scored a goal the next game. He 
had two assists in the series finale against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky appeared to have jump-started the Avalanche again  
midway through the second period Saturday night by redirecting a 
Lemieux shot under Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The red light didn't go on, but Kamensky and teammates began  
celebrating what they thought was a tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
	On-ice officials weren't sure whether the pole stopped the puck  
or if it was prevented from crossing the goal line by a pad at the 
base of the net that went too close to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the puck never crossed the line,'' Lemieux said, ``but  
it couldn't because of that padding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would've been a goal if the stuffing was in the way. Judges  
decided replays were inconclusive, so they couldn't award Colorado 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the puck go in,'' Kamensky said. ``I think it's a  
goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, Colorado made it 1-1 on Forsberg's  
playoff-leading seventh goal. He flicked in the rebound of a shot 
by Kamensky that Belfour had blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The roles were reversed on the winning goal, with Kamensky  
knocking in his own rebound of Forsberg's miss with 5:58 left in 
regulation. Unlike the waved-off goal, Kamensky had no idea what 
happened on this play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw lots of sticks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Colorado's seventh straight on the road in the  
playoffs. Dallas had won its first five home playoff games and nine 
straight at Reunion Arena counting the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Stars are down in a series for the first time  
since Detroit took a 2-1 lead in last year's Western Conference 
finals. The Red Wings won in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of Dallas' eight victories this postseason have come when  
it was down in the third period and the Stars made quite a run at 
it after Kamensky's goal. But Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy was at 
his best in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get in front of the net and then we've got to  
keep firing away,'' Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We had 
chances at the end, but we didn't get second and third whacks at 
it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw's first WNBA exhibition  
game saw her get 14 points and 13 rebounds while showing flashes of 
the expected excellence to come as the Washington Mystics beat the 
Utah Starzz 76-71 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Proclaimed the female Michael Jordan -- and playing in a triangle  
offense made popular by Jordan's Chicago Bulls -- the WNBA's No. 1 
overall draft pick grabbed the game's first rebound. She had a huge 
smile after scoring her first points on a short turnaround baseline 
jumper 4:52 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 forward, slithering through the paint to work  
herself open, was 5-of-11 from the field in 29 minutes. Her every 
touch of the ball brought cheers from the crowd of 9,028, and her 
two air balls were quickly forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics led the WNBA in attendance last year with an average  
crowd of 15,898 despite the expansion team's 3-27 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's Nikki McCray scored 18 points, including two  
fastbreak layups in the final 2:17 after Utah had cut a six-point 
lead to one. McCray injured her ankle and had to be helped off the 
court after she stepped on Debbie Black's foot with 5.7 seconds to 
play 
</P>
<P>
	Natalie Williams scored 18 points and Wendy Palmer had 13 points  
and 11 rebounds to lead the Starzz, who are shorthanded until Margo 
Dydek and Elena Baranova finish their seasons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, who led Tennessee to three national championships,  
had six offensive rebounds. Washington had 18 offensive rebounds to 
Utah's nine, accounting for a 17-4 advantage in second-chance 
points.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Mia Hamm entered the international record  
book Saturday night as four of her teammates helped set up her 
108th career goal in the United States' 3-0 victory over Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm's goal, which took place during injury time at the end of  
the first half, moved her out of a tie with retired Elisabetta 
Vignotto of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, international superstar Pele scored 77 in his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando native Michelle Akers began the series with a pass to  
Hamm, who sent it to Kristin Lilly, who passed to Cindy Parlow. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow made the final one-touch back to Hamm, who had beaten  
Brazilian defender Elane on the right side. Hamm fired a shot 
behind goalie Didi to give the United States the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Carla Overbeck scooped the ball out of the goal and  
presented it to Hamm, already surrounded by her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was special to set the record on such a great goal,'' said  
Hamm, 27, who played in her 172nd game with the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hamm had a golden opportunity slip away when she  
intercepted a Brazilian pass back to goal, but her wide-open shot 
was turned away during the game played at the Florida Citrus Bowl 
before a crowd of 10,452. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly put the United States ahead 2-0 in in the 72nd minute off  
a corner kick from Tiffeny Milbrett, who added a goal 15 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	A second ball was thrown on the field when Milbrett was  
receiving a cross from Lilly, distracting some Brazilian defenders. 
The referee threw the second ball off as play continued, and the 
United States scored seconds later. A Brazilan player was ejected 
after shoving an official. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 13-2-1 this season with its fifth  
straight victory in a nine-game tour leading up to its Women's 
World Cup opener June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Brianna Scurry registered 10 saves.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the first team to arrive in the United States in  
preparation for the Women's World Cup, threatened often in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Its best opportunity came in the 31st minute, when Nene fired a  
shot from the right side that bounced off the left post. Katia 
tried to put in the ricochet, but was stuffed by Scurry, who made 
the save sitting down.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A fire raced through a house  
early Sunday, killing two adults and four boys who were sleeping 
over as guests of their son. The 17-year-old son escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire in this community, about 40 miles northwest of Grand  
Rapids, was reported at 4:52 a.m., the Montcalm County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher W. Simmons escaped from the burning house and ran to  
a neighbor's house to call for help. By the time the Crystal 
Township Fire Department arrived the house was fully engulfed in 
flames, the fire department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Bob Brundage said the teen-ager was downstairs when  
the fire broke out and the smoke was too thick for him to reach 
either his friends or his mother or stepfather. One of the 
teen-agers who was upstairs managed to make it downstairs but was 
unable to find his way out of the house through the smoke, Brundage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All six apparently died of smoke inhalation, Brundage said.  
</P>
<P>
	Simmons' mother, Linda L. Christophersen, 42, and his  
stepfather, Richard A. Christophersen, 37, were killed in the fire. 
Also killed were Simmons' friends, Lee A. Geselman, 16, Blakely D. 
Sailor, 17, Matthew S. Long, 15, and Stephen J. Long, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was treated for burns at Carson City Hospital and  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department said there was a smoke alarm in the  
house but it was not immediately known if it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire is under investigation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Reno for China Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton administration ally, Democratic Sen.  
Robert Torricelli, said Sunday that Attorney Janet Reno's job 
should be on the line over the Justice Department's failure to 
actively pursue suspected Chinese spying in U.S. nuclear energy 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee  
said Reno should lose her job in light of a congressional report, 
due for release this week, on Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokesman said Reno believes she acted  
responsibly and according to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Cabinet member, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose  
department oversees the labs, said tighter security measures were 
in place at the labs and it remained unclear what secrets were 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot overdramatize conclusions that are not conclusive  
yet,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A select House committee under Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,  
planned to make public on Tuesday its findings on Chinese attempts 
to buy and steal U.S. technology for rocket launching and nuclear 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's conclusions have filtered out in recent weeks: that  
over the past two decades, China has obtained sensitive information 
about seven major weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said someone must take responsibility for the slow  
response to a security breach at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab 
in New Mexico that first came to light in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate intelligence committee chairman, Richard Shelby,  
R-Ala., pointed to Reno, saying the attorney general and her top 
lieutenants should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's time, considering her role, or lack of role,  
her trying to defend the indefensible,'' he said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also on CBS, agreed  
that ``some heads should roll.'' Somebody, he said, ``made some 
major mistakes here, and somebody needs to be accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopeful Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said on CNN's  
``Late Edition'' that he would press for a full investigation and 
if officials ``are held accountable, they are going to go to 
jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, on CBS, was nearly as critical, saying Reno's  
failure of judgment in the Los Alamos case were ``inexplicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time for President Clinton to have a conversation  
with the attorney general about her ability to perform her duties 
and whether or not it is in the national interest for her to 
continue,'' said Torricelli, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers specifically pointed to the Justice Department's  
repeated denials of requests by the FBI to wiretap Los Alamos 
scientist Wen Ho Lee, who is suspected of passing secrets to the 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said there were insufficient grounds for a court  
order to monitor Wen, who was fired from the lab this March, three 
years after he first came under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Reno had reviewed  
the decision and fully supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department cannot and must not authorize intrusion  
by the government into the lives of its citizens when the evidence 
presented as in this case fails to meet the standards established 
by the Constitution'' and surveillance laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have urged Reno to resign over her refusal to  
request appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged 
Chinese contributions to Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed dismay  
she was not told of the potentially major security losses until 
earlier this year. ``I was not briefed. That was wrong and I made 
that clear and that has been rectified,'' she said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said Richardson has made a  
serious effort to tighten security, and there had been a ``sea 
change'' in administration attitudes since the middle of last year, 
when his committee began investigating Chinese attempts to gain 
U.S. satellite and nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In other details from the Cox report:

	--Time magazine said in its latest edition that a top Defense  
official in 1996 warned Loral Space and Communications, which had 
contracted with China to launch its satellites, not to give China 
any help with its problem-ridden rocket systems without State 
Department permission. Loral went ahead with its advice to China, 
whose rockets subsequently showed dramatic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Orange County Register in California reported that private  
guards hired by Loral and other U.S. companies to provide security 
for U.S. satellite launches in China slept on the job, went to work 
drunk and solicited prostitutes.

<HEADLINE> Jalabert Retakes Tour of Italy Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCONA, Italy (AP) -- Laurent Jalabert replaced defending  
champion Marco Pantani as the overall leader of the Tour of Italy 
Sunday by winning an individual time trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert covered 20 miles in 40 minutes, 36 seconds, and  
overtook Pantani, the winner of Saturday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergy Gontchar finished second Sunday, 25 seconds behind  
Jalabert. Pantani, not known for his time trial skills, was third 
at 41:31. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine of the Tour's 22 stages, Jalabert and Pantani were  
virtually tied, with the French national champion leading by only 
.02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Dario Frigo was third, 58 seconds behind Jalabert.  
Gontchar was fourth, 1:09 back, and Ivan Gotti, the 1997 Tour 
winner, fifth, 1:13 behind. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Intel Head Sees Internet As Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Companies that have yet to go online should  
do so now, or they will fold within a few years, the chairman of 
Intel Corp. warned investors at a business survival seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In five years, there won't be any Internet companies because  
they will all be Internet companies,'' Andrew Grove, head of the 
world's largest maker of computer chips, said Saturday. ``Otherwise 
they will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which Grove helped found in 1968, has seen its Internet  
business grow from zero percent in 1997 to a projected 42 percent 
this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even junkyards have gone online, acquiring cars, stripping them  
of parts, cataloguing them, and then filling Internet orders from 
all over the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers and sellers don't even have to talk to each other at the  
same time to conduct business online. Thanks to e-mail and other 
devices, they can communicate regardless of time or place, 
extending the business day. 
</P>
<P>
	But simply being online isn't enough, Grove said, as he  
cautioned investors that many Internet companies that are getting a 
lot of publicity now won't be around for the long haul. Those that 
survive will employ traditional business tenets, like being 
customer oriented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grove spoke at the third annual Los Angeles Times Investment  
Strategies Conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Boss Praises Book on Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ex-CIA Chief James Woolsey was effusive in  
praising a new book criticizing the Clinton administration for its 
national security policy. What Woolsey apparently missed was that 
the book was full of highly classified U.S. intelligence documents 
-- the kind Woolsey was bound to protect when he was the nation's 
chief spy. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey's blurb on the jacket of Bill Gertz's book,  
``Betrayal,'' was unambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the Clinton administration's least favorite book  
on its foreign policy,'' said the former member of the Clinton 
administration. ``But the rebuttals are likely to be long on 
adjectives and short on refutation, for these tough charges are 
backed, the Gertz way, by fact after fact after fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Woolsey says he realized only later was that many of those  
facts are laid out in reprints of classified documents that Gertz, 
a reporter for The Washington Times, had obtained over several 
years of covering national security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some of the stories Gertz wrote for the newspaper based  
on leaked classified documents appeared during Woolsey's tenure as 
CIA director through the first two years of President Clinton's 
first term. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said they were deeply concerned  
over the public display of documents labeled ``Top Secret'' and 
containing highly sensitive information including indications of 
the sources the CIA and other U.S. agencies used to collect highly 
sensitive information about foreign adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had not seen the documents -- the manuscript I read did not  
have the documents attached,'' Woolsey said in a telephone 
interview. ``I am not in favor of the publication of 
still-classified documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey added that he did not necessarily blame Gertz for  
disclosing secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reporters do what reporters do,'' Woolsey said. The problem,  
he said, lies in government officials who ``give classified 
documents outside secure channels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey served a stormy tenure at CIA, grappling with lawmakers  
who criticized him for failing to fire anyone in the wake of the 
Aldrich Ames spy case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving CIA, Woolsey has, at times, criticized Clinton's  
foreign policy, calling his policy on Iraq ``flaccid,'' for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	A major issue covered by the Gertz book is national missile  
defense, a favorite cause of conservative Republicans and a program 
Clinton has been reluctant to embark upon throughout his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey, who now practices law in Washington, has testified on  
Capitol Hill in favor of establishing a national missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Also praising the book in jacket blurbs were Caspar Weinberger,  
defense secretary under President Reagan, and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.

<HEADLINE>  Royals' King Unexpectedly Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- First baseman Jeff King, turning his  
back on about $3 million, unexpectedly retired today, suggesting 
his heart was no longer in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old King, bothered by a disc problem in his back  
since last fall, had already been paid about one-quarter of his $4 
million salary on the final year of a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his nagging back problem was not the major reason for  
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head is here, my heart is not,'' he said, fighting back  
tears. ``I played the game with integrity, played hard and played 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King had played in only 21 games this year, hitting .236 in 72  
at-bats with three home runs and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year veteran began the season with a .256 career average.  
He averaged 29 home runs and 112 RBIs in his first two seasons with 
Kansas City, in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	King hit .263 with 24 home runs and 93 RBIs last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The move could have positive financial repercussions for the  
cash-strapped Royals. They had been planning to trade pitcher Kevin 
Appier to unload his $4.8 million contract to get money to sign 
next month's high draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The first overall pick of the 1986 draft, King played seven  
seasons for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to turn the page, close the chapter and begin a new  
one. It comes down to integrity. The struggle I've had with it, I 
think it's affected the way I've played,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of his teammates sat in the back of the room as King  
made his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to walk away like this proves Jeff King is a man of  
integrity,'' said catcher Mike Sweeney, fighting back tears 
himself. ``It shows he's a man. He could have continued to play the 
next 4 1/2 months and taken a paycheck every two weeks and not had his 
heart in the game. But Jeff is a man of integrity. He shut it down 
when he thought the time was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said he had worked hard and ``hoped to get back to where a  
player needs to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just came to the point that as much as I hoped and  
wished, my heart was not totally committed,'' he said. ``It's tough 
to come out here every day and play at the level that my manager 
and my teammates think I need to play at.''

	NATO Strikes Belgrade Electricity  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Groping for flashlights and  
explanations, Belgraders stumbled through a long, dark weekend as 
NATO continued to attack Yugoslavia's already crippled electricity 
system today. The attacks appear aimed at increasing domestic 
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a 
Western peace plan for Kosovo. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 refugees 
fled Kosovo yesterday, and more entered neighboring Macedonia by 
the busload today.

intensifying efforts to clear ethnic Albanians from central and 
southern Kosovo. The arrival of as many as 8,000 new refugees is 
possible today, said Ron Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. That prediction followed the arrival 
yesterday of 7,700 refugees, the biggest one-day total since the 
first week of May.

	Paper: Britain Knows Libya Ordered Bomb

	LONDON (AP) -- The British government knows Libyan leader Moammar  
Ghadafi ordered the Lockerbie bombing and has gagged the Sunday 
Times newspaper to prevent it from publishing details, the paper 
said today. ``We have known for a long while that Gadhafi gave the 
order. It is a sham for him to pretend otherwise and it is an even 
bigger sham for the British government to let him off the hook,'' 
the Times quoted an unidentified former senior intelligence officer 
as saying. Two men, both suspected Libyan intelligence agents, are 
being held in the Netherlands, awaiting trial on charges of 
planting a bomb that caused the explosion, which killed 270 people.

	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plans to unveil today a  
new administration study showing that the increasing 
responsibilities of the workplace are cutting deeply into America's 
family time. In conjunction with release of the study, he is 
directing the Labor Department to formulate regulations that would 
allow states to legislate changes under which surplus unemployment 
funds could be used for parental leave. The study from the White 
House Council of Economic Advisers found that the quality time 
parents can spend with their children has decreased by 14 percent 
over the last 30 years.

poured into the streets around Jakarta today, waving flags and 
honking horns in a huge show of support for presidential 
front-runner Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of founding President 
Sukarno. Vehicles driven by members of the Indonesian Democracy 
Party in Struggle, or PDIP, choked Jakarta's streets and major 
arteries, bringing normally light Sunday traffic to a standstill. 
It was by far the most impressive turnout so far after five days of 
campaigning for the crucial June 7 election, which will determine 
the makeup of a new Parliament whose lawmakers are to form a 
special assembly that will select a president.

his crew in training and that the evacuation of 1,093 people went 
like clockwork. ``I don't know what the captain of the Titanic was 
thinking, but as far as I was concerned, everyone had to be saved, 
whether it was a crew or a passenger. A life is a life,'' Captain 
Sven Hartzell, 56, told The Straits Times newspaper in an interview 
published today. All passengers and crew members aboard Hartzell's 
ship, the eight-deck Sun Vista, were rescued in lifeboats after it 
sank off the coast of Malaysia early Friday.

wind better than the other big names in the field as he fired a 
4-under-par 68. Woods, reportedly paid $1 million just to appear in 
the tournament, is now 11-under-par at 215 after three rounds. He 
built the lead by nailing birdies on the 16th and 18th holes. 
England's Peter Baker and Brian Davis, who briefly moved even with 
Woods midway through the round, are second at 8-under 218 with 
two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els of Africa at 7-under.

<HEADLINE> Doctor At Center of Lewis Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. Gilbert Mudge's privileged life and stellar  
career followed a textbook trajectory: Son of a former Dartmouth 
Medical School dean, graduate of Amherst and Columbia, head of the 
cardiac transplant unit at Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	But life in medicine took a turn for Mudge, the silver-haired  
cardiologist who now is at the center of a malpractice suit brought 
by the widow of Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis. Win or lose, 
Mudge's dedication to saving lives apparently will be overshadowed 
by one death. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the outcome of this case, he will unfortunately  
always be remembered not as one of the great cardiologists in 
Massachusetts or even the country,'' said malpractice attorney 
Andrew Meyer, who has followed the case closely, ``but rather as 
the doctor who misdiagnosed Reggie Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a characterization few would have imagined six years ago,  
when the usually reserved doctor, then 47, held a jubilant news 
conference to announce that Lewis suffered from a neurological 
fainting disorder and could likely return to professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's now-haunting opinion flew in the face of an earlier  
diagnosis by a ``Dream Team'' of 12 doctors who said Lewis had a 
life-threatening, potentially career-ending heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 27, 1993, two months after Mudge's announcement, Lewis  
collapsed and died of an abnormal heart rhythm while practicing 
jump shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' death dealt a devastating blow to Mudge, who had grown  
close to the player and his wife -- the couple even called the tall, 
thin, bespectacled physician by his childhood nickname, ``Punky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a seemingly charmed life that included a meteoric  
career, a passion for horseback riding and a home in Sherborn -- one 
of Boston's wealthiest suburbs -- it was not the first time Mudge 
was confronted with tremendous loss. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, his son Alan died at 18 in a hiking accident in the  
Canary Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been through his share of pain and suffering, and he  
dealt with enormous grace and courage,'' said Dr. Gregory Curfman, 
a cardiologist and deputy editor at the New England Journal of 
Medicine who has known Mudge for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge and his wife, Barbara, have two surviving sons, both in  
their early 20s, who have regularly attended the trial, which is 
entering its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many months after Lewis' death, the warm relations between Mudge  
and Lewis' wife began to sour, and in 1996, she filed a malpractice 
suit against him and two of his consultants. The lawsuit seeks 
money Lewis could have earned had he lived. A plaintiff's expert 
estimated the figure could top $117 million -- a claim disputed by 
defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis' attorney has portrayed Mudge as a doctor  
whose desire to be a hero to the Lewises, the Celtics and thousands 
of fans eclipsed his medical judgment and led to the death of the 
beloved All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's clearly being tortured by this,'' Meyer said. ``It's a  
stressful, uncomfortable and painful situation for any doctor to be 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's father was Dr. Gilbert Horton Mudge, a former dean of  
Dartmouth Medical School who died in 1996. The younger Mudge 
attended Amherst and graduated from Columbia's College of 
Physicians &AMP; Surgeons in 1970, joined Brigham and Women's about 
five years later and went on to become the hospital's chief of 
clinical cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, the hospital's heart transplant unit was created with  
Mudge at the helm. He now runs the program, which has given new 
hearts to at least 379 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives a lot of himself to a lot of people,'' Curfman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Through his attorney, William Dailey Jr., Mudge declined to  
comment, maintaining a public silence that began when Lewis died. 
Dailey is expected to begin presenting the defense case later this 
week.

<HEADLINE> GOP Debates Budget Fight Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans have yet to devise a  
strategy for avoiding a year-end spending fight with President 
Clinton, even though previous budget battles hurt the GOP, and 
party leaders promise no repeats. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely four months from the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2000,  
lawmakers are starting to write the 13 annual spending bills that 
keep agencies in business. The first of those bills -- financing the 
Agriculture Department and Congress' own operations -- is due on the 
House floor this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the GOP-written budget Congress approved last month and the  
1997 budget-balancing deal between lawmakers and Clinton require 
billions of dollars in cuts in the spending measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides want to boost defense spending, which could mean  
cutting roughly $25 billion from education, national parks and 
other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The dilemma for the Republicans running Congress:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make the required cuts. But some of the bills will not pass  
the House and Senate, let alone get Clinton's signature. Democrats 
will accuse the GOP of slashing popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Resist the cuts. GOP conservatives will revolt because the  
extra spending will come from the federal surplus, derived entirely 
from Social Security. The GOP has pledged not to raid those funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision has to be faced up to,'' Rep. Bill Young,  
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he has told 
House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner we get engaged and decisions made, the sooner we  
can proceed properly,'' Young, R-Fla., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Added John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill.: ``We want to get our strategy done as soon as possible. 
We're still working on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One option GOP leaders have discussed is seeking early  
negotiations with the White House, say top Republican aides in both 
chambers. Such talks also could cover cutting taxes and overhauling 
Social Security and Medicare for the coming retirement of baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects for talks seem remote.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would have little incentive to help the GOP out of its  
budget fix, and Republicans harbor a deep distrust for the 
president. That is particularly true on the sensitive issues of 
Social Security and Medicare, which White House spokesman Barry 
Toiv said the administration wants to resolve first. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent end-of-year budget fights have gone badly for the GOP,  
and leaders have promised to avoid another one. The worst were the 
government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996, and the $21 billion in 
so-called emergency spending enacted last year -- to the dismay of 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone says, usually privately, that billions in extra  
spending ultimately will be added this year so both parties can 
deal with promises to improve schools, health research and the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is neither side wants to be the first to suggest  
such spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear they would tarnish their fiscally conservative  
image, betray their promises to leave Social Security alone and 
tear their party apart by angering conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``My message to the leaders is, 'Stick to that budget,''' said  
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leading House conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats do not want to be accused of squandering Social  
Security money, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are happy to let ``Republicans stew in their own juice for  
as long as possible into October so we can clearly define the 
differences between the two parties'' for next year's elections, 
said Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	In his budget, Clinton proposed spending $22 billion above  
budget-balancing pact limits. He proposed paying for it largely by 
raising taxes, chiefly on cigarettes; Congress is likely to ignore 
such proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Republicans, the Senate Appropriations Committee is  
looking at raising extra money by increasing federal fees and 
selling portions of the broadcast spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Some House Republicans say if certain spending bills bog down,  
Congress could allocate money at the same levels as last year, 
making it hard for Clinton to veto the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans also see a prolonged spending fight as an  
opportunity to paint Democrats as eager to use Social Security 
money to pump up the federal bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> Document: Tobacco Candy Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- A major cigarette maker once considered making  
tobacco-based lollipops and other candies with nicotine at the same 
time the industry claimed it was trying to make smoking 
unattractive to kids, a formerly secret document shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was among several novel tobacco product proposals to  
emerge during an October 1992 brainstorming session by executives 
at Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., according to a memo quoted by 
the Saint Paul Pioneer Press on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Others included a wafer bread product, ``foam tobacco; sponge or  
cotton candy like product,'' a fruit roll-up, tea, a paper stick 
resembling a lollipop, a ``chew stick,'' tobacco spice to sprinkle 
on food, a ``tobacco-derived salted snack'' and a tobacco pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also looked at an ``asthma inhaler-like product,'' a  
nicotine nasal spray, chewing tobacco that didn't have to be spit 
out, tobacco toothpicks and an ``atomizer activated by sucking.'' 
It also considered tobacco lotion, perfume and aftershave. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo's author wrote that the meeting's participants were  
searching for a ``socially acceptable'' tobacco product, one that 
contained nicotine but had a ``positive image.'' The author also 
said it should be smoke-free, odorless, easy, ``pleasant'' to use 
and have ``satisfaction readily controlled by user.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the tobacco industry said the memo may provide the  
Food and Drug Administration with a powerful piece of evidence that 
the tobacco industry markets nicotine as a drug, and that the 
industry therefore should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith said the memo just  
reflects some ``dumb ideas'' floated in the kind of freewheeling 
brainstorming in which any corporation might indulge -- and that 
management never let those ideas reach the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court last month agreed to rule on whether the  
FDA can regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and  
Health, said the new-found memo ``is one of the strongest pieces of 
evidence supporting the FDA's position that they (tobacco 
companies) intended nicotine as a drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're basically talking about here is `How do we cram  
nicotine into people?''' Banzhaf told the Pioneer Press. ``They're 
talking about how it has to be at certain levels, and they even use 
the word `controlled,' and that is at the heart of the FDA's 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo is among 36 million pages of documents made public  
following the major tobacco companies' $6.6 billion settlement with 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents in the collection show that the four leading tobacco  
companies -- Brown &AMP; Williamson, Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. -- all investigated a variety 
of novel tobacco and smoking products. But Brown &AMP; Williamson 
seemed to have the widest range of ideas for novel tobacco 
products, the Pioneer Press said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Go 'Loca' for Ricky Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Hundreds of screaming, crying, singing fans who  
aren't ashamed to say they're ``loca'' for Ricky Martin flocked to 
a mall for a glimpse of the Latin singing sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin appeared at a record store at NorthPark Center for a  
two-hour autograph session Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans arrived in the wee hours of the morning to secure their  
spots in line. Others -- male and female -- stood outside all day in 
90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' the first single from his new  
English-language album, ``Ricky Martin,'' is at the top of the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old former member of Menudo is attracting throngs  
wherever he goes. Two weeks ago, an enthusiastic crowd that 
gathered to see him at a Manhattan record store outnumbered the 
people across the street lined up for an advance screening of the 
new ``Star Wars'' movie.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Feds Eye Cancer Drug Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal authorities reportedly are investigating  
whether doctors padded their incomes by overbilling Medicare for an 
expensive drug used to treat cancer, even charging for samples they 
received for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, Lupron, has been on the market since 1989 and is used  
to treat prostate cancer, the second-deadliest cancer among men. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Chicago-area urologists told the Chicago Tribune that the  
manufacturer, TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc., charges $300 to $350 for 
each monthly dose. But Medicare allows reimbursement of $565 a 
dose, according to Wisconsin Physician Service Insurance Corp. of 
Madison, Wis., which handles Medicare claims in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the government paid $467 million for Medicare-covered  
Lupron treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	TAP sales presentations included a company-supplied program that  
listed how much a doctor would collect if he billed Medicare for 
the samples he was given, former company sales representatives told 
the newspaper. At least half a dozen former employees told the 
paper they had been contacted by federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could show the (income from) free samples, or hit an icon  
and it would disappear,'' said a representative who used the 
program. Former TAP employees contacted by the Tribune declined to 
be named because of fears that criticism of the industry might hurt 
their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	TAP officials declined to answer the newspaper's questions about  
the federal investigation or most other issues. The company, a 
joint venture of Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, Ill., and 
Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, said in a written 
response to the newspaper that Lupron's price is justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Medicare-covered drugs are based on the ``average  
wholesale price,'' or AWP, which is published in the Red Book, the 
pharmaceutical industry's guide for drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the AWP for Lupron that appears in the Red Book is supplied  
by TAP -- not wholesalers, the Tribune reported. The company sells 
the drug directly to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Because TAP controls Lupron's price, it can build in a profit  
for doctors, said Bruce Vladeck, who from 1993 to 1997 headed the 
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear we were paying substantially more (for Lupron  
than doctors' costs). We were generating a nice little side 
business for a bunch of urologists,'' Vladeck said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Accused of Funding Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A company that manufactured part of the diet drug  
combo fen-phen hired ghostwriters for articles promoting obesity 
treatment and then used prominent researchers to publish the works 
under their names, according to lawsuit evidence cited in a 
newspaper report on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal action claims that Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which  
made the ``fen'' half of the drug combination, hid health risks 
associated with the drugs. The company allegedly tried to play down 
or remove descriptions of side effects from the articles, The 
Dallas Morning News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of the 10 articles paid for by Wyeth actually were  
published in medical journals before the company pulled the drugs 
from the market in September 1997, when studies linked the combo to 
heart valve damage and an often-fatal lung disease. Plans to 
publish the eight others were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Wyeth, a division of American Home Products Corp.,  
defended the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a common practice in the industry. It's not particular  
to us,'' Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus said. ``The companies have 
some input, it seems, in the initial development of the piece ... 
but the proposed author has the last say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, medical ethicists and editors of prominent medical  
journals criticized the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing here is clearly an advertisement, but it's  
couched in a scientifically valid paper,'' said Dr. Robert M. 
Tenery Jr., a Dallas ophthalmologist and chairman of the American 
Medical Association's council on ethical and judicial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the published researchers, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the  
University of Pennsylvania, said he had no idea that Wyeth financed 
or edited his article. Had he known, he would not have 
participated, he said. He said he threw away the first draft 
supplied by an intermediary medical writing company and wrote his 
own work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really deceptive,'' said Stunkard, whose article was  
published in the American Journal of Medicine in February 1996. 
``It sort of makes you uneasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``fen'' in fen-phen refers to Pondimin (fenfluramine) and  
Redux (dexfenfluramine), both sold by Wyeth. Phentermine, the other 
half of the combo, is not made by Wyeth and is still available. 
</P>
<P>
	Six million people in the United States took Pondimin or Redux.  
Individuals who took the weight-loss combo have filed thousands of 
lawsuits nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth and a company it acquired hired Excerpta Medica, Inc., to  
write the 10 articles, according to lawsuit documents cited by the 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpta, based in Belle Mead, N.J., planned to submit most of  
the papers to medical journals owned by its parent company, Reed 
Elsevier Plc, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning News reported that Wyeth officials said in  
depositions that the two published articles were reviewed for 
fairness by independent panels at the journals in which they 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``The articles were not written with a slant toward selling the  
product,'' said Dr. Jo Alene Dolan, Wyeth's former associate 
director of clinical affairs, in a Jan. 15 deposition cited by the 
newspaper. ``The articles are written with fair balance.''

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Linked to Popular Cheese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A strain of drug-resistant salmonella  
bacteria which caused two outbreaks of digestive illness has been 
linked for the first time to raw milk used to make a cheese popular 
with Hispanics, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreaks struck three Northern California counties, peaking  
in February 1997 and involving 31 patients, and the Yakima, Wash., 
area, peaking in April 1997 and involving 79 patients. They were 
the first such outbreaks of drug-resistant salmonella, and almost 
all those sickened were Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	All the cases were linked to Mexican-style soft cheese made from  
unpasteurized milk, according to the report, which appeared in the 
May 19 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd been tracking this kind of salmonella and noticed it's  
been on the increase, but have never been able to trace it to a 
source before now,'' said Dr. Sara H. Cody, a communicable disease 
control officer with the Santa Clara County Department of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outbreak in the (San Francisco) Bay area was the first  
time we were able to trace it to the source,'' she said. ``The 
important thing is that this is the first time it could be linked 
to food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very popular in our diet,'' Maria Esquite, a clerk at the  
Casa Lucas supermarket in San Francisco's Mission district, said 
May 18. She estimated that 80 percent of the market's customers eat 
queso fresco, the type of soft white cheese implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	She said they were aware of the warnings and the potential for  
salmonella, and Casa Lucas sells only pasteurized cheese. Most of 
the patients said they purchased the cheese from street vendors, at 
flea markets or small corner Mexican grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Donnalley, a supervising special investigator with the state  
Department of Food and Agriculture, said that while California does 
allow the sale of raw milk products, the manufacturers are licensed 
and closely regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are making this `bootleg' or `bathtub' cheese  
illegally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California outbreak did have one positive result, Donnalley  
said. A few months later, several agencies banded together in an 
outreach program, talking to public health officials and the 
Hispanic community about the dangers of eating raw milk products. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths were reported in either outbreak, although 14 percent  
of those examined were hospitalized, Cody said. And no other 
``carriers'' have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raw milk is a wonderful culture medium for bacteria of all  
sorts,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria are resistant to five types of common antibiotics,  
although Cody said there are still some drugs which can be used to 
combat the strain if the doctor realizes what he or she is dealing 
with, Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why does California allow raw milk sales?  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very clearly the intent of the Legislature (in a 1977  
bill) to make raw milk products available to consumers in 
California who want it,'' said Lee Jensen, acting head of Food and 
Agriculture's milk and dairy food branch. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect those consumers, licensed sources of raw milk and  
products made from it are inspected once a month during the summer 
and twice a month during the winter, he said. Samples are tested 
for a variety of bacterial contamination, including salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen said that while investigators have yet to come up with  
evidence they can take to court, it's believed there are dairies 
operating on a cash basis who will sell raw milk to underground 
cheese factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raw cheeses do have a much more distinct flavor,'' Jensen  
said. ``It's an acquired taste, one the customers may have 
developed in their home country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one more bug to add to the list of bugs that  
contaminate raw milk,'' said Cody. ``It's just one more reason not 
to drink raw milk or eat products made from raw milk.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Family Help Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMBLING, La. (AP) -- Seeking a balance between Americans' work  
and home life, President Clinton said Sunday states could tap 
unemployment surplus funds for paid leave for new parents and 
federal workers could use sick days to care for an ailing family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a nation must find a way to give your generation of  
parents some of that time back,'' Clinton told 477 graduates of 
Grambling State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all of this of this nation's pro-family rhetoric, the hard  
truth is that other countries with advanced economies do a lot more 
to support working parents than we do. We must think bigger and do 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the ``round-the-world, round-the-clock  
economy'' was putting more demands than ever on working parents, 
and a new study by the Council of Economic Advisers showed families 
today are spending an average of 22 fewer hours per week together 
than families did 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton directed the Labor Department to develop rules so states  
could use surplus unemployment funds -- which are administered by 
the states -- to pay for leave for parents of newborns and adopted 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes in response to requests from Maryland,  
Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington. The majority of states now 
have surplus unemployment funds, said White House spokesman Barry 
Toiv. The proposal was expected to cost about $60 million, spread 
over various federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the proposal does not require  
congressional approval, but could require some changes in various 
state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers also drew the president's attention.  
</P>
<P>
	He said that while the 1993 federal family leave law has helped  
ease the strain on workers who must care for a sick parent, spouse 
or child, it did not provide relief for those unable to take time 
off without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to set a goal that all working Americans can take  
time when they need it to care for their families, without losing 
the income they need to support their families,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a start, Clinton directed the Office of Personnel Management  
to allow federal employees to use up to 12 weeks of accrued sick 
leave annually to care for a seriously ill family member. 
</P>
<P>
	Most federal employees now can take only 13 days of sick leave  
each year for such a need. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every company in America that offers sick leave to its  
workers adopted the same policy we're adopting today, half of all 
the American work force would have this important benefit,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family leave law says all employers with 50 or more workers  
must allow up to 12 unpaid weeks off to care for a new baby or 
seriously ill family member. The law also allows workers to use 
sick time and vacation so they can get paid during their leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the graduates they were successful mainly because  
of their parents' sacrifices. He singled out the parents of two 
graduates as other parents and families in the stands clustered 
under umbrellas and fanned themselves with programs in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cited his own childhood days beside his grandfather, who  
ran a small community store. He also recalled giving that same 
exposure to his daughter Chelsea: watching her draw pictures at a 
little desk across from his in the Arkansas governor's mansion, and 
set aside time in the evenings so he could eat with her and his 
wife Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking a lot about family lately, and I expect a  
lot of you have,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing on his mind have been the school shootings in  
Littleton, Colo. and Conyers, Ga., the hate crimes that killed 
James Byrd Jr. in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming, and ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Those events, Clinton said, ``force us to confront the need to  
raise our children to respect others who are different from 
themselves. ... It all begins with family, with parents who love 
their children more than life and raise them to live their 
dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was the first of three commencement addresses Clinton  
plans this year on the impact of the nation's booming economy. He 
also is scheduled to address graduates of the Air Force Academy on 
June 2 and the University of Chicago on June 12.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Chief Denies Meeting Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy bit his tongue and Dave Checketts  
issued a denial Sunday after two newspapers reported that Checketts 
met with former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson to gauge his 
interest in coaching the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to it. There was no meeting,'' Checketts said  
through his spokesman, Barry Watkins, after The New York Times and 
New York Daily News reported the story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Times  
and News said Checketts made no formal offer to Jackson at the 
meeting in mid-April, but discussed the state of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, team president Ernie Grunfeld has been demoted and  
the Knicks have been successful, entering their second-round 
playoff game against Atlanta Sunday with a 2-0 lead in the 
best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, whose job security has been in question throughout  
this tumultuous season, smiled and shook his head before the game 
Sunday when asked for his reaction to the Jackson reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about that,'' he said. ``Every time I'm honest  
it comes back and bites me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, a practicing Mormon who does not attend Sunday games,  
was not at Madison Square Garden for Game 3 against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Musburger, the agent for Jackson, could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Checketts and Musburger were quoted in the Times story  
denying there was a meeting. Musburger has said in the past that as 
many as six teams are interested in speaking to Jackson about a 
coaching position. He has not disclosed the teams, although it is 
widely believed that the Lakers, Nets and Nuggets are among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's resurgence has fueled talk that Van Gundy's job is  
safe for another year, although Checketts has said he will wait 
until the season ends before making any personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has one more year remaining on a three-year, $6  
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation over the possible hiring of Jackson was commonplace  
this season while the Knicks were struggling, and center Patrick 
Ewing said he would demand a trade rather than play for Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shocks me,'' Ewing said of the meeting between Checketts  
and Jackson, which the Times said also was attended by Musburger. 
``I've said it. I'm not playing for Phil Jackson. There's no way. 
They can trade me if they get Phil.''

<HEADLINE> Belgian Film Wins Top Cannes Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- ``Rosetta,'' a Belgian film about an  
unemployed young woman trying desperately to carve out a normal 
life, won top honors at the 52nd annual Cannes Film Festival 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Palm-winning film was the fourth movie by brothers  
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. The 18-year-old actress in the film, 
Emilie Dequenne, also won the best actress award for her portrayal 
of the jobless woman. It was her very first screen role. 
</P>
<P>
	In an awards ceremony full of surprises, not to mention an  
embarrassing moment for French star Sophie Marceau, Dequenne shared 
the actress award with Severine Caneele of the French film 
``Humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caneele won along with her ``Humanity'' co-star, Emmanuel  
Schotte, who received the best actor prize. Both were not 
professional actors. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, a slow-moving, sexually explicit tale of a small-town  
cop investigating a sordid murder, also won the Grand Prize as 
runner-up to ``Rosetta.'' It was directed by Bruno Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
	But by far, the most popular award of the night was the best  
director prize to Pedro Almodovar, the colorful Spanish director, 
for his ``All About My Mother.'' He was the only winner to receive 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard's 13th film was a big favorite with critics at  
Cannes. It impressed audiences with its balance of tragedy and 
humor and its quartet of absorbing female characters: a resilient 
single mother, a transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a 
lesbian actress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Almodovar paid tribute to his actresses, and also  
to three directors who many felt should have been honored in some 
way for their films: Americans David Lynch for ``The Straight 
Story,'' Jim Jarmusch for ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' 
and Atom Egoyan, the Canadian director of ``Felicia's Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also shut out of the winners was a crowd favorite, ``Kikujiro,''  
a lighthearted road movie by Japanese director Takeshi Kitano. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the awards contain surprises, and this year was no  
exception, especially with an eclectic jury headed by ``Crash'' 
director David Cronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprises weren't limited to the awards. Marceau took the  
stage to present the Golden Palm and launched into a rambling, 
disoriented speech. The audience called for her to stop, and she 
eventually was interrupted by the hostess of the ceremony, British 
actress Kristin Scott Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In other awards, the jury prize went to ``The Letter,'' by  
veteran director Manoel de Oliveira of Portugal. And in a nod to a 
film that was widely panned, best screenplay went to ``Moloch,'' a 
German-Russian production about Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Camera award for first-time director went to ``Marana  
Simhasanam,'' by Murali Nair of India. 
</P>
<P>
	An award for technical achievement went to Chen Kaige's sweeping  
historical epic about the origins of China, ``The Emperor and the 
Assassin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's jury included Jeff Goldblum and Holly Hunter;  
directors Andre Techine, George Miller, Maurizio Nichetti and Doris 
Dorrie; playwright Yasmina Reza; classical singer Barbara Hendricks 
and French actress Dominque Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	Several notable films also premiered at the festival outside the  
main competition. One of them was Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' a 
powerful look at the summer of 1977, when New York was terrorized 
by serial killer David Berkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Also notable was Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' a controversial  
religious satire featuring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as two very 
un-angelic angels trying to make it back to heaven.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushing Pro-Family Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMBLING, La. (AP) -- Tears rolled down Tieaesha Gaines' cheeks  
as she scanned the bleachers for her mother -- a woman to whom 
President Clinton paid tribute for working three jobs and commuting 
200 miles a day despite spinal problems to put her daughter through 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother, like so many others, who needs a break, Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	In this commencement season, Clinton is pitching to the Class of  
1999 -- the next generation of parents -- a broader pro-family agenda 
that goes beyond tuition tax breaks and child care and seeks to 
help Americans balance work and home life in this 
``round-the-world, round-the-clock economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president used an address Sunday to Tieaesha and 476 other  
graduates of Grambling State University to promote a plan to let 
states tap surplus unemployment benefits for paid leave for new 
parents and allow federal workers to use sick days to care for an 
ailing family member. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all of this nation's pro-family rhetoric, the hard truth  
is that other countries with advanced economies do a lot more to 
support working parents than we do,'' Clinton said. ``We must think 
bigger and do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new study by the president's Council of Economic Advisers  
found that families today are spending an average of 22 fewer hours 
per week together than families did 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a nation must find a way to give your generation of  
parents some of that time back,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed the Labor Department to develop rules under which  
states, which administered unemployment funds, could use surplus 
dollars to finance leave for parents of newborn and adopted 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes in response to requests from Maryland,  
Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington state. Most states now have 
surplus unemployment funds, said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the proposal does not require  
congressional approval, but it could require some changes in 
various state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers also drew the president's attention.  
</P>
<P>
	He said that while the 1993 family leave law has helped ease the  
strain on workers who must care for a sick parent, spouse or child, 
it did not provide for those who can't afford time off without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to set a goal that all working Americans can take  
time when they need it to care for their families, without losing 
the income they need to support their families,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a start, Clinton directed the Office of Personnel Management  
to allow federal employees to use up to 12 weeks of accrued sick 
leave annually to care for a seriously ill family member. 
</P>
<P>
	Most federal employees now can take only 13 days of sick leave  
each year for such a need. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every company in America that offers sick leave to its  
workers adopted the same policy we're adopting today, half of all 
the American work force would have this important benefit,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family leave law says all employers with 50 or more workers  
must allow up to 12 unpaid weeks off to care for a new baby or 
seriously ill family member. The law also allows workers to use 
sick time and vacation so they can get paid during their leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the graduates they were successful mainly because  
of their parents' sacrifices. He singled out the parents of Ms. 
Gaines, of Vallejo, Calif., and Terrance Bedford of Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
	To emphasize the importance of parent-child time together,  
Clinton remembered stealing time in boyhood with his grandfather, 
by tagging along when he went to work as night watchman at a 
sawmill. He did the same with his daughter, Chelsea, setting her 
and her crayons up at a small desk across from his in the Arkansas 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking a lot about family lately, and I expect a  
lot of you have,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the president would use another commencement address  
at the University of Chicago on June 12 to elaborate on how 
individuals are affected by the nation's booming economy.

<HEADLINE> Fed To Recommend Embryo Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidentially appointed ethics panel has  
decided to recommend that the federal government begin paying for 
some research on human embryos, The Washington Post reported in 
Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft report of the decision to be announced next month  
concludes that the moral cost of destroying embryos in research is 
outweighed by the social good that could come from the studies, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the report by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission  
cites recent evidence that some human embryo cells have the 
potential to grow into replacement tissues to treat a wide variety 
of chronic diseases in concluding that it is essentially unfair to 
millions of patients for Congress to continue a 4-year-old funding 
ban on human embryo research. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the report and interviews with panel members and others,  
the Post said the commission will recommend that rules be drafted 
to allow federally financed researchers to conduct studies on 
leftover embryos from fertility clinics if the embryos were no 
longer wanted by the parents who conceived them. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are very difficult judgments to make, but it's a  
balancing act,'' Harold T. Shapiro, chairman of the commission and 
president of Princeton University, told the Post. ``We have moral 
obligations to the future health and welfare of people, and we need 
to balance these with, at the very least, the symbolic moral 
obligation we have to the embryo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel recommendations go beyond those recently  
proposed by the National Institutes of Health, which call for 
federally funded research on laboratory-grown human embryo cells, 
but not on human embryos themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Those NIH recommendations have already drawn opposition in  
Congress and the advisory panel's recommendations next month are 
likely to create even more controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a sense that this is going to be one of the liveliest  
debates on the Senate and the House floors this session,'' Sen. 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told the Post.

	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees  
entered Macedonia early Monday after U.N. workers pleaded with the 
government. Faced with an estimated 15,000 new refugees streaming

air campaign reached the two-month mark, Western leaders differed 
on the means to ensure its success. President Clinton said the air 
campaign was working and would return displaced Kosovo Albanians to 
their homes. But British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook indicated 
bombing was not enough, saying NATO must prepare to deploy troops 
in Kosovo -- with or without resistance from Yugoslav security 
forces.

pay-per-view television audience that initially thought the 
accident was a stunt. Owen Hart, 33, who wrestles under the 
nickname ``Blue Blazer,'' was given CPR in the ring in front of the 
soldout event at Kemper Arena and then taken to a nearby hospital. 
``He was supposed to be lowered down into the ring,'' said a

<HEADLINE> Firefighter Jumped Springsteen Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A firefighter set off an alarm with his  
superiors after cutting to the front of a long line for Bruce 
Springsteen tickets, purporting to be doing an inspection just 
moments before the coveted tickets went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials wouldn't identify the culprit but said he was  
ordered to surrender the four tickets. He could also face 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred Saturday when fans lined up in front of a  
Ticketmaster outlet, hoping for a chance to see the New Jersey 
native at one of his 15 shows in July and August at Continental 
Airlines Arena. All of the tickets that have gone on sale so far 
have sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire truck pulled up in front, and three firefighters got out  
and went inside, said George Romero, one of the waiting fans. ``But 
before they got inside, the people at the front of the line asked 
what was going on. One of the firemen said they were on official 
business, doing a fire inspection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans got angry as they watched one of the firefighters buy four  
tickets while they were still locked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When (the firefighters) walked out, people who had been  
waiting in line for hours started yelling and cursing at them,'' 
Romero said. ``One of the firefighters said, `This is one of the 
perks of the job.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said James Langenbach, a spokesman for the Newark Fire  
Department. After receiving several complaints from would-be ticket 
buyers, the department conducted an internal investigation and 
decided that the firemen who bought the tickets will not be allowed 
to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
	The department isn't sure what to do with the tickets and may  
consider giving them to a charity to be auctioned off to raise 
money. Or, Langenbach said, if the department can identify the 
first person in line who was unable to buy tickets, the coveted 
tickets could go to that person. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a violation of our rules and regulations,'' he  
said. ``It wasn't anything criminal. But it was a really stupid 
mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Keep Groggy Clark Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Detroit's Tony Clark was still groggy Sunday, a  
day after being hit in the head by Cleveland's Jaret Wright in a 
beanball exchange between the Tigers and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, struck in the batting helmet on Saturday, was kept out of  
the starting lineup for the series finale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers first baseman was examined by the team's trainer and  
Dr. Zenos Vangelos, one of the Indians' team physicians, on Sunday. 
He has a bruised head and is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was nailed by Wright in the sixth inning of Detroit's 6-2  
win on Saturday, that led to a brief beanball war, a bench-clearing 
incident and the ejection of Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers first baseman said after Saturday's game that he  
didn't think Wright, who he knows personally from off-season 
charity appearances, was throwing at him on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it wasn't intentional. I know Jaret,'' the 6-foot-7  
Clark said. ``No hard feelings. You never try to hit anyone in the 
head. But that's not going to stop the ringing in my head. ... I'm 
tall enough I usually avoid those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said he and Wright ran into each other and talked Saturday  
night at Detroit's team hotel where Wright had out-of-town guests 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	After Clark was struck, Tigers starter Jeff Weaver hit Ramirez --  
Cleveland's first batter in the bottom of the sixth -- in the head 
with a pitch. Ramirez looked like he was content to only yell at 
Weaver, but once he neared first base, he decided to go after the 
rookie right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ramirez ran half-heartedly toward the mound -- this was  
anything but a charge -- he was met by second base umpire Jim Evans, 
who put his arms out in an attempt to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez side-stepped and moved Evans aside as the benches and  
bullpens for both teams emptied on to the field. Wright was tackled 
to the ground by Tigers manager Larry Parrish, a takedown that 
infuriated Wright and some of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty much classless,'' Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who has already been suspended for five games following  
a brawl in Boston last month when he hit Darren Lewis, is unlikely 
to face a suspension this time. However, Ramirez is certain to get 
one for chasing after Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians GM John Hart did not think Ramirez would get any  
additional time for making minor contact with Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was more of a dance,'' Hart joked. ``It looked  
like a well-chaperoned dance. No touching.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Recommends Embryo Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's top advisory panel on  
medical ethics is recommending government financing of limited 
forms of research on human embryos to build on discoveries 
promising huge medical advances. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bioethics Advisory Commission acknowledged the  
report was likely to raise controversy but said the research's 
promise for the betterment of mankind merits the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft report outlining reasons for the decision by the  
National Bioethics Advisory Commission says Congress should rescind 
parts of its four-year ban on spending federal money for embryonic 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it recommends a regime of tightly controlled  
experiments to obtain so-called ``stem cells'' from embryos left 
over from procedures at fertility clinics. They would be used only 
with the consent of the parents for whom the embryos were created. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells have been shown in recent years to be building blocks  
for almost all human tissue. Scientists say the cells' capability 
to grow into virtually any tissue raises the possibility of growing 
spare body parts or correcting disorders such as Parkinson's 
disease or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This research is allied with a noble cause, and any taint that  
might attach from the source of the stem cells diminishes in 
proportion to the potential good which the research may yield,'' 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Parshall, chief spokeswoman for the Family Research  
Council, criticized the recommendation as ``a classic example of 
situational ethics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the worst kind of utilitarianism .... to say we  
will destroy these so those can live,'' she said. ``One would only 
hope that common sense and compassion would rule the day rather 
than scientific advancement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Brown, president of the American Life League, also attacked  
the commission conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not two classes of human beings,'' she said. ``The  
embryo baby is no different than any other human being and should 
never be subjected to destructive research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bioethics panel's recommendation, being announced officially  
next month, goes further than a proposal last month from a National 
Institutes of Health advisory committee on financing research in 
stem cells, which are obtainable only from human embryos or very 
early fetuses. The NIH rules would allow the institutes to finance 
studies only on cell cultures grown in laboratories and not taken 
from embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Embryos are destroyed in the process of harvesting stem cells, a  
reason such research has raised emotional debate in Congress and 
elsewhere between people on both sides of the abortion question. At 
least 75 members of Congress have said all stem-cell research 
violates the money ban, which has been extended annually since its 
enactment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members reported wide agreement that women should not  
be allowed to terminate a pregnancy to donate the fetal material 
for research. In discussing a possible abortion, it said, the 
possibility of research on the aborted material should not be 
brought up by the physician unless asked.

<HEADLINE> Details of the Conrail Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Details about the Conrail transaction:  
</P>
<P>
	--Norfolk Southern gets about 58 percent of Conrail and CSX most  
of the rest. The two companies will share Conrail tracks and 
facilities in Detroit, Philadelphia and most of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va., takes over about 7,200  
miles of Conrail routes, creating a 21,600-mile rail system in 22 
states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. It will be 
the nation's fourth-largest railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	--CSX, based in Richmond, Va., gets about 4,000 miles of Conrail  
routes, forming a 22,300-mile system serving 23 states, the 
District of Columbia, and Montreal and Ontario, Canada. It will be 
the No. 3 railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	--The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when Conrail 
began operating as a monopoly created by Congress out of six 
bankrupt railroads. However, the transaction also leaves CSX as the 
sole carrier in many markets east of New York's Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	--Philadelphia-based Conrail was sold to the public in 1987 at  
about $15 a share. Its stock was hovering at $71 when CSX offered 
shareholders a package of cash and stock worth $92.50 a share. 
Norfolk Southern eventually upped the bid to $115 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	--CSX and Norfolk Southern hope to grow their business by  
persuading shippers they can offer better north-south service by 
avoiding costly interchanges they now do with Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	--The transaction is costing a net 1,500 union positions and  
requires a similar number of transfers, much of it involving 
clerical and maintenance workers. Another 1,150 management 
positions are being abolished, mostly at Conrail's Philadelphia 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	--The restructuring leaves two giant railroads in the East and  
two in the West, paving the way for the creation of a 
transcontinental railroad.

<HEADLINE> Narrative Helps Blind Enjoy 'Wars' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What is Watto?  
</P>
<P>
	Some might say the junkyard-owning creature in the new ``Star  
Wars'' prequel resembles a fat housefly. But that's not enough for 
Helen Harris, who's blind and has to see Watto with her ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Harris and a team of writers who are sighted have created a  
description of the film so other blind people can enjoy the story

</P>
<P>
	``Most people, whether they have sight or not, could never  
imagine these things without seeing them,'' she said. ``So to tell 
a person who is blind that this guy is different than anything that 
is normal on the Earth doesn't cut it.'' 
</P>

	She and her team at TheatreVision have given the narrative  
treatment to about 20 other movies so far, including ``Forrest 
Gump'' and ``Titanic.'' The separately dubbed voice-over is 
synchronized with the film, and broadcast over a small receiver and 
earphone into the ear of the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the special effects extravaganza of ``Star Wars: Episode I --  
The Phantom Menace'' has menaced the TheatreVision team more than 
any other movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could look at this movie for hours and try to figure it  
out,'' an exasperated Ms. Harris said Saturday after she and her 
writers completed the first draft of their script. 
</P>
<P>
	Because some blind people have never seen anything, a creature  
like Watto must be described using words that draw on words 
associated with touch or hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The leathery flapping wings. His bulbous belly. The scratch of  
his bristled snout. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one character after another requires intricate endless  
description with words that are not in Webster's Dictionary,'' Mrs. 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are hundreds of bizarre creatures slithering through  
``The Phantom Menace,'' not to mention alien landscapes, light 
saber duels, outer space dogfights and a race of rocket-powered 
chariots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost wish George Lucas could give a doll of these  
creatures to each blind person who goes to this movie, so they can 
touch it and tell what these things look like,'' Mrs. Harris said. 
``That would make it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action sequences, designed to dazzle the eye, were equally  
puzzling for the team to transcribe without interrupting the story, 
Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great battle in space begins as hundreds of ships attack  
with a great flash of multicolored laser fire,'' he read from the 
team's newly finished draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile on the grassy plains below ...the front of the tanks  
begin to open, revealing large mechanical arms holding hundreds of 
droids in their clutches like robotic sardines. The arms begin to 
lower the droids onto the grassy ground like bowling pins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that those words must be crammed in the brief  
spaces between dialogue and the deafening sounds of laser blasts 
and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	The floppy-limbed Jar Jar Binks, the Jedis' affable amphibious  
sidekick, proved much more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a ... well, he has a horse-like head. He's sort of a  
horse-headed fish ... well, more of a lizard, really ...'' Mrs. 
Harris said, trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to complete the project soon and release it  
while the movie is still in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was developed so blind people wouldn't have to just sit  
in the corner of the room reading braille,'' said Jim Gates, one of 
TheatreVision's chief writers. ``Now they can go to the movie with 
sighted friends and enjoy it together.''

<HEADLINE> Hunt Is On for Africanized Bees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive, mean and unpredictable, the  
killers entered through the Port of Jacksonville, hiding among the 
crates and containers arriving daily from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Mozer's job was to track them down and wipe them out.  
</P>
<P>
	His quarry: Killer bees.  
</P>
<P>
	Mozer found two swarms of the Africanized bees last month in  
bait hives at Blount Island in Jacksonville, marking the first time 
they had been captured in Florida. The bees have been found 18 
times on ships in Florida since 1983, but never in hives on land. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozer's mission is to make sure the bees don't take up residence  
in Florida, potentially destroying the state's beekeeping industry 
and possibly fatally stinging residents, tourists and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bees entered the United States earlier this decade,  
there have been six deaths, three in Texas and three in Arizona, 
according to the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hives Mozer found at Blount Island had about 10,000  
bees. The other only had a few of the insects. The bees were 
destroyed by freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA testing showed the bees were from the dangerous African  
strain that was imported into South America in an attempt to boost 
honey production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think they are established,'' Mozer said.  
</P>
<P>
	The swarms were located in the section of the port where  
container ships arrive from Puerto Rico. State agriculture 
officials suspect that all of the 150,000 wild bee colonies in 
Puerto Rico are Africanized. In 1997, the bees attacked and killed 
a 2-year-old boy who was with his family as they picked avocados. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozer said he was amazed he wasn't stung when he captured the  
killer bees in Jacksonville. ``They could have gotten me if they 
had wanted to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bees get their nickname from their aggressive behavior. The  
African honeybees attack in furious swarms with little provocation, 
pursue victims over much greater distances than the more common 
European bees and remain agitated for up to eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you anger European bees, you get five or six after you.  
With Africanized bees, you get several hundred after you,'' said 
Rodney Holloway, a bee expert with the Texas Agricultural Extension 
Service at Texas A&AMP;M University. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozer's find has added to his workload. Since his discovery, he  
has had to increase from 50 to 75 the number of bait hives he 
regularly monitors in six counties in northeast Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent sweltering afternoon, Mozer parked his aging white  
state Ford pickup beside the Coast Guard station in Mayport, about 
14 miles east of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	He waded through waist-deep grass to a wood pulp trap placed in  
the fork of a small tree. The 5-gallon trap contained scents such 
as lemon and gardenias known to attract the bees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bearded Mozer, a self-taught commercial beekeeper for  
several years, eases up to the trap, carefully watching for bees 
buzzing in and out. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the end of the trap, he quickly jumps back. Several  
field mice scurry away, but there are no bees. Mozer's caution 
comes from the reputation of the Africanized bees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are unpredictable. They are defensive,'' Mozer said.  
``People have lost their lives and livestock. They need to be 
respected. These guys will not go without a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state has some 500 bait hives used to detect killer bees,  
primarily in port areas, along Interstate 10 and on the 
Florida-Alabama border. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanized bees trace their killer genes to Africa, where a  
swarm of a specific strain known for its aggressiveness was 
captured and brought to Brazil by a scientist in the 1950s for 
experiments to increase honey production. Once there, the African 
bees escaped and began moving north while mating with native 
strains of bees and retaining their aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has dealt with wild swarms of Africanized bees since 1990,  
but they have not spread eastward past Houston. They have also 
spread as far west as California. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern about the Africanized bees has been more than the  
results from the Africanized bees,'' said Holloway. ``We really 
have not had much of a problem with the Africanized bees.''

<HEADLINE> Royals' King Unexpectedly Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- First baseman Jeff King, turning his  
back on about $3 million, unexpectedly retired today, suggesting 
his heart was no longer in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old King, bothered by a disc problem in his back  
since last fall, had already been paid about one-quarter of his $4 
million salary on the final year of a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his nagging back problem was not the major reason for  
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head is here, my heart is not,'' he said, fighting back  
tears. ``I played the game with integrity, played hard and played 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King had played in only 21 games this year, hitting .236 in 72  
at-bats with three home runs and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year veteran began the season with a .256 career average.  
He averaged 29 home runs and 112 RBIs in his first two seasons with 
Kansas City, in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	King hit .263 with 24 home runs and 93 RBIs last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The move could have positive financial repercussions for the  
cash-strapped Royals. They had been planning to trade pitcher Kevin 
Appier to unload his $4.8 million contract to get money to sign 
next month's high draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The first overall pick of the 1986 draft, King played seven  
seasons for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to turn the page, close the chapter and begin a new  
one. It comes down to integrity. The struggle I've had with it, I 
think it's affected the way I've played,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of his teammates sat in the back of the room as King  
made his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to walk away like this proves Jeff King is a man of  
integrity,'' said catcher Mike Sweeney, fighting back tears 
himself. ``It shows he's a man. He could have continued to play the 
next 4 1/2 months and taken a paycheck every two weeks and not had his 
heart in the game. But Jeff is a man of integrity. He shut it down 
when he thought the time was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said he had worked hard and ``hoped to get back to where a  
player needs to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just came to the point that as much as I hoped and  
wished, my heart was not totally committed,'' he said. ``It's tough 
to come out here every day and play at the level that my manager 
and my teammates think I need to play at.''

<HEADLINE> Vermont's Forests Are Growing Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLCHESTER, Vt. (AP) -- The forest has returned in Vermont.  
</P>
<P>
	A century ago, the forest covered only 20 percent to 30 percent  
of the Green Mountain State. The agricultural practices of the 19th 
century had denuded the countryside of trees and of wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as farming and forestry practices changed, the forests  
began to grow back. By 1948, about 63 percent of Vermont was 
covered by forests. 
</P>
<P>
	A half century later, a U.S. Forest Service study found that  
trees covered 78 percent of the state. The state Agency of Natural 
Resources reported in January that nearly 900,000 acres has grown 
into forest over the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in an era of healthy forests, Vermont's trees face  
threats that reach beyond those posed by additional subdivisions 
and parking lots. Pests and fungi can kill hemlock trees, butternut 
or other species. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the forests are expanding at twice the rate at which  
they are being cut, the forest is becoming less diverse. Maple is 
becoming predominant, taking the place of other trees that are 
being lost. And it's not just sugar maple. The less valuable red 
maple -- which some consider a weed -- is filling forests. 
</P>
<P>
	If insects like the Asian long-horn beetle, brought to the  
United States in freighters, escape their bridgeheads in New York 
and Chicago and make it to Vermont, the forests could change 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine losing maple. That's a wild thought,'' Chittenden  
County Forester Michael Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the weather can hurt the forests. Foresters are still  
calculating the damage to hundreds of thousands of trees from last 
year's ice storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor complicating the future of Vermont's forest is  
the changing pattern of land ownership. More land is now owned by 
more people in smaller parcels. That can make it harder to manage 
forests because there is less continuity of management practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pulp and paper companies have abandoned the state,'' said  
David Stevens, the director of Forests for the Department of 
Forests, Parks and Recreation. ``The effect of that is just looking 
in a crystal ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the state is utilizing its forest resource. In  
1948, for example, 723,100 cords of wood were cut in Vermont 
forests. By 1971 that figure had dropped to 378,200 cords. Yet in 
1996 the figure climbed to 1,237,700 cords. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the positive statistics, the state is flush with debates  
about how Vermont's forests should be managed over the next 50 
years and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	All agree the forests need to continue to be a source of jobs  
and natural resources and recreation. The debate is about how best 
to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan to protect 133,000 acres of forest land in the Northeast  
Kingdom, the farthest northern section of the state, has drawn both 
praise and criticism. Elsewhere, environmentalists are fighting 
efforts to log in the national forest in southern Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side of the debate are environmentalists, who argue  
rapacious logging and, in some places, unbridled development, will 
hurt the delicate balance that has built up over the past half 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Northup, executive director of Green Mountain Forest Watch,  
said the state had to protect public land from logging and 
development while private land should be managed for sustainable 
forestry so the wood products industry can continue to meet demand 
for wood and provide jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be seizing every opportunity we can to conserve  
forests and increase public forests and manage public forests to 
provide things that private land doesn't: wilderness and deep-woods 
wildlife habitat,'' Northup said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the debate, loggers and others say managing  
the tree stands as a renewable resource has helped create today's 
forests. They claim that regulation and conserving land actually 
makes it less productive because timber management makes forests 
grow faster, healthier and provides a better habitat for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diversity that we see that everybody is fighting over  
saving was created in the private free enterprise arena,'' said 
Roberta Borland, executive director of the Vermont Forest Products 
Association, which represents loggers and others involved in using 
the forest as a renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught between both extremes are state officials. They must  
balance the needs of loggers, conservationists, snowmobilers, 
skiers and leaf peepers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our role here is to try to listen to what people are trying to  
say and mediate a level of common ground and accept each other's 
use,'' said Jay Maciejowski, district forestry manager for 
Vermont's four southern counties. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what state officials hope is happening in Colchester in  
Chittenden County, near some of Vermont's most heavily populated 
suburbs, where state foresters are protecting a 664-acre stand of 
gnarly pitch pines on Camp Johnson, a National Guard base. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees aren't straight, their bark is rough and scaly, and  
they don't have much economic value. Thousands of acres of 
commercially worthless pitch pine already have been cut down to 
make way for houses, roads and businesses as commerce has expanded 
in the Champlain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colchester is the northern extreme of the species' range and  
these trees are genetically unique. Foresters are even sacrificing 
nearby oaks to ensure that the pines, which thrive in the sandy 
soil, survive and reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like going into a tremendous stand of sugar maples  
where you get the feeling you're in a special place,'' Snyder, the 
Chittenden County forester, said. ``It almost looks like houses 
would be an improvement here, but it is a unique area. It's made up 
of unique species with specialized strategies for survival.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers End Forum Era in Losing Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Lakers wrote an inglorious ending  
to the 32-year-old Forum, where the last of their six NBA 
championships came 11 long years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio completed a four-game sweep of Los Angeles today  
with a 118-107 victory in the Western Conference semifinals. Last 
year, the Lakers were swept in the conference finals by Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll leave all our sweep demons over here,'' forward Robert  
Horry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers will play two exhibition games in the Forum next  
season before moving to the new Staples Center in downtown Los 
Angeles. They'll share the arena with the Clippers and the NHL's 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's history,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``The Forum and (New York's  
Madison Square) Garden are it. I feel very honored I had the 
opportunity to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the sellout crowd of 17,505 began hitting the exits with  
five minutes left and the Lakers trailing by 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	They had cheered lustily when rookie coach Kurt Rambis inserted  
rookie Tyronn Lue six minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard listed at 6 feet, although he hardly looks it, lived  
up to his reputation as a fearless flyer by repeatedly driving to 
the basket against the much taller and heavier Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lue provided a temporary spark for the struggling Lakers, but  
they couldn't capitalize against 7-footers Tim Duncan and David 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of rusty, but it was good to get an opportunity,''  
said Lue, who had 12 points, six assists and four turnovers in 29 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lue's driving layup with 25 seconds remaining was the final  
basket scored in the Forum's regular season history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty has a proven career. He's a young, talented player,'' said  
veteran guard Derek Harper, who was passed over Sunday in favor of 
Lue. ``He's shown he can produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Rice thought he could, too. But the sharpshooter who  
arrived via a February trade with Charlotte was just 4-of-10 
shooting for 11 points despite playing all but three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to go out there time after time and to be  
forgotten,'' he said. ``It boiled down to teamwork. A lot of times 
there wasn't a lot of teamwork out there. We weren't together out 
there on either end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice had complained in the season's waning weeks about being  
left out of the offense. The player whose shooting relies on 
teammates setting screens often found himself buried on the 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to think about a lot of things this summer,'' he said  
of his future with the Lakers. ``Right now, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis faces an uncertain future. He stepped up from assistant  
to head coach after Del Harris was fired the same February day that 
Dennis Rodman temporarily became a Laker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's done a terrific job under the most difficult  
circumstances,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said. 
``He was thrown into a situation that was the most difficult I've 
ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers finished with a 31-20 record. They beat Houston 3-1  
in a first-round series, but were undone by late miscues in each of 
the games against the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we didn't win a lot of games. We did,'' West  
said. ``We don't have a terrible team, we have a talented team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicholson, the Lakers' No. 1 fan, admitted feeling  
nostalgic at the thought of attending the final NBA non-exhibition 
game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfect basketball arena,'' he said. ``There's very few  
of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame baseball player Frank Robinson is ready to leave  
the circular building with its orange and yellow seats behind. He's 
been a regular since the Forum opened in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has had its day,'' he said. ``Maybe the new building has  
got some championships in it. This one doesn't have any more.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Stock Market Guessing / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For some stock investors, the summer months may  
get a little sticky as Wall Street tries to anticipate the Federal 
Reserve's next move on the interest-rate front. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers gave an unclear picture at last week's Federal  
Open Market Committee meeting: They decided against raising rates 
for now, but adopted a ``bias'' in favor of hiking them up if 
inflation emerges. 
</P>
<P>
	Some signs already have been revealed. The government recently  
reported that consumer prices as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index rose 0.7 percent in April, the biggest jump in about nine 
years. The Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.5 percent 
that same month. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation rate now sits at 3.3 percent, compared to a 1.6  
percent rate for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market watchers, though, aren't sure the latest inflation  
data are enough to sway the Fed's monetary policy toward tightening 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed doesn't tend to make policy changes on the basis of  
one number, so even if it is unhappy with the April CPI, it is 
probably too cautious to do anything about it,'' said analysts for 
HSBC Holdings PLC in a recent investor update. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreover, the Fed has a much more global perspective ... . It  
recognizes that even a hint of higher rates would have a global 
impact and could throw global markets into a tailspin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP;  
Sons Inc. in St. Louis, agreed: ``I think the April figures are an 
anomaly -- they came from higher costs for apparel, tobacco and 
housing, and they won't continue to rise. If the inflation figures 
for May come in and show some core rate of inflation, ... then the 
Fed will increase (rates).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman also noted that since 1996, there have been 24 FOMC  
meetings, and at 14 of those meetings there was a bias toward 
raising rates. Yet only once did the Fed actually raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Two FOMC meetings are planned for the summer -- June 29-30 and  
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Fed does take any action, market analysts say, it likely  
will be during the later of the two gatherings and it probably will 
be only a small increase in short-term rates. Higher rates will 
help stem inflation by raising borrowing costs, which can 
ultimately hurt corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a good economy. The Fed is going to be vigilant''  
against inflation, said Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	``One increase in rates won't stop the bull market,'' added  
Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the stock market remains edgy about any change. Stock  
prices declined prior to and on the day of the May 18 FOMC meeting 
-- something that happens frequently when policy-makers meet. The 
Friday before the meeting, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 
nearly 200 points. Though stocks have since recovered, trading 
volume has been lighter than usual, reflecting general nervousness 
about the Fed's future actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market hates uncertainty more than anything else,'' said  
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	He says Fed policy and inflation aren't the only uncertainties  
investors have to deal with right now. Many worry that the market 
is overheated and could be in for a correction this summer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is extremely overvalued ... about 31 percent,''  
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan 
Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	To correct the situation, Moore says, the market would need to  
have at least one of three factors in place: higher corporate 
earnings, lower interest rates and lower stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is known is that they (Fed policy-makers) have a  
tightening bias and they're not going to lower rates any further,'' 
Moore said. ``The markets are going to have a rough time just 
because interest rates are not going down -- whether they go up or 
not.''

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos scored in regulation and  
in the shootout, and goalkeeper David Kramer stopped three of four 
shots in the tiebreaker as the San Jose Clash beat the Dallas Burn 
2-1 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clash improved to 6-0 in tiebreakers this season, while the  
Burn dropped to 1-5 in shootouts. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose took an early lead with a goal by Cerritos in the 10th  
minute. Wade Barrett set up the strike, taking the ball down the 
left flank with a pass from Jeff Baicher and sending a cross to 
Cerritos for a wide-open header at the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clash was unable to hold the lead, surrending a goal to  
Jason Kreis in the 81st minute to send the game into San Jose's 
sixth shootout in 10 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis scored with assists from John Jairo Trellez and Leonel  
Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerritos, Jamie Clark and Dario Brose each scored in the  
shootout for San Jose. Mark Santel converted for Dallas, but Kramer 
stopped attempts by Trellez, Alvarez and Richard Farrer.

<HEADLINE>  Indians Catch a Big Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Talk about catching a break. The Indians sure  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	When Omar Vizquel hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth  
inning today it not only beat the Detroit Tigers 7-4, it saved 
Jolbert Cabrera from having to make his major league catching 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the happiest guy in the ballpark,'' Cabrera said. ``I  
was probably happier than Omar was. I would have had to catch 
(Paul) Shuey. Thank God that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera, a reserve infielder, was nearly forced to go behind the  
plate when Indians manager Mike Hargrove used Jim Thome in the 
ninth inning as a pinch-hitter for catcher Einar Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, currently the Indians' starting catcher with Sandy Alomar  
on the disabled list, had entered the game in the eighth inning 
after Sunday's starting catcher, Chris Turner, had been replaced by 
a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	When Thome walked in the ninth inning, Cabrera, who hadn't  
caught since Little League, was busy trying on shin guards in 
anticipation of entering the game when Hargrove sent him in to 
pinch-run. He had trouble getting them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to get his shin guards on when I told him to go  
in and pinch-run,'' Hargrove said. ``And I think it took him about 
15 minutes to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Travis Fryman had just gotten back to the bench  
after scoring a run to bring the Indians within 4-3, when he 
realized the Indians were in deep trouble if the game went to extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Jolbert trying on the gear and I thought, `uh oh,''' he  
said. ``The guy is a sprinter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Fryman, who caught briefly in high school, volunteered to put  
on the shin guards, chest protector and mask, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked around and saw our options,'' he said. ``You've got a  
6-foot-7 guy at first (Richie Sexson) and that's not going to work. 
Robbie (Alomar) is too good and too valuable. Omar? That's out of 
the question. And Wil (Cordero) has a bruised heel. I figured third 
base isn't that far off from catching. I might as well go back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman said Hargrove then asked him if he had any catching  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I liked Johnny Bench as a kid, that's about it,''  
Fryman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he knew he was taking a big gamble by  
pinch-hitting for Diaz, and realized the Indians spared themselves 
some possible embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a certain way you dread coming to that because you don't  
want to watch that debacle that could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While reporters were listening to Vizquel's account of his first  
career game-winning homer, Cabrera, once a member of Colombia's 
national track team, leaned in to offer thanks for not having to 
chase one of Shuey's 95 mph split-finger fastballs to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you, Omar,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cherokee Nation To Elect New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) -- The Cherokee Nation -- the nation's  
second-largest tribe -- will hold a runoff election next month to 
choose a chief after no candidate seized a majority in voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Incumbent chief Joe Byrd led nine candidates in Saturday  
balloting with 32 percent -- or 4,140 votes. Challenger Chad Smith 
received 19 percent, or 2,535 votes, and candidate Pat Ragsdale 
placed third with 16 percent, or 2,162 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd and Smith will face each other in a June 24 runoff, when a  
deputy chief will also be selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic voting devices were used for the first time Saturday  
by the Cherokee Nation, which has 200,000 members. Half of its 
26,000 registered voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Saturday's outcome was unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the Cherokee tradition to vote for the incumbent,''  
he said. ``But in other chief races, we didn't have to go through a 
runoff. This is a very big victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elections are considered pivotal in ending turmoil that has  
halted tribal government. Many candidates have been key figures in 
a three-year feud. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Ragsdale was tribal marshal until Byrd fired him  
in 1997 for serving a search warrant on Cherokee administrative 
offices, then alleging impropriety. And Smith, a lawyer, was 
arrested when he tried to stop Byrd's administration from closing 
the tribe's courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Interior Secretary attempted to negotiate a truce, but  
the conflicts continued with millions of federal dollars 
unaccounted for and boycotts of tribal meetings.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Falls Short of Record / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Proving that not even the Force could conquer  
all the ``Star Wars'' hype, ``The Phantom Menace'' grossed $61.8 
million its opening weekend, falling far short of the record $72.1 
million debut of ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' estimates 
showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its release Wednesday, the ``Star Wars'' prequel amassed  
$102.8 million, a spectacular number for any other film, but short 
of some expectations for this eagerly awaited space adventure. 
Several movie analysts had predicted a five-day gross of $120 
million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while it settled for No. 2 all-time record for a  
Friday-to-Sunday opening weekend, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace'' shattered a number of other records. It had the 
highest single-day and opening-day grosses ($28.5 million on 
Wednesday) and became the fastest movie to reach $100 million (five 
days, versus six for ``Lost World.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' set these marks, which are not adjusted  
for inflation, even though it didn't open on a holiday weekend, as 
event pictures usually do. ``Lost World,'' for instance, set the 
three-day opening weekend record over the Memorial Day holiday in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th Century Fox, said the  
strategy was to release ``The Phantom Menace'' in mid-week to first 
accommodate the hardcore fans -- who would watch it any time, 
anywhere -- and then make room for regular movie-goers to see it 
over the weekend or the following Memorial Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we wanted to set the record we would have released the  
picture next week,'' said Sherak, whose studio is releasing the 
film for creator George Lucas. ``This wasn't about the records. 
This picture would have set any early record it wanted to set. It 
was never planned like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherak added that some fans may also have been scared away by  
reports of long lines and unavailability of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exactly what we were worried about,'' he said. ``Our  
concern is that people think they can't get in, but they can. There 
are tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After opening with the record-breaking $28.5 million Wednesday,  
``The Phantom Menace'' dropped to $12.3 million Thursday, recovered 
a little to $18.4 million Friday, then packed in audiences Saturday 
with $24.2 million, among the biggest single-day grosses in 
history. Sunday's gross was estimated at $19.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three-day movie weekend, the film had a stunning  
per-location average of $20,808, an amount usually only recorded by 
popular art house films playing in a couple of theaters. ``The 
Phantom Menace'' is in 2,970 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line was that expectations were probably so high for  
this movie, suggested Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., that ``The Phantom Menace'' could 
never have met all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are terrific numbers,'' he said. ``But the bar has been  
raised. At one time these numbers would be considered just 
unbelievable or not even imaginable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, ``The Phantom Menace'' wiped out the box office  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other big film opening last weekend, ``The Love  
Letter,'' struggled to find an audience, despite being released as 
a romantic alternative. It debuted with $2.6 million for fifth 
place over the Friday to Sunday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest movie against ``The Phantom Menace'' was ``The  
Mummy,'' dropping 47 percent in its third week to $13.1 million for 
the weekend -- or about what ``Phantom'' did on its worst day. 
``Entrapment'' was third with $5.8 million and ``The Matrix'' 
fourth with $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakespeare took a dive as ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''  
plummeted 42 percent in its second week to $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never Been Kissed'' was seventh with $1.55 million, ``Black  
Mask'' and ``Life'' were tied for eighth with $1.5 million each, 
and ``Election'' and ``Trippin''' were tied for 10th with $1.4 
million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., with final 
figures to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $61.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Mummy,'' $13.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Entrapment,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Matrix,'' $2.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Love Letter,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $1.55 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Black Mask,'' $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Life'' $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Election,'' $1.4 million.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Sweet Lady slipped through a narrow  
opening in the stretch and went on to a head victory the 
$100,000-added Honeymoon Handicap at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Gary Stevens, Sweet Lady stayed in third place along  
the rail most of the race, then found just enough room to move 
inside leader Tout Charmant. Aviate was third, another four lengths 
back in the field of seven 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish-bred Sweet Lady, carrying 116 pounds, was timed in 1:48.05  
for 1 1/8 miles on the turf and the favorite paid $6.60, $3.60 and 
$2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Tout Charmant paid $4.80 and $3.20, while Aviate was $2.80 to

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offered 'Teaching Post' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMBLING, La. (AP) -- It seemed like a long shot, but Grambling  
University President Steve A. Favors figured he would try: a 
post-White House job at the school for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's commencement exercises at the school, Favors  
asked Clinton if he would consider taking a faculty post at 
Grambling after Clinton leaves the White House in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Favors said the historically black university could not match  
other college's salaries and financial benefits. But Favors did 
come up with a package of perks, or fringe benefits, for Clinton to 
mull over. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you accept this invitation, I promise that we will provide  
you with all the gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish ... collard greens, 
sweet potato pie and ham that you can eat, in a very hospitable 
environment,'' Favors said. ``We'll even allow you unlimited 
opportunities to play the saxophone with the world-renowned 
Grambling State University marching band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If time commitments were at issue, Favors said, Grambling would  
be flexible. ``Even if you can only do it for a week or two, we 
would be proud to have you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was hooked on the offer of food -- until Favors  
said he was only joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting into this,'' Clinton said. ``I've got a good  
pension, I can work pretty cheap!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favors was not the only one thinking about future jobs. Someone  
among the 477 graduates yelled out during Clinton's speech, ``I 
need a job!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton replied, ``Well, you'll be able to get one now.''

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Jolley scored his first goal of  
the season in the game's third minute as the Los Angeles Galaxy 
beat the New England Revolution 1-0 today in front of an announced 
crowd of 7,581 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman recorded his MLS-leading  
fifth shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's only goal came when Greg Vanney's right corner kick  
swerved above the goal mouth and Jolley headed the ball past New 
England goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga, who barely moved on the 
fast-developing play. 
</P>
<P>

Conference. The Revolution (3-6) lost for the third time in four

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Dudley Playing Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He had two vicious slam dunks, heard the fans  
chant his name and finished with a boxscore line that made Patrick 
Ewing's pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was Chris Dudley's brightest day as a Knick.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've had better games in the regular season, but not  
in the playoffs,'' Dudley said after scoring 14 points, grabbing 12 
rebounds -- six on each end -- and blocking two shots in New York's 
90-77 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's performance was the biggest eye-opener in a victory so  
lopsided that Ewing, hobbled by Achilles' tendinitis and sore 
knees, was able to sit out the entire fourth quarter to save some 
strength for Game 4 Monday night and a possible series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest is big, especially for Patrick,'' Dudley said. ``We  
want to get Patrick healthy. We don't want to have to back down 
there to Atlanta, travel down there, extend the series and allow 
Indiana to have that rest while we're still in a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It became clear that a different Dudley was on the court during  
the first half when he followed a missed shot with an emphatic 
putback slam that electrified the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley had another shot almost exactly like it later in the game  
to contribute to a 6-for-7 shooting performance. When he fouled out 
late in the fourth quarter, the ovation was easily the loudest he 
had ever received at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans gave me that ovation, it was real nice,'' he said.  
``It was great to have that and it's great to be up 3-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, meanwhile, had a shooting percentage that loosely  
resembled something Dudley could have done from the free throw 
line: 2-for-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duds played a much better game than I did,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's playing time has been unpredictable during the  
playoffs. He sat out Games 4 and 5 of the first-round series 
against Miami, and coach Jeff Van Gundy lauded him for sacrificing 
minutes for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In this game, however, his 23 minutes were on par with the  
playing time the other eight Knicks regulars received, and his 12 
rebounds were more than anyone on either team had with the 
exception of Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Mutombo is they rely on him defensively to  
block shots. I tried to follow in behind him when he went to block 
shots,'' Dudley said, ``and in the second half I was able to beat 
him to the boards.''

	``The fans gave me that ovation, it was real nice,'' he said.  
``It was great to have that and it's great to be up 3-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, meanwhile, had a shooting percentage that loosely  
resembled something Dudley could have done from the free throw 
line: 2-for-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duds played a much better game than I did,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's playing time has been unpredictable during the  
playoffs. He sat out Games 4 and 5 of the first-round series 
against Miami, and coach Jeff Van Gundy lauded him for sacrificing 
minutes for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In this game, however, his 23 minutes were on par with the  
playing time the other eight Knicks regulars received, and his 12 
rebounds were more than anyone on either team had with the 
exception of Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Mutombo is they rely on him defensively to  
block shots. I tried to follow in behind him when he went to block 
shots,'' Dudley said, ``and in the second half I was able to beat 
him to the boards.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Open Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks started the week lower Monday  
following Friday's drop on Wall Street. The dollar was higher 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 31.83  
points, or 0.20 percent, to 16,281.15 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Thursday, the average closed up 92.99 points, or 0.57 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.18 yen in early trading, up 0.42 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its level of 124.01 yen late 
Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices declined on futures-led  
profit-taking following a drop in New York, where the Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 13.86 points to 10,852.88 on Friday, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in major Japanese banks were mixed after eight commercial  
banks on Friday announced grim earnings results for the fiscal year 
ended March 31, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was likely to remain in a tight range this week as  
participants curtail their activities in order to monitor the flood 
of corporate earnings results, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 0.30 points, or 0.02 percent, to 
1,309.37. The TOPIX closed up 7.80 points, or 0.60 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was higher on scattered buying  
from Japanese institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency markets showed no immediate reaction to a morning  
announcement that Japan's April trade surplus fell by a 
greater-than-expected 12.6 percent to 1.069 trillion yen ($8.62 
billion). 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.25 yen, up from  
131.17 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.3350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.3250 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.46 yen from 101.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Now Making Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- In the first seven weeks since J.  
Peterman was acquired by an Indianapolis-based clothing chain, J. 
Peterman contributed $259,000 to the new owner's bottom line, the 
company's president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could make money with Peterman in seven weeks. We stopped  
spending so much money. That's really what the only problem was 
with Peterman. They just spent too much money,'' Charlotte G. 
Fischer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer is chairwoman, president and chief executive officer of  
Paul Harris Stores Inc., which bought the Lexington clothing 
company at a bankruptcy auction in March. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal  
bankruptcy code Jan. 25, just one year into a store expansion plan. 
Its debt exceeded its assets by $14 million at the time of the 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harris, which operates 304 moderately priced women's  
clothing stores, paid $10 million for J. Peterman's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer, a 20-year retail veteran, is no stranger to running  
companies that have had financial difficulties. Paul Harris emerged 
from bankruptcy in 1992, but by 1994 was ailing again. Fischer took 
the helm in early 1995. Under Fischer, Paul Harris has posted sales 
records and paid down millions of dollars in debts. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost J. Peterman sales, Fischer said, she intends to widen  
the store's range of prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want to own a piece of Peterman. They want to  
buy the vintage sweatshirt or T-shirt, and they want to spend $25 
or $35. They don't necessarily want the pewter candlesticks for 
$3,000,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, in just a few weeks, the J. Peterman Co. Web site will be  
running again. And customers can again place orders at 
http://www.jpeterman.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said she sees there being at least 100 ``great''  
Peterman stores in major U.S. cities. But the growth will be 
gradual.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners May Buy Into Taiwan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- In a major step toward reform of the  
banking sector, Taiwan will allow foreigners to acquire up to a 50 
percent equity stake in local banks, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Times quoted Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen as saying  
foreigners will be given the same right as Taiwanese nationals to 
buy shares of banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes the planned move will encourage mergers or  
acquisitions to help speed up an overhaul of Taiwan's troubled 
banking system, he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Taiwanese authorities have encouraged mergers among  
the island's 47 commercial banks after a string of corporate 
failures led to a surge in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan does not have specific laws banning foreign ownership in  
local banks, but interested foreigners had been discouraged by the 
government's ambivalence about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chen was quoted saying foreigners are now allowed to acquire  
up to 50 percent equity shares in any listed company and their 
acquisitions of local banks will be granted on a case-by-case basis 
with special approval from the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese banks have faced keen competition since the island  
ended a ban on the establishment of new banks in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of lax loan requirements, the banks' average return  
on net worth dropped to 8 percent last year, compared with 20 
percent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratio of nonperforming loans held by banks to their total  
loan portfolios reached a record high of 5.17 percent as of the end 
of April. 
</P>
<P>
	To address the problem, the government announced banks' business  
tax will be cut from 5 percent to 2 percent beginning in July. 
Banks are supposed to use the tax break to help them fund bad loan 
write-offs over a four-year period.

<HEADLINE> Unser Family Racing Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Unser clan sticks together.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, struggling since he crashed his car in practice on  
Thursday, bumped his way into the Indianapolis 500 lineup today, 
and he had some special thanks for his two famous uncles, Al and 
Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means so much to have them there, to talk about things, to  
figure out what to do,'' said Johnny, who qualified at 221.197 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the guys hold up 221, and I was happy. On the third lap,  
I was just hoping the car would hold up one more lap and it did,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser's father, Jerry, was the older brother of Al and Bobby and  
was the first member of the family to race at Indianapolis. Jerry 
was killed at Indy in 1959; Al later won four Indy races; Bobby won 
three, and Al Jr. won two. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny's first race at Indianapolis was in 1996, and cousin  
Robby -- Bobby's son -- was a rookie last year and earned his second 
start in qualifications Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys worked some all-nighters putting the car back  
together after Thursday,'' Johnny said. ``We peaked at the right 
time, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully appreciate what Al Jr. went through when he didn't  
make the show here (in 1995). It can happen to anybody. You just 
never know,'' Johnny said. ``You have to have everything right and 
have to have a few things fall into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser's qualification run on Sunday bumped rookie Jaques Lazier,  
younger brother of 1996 winner Buddy Lazier. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SAFETY MEASURES: Leo Mehl, executive director of the Indy Racing  
League, will hold a news conference Monday to announce new safety 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL is expected to announce changes on the race cars,  
possibly including ``tethering'' of wheels to the chassis, to 
prevent injuries to spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, three fans were killed and eight injured when a  
wheel and other debris from a crash flew over a 15-foot catch fence 
into the crowd during an IRL race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 
Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a similar crash killed three spectators during a CART  
race in Michigan. CART last week announced it would follow the lead 
of Formula One by using tethers. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW PARTNER: Panther Racing decided Sunday not to replace  
injured rookie Dave Steele and instead worked a deal with the 
Blueprint-Immke team for co-sponsorship for already-qualified Tyce 
Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele injured his back and chest in a crash last Wednesday.  
Carlson, who qualified Saturday on the fifth row at 221.322 mph, 
will remain in his car No. 20 but will carry both the Panther and 
Blueprint sponsor decals. The car also will be repainted yellow for 
Panther's primary sponsor, Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to iron out all the details this morning,''  
Panther owner John Barnes said. ``We feel this will be a great 
partnership for both teams. We bring some additional strength and 
experience to the Blueprint-Immke team, and they bring us an 
exceptional car and driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll blend together some of the personnel ... and end up with  
a very competitive car to field next Sunday,'' Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson was 19th in his only previous start at Indianapolis in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG DROP: What should have been a comfortable qualifying run  
turned a bit shaky Sunday when Jack Miller suddenly slowed on his 
final lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who had to call off an attempt Saturday when his engine  
went sour, was above 222 mph on the second lap and just under 221 
on the third. The fourth lap dropped to 216.518, but his average of 
220.276 still was good enough to bump Stephan Gregoire from the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was perfect. I don't know what happened,'' Miller  
said. ``It shows if you lift just a little bit, it can kill your 
speed. We've had a good car all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is driving for Tri Star Motorsports, co-owned by teammate  
Tony Stewart and Larry Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he wasn't worried about qualifying after Saturday's  
engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept pretty good,'' he said. ``Larry and Tony are fantastic  
to work with. The only thing I was nervous about was the weather. 
You never know when the winds will pick up.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG CHEER: One of the biggest cheers from the speedway crowd on  
Sunday came when the public address announcer reported the Indiana 
Pacers beat the Philadelphia 76ers 89-86, completing a four-game 
second-round sweep to move on to the NBA Eastern Conference finals.

<HEADLINE>  Indy Field Set, Some Ready for Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Desperation was in the air Sunday at the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for some, and unhappily for others, so was rain.  
</P>
<P>
	The drizzle that ended the second of two days of time trials for  
the May 30 Indianapolis 500 four hours short, held off just long 
enough for Robbie Buhl to bump his way into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	His run was completed one minute before rain shut the 2 1/2-mile  
oval. With several other drivers still hoping to take a crack at 
the lineup, track officials waited 2 1/2 hours before making the end 
of qualifying official. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhl, a 35-year-old three-time Indy starter, had found nothing  
but frustration here this week until A.J. Foyt came to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he crashed while getting up to speed on a warmup  
lap for a qualifying attempt in a car fielded by underfinanced 
Sinden Racing Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Already struggling with a limited number of motors, Buhl tried  
to nurse the team's second car into the lineup shortly after 
qualifying resumed on Sunday, but blew his last engine. 
</P>
<P>
	With his chance to make the race seemingly gone, Buhl heard  
team-owner and four-time Indy winner Foyt, who already had Billy 
Boat in the first three-car row and Kenny Brack in the third row, 
might be able to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to see A.J. and it was a pretty casual conversation,''  
Buhl said. ``He was kind enough to say, `Hey, I've got two cars. 
See which ones works best for you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two teams pulled together and made a couple of calls that  
were right. I think we timed it just right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the air heavy and moist and rain obviously on the way, a  
nervous Buhl drove Foyt's Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara onto 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-lap, 10-mile average of 220.115 mph was just good  
enough to make Mike Groff the last of five drivers bumped out of 
the 33-car lineup on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens to a lot of people,'' said Groff, who had been in  
the race each of the last three years and five times overall. ``It 
was just difficult and we didn't make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhl was very happy to make the race, but he was still feeling  
frustration from what had happened before he stepped into Foyt's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest emotion I feel is that I'm still angry at myself  
for what I did yesterday,'' he said. ``The car was good and I felt 
comfortable in it. I should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the guys were up until 5 in the morning putting a motor  
in the backup car, just in case. I don't think you can understand 
how bad you feel as a driver when you do what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the field filled on Saturday, the first day of time trials,  
Sunday was dedicated to bumping the slower cars out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indy, it's the 33 fastest cars that start the race, meaning  
that non-qualified cars can take a run at knocking the slowest 
qualifiers out of the field until the 6 p.m. EST finish -- or until 
rain halts the action. 
</P>
<P>
	With wet weather in the forecast, there was a flurry of activity  
when qualifying resumed at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Boesel immediately drove onto the 2 1/2-mile oval and bumped  
out Lyn St. James, the only woman entered in the 83rd 500-mile race 
and the slowest first-round qualifier at 218.970 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating she would be bumped, St. James was practicing in  
her backup car on Sunday morning when her engine blew and she 
crashed, ending her shot at a seventh Indy start. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel, a 10-time Indy starter, easily blew St. James' speed  
away, turning in a four-lap, 10-mile average of 220.100. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, cousin of first-day qualifier Robby Unser,  
qualified for his fourth Indy start. He bumped out rookie Jaques 
Lazier, younger brother of 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, with a 
speed of 221.197. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buhl blew his engine, there was a long period of open  
practice before Jack Miller got into the field by bumping out 
Stephan Gregoire at 220.276. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the scene for what turned out to be the dramatic finish  
of the day's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Groff, who waved off two of his car's allowable three attempts  
on Saturday, made a desperation run and bumped Scott Harrington 
with a speed of 220.066. But that was just fast enough to put him 
``on the bubble'' as the slowest qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Michner, taking over the seat of John Paul Jr., who was  
injured in a crash during practice on Friday, aborted his second 
attempt after two laps just over 218. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, track observers were reporting light sprinkles.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when Buhl went out, getting the job done despite an  
uncomfortable seat that pushed him high in the open cockpit and had 
his helmet buffeting around throughout the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `This isn't perfect, but we don't have time to mess  
around.' I mean, this is the Indy 500,'' Buhl said. ``We just went 
out and ran what we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by two-time winner Arie Luyendyk's pole-winning speed of  
225.179 mph on Saturday, the final field averaged 221.558 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other former winners in the lineup are defending  
champion Eddie Cheever, who will start 16th, and Lazier, who is 
22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hollansworth Jr., who qualified 12th, is the fastest of  
four rookies. The other first-year drivers in the field are Jeret 
Schroeder, Robby McGehee and Wim Eyckmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the end of qualifications and next Sunday's race, the  
only time the drivers can get back on the track is Thursday during 
the traditional two-hour ``Carburetion Day'' practice.

Lazier, younger brother of 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, with a 
speed of 221.197. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buhl blew his engine, there was a long period of open  
practice before Jack Miller got into the field by bumping out 
Stephan Gregoire at 220.276. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the scene for what turned out to be the dramatic finish  
of the day's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Groff, who waved off two of his car's allowable three attempts  
on Saturday, made a desperation run and bumped Scott Harrington 
with a speed of 220.066. But that was just fast enough to put him 
``on the bubble'' as the slowest qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Michner, taking over the seat of John Paul Jr., who was  
injured in a crash during practice on Friday, aborted his second 
attempt after two laps just over 218. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, track observers were reporting light sprinkles.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when Buhl went out, getting the job done despite an  
uncomfortable seat that pushed him high in the open cockpit and had 
his helmet buffeting around throughout the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `This isn't perfect, but we don't have time to mess  
around.' I mean, this is the Indy 500,'' Buhl said. ``We just went 
out and ran what we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by two-time winner Arie Luyendyk's pole-winning speed of  
225.179 mph on Saturday, the final field averaged 221.558 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other former winners in the lineup are defending  
champion Eddie Cheever, who will start 16th, and Lazier, who is 
22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hollansworth Jr., who qualified 12th, is the fastest of  
four rookies. The other first-year drivers in the field are Jeret 
Schroeder, Robby McGehee and Wim Eyckmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the end of qualifications and next Sunday's race, the  
only time the drivers can get back on the track is Thursday during 
the traditional two-hour ``Carburetion Day'' practice.

 *James Broughton    	
</P>
<P>
	PORT TOWNSEND, Wash. (AP) -- James Broughton, an avant-garde  
filmmaker and poet often regarded as the father of West Coast 
independent cinema, died May 17 of heart failure. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton considered himself ``first and foremost a poet'' and  
was prominent in San Francisco's art community for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote more than 20 books of verse, including ``True and False  
Unicorn'' -- often considered his strongest and most important long 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
	But his avant garde films such as ``Dreamwood,'' ``The Pleasure  
Garden'' and ``The Golden Positions'' received more attention, 
earning him an American Film Institute lifetime achievement award 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	One, ``The Bed,'' focused on an ornate bed in a meadow where  
life's most significant moments -- birth, sex and death -- took 
place. Broughton played a role in the film, along with other San 
Francisco artists and writers, all nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton began making films in the mid-1940s and also wrote  
plays for San Francisco's Playhouse Repertory Theater in the late 
1950s and 1960s.

and Peabody awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked with such figures as Louis Leakey, Jane Goodall and  
Jacques Cousteau on the specials. 
</P>
<P>
	During his years with NBC from 1946 to 1953 he was involved with  
the first broadcasts of national political conventions and had 
coached four presidents, Harry S . Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
Lyndon Baines Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, on the use of

	Clinton Backs Strikes in Editorial  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia is  
working and will help establish a Europe that is peaceful, 
undivided and free, President Clinton said in an opinion piece in 
today's New York Times. Clinton has been criticized by some in 
Congress for limiting the action in the region to air strikes and 
for not making plans for a ground attack. Clinton said he does not 
rule out other military options but said the current strategy is 
working and will succeed in restoring the people of Kosovo to their 
homes. The NATO action in the region is necessary because inaction 
would have posed a risk of a wider war, Clinton said.

	Refugees Discuss 'Human Shields'  
</P>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- A refugee today told how he and 50 other  
Kosovo Albanians were handcuffed together and forced to march in 
front of Yugoslav troops and vehicles to protect against NATO 
attacks. As the prisoners approached a guerrilla position, the 
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels recognized the hostages as fellow 
Albanians and retreated instead of fighting, according to Zehnullah 
Mangjolli. NATO has made repeated allegations of civilians being 
used as shields by the Serbs, but witnesses have been hard to come 
by. Yugoslavia says the allegations are ``crazy.''

	400 Die in Pakistan Cyclone  
</P>
<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Villagers and troops recovered at least  
400 bodies -- some suspended in trees or buried in mud -- and rescued 
thousands of survivors after a cyclone tore through hundreds of 
villages in southern Pakistan, witnesses and officials said today. 
Rescue workers retrieved the bodies as flood waters receded, 
leaving devastated villages and thousands of stranded people. 
Hundreds were missing and feared drowned. The cyclone with winds of 
170 mph smashed into the Arabian Sea coast Thursday, causing floods 
that submerged thousands of villages.

	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is  
convening an Arab summit to coordinate policy on peace with Israel 
now that moderate Ehud Barak has ousted his hard-line predecessor 
in elections, an aide said today. The aide said Arafat hoped to 
present a united Arab front in negotiations with Israel. Israeli 
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon were stalled during the three 
years Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in power, and Netanyahu 
froze talks with the Palestinians in December.

Yugoslavia was honored today with a parade through East Los 
Angeles. Hundreds of admirers, many waving miniature American flags 
and clutching red, white and blue balloons, crammed the sidewalks 
to catch a glimpse of Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez. Ramirez, Staff 
Sgt. Christopher Stone of Smiths Creek, Mich., and Spc. Steven 
Gonzales of Huntsville, Texas, were part of a U.N. peacekeeping

<HEADLINE> Railroads Ready To Carve Up Conrail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Donald Nelson and his colleagues at three  
Eastern rail carriers are about to embark on the most complex 
restructuring in modern railroading. 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers, regulators and other railroads will be watching  
closely as the carriers attempt to redraw the rail map while 
avoiding the service foul-up that followed the 1996 merger of Union 
Pacific with Southern Pacific in the West and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have spent two years  
dotting the i's and crossing the t's in preparation for carving up 
Philadelphia-based Conrail Inc. on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Major mishaps could delay letters and packages, impede commuter  
trains and boost shipping costs for farm products and consumer 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complicated transaction, and it's foolish to say  
Murphy's Law won't play a role,'' Nelson, senior vice president of 
operations at Conrail, said as crews continued their pre-split 
routines of sorting boxcars outside. ``We have to be prepared to 
react to rapidly changing events, day by day, hour by hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past mergers have generally involved two or more companies  
combining operations. In the restructuring of the railroads, 
Conrail will be carved into three parts, with two pieces going to 
CSX and Norfolk Southern and the third shared by both. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that will take place while trains continue to run,  
leaving little room for error as the companies figure out which 
employees go to which railroad and which shipments go on which 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.3 billion transaction will give CSX and Norfolk  
Southern, primarily Southeastern railroads, access to the lucrative 
Northeast market, where Conrail has enjoyed a monopoly since it was 
created by Congress in 1976 out of six bankrupt railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Virginia-based carriers will control virtually all rail  
traffic east of the Mississippi River, with tracks stretching 
nearly 45,000 miles from Montreal to Miami and from Boston to 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Many shippers have spent the past year recovering from the Union  
Pacific meltdown, which forced some companies to ship goods more 
expensively on trucks and airplanes and prompted others to slow 
down production or furlough employees. By some estimates, the 
gridlock cost the U.S. economy at least $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX and Norfolk Southern have postponed the Conrail split by  
nine months -- from Sept. 1 to March 1 and ultimately to June 1 -- to 
make sure they are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, they have also delayed reaping the savings and  
growth benefits from the transaction, all the while spending $1 
million a day each in interest payments on the money borrowed to 
buy Conrail. Earnings have dropped, yet executives remain patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Western merger, there was some pretty significant  
economic impact they suffered as a result of not doing it right,'' 
said Gerry Gates, CSX vice president for Conrail field operations. 
``Our hope is we would eliminate those expenditures later and 
sacrifice up front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific has said its meltdown in 1997 and 1998 was not  
merger related but acknowledges that merger-related labor and 
computer issues made the problems worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers and industry analysts, however, directly blame the  
company's attempt to quickly absorb Southern Pacific routes and 
make wholesale changes in personnel and operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both CSX and Norfolk Southern decided early on not to proceed  
without first reaching labor transition agreements with all of 
their unions and fully testing their computer systems. Those tasks 
are in the final stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies brought thousands of employees into the planning  
and established teams to handle everything from splitting up 
Conrail's fleet of boxcars and locomotives to making sure employees 
joining the new railroads get paid on time. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the three railroads had about 1,000 employees  
working on the sole challenge of making their computers talk with 
one another after the split. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have spent more than $1 billion combined on new  
tracks, connections and other capacity improvements and have met 
regularly with Union Pacific to learn from its mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroads have a large stake in making sure the split goes  
smoothly. Failure could add to pressure in Congress to give 
regulators more powers, something the railroads believe would 
hinder their ability to make investments and grow. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, a successful implementation would boost  
shippers' confidence and allow both companies to meet their goals 
of luring a greater share of the orange juice, paper towels, auto 
parts and other goods that now move by truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Conrail transaction will be pivotal in determining the  
future course of the industry,'' said David Goode, chairman, 
president and chief executive of Norfolk Southern. ``If we do it 
well ... then we have the basis for the network of the next 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expect to face some startup problems but nothing  
beyond what railroads normally encounter during weather emergencies 
and other unusual conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the railroads do not know ahead of time exactly which  
carrier will get what business, both have prepared to handle more 
traffic than usual, spending millions of dollars on new equipment 
and extra work crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to work like a football game,'' said Joe  
Garofolo, transportation superintendent for Conrail's northern New 
Jersey region. ``The quarterback calls a play, and if the defense 
changes, the team has to be able to change. Managers have to be 
flexible and go to Plan B.''

	Panel Backs Embryo Research Funds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential ethics panel will recommend the  
federal government pay for some research on human embryos, The 
Washington Post reported today. The National Bioethics Advisory 
Commission cites recent evidence that some human embryo cells have 
the potential to grow into replacement tissues to treat a wide 
variety of chronic diseases, the paper said. It concluded that it 
is essentially unfair to millions of patients for Congress to 
continue a 4-year-old funding ban on human embryo research.

Yugoslavia, including two residential areas near Sabac, 40 miles 
west of Belgrade, the private Beta news agency said. No details 
were immediately available. And in a sign of NATO plans to boost

the past several weeks, the men said after crossing into Albania 
yesterday. The refugees, many of them gaunt, said they had been 
detained at Smrekovnice prison near the northern Kosovo town of 
Kosovska-Mitrovica after being taken from refugee columns that had 
been heading to the Albanian border two to four weeks ago. ``When 
the Serbs grabbed me, they said I was a terrorist,'' said Sulejman

less thanks to an experiment aimed at making the monument settle 
better into the ground, experts said yesterday. In February, 
workers started removing soil from under the tower's base. Going

St. Louis Cardinals 10-7 last night. McGwire hit a solo homer in 
the first inning and a two-run shot in the eighth. That one cleared 
the pavilion in left-center field, making him only the third player 
to hit a ball completely out of Dodger Stadium in the ballpark's 
38-year history. The others were Willie Stargell (twice) and Mike 
Piazza.

<HEADLINE> Relative of Freud Writes Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the late 1960s, when Esther Freud was a  
child, her mother took her and her sister Bella to Marrakesh in 
search of excitement and enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
	But those Moroccan adventures sometimes turned into  
misadventures, which a grown-up Freud turned into a 
semiautobiographical novel, ``Hideous Kinky.'' It has been adapted 
into the current art-house movie starring Kate Winslet in her first 
role since ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud, the great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, fondly recalls  
her childhood journey, but looking back as an adult she realizes 
there was a ``darker side to it -- or at least I decided that there 
was when I was writing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By that, she means she infused the book with some drama.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I wanted to make a good book,'' she said in an  
interview. ``And I also thought, 'OK, so this woman (her mother) is 
very young, she has very little money, she's in a country that has 
a very sinister side to it ... there must have been times when they 
all felt in danger.' Personally, I don't actually have that many 
memories of feeling like that. I was of that age where if my mother 
was around, it was just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why it surprised her -- and hurt her mother's feelings --  
when reviews of her 1992 debut novel embraced the book and all but 
accused her mother of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite taken aback at how virulent (and) anti-mother the  
reviewers were,'' says Freud, whose two subsequent novels 
(``Peerless Flats'' and ``Summer at Gasglow'') also received 
positive notices. ``There was a lot of outrage against this 
`feckless, irresponsible mother'; there was no `where was the 
father?' Nothing. No mention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In real life, the father, who never married her mother, is noted  
British painter Lucian Freud. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's sense of aspiration and accomplishment extends well  
into Freud's generation, too: Her older sister is a fashion 
designer, two half-sisters are novelists, and a cousin is a 
talk-show host in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London in 1963, Freud personally doesn't feel the weight  
of an eye-catching name. Certainly, lots of people have goals 
unmotivated by redoubtable ancestry or some notion of noblesse 
oblige, she says, adding: ``I used to almost look on in amazement 
at people who just seem to be happy to be themselves and not say, 
`I'm going to be a SOMETHING.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Any pressure she might have felt stemmed from being in a family  
-- regardless of its name -- in which everybody was doing things that 
seemed rather impressive, which could make her feel ``invisible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I even realized about my surname when I decided  
I wanted to be a farmer's wife, which was one of my ambitions,'' 
she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	She settled on being an actress -- after she found that she  
couldn't be a tightrope walker since she lacked the coordination 
and balance. Amid those abortive career choices, though, she also 
wanted to be a writer but deemed it too lonesome a pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated with the sporadic employment that so many aspiring  
actresses suffer as well as the waitressing jobs to pay the bills, 
she started working on her first book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never in a position where I was working enough to  
satisfy me. And I felt horribly wasted. It sounds kind of grand. 
But, you know, I just felt like, 'Um, yes, six months had gone by 
and I had played a penguin,''' she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she says she never thought she'd finish the book. ``I  
just thought I'd do it until I got offered a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An acting job?  
</P>
<P>
	``Or a waitress job,'' she jokes.  
</P>
<P>
	But then she got so close to finishing it that she turned down a  
role. And before long, the actress had turned novelist -- which 
certainly seemed unlikely when she was 10 and still couldn't read 
or write. She can't completely explain how she caught up, except to

<HEADLINE> Mormon Site Is Online Family Tree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Did your ancestors include pioneers or  
immigrants, villains or soldiers, princesses or tailors? A Web site 
that officially kicks off Monday and offers access to the largest 
collection of genealogical data in the world may help you find out. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, put up by the Mormon church, contains links to 400  
million names of people who lived dated back to 1500 -- many with 
family pedigree charts. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints' will add millions more names later this year from its 
records on 2 billion dead people. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyndi Howell of Puyallup, Wash., creator of a popular index of  
genealogical Web sites, says the new site is ``a real boon to 
genealogy. It's like bringing Disneyland into your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site has been accessible since it began testing on April  
1, with improvements made along the way. Church President Gordon B. 
Hinckley will formally unveil the site and roll out an improved 
version Monday in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the kinks were worked out, the site was a hit. The  
test site received 2 million visits on its first day, as many as 
the next most popular genealogical Web site gets in a month, and 
has had more than 7 million hits per day ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	That ranks it among the top 80 places on the Web, said Alex  
Dunn, president of LavaStorm, the Boston company that developed 
software for the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church has done for genealogy what Amazon has done for  
books on the Internet. It's revolutionized it,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a century, the Mormon church has dispatched  
members throughout the world to hand-copy and later photograph and 
microfilm parish and civil records. The records, now all on 
microfilm, are stored in a granite vault in the Wasatch Mountains 
25 miles southeast of Salt Lake, and copies are at the Mormon 
Family History Library near the temple downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's goal is to help members find names of ancestors to  
baptize by proxy, an ordinance that Mormons believe gives the dead 
the opportunity to embrace the faith in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the Internet would be a major step forward in  
making it easier, especially for members, but for everyone involved 
in family history, to collaborate,'' said Elder D. Todd 
Christofferson, executive director of the church's Family History 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also has what amounts to a card catalog to the church's  
Family History Library -- everything from immigrant ship passenger 
lists to homestead records to births and deaths. To verify their 
online research, users can look at microfilm of the original 
records at the library here or by ordering a copy at one of the 
church's 3,200 Family History Centers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Christofferson said the church uses an army of volunteers to  
screen other genealogy Web sites, and the search engine will look 
in 4,000 of those as well as in church sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Caldwell, director of Internet technology strategy at IBM,  
which is hosting the Web site on its computer servers in Chicago, 
predicted the site will become one of the ``top three or four sites 
on the Internet in terms of the number of people hitting it on an 
ongoing basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell said the site could make a fortune, but the Mormon  
church will not accept advertising, and access to the genealogical 
data is free. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Knicks Admit Approaching Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After issuing an emphatic denial, Dave  
Checketts, acting president of the New York Knicks, flip-flopped 
today and admitted that he contacted former Chicago Bulls coach 
Phil Jackson to gauge his interest in running the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombshell revelation came during the fourth quarter of New  
York's 90-78 victory over the Atlanta Hawks for a 3-0 lead in the 
best-of-7 second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I've never met or spoken to Phil and or (his agent) Todd  
Musburger, through an intermediary we did talk to Phil among other 
people at one point ... to see if there was any interest,'' 
Checketts said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was (interest), and we left it that and said we'll see  
you at the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, The New York  
Times and New York Daily News said Checketts met with Jackson in 
mid-April to discuss the state of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, team president Ernie Grunfeld has been demoted and  
the Knicks have been successful, eliminating Miami in the first 
round of the playoffs and now one victory away from the Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose job security has been in  
question throughout this tumultuous season, smiled and shook his 
head before the game Sunday when asked for his reaction to the 
Jackson reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about that,'' he said. ``Every time I'm honest  
it comes back and bites me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, a practicing Mormon who does not attend Sunday games,  
was not at Madison Square Garden for Game 3 against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Musburger could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Checketts and Musburger were quoted in the Times story  
denying there was a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts spokesman, Barry Watkins, issued a blanket denial  
before tipoff: ``There's nothing to it. There was no meeting.'' But 
during the fourth quarter, Watkins came to the arena floor with 
Checketts' new statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Musburger has said in the past that as many as six teams are  
interested in speaking to Jackson about a coaching position. He has 
not disclosed the teams, although it is widely believed that the 
Los Angeles Lakers, New Jersey Nets and Denver Nuggets are among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's resurgence has fueled talk that Van Gundy's job is  
safe for another year, although Checketts has said he will wait 
until the season ends before making any personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has one more year remaining on a three-year, $6  
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation over the possible hiring of Jackson was commonplace  
this season while the Knicks were struggling, and center Patrick 
Ewing said he would demand a trade rather than play for Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shocks me,'' Ewing said of the meeting between Checketts  
and Jackson, which the Times said also was attended by Musburger. 
``I've said it. I'm not playing for Phil Jackson. There's no way. 
They can trade me if they get Phil.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Star Goalie To Miss Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek missed  
Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday because of a 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Dwayne Roloson, who had all of 19 minutes of  
NHL playoff experience going into the game against the Toronto 
Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's injury flared after practice Saturday, and the star  
goalie removed himself from the lineup before the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the final decision this morning, but yesterday I tried  
really hard in the practice, but I could see that I cannot go up 
and down -- it hurt me too much,'' Hasek told Canadian Broadcasting 
Co. ``I knew almost 100 percent I could not go today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek wanted a night's rest to see if he felt better Sunday, but  
he did not and was not on the ice for the pregame warmpup. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Hart Trophy winner was unsure if he could play in  
Game 2 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to speculate,'' he said. ``I wish to wake up  
tomorrow and feel better, but with this kind of injury it's very 
difficult to say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres general manager Darcy Reiger said Hasek could be out more  
than one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have our doctors continue to work with him the  
next day or two and we'll see where it goes from there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson's only NHL playoff time came against Boston in the  
second round this spring after Hasek was lifted when the Sabres 
fell behind 4-1. Roloson faced eight shots and allowed no goals, 
and the Sabres lost 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson was backed up by Martin Biron, who was recalled from the  
AHL farm club in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ready since yesterday to play,'' Hasek said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 18 regular-season appearances this season, Roloson was 6-8-2  
with a 2.77 goals-against average and .909 save percentage. The 
29-year-old goalie was a free agent from the Calgary Flames when he 
signed with the Sabres last July.

<HEADLINE> Kirk Douglas Makes 82nd Movie at 82 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Gone is the muscular strength of  
``Spartacus,'' and the agility of the cocky fighter in ``The 
Champion'' has been replaced by an uneasy gait. But the combative 
spirit that helped define his long career still bursts through even 
the most challenging changes in Kirk Douglas' life. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas has been a movie star for more than half of the 20th  
century. He fought the Hollywood blacklist and won. He has survived 
an air crash and a stroke, and at 82 he has completed his 82nd film 
and is talking about his next one. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has he seen the changing pattern of the American motion  
picture in the past 50 years, he has been an intrinsic part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreseeing the decline of the studio system, Douglas was among  
the first actors to form his own production company, thus taking 
command of his career, as he so often had done when choosing film 
subjects. And the movies he went after often challenged America's 
thinking about social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some contemporaries viewed him as a combative figure who  
resented authority and fought for what was best for Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admit I was impatient in my younger years,'' he once  
remarked. ``But throughout my career in films, I never expected 
anyone to work harder than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That work resulted in three Academy Award nominations:  
``Champion'' (1949), ``The Bad and the Beautiful'' (1953) and 
``Lust for Life'' (1956). The nominations made for much family 
bantering that while Kirk has never won an Oscar, his son Michael 
has two: for co-producing ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' 
(1975) and for his performance in ``Wall Street'' (1987). 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the Academy compensated by presenting Kirk  
Douglas with a special award for career achievement. Millions of 
television viewers were shocked to see the always dynamic actor 
walking hesitantly and speaking with a thick tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier in the decade, in 1991, Douglas was seriously  
injured when a helicopter in which he was riding collided with a 
small plane at the Santa Paula, Calif., airport northwest of Los 
Angeles. The two occupants of the plane died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really tormented,'' he said later. ``I don't think a day  
has passed without my thinking of ... the two young men who were in 
the airplane when we smacked. You have to think: `Wow, I was in my 
70s; they were young. How does that happen?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after surgery to repair a back problem caused by years  
of movie stunts and aggravated by the crash, Douglas was having a 
manicure at his Beverly Hills home when he felt a strange sensation 
on the side of his face. He tried to explain to the manicurist, but 
all that came out was, ``wub wub wub.'' His wife drove him to a 
hospital where he was diagnosed with a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, chin still dimpled and hair full and white, spoke on a  
recent day of his continuing therapy and his return to acting. The 
interview took place at his comfortable but unostentatious home on 
one of Beverly Hills' main residential streets, where 
homes-of-the-stars tour buses can be as common as the locals' 
limousines. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas maintains his daily physical and speech therapy (he  
calls it ``oral aerobics''). His speech seems much improved since 
his Academy appearance, though traces of the stroke are apparent. 
And he is agile enough for an occasional nine holes of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's important for me,'' he said. ``Otherwise, you begin to  
think, 'Gee, you're really a cripple.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas spoke proudly of having just completed Miramax Films'  
``Diamonds,'' a road movie shot on a tight schedule in northern 
Nevada. The film, in which he co-stars with Dan Aykroyd and Lauren 
Bacall, will be released early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	His major concern in accepting the ``Diamonds'' role was his  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm excited, it's very difficult for me to talk,'' he  
explained. ``If I talk slowly, it's pretty good. But when you're 
acting in a picture, you get pretty steamed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently it went pretty well. But when I started the  
picture, I said to my wife, 'I don't think I can talk.' She said, 
'Listen, when the camera is rolling, you will talk.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really am proud of myself. It's almost three years since I  
had my stroke. When I first had it, I -- clever guy -- said, 'In a 
few months I will be perfect.' I tell you, you have to have 
patience, which I don't have much of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly difficult for Douglas, as is the case with many  
stroke victims, is the depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people with strokes just capitulate,'' he  
said. ``At the beginning you cry. But then I said, 'What the hell.' 
I work with a speech therapist, I do exercises. And this movie was 
a very good challenge.'' Douglas plays the lead in the film, so he 
has a heavy workload. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they say 'Action!' he is there,'' Bacall said. ``He's  
still got the energy and interest and curiosity. And he performs. 
He was always a wonderful actor, and he still is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas is cast as an 80-year-old whose boxing past is  
illustrated by scenes from ``Champion.'' His ``Diamonds'' character 
is recovering from a stroke, and he resists his family's desire to 
place him in a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	He unabashedly calls his acting return ``an accomplishment.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people with all kinds of handicaps might think so. You  
should see the letters I get. What can you tell anyone? Just, 
'Don't give up.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	What was it like for a 28-year-old to direct an 82-year-old  
icon? 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really worried, directing a man who had twice worked  
with Stanley Kubrick,'' said John Asher. ``Diamonds'' was his first 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the third day, when I made a suggestion, Kirk said, 'All  
right, sir.' Then I figured I had it made. ``He was amazing, 
calling me every night with ideas about the script. The good thing 
was that he said, 'Let's shoot it that way, and if you don't like 
it, don't use it.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch in Amsterdam, N.Y., to  
illiterate Jewish peasants from Russia. His father scraped together 
a living by driving a horse and wagon through the town's streets 
collecting used goods. Ever conscious of his roots, Douglas called 
his 1988 autobiography ``The Ragman's Son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough enough to be a Jew, but it was very tough in  
Amsterdam,'' he wrote. ``There were constant reminders. No Jews 
worked in the carpet mills. No Jews worked on the local newspaper. 
No Jewish boys delivered the newspaper. Kids on every street corner 
beat you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a boyhood developed a resilience that proved valuable in  
dealing with the all-powerful moguls of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ragman abandoned the family, leaving his wife with a son and  
six daughters. Young Issur escaped the world by conjuring up the 
fantasies he saw at the local movie house. He acted from 
kindergarten through St. Lawrence University. Then came Broadway 
and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Under contract to producer Hal Wallis, Douglas soon declared his  
independence by insisting on the right to make outside pictures. 
One of his choices was the low-budget ``Champion,'' about an 
unprincipled boxer. It was a career-making move. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas zealously protected his newfound stardom, challenging  
producers and questioning directors. In 1955, he established his 
own production company, which he named Bryna in honor of his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no ambitions to become a tycoon in the motion picture  
industry,'' he said in his book. ``My purpose was to participate 
more in the creative process of making films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As his fame grew, his wartime marriage to actress Diana Dill  
unraveled. Newly single, he dated Rita Hayworth, Gene Tierney, 
Evelyn Keyes, Marlene Dietrich, Ava Gardner and other film 
beauties. 
</P>
<P>
	While filming ``The Story of Three Loves,'' he became entranced  
with a 19-year-old Italian with the face of a Renaissance painting, 
Pier Angeli -- ``Our romance started 30 feet above the Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time he was also romancing Anne Buydens, a  
German-born beauty who worked as a production assistant in Paris. 
They married in Las Vegas in 1954 and on May 29, they celebrate 
their 45th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	As a powerful movie star, Douglas demonstrated his toughness in  
1959 by hiring the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo for a much-needed 
rewrite of ``Spartacus,'' the Roman epic Douglas' company was 
filming. Trumbo and other leftists had been barred from the studios 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what? The sky didn't fall in,'' Douglas said in 1985.  
``Other studios began hiring blacklisted writers and actors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas' scores of films include ``Paths of Glory'' (1958),  
Stanley Kubrick's powerful antiwar movie; ``The List of Adrian 
Messenger'' (1963), with its guessing game of stars; and ``Lust for 
Life,'' in which he portrayed the tortured artist Vincent van Gogh. 
For years Kirk and son Michael have searched for a film in which 
they could appear together. Now Michael has a script they may film 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only in the last six-seven years that we have become  
really close,'' Kirk said of his movie-star son. ``Now he says, 
'You know, Dad, I think the stroke really helped you; you're a much 
nicer guy now.' He might be right.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A married couple climbing on Mount Hood  
fell 1,000 feet to their deaths on Sunday just after they began 
their descent down the north side of the peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbers, a husband and wife in their 20s whose names were  
not immediately released, were linked together. One of them slipped 
and pulled the other about 9 a.m. as they were descending the 
Cooper Spur route, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other climbers said conditions were soft and mushy on the  
mountain as temperatures jumped into the high 80s and low 90s for 
the first time this year across much of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain rescue crews were climbing to Eliot Glacier to retrieve  
the bodies, which were at the 8,800-foot level, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were dozens of witnesses, and one used his cell phone to  
call for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Hood is in the Cascade Mountain range and is 11,245 feet  
tall. It is about 60 miles east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal accident on the peak was in May 1998, when a  
University of Portland physics professor was killed in an avalanche 
near the summit.

<HEADLINE> Some HMOs Don't Cover Popular Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a new secret to success in the health  
insurance business: cutting costs by eliminating coverage of some 
of the most prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Aetna Inc. was able to post a better-than-expected  
first quarter profit last month. In January, the nation's leading 
health insurer stopped routinely covering some of the most popular 
medicines for many members. 
</P>
<P>
	Need Prozac for your depression? Sorry. Want the No. 1 U.S.  
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor? Too bad. Want the world's 
best-selling prescription drug, Prilosec, to treat your ulcer? 
Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
	These are among the 106 prescription drugs that Aetna U.S.  
Healthcare requires most of its members to buy themselves, or pay 
for at a higher co-payment than the drugs Aetna favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, most large health plans have also restricted  
coverage of some of the top-selling drugs in an effort to control 
costs. For example, PacifiCare doesn't cover either of the top two 
selling cholesterol-lowering medications, Zocor or Lipitor. Oxford 
Health Plans, a major HMO in the Northeast, charges some members a 
premium for the leading allergy drug Claritin for adults. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO drug costs are expected to soar 20 percent this year,  
primarily because people are using more medicines and the situation 
is expected to only worsen. Overall health care costs are expected 
to rise only 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO executives say they have little choice but to reduce access  
to many high-priced new drugs to keep annual premium increases in 
single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	But that reasoning is of little comfort to many consumers who  
are used to getting the drug their doctor prescribes, or the 
medication they have trusted for years to keep them healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been penalized,'' said Barbara Lampert, 52,  
of suburban Chicago, who had to switch insulin medications when she 
Aetna in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna and other HMOs say they often make exceptions to allow  
members to get coverage for excluded drugs if the preferred drugs 
don't work or cause severe side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Lampert, for example, was able to convince Aetna to pay for her  
Lipitor and another diabetes drug, Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer advocates say patients often have to work too hard  
to get the drugs they need. And most consumers simply skip the 
appeals process because they believe it's skewed against them or is 
too cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's drug strategy goes beyond just restricting choices. It  
also calls doctors to convince them to prescribe the lower cost 
drugs and sends notices to members telling them how much they could 
save by switching. 
</P>
<P>
	But such steps are a tough sell because of pharmaceutical  
makers' heavy consumer advertising and frequent sales visits to 
physician offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes more of an educational effort on our part,'' said Dr.  
Nicholas Hanchak, Aetna's drug program manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumers have no complaints after being persuaded or  
forced to switch drugs by their health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Paul Fronstin's health insurer, the George  
Washington University Health Plan, wanted to charge him more for 
the allergy drug Claritin that he'd take for four years. So 
Fronstin, a Washington D.C.-based employee benefits researcher, 
switched to a newer drug, Zyrtec. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried it ... and it works,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	When Aetna started to exclude Prozac in January, it's policy  
applied only to new members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came down to cost,'' said Hanchak, noting the company  
believed the alternative drugs it covers are equal in benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the grandfather clause, Aetna's decision struck a chord  
in the mental health community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is terribly risky and even the HMOs' doctors must  
know these types of drugs are not interchangeable,'' said Jim 
Coleman, a coordinator with the Recovery Initiative, a Cincinnati 
mental health advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight restrictions on drugs irk many doctors as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the biggest problems I have in dealing with  
managed care,'' said Dr. Lee McCormick, a Pittsburgh family doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, as part of an industry trend, Aetna began offering a  
three-tier system for drug coverage. About a third of Aetna members 
are under the new system: paying one price for generic drugs 
(usually $5), a higher price for the brand name drugs that Aetna 
prefers (usually $10-15) and a still higher price ($25 or $30) for 
thebrand name drugs that it would prefer members not use. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of Aetna members have no coverage for excluded  
drugs; The other third have the same co-payment for all drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna will spend about $3 billion on drugs this year for 10  
million members. Despite the company's efforts, its drug spending 
will likely rise by about 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann To Buy Stake in Oliman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Mannesmann said this weekend that, as  
previously agreed, it will acquire Olivetti's 50.1 percent stake in 
their joint telecommunications holding company Oliman. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceeds of the sale, worth $7.1 billion, will help Olivetti  
pay for the takeover of Telecom Italia SpA, Italy's No. 1 phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann and Olivetti agreed in February to the sale if  
Olivetti succeeded in taking over Telecom Italia. Olivetti, a 
diversified communications and office products business, garnered 
51 percent of Telecom's shares in a hostile take over bid ended 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann will finance the deal through an existing bank loan  
and has all necessary regulatory approvals for the deal, the 
company said in a statement issued Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann said it expects the takeover will help to improve its  
profit next year.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Kicks Off Book Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura's administration may ask his  
publisher to pay more of the costs of his book tour for security 
and a staff member to travel with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in jeans and a Navy SEAL T-shirt and hat, Ventura kicked  
off the tour Saturday with a book-signing at the Mall of America. 
Within the first hour, he'd already signed 200 copies of his 
autobiography, ``Ain't Got Time to Bleed,'' and about 300 people 
were still in line. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans stops in California, New York, Washington and Chicago  
to promote the book, for which he received a six-figure advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's spokesman, John Wodele, said the governor may ask his  
publisher to help pay for the security crew and staff member 
required for the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Wodele said earlier that state taxpayers would pick up the tab,  
but Ventura is making the trips on vacation time and his personal 
expenses are being paid privately by Villard Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Weaver, the state's public safety commissioner who  
provides security for the governor, said it isn't appropriate that 
citizens pay for the security costs.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Eyes Champions Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEMBLEY, England (AP) -- Now comes the title Manchester United  
has longed for: Europe's Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	United won the Premier League a week ago, the fifth time in  
seven seasons. On Saturday it downed Newcastle 2-0 in the 118th 
F.A. Cup final -- the third league and cup double this decade and 
the first club to win three. 
</P>
<P>
	The last step is Wednesday's showdown with Bayern Munich in the  
Champions Cup final in Barcelona, Spain, a title Manchester United 
last won 31 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory would make United the first English team to ever win  
all three major trophies in the same season and restore battered 
English soccer pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' coach Alex Ferguson said. ``It was a great  
performance and we could have scored a lot more goals. With the 
spirit the players showed they will be looking forward to 
Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bundesliga title already clinched, Bayern is also chasing a  
similar triple with the German Cup set for next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``All along we have said the other games are important, but  
Wednesday really is the big one for us,'' defender Gary Neville 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hunger is still there for Wednesday and the Champions Cup  
final,'' striker Andy Cole said. ``It's another big game but this 
final hasn't taken anything out of the lads. Roll on Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United is unbeaten in 32 games and the F.A. Cup was the club's  
record 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcastle -- which seldom got the ball to England star Alan  
Shearer and played poor defense -- has lost two straight F.A. Cup 
finals. Reports suggest coach Ruud Gullit is leaving, but he says 
he's coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make mistakes like that at this level,'' Gullit  
said. ``It has happened all season and now I have to add new 
faces.''

<HEADLINE> Married Climbers Die in Oregon Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A married couple climbing on Mount Hood  
fell 1,000 feet to their deaths on Sunday just after they began 
their descent down the north side of the peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbers, a husband and wife in their 20s whose names were  
not immediately released, were linked together. One of them slipped 
and pulled the other about 9 a.m. as they were descending the 
Cooper Spur route, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other climbers said conditions were soft and mushy on the  
mountain as temperatures jumped into the high 80s and low 90s for 
the first time this year across much of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain rescue crews were climbing to Eliot Glacier to retrieve  
the bodies, which were at the 8,800-foot level, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were dozens of witnesses, and one used his cell phone to  
call for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Hood is in the Cascade Mountain range and is 11,245 feet  
tall. It is about 60 miles east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal accident on the peak was in June 1998, when a  
University of Portland physics professor was killed in an avalanche 
near the summit.

<HEADLINE> Indians Catch a Big Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Talk about catching a break. The Indians sure  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	When Omar Vizquel hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth  
inning today it not only beat the Detroit Tigers 7-4, it saved 
Jolbert Cabrera from having to make his major league catching 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the happiest guy in the ballpark,'' Cabrera said. ``I  
was probably happier than Omar was. I would have had to catch 
(Paul) Shuey. Thank God that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera, a reserve infielder, was nearly forced to go behind the  
plate when Indians manager Mike Hargrove used Jim Thome in the 
ninth inning as a pinch-hitter for catcher Einar Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, currently the Indians' starting catcher with Sandy Alomar  
on the disabled list, had entered the game in the eighth inning 
after Sunday's starting catcher, Chris Turner, had been replaced by 
a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	When Thome walked in the ninth inning, Cabrera, who hadn't  
caught since Little League, was busy trying on shin guards in 
anticipation of entering the game when Hargrove sent him in to 
pinch-run. He had trouble getting them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to get his shin guards on when I told him to go  
in and pinch-run,'' Hargrove said. ``And I think it took him about 
15 minutes to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Travis Fryman had just gotten back to the bench  
after scoring a run to bring the Indians within 4-3, when he 
realized the Indians were in deep trouble if the game went to extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Jolbert trying on the gear and I thought, `uh oh,''' he  
said. ``The guy is a sprinter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Fryman, who caught briefly in high school, volunteered to put  
on the shin guards, chest protector and mask, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked around and saw our options,'' he said. ``You've got a  
6-foot-7 guy at first (Richie Sexson) and that's not going to work. 
Robbie (Alomar) is too good and too valuable. Omar? That's out of 
the question. And Wil (Cordero) has a bruised heel. I figured third 
base isn't that far off from catching. I might as well go back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman said Hargrove then asked him if he had any catching  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I liked Johnny Bench as a kid, that's about it,''  
Fryman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he knew he was taking a big gamble by  
pinch-hitting for Diaz, and realized the Indians spared themselves 
some possible embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a certain way you dread coming to that because you don't  
want to watch that debacle that could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While reporters were listening to Vizquel's account of his first  
career game-winning homer, Cabrera, once a member of Colombia's 
national track team, leaned in to offer thanks for not having to 
chase one of Shuey's 95 mph split-finger fastballs to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you, Omar,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Unions Press Olivetti on Job Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian unions are pressing Olivetti to create, not  
cut, jobs now that it has taken control of Telecom Italia SpA, the 
Italian telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders are worried that new management might quickly move  
to cut jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company this rich and with this many prospects must create  
jobs, not destroy them,'' Sergio D'Antoni, leader of CISL, one of 
Italy's three main labor federations, said in an interview 
published Sunday in Milan's daily Corriere della Sera. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's unemployment rate is more than 12 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, a typewriter and computer manufacturer that has moved  
into telecommunications, formally agreed Saturday to accept a 51 
percent controlling stake in Telecom, Italy's No. 1 phone company, 
in its three-month hostile takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Communists in Italy's center-left coalition have been pressing  
for the government to use its ``golden share'' mechanism with 
Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Ministry, as part of Telecom's privatization  
arrangements, has a 3.4 percent ``golden'' stake in the former 
state monopoly. Into next year, it can wield veto power over new 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	But Italy's finance minister on Saturday indicated the  
government saw no reason to use the veto.

tonight by getting hit by a pitch twice in the same inning, and he 
scored twice during the Baltimore Orioles' 10-run first inning 
against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the Orioles' leadoff hitter, was hit twice in the  
first inning by Texas pitcher Mike Morgan. Manager Johnny Oates 
removed Morgan after Anderson was hit for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in modern history that a player has been  
hit by a pitch twice in the same inning. Willard Schmidt of the 
Cincinnati Reds did it on April 26, 1959, and Frank Thomas of the 
New York Mets was hit twice on April 29, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson scored the first time on a sacrifice fly and came in  
the second time on a three-run double by Mike Bordick. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has been been hit by a pitch eight times this season,  
high on the Orioles.

<HEADLINE> O'Connor Encourages Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing surveys indicating more than half the  
country's lawyers say they are dissatisfied at work, Justice Sandra 
Day O'Connor on Sunday encouraged law school graduates to devote 
more time to public service and civility. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said lawyers should see their work as a profession  
dedicated to the community -- not just a way to make money. While 
more lawyers do more charitable work now than ever before, most of 
the poor's legal needs are not met, she said in a speech at 
American University's Washington College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing more legal services for the poor, O'Connor said, would  
help repair the public's negative perceptions of lawyers and end 
lawyers' common frustration ``that all the long hours and hard work 
are not producing anything socially worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers' lives also can be improved by more cordiality within  
the profession, O'Connor said. She said judges should serve as 
examples and law schools can be breeding grounds for civility among 
future lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, it is by deed rather than by decree that students  
can learn that it is possible to disagree agreeably,'' O'Connor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor also received an honorary degree the country's first  
law school to be founded by women. O'Connor was the first woman on 
the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Document: Tobacco Candy Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- A major cigarette maker once considered making  
tobacco-based lollipops and other candies with nicotine at the same 
time the industry claimed it was trying to make smoking 
unattractive to kids, a formerly secret document shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was among several novel tobacco product proposals to  
emerge during an October 1992 brainstorming session by executives 
at Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., according to a memo quoted by 
the Saint Paul Pioneer Press on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Others included a wafer bread product, ``foam tobacco; sponge or  
cotton candy like product,'' a fruit roll-up, tea, a paper stick 
resembling a lollipop, a ``chew stick,'' tobacco spice to sprinkle 
on food, a ``tobacco-derived salted snack'' and a tobacco pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also looked at an ``asthma inhaler-like product,'' a  
nicotine nasal spray, chewing tobacco that didn't have to be spit 
out, tobacco toothpicks and an ``atomizer activated by sucking.'' 
It also considered tobacco lotion, perfume and aftershave. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo's author wrote that the meeting's participants were  
searching for a ``socially acceptable'' tobacco product, one that 
contained nicotine but had a ``positive image.'' The author also 
said it should be smoke-free, odorless, easy, ``pleasant'' to use 
and have ``satisfaction readily controlled by user.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the tobacco industry said the memo may provide the  
Food and Drug Administration with a powerful piece of evidence that 
the tobacco industry markets nicotine as a drug, and that the 
industry therefore should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith said the memo just  
reflects some ``dumb ideas'' floated in the kind of freewheeling 
brainstorming in which any corporation might indulge -- and that 
management never let those ideas reach the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court last month agreed to rule on whether the  
FDA can regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and  
Health, said the new-found memo ``is one of the strongest pieces of 
evidence supporting the FDA's position that they (tobacco 
companies) intended nicotine as a drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're basically talking about here is `How do we cram  
nicotine into people?''' Banzhaf told the Pioneer Press. ``They're 
talking about how it has to be at certain levels, and they even use 
the word `controlled,' and that is at the heart of the FDA's 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo is among 36 million pages of documents made public  
following the major tobacco companies' $6.6 billion settlement with 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents in the collection show that the four leading tobacco  
companies -- Brown &AMP; Williamson, Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. -- all investigated a variety 
of novel tobacco and smoking products. But Brown &AMP; Williamson 
seemed to have the widest range of ideas for novel tobacco 
products, the Pioneer Press said.

<HEADLINE> Reconnaissance Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A Titan IVB rocket  
carrying a classified satellite lifted off and separated from its 
booster early Saturday -- marking the first successful launch after 
a series of Titan failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket was carrying the satellite for the National  
Reconnaissance Office, the government agency responsible for 
reconnaissance satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	It lifted off at 2:36 a.m., heading for a polar orbit.  
Information on whether the satellite reached its proper orbit was 
classified, said Paul Grove, a Vandenberg spokesman. But he did say 
the satellite separated from its booster several minutes into 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider our job a success,'' said Lt. Tom Knowles, a  
spokesman for Vandenberg's 30th Space Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the payload, including its weight and mission, also  
were classified. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first West Coast launch of a Titan IVB, which is the  
nation's largest unmanned booster. 
</P>
<P>
	Built by Lockheed Martin Corp., the two-stage rockets carry both  
liquid- and solid-fuel motors. The rocket can place 38,800 pounds 
into a low-Earth polar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it has a troubled history. Titan IV rockets were  
involved in three of six U.S. rocket failures in the last nine 
months.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- A runner collapsed at the finish line of  
the USO Defenders 10-mile race Sunday and was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Jeffrey Klein, 53, of East Windsor, N.J.,  
complained of difficulty breathing when he crossed the finish line 
in the Pentagon's north parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	He was helped to the ground by onlookers, who said he was  
conscious at that point. But he reportedly soon lost consciousness 
and stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency medical technicians stationed with an ambulance near  
the finish line then took over treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Calcagni, one of the medical technicians who treated  
Klein, said the man's condition worsened in the ambulance and he 
never regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	He was pronounced dead at George Washington University Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Intel Head Sees Internet As Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Companies that have yet to go online should  
do so now, or they will fold within a few years, the chairman of 
Intel Corp. warned investors at a business survival seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In five years, there won't be any Internet companies because  
they will all be Internet companies,'' Andrew Grove, head of the 
world's largest maker of computer chips, said Saturday. ``Otherwise 
they will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which Grove helped found in 1968, has seen its Internet  
business grow from zero percent in 1997 to a projected 42 percent 
this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even junkyards have gone online, acquiring cars, stripping them  
of parts, cataloguing them, and then filling Internet orders from 
all over the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers and sellers don't even have to talk to each other at the  
same time to conduct business online. Thanks to e-mail and other 
devices, they can communicate regardless of time or place, 
extending the business day. 
</P>
<P>
	But simply being online isn't enough, Grove said, as he  
cautioned investors that many Internet companies that are getting a 
lot of publicity now won't be around for the long haul. Those that 
survive will employ traditional business tenets, like being 
customer oriented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grove spoke at the third annual Los Angeles Times Investment  
Strategies Conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers End Forum Era in Losing Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Lakers wrote an inglorious ending  
to the 32-year-old Forum, where the last of their six NBA 
championships came 11 long years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio completed a four-game sweep of Los Angeles today  
with a 118-107 victory in the Western Conference semifinals. Last 
year, the Lakers were swept in the conference finals by Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll leave all our sweep demons over here,'' forward Robert  
Horry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers will play two exhibition games in the Forum next  
season before moving to the new Staples Center in downtown Los 
Angeles. They'll share the arena with the Clippers and the NHL's 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's history,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``The Forum and (New York's  
Madison Square) Garden are it. I feel very honored I had the 
opportunity to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the sellout crowd of 17,505 began hitting the exits with  
five minutes left and the Lakers trailing by 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	They had cheered lustily when rookie coach Kurt Rambis inserted  
rookie Tyronn Lue six minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard listed at 6 feet, although he hardly looks it, lived  
up to his reputation as a fearless flyer by repeatedly driving to 
the basket against the much taller and heavier Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lue provided a temporary spark for the struggling Lakers, but  
they couldn't capitalize against 7-footers Tim Duncan and David 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of rusty, but it was good to get an opportunity,''  
said Lue, who had 12 points, six assists and four turnovers in 29 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lue's driving layup with 25 seconds remaining was the final  
basket scored in the Forum's regular season history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty has a proven career. He's a young, talented player,'' said  
veteran guard Derek Harper, who was passed over Sunday in favor of 
Lue. ``He's shown he can produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Rice thought he could, too. But the sharpshooter who  
arrived via a February trade with Charlotte was just 4-of-10 
shooting for 11 points despite playing all but three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to go out there time after time and to be  
forgotten,'' he said. ``It boiled down to teamwork. A lot of times 
there wasn't a lot of teamwork out there. We weren't together out 
there on either end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice had complained in the season's waning weeks about being  
left out of the offense. The player whose shooting relies on 
teammates setting screens often found himself buried on the 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to think about a lot of things this summer,'' he said  
of his future with the Lakers. ``Right now, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis faces an uncertain future. He stepped up from assistant  
to head coach after Del Harris was fired the same February day that 
Dennis Rodman temporarily became a Laker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's done a terrific job under the most difficult  
circumstances,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said. 
``He was thrown into a situation that was the most difficult I've 
ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers finished with a 31-20 record. They beat Houston 3-1  
in a first-round series, but were undone by late miscues in each of 
the games against the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we didn't win a lot of games. We did,'' West  
said. ``We don't have a terrible team, we have a talented team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicholson, the Lakers' No. 1 fan, admitted feeling  
nostalgic at the thought of attending the final NBA non-exhibition 
game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfect basketball arena,'' he said. ``There's very few  
of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame baseball player Frank Robinson is ready to leave  
the circular building with its orange and yellow seats behind. He's 
been a regular since the Forum opened in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has had its day,'' he said. ``Maybe the new building has  
got some championships in it. This one doesn't have any more.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two American women -- a grandmother and  
granddaughter -- drowned after being swept away by a wave while 
walking on a northern Mexican beach, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Means, 22, and her 73-year-old grandmother, Ethel Buteh  
Wogner, both of St. George, Utah, were walking near the Solmar 
Hotel in the northern resort city Cabo San Lucas on Saturday when 
the wave overtook them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Americans who had been fishing nearby retrieved the  
women's bodies, Carlos Dominguez Lara, a police official, said by 
telephone from nearby La Paz.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Rain-swollen rivers in Peru's Amazon jungle  
have flooded the green-carpeted lowlands, leaving four people dead 
and forcing thousands from their homes, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents waded through waist-deep water in the streets of the  
jungle capital Iquitos, 620 miles northeast of Lima, and 
surrounding towns after three weeks of rains caused the Amazon 
River and its Itaya and Nanay tributaries to flood. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 homes in the region were damaged by the flooding and  
residents have fled to higher ground, said Ivan Vasquez, mayor of 
Maynas province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amazon River and its tributaries flood frequently and  
residents living along its banks often build their homes on raised 
stilts in anticipation of changing river levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent rains have caused the Amazon River in Peru to rise to  
its highest level in the past 17 years, Maynas civil defense chief 
Federico Pezo said.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Justice officials are  
investigating a federal lawmaker whose hospitals sterilized 54 
Indian women in exchange for votes, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tubal ligations were conducted at hospitals owned by Roland  
Lavigne during the 1994 congressional campaign, the Folha de Sao 
Paulo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted Lavigne, a physician from the northern state  
Bahia, as saying he no longer owns the hospitals and no longer 
practices medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospitals were in Itaju do Colonia, a remote district 430  
miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54 women, members of the Pataxo tribe, have an average of  
three children per family and are believed to have welcomed 
sterilization. In return, they cast votes that helped Lavigne win 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials launched an inquiry after a health census  
revealed that all but one of the 10 women of childbearing age at 
several Pataxo villages were sterile as a result of Lavigne's 
offers. Tribal leaders claim the future of the 6,000-member tribe 
is now in jeopardy.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez will deny a  
request by the United States to use Venezuela's airspace for 
anti-narcotics flights in the region, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants to use Venezuela's airspace for flights  
from three new staging centers being set up in Ecuador and the 
Dutch islands of Curacao and Aruba, located off Venezuela's western 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez was quoted in El Universal newspaper on Sunday as saying  
that ``we cannot accept that any foreign military airplanes fly 
over our territory without our authorization, and we are not going 
to authorize it.''

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Heavy rains have swept away the  
main bridges connecting Honduras with Nicaragua and El Salvador, 
downing flimsy structures built after Hurricane Mitch destroyed the 
original spans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of trucks were lined up Sunday on either side of the El  
Salvador-Honduras bridge, where a 100-foot temporary bridge was 
washed away Wednesday. The bridge is at El Amatillo, 100 miles 
south of the capital, Tegucigalpa. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have been unable to rebuild the bridges because of heavy  
rains, said the spokesman for Honduras' Communications Secretariat, 
Rene Paz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have sent a great deal of machinery to repair the bridge,  
but the work is tough because of the rain,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> French Open Begins Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ten years after capturing her first French Open,  
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario begins defense of her third title Monday 
with less concern for her ball-bashing young opponent than for an 
aching wrist that needs surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez-Vicario has been that most durable and indefatigable of  
players who seemed born for clay. 
</P>
<P>
	The glamour in the game may belong to the likes of Martina  
Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams and Anna Kournikova, but 
Sanchez-Vicario can still run down balls all afternoon and, if need 
be, all evening. Six times at Roland Garros she's run herself into 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, though, when she's swung with her two-fisted backhand,  
she's felt shivers of pain in her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the ligaments is out of position,'' she said Sunday as  
she prepared for her opening match against one of the strongest of 
the new generation of players, Mirjana Lucic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors told me the best thing to do is operate if I want  
to fix it. I'm trying not to do that, if I can help it. It's kind 
of like something is always turning around in my hand. It's a lot 
of pain when I want to hit my backhand hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Physical therapy is helping, and after missing more than three  
months she's been able to play the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not 100 percent, but I'm optimistic,'' she said. ``I'm  
here. I'm the defending champion. I love the atmosphere, and I've 
always done well here. So I came here thinking that I'm going to 
try to win my fourth French Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was only 17 when she won the French in 1989, beating Steffi  
Graf in the final and becoming the toast of Spain. One of the 
youngsters watching her and getting inspiration from that victory 
was a 12-year-old named Carlos Moya. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that day,'' said Moya, who won the men's title last  
year and opens play on center court Monday against an Austrian he 
once met in the juniors, Markus Hipfl. ``It was a great day for the 
people in Spain. Graf was already so big, so nobody expected 
(Sanchez-Vicario) to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's been one of the greatest sportswomen ever in  
Spain. What she has done is amazing. She always gave 100 percent 
for her tennis, fighting so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That style served not only Sanchez-Vicario well, but provided a  
model for a generation of Spanish men who have become a major force 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya expects his toughest challenges in the French this year to  
come not from the top-ranked players like Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
Pete Sampras, but from the other Spaniards like No. 6 Alex 
Corretja, No. 14 Felix Mantilla, and unseeded Alberto Bersategui. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of the 128 men in the draw are from Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the toughest opponents are going to be Spanish players  
and (Chilean Marcelo) Rios and (Brazilian Gustavo) Kuerten,'' Moya 
said.

<HEADLINE> Social Conservatives Alter Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Far from speaking with a single voice,  
social conservatives seem unable to settle on a consensus 
Republican candidate as the 2000 presidential campaign takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer courts them and former Vice President Dan Quayle  
seeks to lay claim to their allegiance. Commentator Pat Buchanan 
has rallied them in the past, while talk show host Alan Keyes has 
the potential to win support. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire plays 
all the right notes. Publisher Steve Forbes sounds appealing 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
	But none has become the anointed candidate of the right.  
</P>
<P>
	Some worry that could dilute the influence of conservatives over  
the GOP nominee and ease pressure on mainstream politicians to 
cater to conservative issues. Others see a general election bonanza 
that could end an eight-year absence from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge force, but even a big pie cut into 20 pieces gets  
small pretty fast,'' said Ralph Reed, a former director of the 
Christian Coalition who now counsels Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a 
potential Republican presidential candidate. ``That's what has 
happened so far to religious conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to get the entire pro-family vote,'' said  
consultant Greg Mueller, who is aligned with Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other strategists argue that the divisions among social  
conservatives merely reflect a movement that has grown into an 
established force in GOP politics, shifting the entire party to the 
right and influencing even centrist candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no Arlen Specter or Pete Wilson in the race this  
year,'' notes Christian Coalition head Randy Tate, referring, 
respectively, to the senator from Pennsylvania and the former 
California governor. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other divisions as well. New polling conducted for  
congressional Republicans showed voters view the GOP as 
increasingly out of step, which could pressure some candidates to 
moderate sharply conservative stances. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's Smith contends that conservatives could bolt the  
party if they are abandoned once more. He has raised the 
possibility of a third-party effort by conservatives, but most 
consider that unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The clout of social conservatives varies from state to state,  
but most strategists believe about one-third of the Republican 
primary vote in key early states comes from social and religious 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	When united, they can exert enormous pressure on contenders for  
the presidential nomination, forcing them to the right both in 
rhetoric and in the GOP platform. 
</P>
<P>
	But in this election cycle, they are badly divided.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's more splintered,'' said Richard Schwarm, a former  
Iowa GOP chairman who is supporting Bush. ``There are a number of 
conservative candidates in the field who have records which are not 
only acceptable but can be enthusiastically embraced by social 
conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Gillespie, a consultant in the camp of Rep. John Kasich of  
Ohio, one such hopeful, said: ``The candidate who had the greatest 
potential to galvanize support was the first one out, and that's 
(Missouri Sen.) John Ashcroft. That left a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader, observed: ``It's a  
combination of no one being able to get to a critical mass, and 
there are so many people vying for that crown that they are just 
cannibalizing each other. There were a lot of people who had the 
opportunity to pick up the Holy Grail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has had a noticeable effect on others in the race.  
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole is talking about gun control, while Bush made a  
point of noting that voters are not ready for constitutional bans 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Dole and Governor Bush certainly seem comfortable  
staking themselves out as moderate, and you didn't see that in 
1996,'' said Steve Grubbs, a former Iowa Republican chairman who 
now consults for Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Past elections have featured a conservative candidate making an  
unexpectedly strong early showing, Grubbs said. ``You might not 
have that kind of national surprise this time,'' he said.
