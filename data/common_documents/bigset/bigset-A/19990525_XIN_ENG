<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Lashes out at Terrorist Action by NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday rapped at
the terrorist action by the U.S.-led NATO because the military
alliance intends to destroy the civilian infrastructure, such as
hospitals and refugee camps, and the residence of the elected
president of a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told the press conference here that "NATO
has already engaged itself in a number of terrorist activities
in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
One example is that the residence of the president of
Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, "the democratically-elected
president of the country, has been targeted three times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty refugee camps, which house refugees from Bosnia and
Croatia, were bombed, resulting in 100 deaths, mostly women and
children, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO is targeting "almost anything visible from the sky," he
said, "the deliberate action" is designed to terrorize population
and force the elected government to accept surrender."
</P>
<P>
"Attacking hospitals and refugee camps is nothing more than a
deliberate terrorist attack," he said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and rebel KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) have now fully
cooperated," he said, "In Albania, NATO recruits and trains
Albanian refugees (from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo) and
prepare them for infiltrate our border, staging attacks against
our army and other people in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"On May 17, there are two attempts of the huge armed group of
KLA people, assisted by tanks of the army of the Republic of
Albania and the NATO association, who tried to cross the border in
order to set up a new slaughter house in Kosovo," he said. "But
they were crashed by our army."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo crisis broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians have been fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
Rebuting NATO accusations, the Yugoslav ambassador said, "Our
policy is not any ethnic cleansing against anybody."
</P>
<P>
"We are nevertheless determined to defend our country by all
our means until the very end," he said. "There is no price which
we are not ready to pay for defending our country."

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: NATO Bombing Kills 1200 Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
special envoy for the Balkans, said here Monday that NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia hads killed 1,200 innocent civilians,
including ethnic Albanians, of that country.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told a press conference over 5,000 people were
injured and that damage caused by the air campaign, which entered
the 62nd day Monday, has exceeded 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the total number of refugees has exceeded 1 million, of
who 600,000 are outside of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombings have also left more than 500,000 people
jobless and over 1 million people without source of income,
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is seriously concerned about the fact that NATO
countries are arming the Kosovo Liberation Army, noting that the
KLA has been engaged in drugs and arms trafficking in Europe, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that this is not an army and everybody feared it
before," Chernomyrdin sai. "But now they are arming it."
</P>
<P>
He warned that it would be much di fficult to disarm the KLA
guerrillas than to arm them.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: Talks Should End Bombings on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy for the Balkans Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here Monday that upcoming talks among Russian,
U.S. and Finnish officials Wednesday should lead an end to air
strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We need a concrete result and our trilateral talks should
result in stopping the air strikes and transferring the conflict
from the military to a political setting," Chernomyrdin said,
referring to the talks among him, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
He again called attention to the fact that "bombings are being
intensified in Yugoslavia" simultaneously with the invigoration of
the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
"The world has never seen this before," Chernomyrdin said. "It
will hardly be possible to advance democracy with the help of air
strikes."
</P>
<P>
He expressed that hope that the Wednesday talks would turn
successful and that he would travel back to Belgrade later this
week together with the Finnish president.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said differences remained mainly on two points:
the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and the structure of
international presence in the province.
</P>
<P>
"Belgrade and (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic are ready
to accept many things, including the participation of NATO
countries that are not actively involved in combat actions, such
as Greece and Portugal, in the international presence,"
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a stop or at least a temporary pause to the air
strikes. "A pause is needed very much," the Itar-Tass quoted
Chernomyrdin as saying.

<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister called on
African youths on Monday to strive for education and develop work
ethics that will help transform the continent from conflicts,
poverty and disease into prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said this
when he addressed hundreds of youths who commemorated African
Unity Day at the Zimbabwe College of Distance Education in
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Africa's hopes for prosperity lay in the
youth who will be the future leaders of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"If the youth patronize the intoxicating drink and go for drugs
then Africa is heading for doom," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But if the youth remain united, upright and disciplined and
strive for education then Africa has hope for development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As African countries celebrated African Unity Day on Tuesday,
he said, there is need for governments to revisit the ideals of
the OAU and strive to create conditions of peace on the continent.

<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Monday called on its 16 members to come up
with measures to deal with the recent military coups in Niger and
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate was speaking at an
emergency meeting of west African foreign ministers which started
Monday in Lome, capital Togo, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
He told the opening session that "it is time to bring an end to
coups which only tarnish the image of our sub-region," adding that
he would like to see sanctions imposed on the new rulers in Bissau
and Niger to give credibility to efforts to foster constitutional
rule in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Niger's President Ibrahim Bare Mainsasara was killed by members
of his presidential guard at the start of a coup last month while
rebels in Guinea Bissau toppled President Joao Bernardo Vieira
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a cease-fire in Sierra Leone's civil war reached
last week came into force on Monday as ECOWAS foreign ministers
met in Togo to help rivals in the country start peace talks
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers meeting was designed to set the stage for
the peace talks, and endorse the on-going mediation by Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also aimed at setting the framework for
international assistance in the implementation of a subsequent
comprehensive agreement, notably in terms of truce monitoring,
humanitarian assistance and disarmament of combatants.
</P>
<P>
Senior envoys of Ahmad T. Kabbah's government led by
Attorney-General and Justice Minister Solomon Berewa have arrived
in Lome for the peace talks with the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).

Rogers, chairman of its war council, sitting in at the peace
talks, reports reaching here said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Creates "Appalling Picture of Destruction" in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Monday said that "the criminal NATO bombing" has created a
"appalling picture" in Yugoslavia -- the killing of innocent
civilians and the destruction of civilians infrastructure of the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, told a press conference
here that the on-gong NATO air strikes are "criminal in characters
and genocide in targets and proportions."
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the two months of deliberate destructions and
killings of Yugoslavia," "the picture of destruction is
appalling," the Yugoslav ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, former Yugoslav foreign minister, slammed the NATO
strikes as a violation of the U.N. Charter and the authority of
the Security Council, which has the primary responsibility to
maintain world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, "over 10,000 sorties have flown
over the whole territory of Yugoslavia," he said. "There are over
1,300 civilians killed and more than 6,000 civilians wounded."
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million pupils are denied primary education, 300
primary and secondary schools were destroyed or heavily damaged
and 180,000 school children have lost their classrooms in the wake
of the NATO military action, which began March 24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "NATO used its weapons banned by the international
conventions," such as cluster bombs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the beginning of the press conference, 30 xeroxed photos
of cluster bombs and carbon fibre bombs were distributed among
journalists. NATO dropped these bombs into Yugoslavia, killing
many civilians frequently disabling the nation's power
distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals, factories and communication infrastructure were
hit and destroyed or heavily damaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only a couple of days ago, the largest hospital in Belgrade,
capital of Yugoslavia, was targeted, "few of its main parts
totally destroyed, like surgery and maternity wards," he said.
Four people were killed, and 11 children and two newly-born babies
were among those injured.
</P>
<P>
In addition, even refugee camps in Yugoslavia can not avoid
being hit by NATO bombs, he said, adding that 80 refugee camps,
which housed refugees from Bosnia and Croatia, were attacked and
created more than 100 deaths and many injuries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, "cultural and historic monuments and museums
are not reserved either," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Albanian refugees, who were on their way back from neighboring
countries, have been hit," he said, "More than 300 of them were
killed."
</P>
<P>
Between March 25 and May 15, 60 containers, each with 240
cluster bombs, were dropped into Yugoslavia, in addition to 40
containers, each with 250 mines, which were dropped in Kosovo, a
Serbian province, he said.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the ground, a BLU-97 mines, contained in a
cluster bomb, can make a crater, 20 cm diameter and 80 cm in
depth.
</P>
<P>
"New casualties and destructions are to be expected from
unexploded bombs. And the future generations are to pay a heavy
toll for the (NATO) use of these special ammunitions," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, under the pretext of curbing what it said the spread of
"humanitarian catastrophe," has in fact created a serious
humanitarian crisis in Yugoslavia by killing a lot of innocent
civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in the Balkan
country, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Ending Sanctions Key to Normal Life in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- It would be impossible to resolve
the humanitarian crisis in Iraq unless sanctions against Baghdad
are lifted, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement issued in response to
Resolution 1242 unanimously adopted by the U.N. Security Council
last Friday that extended the regime of sanctions for another six
months.
</P>
<P>
"Russia sees, of course, all the flaws of the U.N. humanitarian
operation. However, as long as the question of lifting economic
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council remained unsolved,
this operation gives more opportunity to alleviate the suffering
of the Iraqi people," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken within the framework of the humanitarian
program barely ensure the physical survival of the Iraqi people,"
the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only the lifting of sanctions, rather than their extension,
will help overcome the humanitarian, social and economic crisis in
Iraq, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said that Moscow "will continue to
consistently do everything possible to achieve this goal and
create a new mechanism ensuring that Iraq does not rebuild
prohibited weapons."

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Humanitarian Aid for Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will provide
Angola with 10 million euro as humanitarian aid in the coming nine
months, Cons des Rueal, EU's residence representative in Angola
announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He revealed this after meeting with Angolan minister of Social
Relief Albino Malungo and vice minister of Agriculture Zacarias
Sambeni, who discussed the current humanitarian situation in the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be mainly used to help refugees with food they
need, with part of the fund going to rehabilitation of the
facilities damaged in the war, said the EU representative.
</P>
<P>
He also said that two of the eight tons of corn, sugar and
edible oil promised by the EU earlier will soon arrive in Luanda,
the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Owing to escalating conflict in Angola, the number of refugees
has currently increased to 1.7 million. However, the aid provided
by international humanitarian bodies can only satisfy about half
of the need, said Albino Malungo, the social relief minister.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister of Agriculture Zacarias Sambeni also said
that "the food supply situation in the country is expected to
worsen", as many farmers abandoned farming to flee the civil war.
In Huambo and Bie provinces in the central and Malaje Province in
the north, the countries major grain producers, nine out of ten
farmers have even abandoned their homes, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to oust
President Laurent Kabila have claimed to have downed two
Zimbabwean helicopters during their military successes in the
eastern Kasai region and northwestern Katanga province, State-run
radio Rwanda reported Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Rebel sources was quoted as saying that over the week-end,
troops of the main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) shot down two enemy helicopters near Kabinda town, 250 kms
east of the diamond-rich city of Mbuji-Mayi in eastern Kasai.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Zimbabwean soldiers were also captured, radio Rwanda
said, but did not give more details. It has not been confirmed by
the Zimbabwean side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tension has risen in Kisangani, the third largest
city in Congo (K) held by the rebels where violent clashes
occurred between Ugandan troops and Congolese rebels, leaving two
Ugandans dead allegedly and three rebels arrested.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed a march in support of ousted Congolese
rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba that was disbanded by troops
loyal to the new leader, Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
Wamba was removed last week in a RCD session held in Goma town,
near the border with Rwanda, but he refused to give up and says he
is still in charge of the congress. Wamba is backed by Ugandan
troops.

<HEADLINE> UK Home Secretary Outlines Information Bill to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
announced Monday new draft laws to parliament, which promised a
"radical change" in the relationship between the government and
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
"A careful balance has to be struck between extending access to
information and preserving confidentiality where disclosure would
be against the public interest," said Straw.
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow people for the first time to have a right
of access to information held by public bodies, including
government departments, the police, schools, councils, health
authorities and the courts, he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the new plans were weighted "decisively" in favor of
greater opennesss and the government would spend up to 125 million
pounds (199.4 million U.S. dollars) and set up a task force to
implement the provisions.
</P>
<P>
But despite its wide remit, Straw faced accusations of toning
down original plans to open government departments to public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The original White Paper -- "Your Right to Know" -- which set
out plans in December 1997 proposed that all government
information would be available unless it caused "substantial harm"
to the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that definition has now been changed to exclude any
government material likely to "prejudice" the government or
national interests.

<HEADLINE> FAO Warns of Dangerous Legacy of Obsolete Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Like a "time-bomb", huge
stocks of dangerous obsolete and unused pesticides in Africa and
the Near East would pose a threat to humans and the environment
until 2030 if funding for waste disposal remained at today's low
level, a press lease from the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
FAO called upon governments and industry to increase their
efforts and financial support to solve this environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. agency, it is estimated that there are
several hundred thousand tonnes of obsolete pesticide stocks
worldwide, with more than 100,000 tonnes in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimated the amount of pesticide left-overs in Africa
at 20,000 tonnes and the situation was particularly dangerous in
Poland with 65,000 tonnes and the Ukraine with over 23,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
FAO said the lethal legacy of obsolete pesticides stocks
continued to threaten human health and the environment,
particularly in Africa where some stocks were over 30 years old
and could no longer be used because they were banned or they had
deteriorated as a result of prolonged storage.
</P>
<P>
FAO warned that the accumulation of hazardous pesticides in the
environment would continue unabated as the worldwide annual sales
pesticides were still increasing substantially.
</P>
<P>
FAO called upon its members to apply environmentally friendly
Integrated Pest Management methods and to drastically reduce the
use of pesticides, where this was possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO air raids continued over
Saturday and Sunday as its air campaign against Yugoslavia entered
the 62nd day.
</P>
<P>
Late on Saturday and early on Sunday, NATO warplanes fired four
missiles at the village of Ence in Kosovo and dumped over 20
missiles on the village of Petrovo Selo in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO fired seven missiles at Landovica near Prizren in
southwestern Kosovo while the village of Zac was attacked by at
least 10 missiles over two consecutive air raids.

<P>
In eastern Kosovo, NATO warplanes fired 10 missiles against the
village of Velikince near Gnjilane early on Sunday and dropped 13
more missiles over the region of Urosevac later.

<P>
Civilian buildings in the Serbian province of Kosovo were

<P>
Some 70 percent of the Balkan country so far are without

<HEADLINE> Malawi Sets June 15 As New Elections Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's Electoral Commission has
set June 15 as the new date for the country's general elections,
the Pan-African News Agency PANA reported from Blantyre, the
commercial capital of Malawi Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chief elections officer Roosevelt Gondwe was quoted as
disclosing Monday that the commission made the decision at an
emergency meeting Sunday night after parliament directed Friday
that the commission hold the polls not later than June 15.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the Malawi poll has been postponed.
Originally the poll was set for May 17, exactly five years from
the 1994 polls. But that date was put off till May 25 to allow for
more time of preparations.
</P>
<P>
However, Gondwe added that the five-hour meeting rejected
parliament's other order to resume registration in areas where the
registration exercise recorded "glaring anomalies".
</P>
<P>
''It was the collective view of the commission that this would
only cause unnecessary problems,'' Gondwe told PANA. ''We may not
be able to meet the June 15 deadline if we are to reopen some
centers because of logistical problems.''
</P>
<P>
The new date comes after a court action brought by opposition
candidates who cried foul following the chaotic registration
exercise, terming it as ''systematic legal rigging'' in favor of
the ruling United Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
Legal adviser of the main opposition Malawi Congress Party
Louis Chimango said his party has no problems with the new date
''as long as the commission rectifies their mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Constitutes Threat to Europe and World, Yugoslav  Envoy Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Monday reiterated his strong condemnation against the on-going
NATO bombing of his country, saying that "NATO constitutes a
global threat to the peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told the press conference here that "NATO
constitutes a global threat to the peace and stability, not in the
region, but the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
unilaterally took military action against Yugoslavia, flagrantly
violating the U.N. Charter and international law. The on-going
NATO air strikes already triggered strong objection from
international community, such as China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The strong reaction made by Russia, China, India and a number
of African and Latin American countries is the best evidence that
a large part of the international community is more and more
afraid of the future if NATO decides to act on its own, disregard
of the United Nations and international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombed Yugoslavia because "the offensive alliance" sees
Yugoslavia as an obstacle to its expansion, he said, adding that
NATO is imposing "the one-sided American policy against
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
However, the leading NATO countries are still going ahead with
"the illegal military action" without heeding just appeals from
the world community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that they are decided to step up activities in
the war, and they are less interest in peace efforts, although
they sometimes say something 'nice' about peace efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the group of eight, including seven major
Western countries and Russia, is "the basis for future dialogue"
on a political settlement to Kosovo crisis, he said. The
statement, issued about two weeks ago in Germany, said that any
international military presence in Yugoslavia should be approved
by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade "has done a lot of work" to seek a political solution
"in the shadow of the intensified NATO bombing," he said, "We
respect all peace initiatives from various countries."
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. role in the peace process, he said that "the future
U.N. resolution should show respect for the national interest,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia."

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- the Ethiopian army
"successfully repelled the attack" by four Eritrean brigades at
the western front near Mereb river on Saturday and Sunday,
Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the office of the Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson said beginning Saturday, four Eritrean
brigades attacked Ethiopian army positions for two days running at
the western front near Mereb river.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that more than 400 Eritrean soldiers were
killed and 1,500 wounded.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, it said, "the Ethiopian air force played a
major role, causing heavy losses to the Eritreans."
</P>
<P>
However, the two-day fighting hasn't been confirmed by the
Eritrean side.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
have called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to immediately end their
over one-year border conflict and implement the 11-point OAU
framework agreement.

<HEADLINE> Two-Thirds Majority Possible for S. Africa's ANC: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African National
Congress (ANC) appears to be heading for a two-thirds majority and
is likely to capture at least eight of the nine provinces in the
general elections in South Africa, the latest opinion poll
revealed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey named Election 99 found that a low voter turnout on
election day (73 percent), which falls on June 2, could result in
the ANC receiving as much as 69 percent of the vote, while a
98-percent turnout could leave it with 66 percent support.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the Western Cape was the only hotly
contested province, with the leadership battle between the ANC and
the New National Party (NNP).
</P>
<P>
An earlier survey in April showed that 65 percent of registered
voters indicated that they intended voting for the ANC in the
national poll, compared with seven percent for the Democratic
Party (DP), six percent for the NNP, three percent for the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP), and two percent for the United Democratic
Movement (UDM).
</P>
<P>
Support for the African Christian Democratic Party, the Freedom
Front (FF), the United Christian Democratic Party, the Pan
Africanist Congress (PAC), and the Federal Alliance, were all at
one percent, or slightly below.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of the electorate was still undecided.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted on a representative sample of 3,384
individuals older than 18 between April 6 and April 30, had a
margin of error of between 0.75 and 1.65 percent.

<HEADLINE> Greece Imposes Ban on Import of Plastic Toys Made of PVC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Monday imposed a ban on
the import and trade of soft plastic toys made of polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), extending an earlier ban on the sale of PVC toys
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Health and Development Ministries said in a statement
that the ban would apply to the importation of all toys
manufactured for children made of PVC, any PVC-based toys which
can be swallowed or put in children's mouths and PVC-based toys
designed for infants, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government banned the sale in the country of toys
made from PVC in January, a decision that was greeted by the
environmental group Greenpeace as paving the way for a Europe-wide
ban.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken because the toxic phthalic compounds
used in PVC products are believed to cause serious liver and
kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
Existing stocks of the products in question were withdrawn from
retail outlets in January. As of June 30, any trading in them will
be completely prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said in a study last June that toys circulating on
the Greek market contained levels of toxic substances ranging from
20 to 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Electoral Officers Foresee Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Officers of the Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) were confident on Monday that the
second democratic elections in South Africa would not experience
serious security problems.
</P>
<P>
A total of 85,000 soldiers and police would be deployed to
secure the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
"We can proudly tell the people of South Africa that they are
assured of accessing their voting stations," deputy chief
electoral officer Glen Mashinini told a news briefing in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini said almost 40 percent of voting points would not
need significant protection.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini warned that it would serve no purpose for a political
party to breach the electoral code of conduct on election day.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief electoral officer Norman du Plessis said the IEC
had made proper preparations for the poll.
</P>
<P>
"We have done good planning. Things are broadly in shape, and I
don't foresee any major problems."
</P>
<P>
A vast infrastructure -- from gas lamps for remote areas to a
high-tech information system -- had been set up to ensure a smooth
election. More than 260,000 people would be doing election duty on
June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini said the IEC's sophisticated information technology
was second to none, and would make it possible to transmit
information from all 450 municipal offices selected to receive
results from voting districts.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to announce the final result within seven
days as required," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 24 (Xinhua) - Alliance &AMP; Leicester and bank of
Ireland announced Monday that they are in talks over a 11bn pounds
merger.
</P>
<P>
The combination would create Ireland's largest bank and the
eighth biggest in Britain. The two partners estimate that the
merger will generate annual cost savings of 200m pounds.
</P>
<P>
If the merger approved by regulators, Bank of Ireland will be
the dominant partner in the group, owning 55 percent of the merged
entity.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the two banks would carry separate listings in
Dublin and London. It will be the first time that a British bank
merged with a bank in Europe's single currency zone.
</P>
<P>
Consolidation in the banking sector all over the world is being
driven by intense competition on both the mortgage and savings
side, which is being amplified by low interest rates.

<P>
News that Alliance &AMP; Leicester and Bank of Ireland were in

But eventually the index ended the day down 31 points, or 0.5
percent, at 6322.1, having spent much of the session up more than
1.5 percent.
</P>

Most of the selling pressure built up toward the end of the
session as sentiment took a knock from a weak opening on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
However, Alliance shares ended on the day off their earlier
highs but still up almost 6.7 percent. Bank of Ireland ended up
almost 4 percent at 1275 pence in London.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Dismisses Gaddafi's Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Deputy Foreign
Minister, Aziz Pahad, Monday shrugged off news reports that Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi personally ordered the Lockerbie bombing in
1988, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
There are reports claiming that Gaddafi personally ordered the
bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in Scotland in revenge
for an air raid on Tripoli by the United States two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new to the speculation, which has been going
on for ten years, and this is precisely why (South African)
President Nelson Mandela and others have spent so much time and
energy to ensure that the matter is put to rest by ensuring that
the trial (of the two men suspected of the bombing) takes place in
a third and neutral country," Pahad said in Sirte, some 450
kilometers from Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Pahad is with a high-profile South African trade delegation
currently in Libya.
</P>
<P>
A deal whereby Libya would set aside an allocation of foreign
reserves to pay for work done by South African companies is being
negotiated by senior government officials from the two countries,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Politically South Africa is on good terms with Libya, largely
as a result of Mandela's intervention in the Lockerbie dispute,
which saw UN sanctions against Tripoli being suspended after Libya
handed over two men suspected of the attack to stand trial in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The big prize for South Africa firms would be a stake in
Libya's lucrative oil or petrochemical industries which have
stagnated over recent years, as a result of UN sanctions which
meant modern equipment could not be imported.

WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
indicated that the settlement of Middle East peace process should
be pushed forward on a basis of the U.N. resolutions 242 and 338,
but not the U.N. resolution 181 approved in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for Middle East peace talks,
said at a pro-Israeli lobby group, the American Israeli Public
Affairs Committee, that when negotiations resume between Israel
and the Palestinians the terms of reference must not change.
</P>
<P>
"That means recognizing what the terms of reference are," he
said. "The terms of reference, as defined in Madrid and Oslo, are
242 and 338 and 'land for peace.' Any other basis is not relevant
and is not appropriate and we will say so."
</P>
<P>
"Any other basis is not relevant" was obviously referring to
resolution 181.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution 181, which divided Palestine into an Arab
state and a Jewish state far smaller than modern Israel, Israel
would transfer larger parts of what it has gained through wars
with the Arab states since it establishment in 1948 than U.N.
resolutions 242 and 338 require, which called Israel to concede
territory captured in the 1967 war in exchange for secure borders.
</P>
<P>
"Land for peace" means Israel gives back territory in
exchange for peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ross who is expected to go to the Middle East once
newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak forms a coalition
government, said peace was possible if both sides realize they
have a common stake.
</P>
<P>
Ross said negotiations would take times and would be difficult
because leaders on both sides did not want to make a "historic
mistake" or give away too much.
</P>
<P>
The United States said it wants the Israelis and Palestinians
to start talks again as soon as possible after Barak forms a
government and to aim to finish within a year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have stressed that all the U.N. resolutions
should be considered in the peacemaking in the area.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top
negotiator, said in the region on Monday that U.N. resolutions
242 and 338 still applies, but "this should not undermine 181,
especially in provisions calling for a two-state solution."

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates in U.S. Treasury Securities Drop Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Interest rates on
short-term Treasury securities fell in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department sold 7.5 billion dollars in three-month
bills at a discount rate of 4.495 percent, down from 4.570 percent
last week. An additional 7.5 billion dollars was sold in six-month
bills at a rate of 4.570 percent, also down from 4.630 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both three-month rate and six-month rate was the lowest since
May 10.
</P>
<P>
The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors -- 4.621 percent for three-month bills, with a
10,000-dollar bill selling for 9,886.40 dollars, and 4.756 percent
for a six-month bill selling for 9,767.70 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average
yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.89 percent
last week from 4.79 percent the previous week.

<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Monday called on its 16 members to come up
with measures to deal with the recent military coups in Niger and
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate was speaking at an
emergency meeting of west African foreign ministers which started
Monday in Lome, capital Togo, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
He told the opening session that "it is time to bring an end to
coups which only tarnish the image of our sub-region," adding that
he would like to see sanctions imposed on the new rulers in Bissau
and Niger to give credibility to efforts to foster constitutional
rule in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Niger's President Ibrahim Bare Mainsasara was killed by members
of his presidential guard at the start of a coup last month while
rebels in Guinea Bissau toppled President Joao Bernardo Vieira
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a cease-fire in Sierra Leone's civil war reached
last week came into force on Monday as ECOWAS foreign ministers
met in Togo to help rivals in the country start peace talks
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers meeting was designed to set the stage for
the peace talks, and endorse the on-going mediation by Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also aimed at setting the framework for
international assistance in the implementation of a subsequent
comprehensive agreement, notably in terms of truce monitoring,
humanitarian assistance and disarmament of combatants.
</P>
<P>
Senior envoys of Ahmad T. Kabbah's government led by
Attorney-General and Justice Minister Solomon Berewa have arrived
in Lome for the peace talks with the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The RUF will send about seven top officials with Solomon
Rogers, chairman of its war council, sitting in at the peace
talks, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. monitors have already started arriving in Sierra Leone to
observe the provisional cease-fire and the world body is expected
to deploy a larger observer force when a substantive agreement is
reached.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Electoral Officers Foresee Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Officers of the Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) were confident on Monday that the
second democratic elections in South Africa would not experience
serious security problems.
</P>
<P>
A total of 85,000 soldiers and police would be deployed to
secure the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
"We can proudly tell the people of South Africa that they are
assured of accessing their voting stations," deputy chief
electoral officer Glen Mashinini told a news briefing in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini said almost 40 percent of voting points would not
need significant protection.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini warned that it would serve no purpose for a political
party to breach the electoral code of conduct on election day.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief electoral officer Norman du Plessis said the IEC
had made proper preparations for the poll.
</P>
<P>
"We have done good planning. Things are broadly in shape, and I
don't foresee any major problems."
</P>
<P>
A vast infrastructure -- from gas lamps for remote areas to a
high-tech information system -- had been set up to ensure a smooth
election. More than 260,000 people would be doing election duty on
June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mashinini said the IEC's sophisticated information technology
was second to none, and would make it possible to transmit
information from all 450 municipal offices selected to receive
results from voting districts.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to announce the final result within seven
days as required," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Groundless: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The charge of the Cox Report that
China has threatened the national security of the United States by
stealing its military technology is groundless and with ulterior
motives.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao when asked to comment on a report released
today by a special committee of the U.S. House of Representatives
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox from California on China's so-
called spying on U.S. military technology.
</P>
<P>
"This sensational allegations are absurd," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We must point out that the Chinese people cherish the
sovereignty and security of their country." Zhu said. "History has
shown and will continue to show that the Chinese people are able
to safeguard their country's security by completely relying on
their own wisdom and strength."
</P>
<P>
Chinese people love peace and China has always pursued the
diplomatic policy of independence and peace. Therefore, the
country has never and will not threaten any other country, Zhu
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the anti-China forces in the United States,
who adopt a hostile attitude to and prejudice against China, go
against the trend of history and tightly embrace a Cold War
mentality.
</P>
<P>
"By issuing the Cox report, they have stage an anti-China farce
in order to spread the theory of a China threat and damage the
friendly ties between the peoples of China and the United States,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released soon after the U.S.-led NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, was strongly condemned
by the Chinese government and Chinese people, as well as the
international community, and is aimed at instigating anti-China
sentiment and diverting people's attention.
</P>
<P>
"This fully exposes the vicious intentions and political plot
of the anti-China congressmen in the United States," Zhu said. "
However, the nasty tricks that have been played by them for many
years will be doomed to failure again."

<HEADLINE> Russia Raps at NATO Attacks on Belgrade Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia slammed NATO's May 19
strikes on a Belgrade hospital as "criminal actions," and called
on the NATO leadership and its members to "proceed seriously to
political negotiations with the objective of settling the Kosovo
problem."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which is
being distributed here Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said,
"The Russian Federation once again firmly condemns the criminal
actions by the aircraft of the alliance."
</P>
<P>
"The terrible consequences of bomb strikes for the civilian
population of Yugoslavia have now become a daily reality," the
letter said. "The raid on the hospital in Belgrade is a heinous
violation of the Geneva Conventions on the Protection of War
Victims."
</P>
<P>
"In protesting against these actions, we once again call on the
NATO leadership and member countries of the alliance to reconsider
and to proceed seriously to political negotiations with the
objective of settling the Kosovo problem," the letter said, "We
are convinced that there is no other course, and the NATO
strategists should be clearly aware of it."
</P>
<P>
On the night of May 19 (local time), NATO raided the largest
hospital in Belgrade in what is the most intensive offensive by
NATO against Belgrade over the recent period. The neurosurgery
department of the "Dragisa Misovic" hospital and Gynaecological
departments were severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was among 30 hospitals bombed by NATO since the
March 24 start of the air strikes, which was staged without the
authorization of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russia, together with China, has been firmly against NATO's
unilateral use of force against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the U.N. family, saying the military move
has flagrantly violated the U.N. Charter and international law.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Panda Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a large theme
park for its national treasure, the Giant Panda, in the
southwestern province of Sichuan, the home of the rare animal,
local authorities announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Giant Panda World Theme Park in the suburbs
of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, is expected to begin early next
year at an estimated cost of between 600 and 700 million yuan (
about 80 million U.S. dollars), said a source with the Sichuan
Provincial Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
The park will be built on the basis of the Chengdu Giant Panda
Breeding &AMP; Research Base, and an additional 100,000 square meters
of bamboo forest will be planted around the park to feed the
pandas.
</P>
<P>
Native only to China, there are now only about 1,000 Giant
Pandas remaining in the wild, and more than 80 percent of them
live in Sichuan. China's National Tourism Administration has
selected the Giant Panda as one of three themes for China tourism
in the next century, along with the Great Wall and the Terra-cotta
warriors in Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Date Fixed for Charges in Bangladesh Killing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Trial Court of Bangladesh on
Tuesday fixed June 13 for framing charges against the 21 accused
in the November 3, 1975, jail killing case.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Sessions Judge Sheikh Rezwan Ali fixed the date
after a brief hearing of the views of both the prosecution and the
defense counsels, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Former acting President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Prime
Ministers Tajuddin Ahmed and M. Mansur Ali, and former minister
A.H.M. Quamaruzzaman, who were jailed after the assassination of
the then President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family
members in August 1975, were killed in the Dhaka Central Jail in
November the same year.
</P>
<P>
They were top aides of Mujibur Rahman, the first prime minister
of independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the date for framing charges against the
accused had been deferred twice following petitions moved by the
defense counsels for some of the accused.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka District and Sessions Judge Court in November last
year gave death sentences to 15 of the 19 persons accused in the
killing case of Mujibur Rahman, father of incumbent Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
No action was taken against those allegedly involved in the
killing cases before the Hasina-led Awami League came to power in
June 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The first group of about 2,500
Namibian refugees have begun returning home from Botswana after
the signing of an agreement Monday, which granted them exemption
from prosecution, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite agreement was signed by Namibian Home Affairs

Citing fears of prosecution, the refugees fled the northeast
Namibian province of Caprivi and sought asylum in Botswana since
October last year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives all returning refugees a general amnesty.
</P>
<P>
It states the refugees are free to return to their homes
without any fear of being subjected to arrest, persecution,
detention, imprisonment, persecution, harassment, or any other
penal or administrative procedure for having left as refugees.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment In Shanghai Pudong New Area Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Pudong New Area added
158 more overseas-funded projects during the January-April period
this year, bringing the total number to 5,630 since the area was
opened nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
This year's new projects cost a total of 500 million U.S.
dollars and have used 370 million dollars of contractual overseas

</P>
<P>
Seven new projects are each using at least 10 million dollars

including environmental protection, telecommunications, and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The service sector and projects involving real estate
management, software development, and consultations also are

Kong-funded projects reached 24 during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the Pudong New Area had used more than 10.

<HEADLINE> Proposals for GDE Financial Restructuring Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong provincial
government presented here Tuesday proposals for the financial
restructuring of its Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Limited,
Guangdong Investments Limited, Guangnan Holdings Limited and Nam
Yue (Group) Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, presented to the companies' creditors, provide
for "separate but interrelated" restructuring for each of the
Guangdong Investment (GDI) Group, the Guangdong Enterprises (GDE)
Group and Guangnan Holdings Limited (Guangnan).
</P>
<P>
The proposed restructuring plans are intended to be fair to all
stockholders and result in a commercially viable and financially
independent GDE Group, GDI Group and Guangnan, according to
Guangdong provincial government representatives.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposals, the Guangdong provincial government
will create a new, Hong Kong-registered subsidiary called "New GDE
" and transfer the shares of the existing GDE (Old GDE) to the New
GDE.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of debt is outstanding
and needs to be rescheduled for GDI.
</P>
<P>
The GDI plan calls for the Guangdong government to inject the
highly cash flow generatives Dongshen Water Business into GDI and
for the existing GDI debt to be rescheduled, thus returning GDI to
financial health.
</P>
<P>
The Dongshen Water project supplies Hong Kong with
approximately 75 percent of the water it consumes annually.
</P>
<P>
As consideration, the government would receive from GDI newly
issued debt and shares and other assets.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qishan, vice governor of the Guangdong provincial
government, said the people of Guangdong Province have offered the
highest quality asset in order to save the group.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government has taken the unusual step of
contributing cash over the last several months to enable the GDE
group to continue to pay interest to its creditors while the
restructuring proposal was being prepared, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the GDE restructuring, which involves 3.9 billion U.S.
dollars of debts, the government would contribute its newly
acquired high quality GDI debt to GDE.
</P>
<P>
GDE creditors will exchange their loans, notes and other claims
for GEI debt and newly issued GDE preference shares, leaving DGE
nearly debt-free.
</P>
<P>
Nam Yue will be acquired by GDE for nominal consideration and
Nam Yue's debt will be restructured as part of the overall
restructuring of GDE. Each Nam Yue creditor will be treated as a
GDE creditor.
</P>
<P>
Under the Guangnan restructuring, Guangnan would be
recapitalized through a rights offering, underwritten by the
Guangdong government, and an exchange of existing debt and other
claims for cash and a mix of new debt securities issued by the
Guangnan companies.
</P>
<P>
Wang told creditors that the Guangdong provincial government
would share equally the economic pain of restructuring in order to
ensure that the GDE group is successfully restructured.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the government decided to save the GDE from
bankruptcy by financial restructuring, Wang said the government
regards this issue as one beyond mere economic consideration.
</P>
<P>
If the GDE was liquidated, the liquidation rate could be only
25 percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the GDE has contributed a lot to Guangdong Province
during its reform and opening-up process in the past decades and
the restructuring of the group will help stabilize the Hong Kong
market and contribute to its prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will also seek a new way for the management
and supervision of state-owned enterprises operating abroad, Wang
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here Tuesday
to launch the first 100 volumes of books on outstanding thinkers
in China.
</P>
<P>
Published by the Nanjing Publishing House, a total of 200
volumes with about 60 million Chinese characters were written and
compiled by the late Professor Kuang Yaming, well-known educator
and former honorary president of Nanjing University.
</P>
<P>
The other 100 volumes of books are scheduled to be published in
2003.
</P>
<P>
The books give a scientific evaluation of more than 270 Chinese
thinkers during China's long history of 2,500 years, ranging from
Confucius (551 B.C.- 479 B.C.) to Dr. Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925),
forerunner of the Chinese revolution. They also record their
positive contributions to the society in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the books is described as a major event in
China's academic and publishing sectors and the largest research
project on traditional ideology and culture that China has
undertaken in the century.
</P>
<P>
Among those present on the occasion were Wang Fengchao, deputy
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch; Chen Wenbo,
China's assistant minister of education; and representatives from

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Unveils Foundation of Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Tuesday unveiled the plaque of a 360-megawatt land-based
power plant, the biggest in the country's private sector, at
Haripur of the southeastern district of Narayanganj, the news
agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
The 200 million U.S. dollar plant is being constructed by the
AES Corporation of the United States and is expected to be
commissioned in 2001.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest foreign investment in the power sector in
Bangladesh, Hasina was quoted as saying at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, our government has been giving more
importance on foreign investment instead of foreign assistance and
grants," she said, adding that over-dependence on donors coupled
with lack of financing in the past caused obstacles in building
new plants and transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted the policy of privatizing the power
sector, she stated. "Being attracted by the policy, many reputed
local and foreign entrepreneurs have come forward to invest in the
power sector."
</P>
<P>
At present, only about 15 percent of the total population in
this South Asian country has access to electricity. The present
capacity of the Power Development Board with 52 generation units
under 18 power stations is between 2,000 and 2,100 megawatts,
whereas the country's total need is about 2,300 megawatts.

ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi stocks closed lower
Tuesday owing to profit booking by short-term investors who
dealers said feared that after May 28 the present buying sentiment
would halt.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100-index closed 24.64 points,
or 1.74 percent lower, at 1,391.98 against Monday's close of
1,416.62 where the market crossed the 1,400-point barrier due to
heavy buying.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of trade on Tuesday stood at 290.059 million
shares, setting a record in the history of KSE trading. On Monday,
the trade volume was 248.161 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was created on July 23, 1997, when 279.04
million shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
"There was no negative news in the market. It was just
retracting of the market as it was technically overbought and
needed a correction," said Shahid Rajwani, a dealer with
Prudential Securities Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"If the present (trend) continues on Wednesday, then there is a
likelihood that a technical panic might come triggering heavy
selling which would be difficult to control," Rajwani said.

China Expresses Strong Displeasure at Ship Sunk by Filipino
Warship: FM Spokesman
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is blamed for violating Chinese sovereignty
after its warship sank a Chinese vessel in Chinese waters, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in response to a question about his comment
on the recent ship sinking incident at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Anti-China Moves Doomed to Fail: FM Spokesman
</P>
<P>
The attempt to stir up feelings about "China threat" and anti-
China sentiment is doomed to fail, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao reiterated here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about Cox's report on the so-called
espionage case, Zhu said at a regular press conference that this
was merely a fallacy dreamed up by a few people in the United
States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt to stir up
anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are sticking to the Cold War mentality and are
making a great effort to dream up stories about China's spying on
U.S. nuclear technology, he said. Their despicable attempt is
doomed to fail, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
China Firmly Opposes Introduction of Tian'anmen Resolution: FM
</P>
<P>
China strongly resents and firmly opposes the so-called
resolution "marking the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen incident"
introduced by a few U.S. congressmen, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said at a regular press conference that the so-called
resolution, recently introduced by a few U.S. congressmen, has
wantonly distorted facts about China's human rights conditions. By
making irresponsible remarks on China's internal affairs, they
have fully revealed their anti-China political face, he said.
</P>
<P>
FM Spokesman Urges Japan to Follow Path of Peaceful Development
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao today reiterated China's
concern about the approval of the new Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines by Japan's House of Councilors.
</P>
<P>
China urged Japan to honor its solemn commitments of not
becoming a military power and of following the path of peaceful
development, Zhu said at a regular press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China is gravely concerned about Japan's act of going against
the historical trend and its insistence on strengthening Japan-U.S.
military cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese And Pakistani Military Officers Hold Talks
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, the chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), in a meeting with Pervez Musharaf, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and chief of Army
Staff of Pakistan here today, said that the countries of South
Asia should peacefully settle any conflicts and problems through
patient and candid dialogue.
</P>
<P>
South Asia is an important part of Asia, he said, and the
stability and development of the region is closely connected to
that of the whole continent and the Chinese government greatly
appreciates Pakistan's efforts to improve relations with its
neighbor India.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Official Says Japan Should Maintain Only Defence Policy
</P>
<P>
A leading National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee
official said here today that Japan should adhere to its Peace
Constitution and maintain a defence-only policy.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after the Japanese Senate passed
new Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines. Its House of
Representatives had already approved the documents.
</P>
<P>
Japan should continue on the path of peaceful development and
implement its own commitments, he said, calling the increased
Japan-U.S. military cooperation and expanded military role in the
Asia-Pacific region a serious step, one that worries the Chinese
and countries and regions in other parts of Asia and makes them
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Kyrgyzstan FM

</P>
<P>
He said the relations between the two countries, which share a
common border of more than 1,000 kilometers, have been developing

situation, ethnic integrity, and economic development of the
country have deeply impressed him.

Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anti-corruption Drive Hits High-ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of high-ranking officials
in the previous Lebanese governments have been hit in a massive
anti-corruption drive since President Emile Lahoud took office
last November.
</P>
<P>
The first victim of the drive was the former Oil Minister
Shahe Barsoumian who was accused of approving illicit oil deal in
return for bribes during his three-year tenure that ended last
November.
</P>
<P>
The shady fuel deal was reported to have wasted public funds
which totaled 800 million U.S. dollars .
</P>
<P>
Barsoumian is the first ex-minister to be charged on
embezzlement of public funds in the history of Lebanon since the
country attained independence from France in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Barsoumian is currently incarcerated in Beirut's main Roumieh
prison, east of Beirut, along with eight others involved in
the case, for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The fuel case was followed by the opening of another file
concerning ex-chief of Lebanon's Antiquities Department Camille
Asmar who has been arrested for an inquiry into an alleged
waste of 3.3 million dollars in public funds.
</P>
<P>
Asmar, who served the department for 36 uninterrupted years
that included the 1975-1990 civil war period, became the second
highest ranking Lebanese official to be arrested on a corruption
charge after the ex-oil minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Asmar, his son and three other department
officials were also detained in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three former cabinet ministers under billionaire
ex-Premier Rafik Hariri were implicated in the alleged
mismanagement of funds belonging to the country's municipalities
and were ordered to give testimony to the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are former Minister of State for Financial
Affairs Fuad Sinyoura, former Minister of Rural and Municipal
Affairs Hagop Demirjian, and his successor Bassem Al-Sabaa, who
was also Hariri's information minister.
</P>
<P>
The latter two are members of the current parliament and thus
no legal procedures can be taken against them before the
legislature waives their parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
Another high-ranking official under the previous government to
be indicted in the anti-corruption campaign is Lebanon's former
Mount Lebanon Province governor Sohail Yamout.
</P>
<P>
The State Prosecutor for Financial Fraud Ahmad Taqieddine
accused Yamout of embezzling municipal funds through the payment
of forged and fictitious bills.
</P>
<P>
Yamout is currently in Sao Paolo in Brazil to oversee a Hariri
real estate venture and refused to return for appearing in the
court on the ground that he is sick. The judicial authorities has
issued a search warrant for him.
</P>
<P>
Former Beirut Port director-general Mouhib Itani was also
placed in custody for allegedly stealing equipment belonging to a
British construction company while the former head of the
National Bureau of Medicines Qassem Hamade was arrested on
suspicion of pocketing 260,000 dollars in public funds.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects are allies of Hariri who left office last
December after six years in office.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Hariri politicians dismessed the anti-corruption drive as a
politically-motivated campaign aimed at discrediting the Hariri
era and its accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
But, the current government of Salim Hoss blamed the country's
financial strains on corruption and wasteful spending that have
chronically plagued Lebanese administrations.
</P>
<P>
The president said in his oath-taking speech last November
that one of his goals was to combat corruption and waste of
public funds, adding "he who is caught stealing public funds will
have his hand chopped off and will be forced to return them.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the law would be applied on all equally, and
himself before all others, saying the drive would be carried out
to the end.

S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and
expressed his thanks for the just stand and valuable support given
to China by Cote d'Ivoire and other peace-loving countries.
</P>
<P>
Brou called Hu's visit to Cote d'Ivoire a success which has
pushed forward bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The government and people of Cote d'Ivoire were greatly shocked
by the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Brou said,
adding that President Henri Konan Bedie has asked him to convey
the sympathy and support of Cote d'Ivoire's people.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Since a 100-ton garbage-disposal
vessel was putting in use on the International environment Day
last year on the port of Yichang, the ship has collected 120 tons
of rubbish on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Many more such vessels now have appeared in the valleys of the
Yangtze River and Taihu Lake, where some places are also salvaging
plastic objects abandoned by passengers on the water.
</P>
<P>
Most residents along the river and lake attribute the improved
local environment to transportation department's efforts to
intensify control over garbage in the water.
</P>
<P>
In addition to using the vessels, shipping companies and port
administrative bureaus also employ environment supervisors to
prompt ship crews to abide by related regulations, according to an
official with an environmental protection committee under the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
 They also have asked for an end to the use of plastic food

<HEADLINE> WHO Vows to Eliminate Iodine Deficiency Disorder Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Tuesday reaffirmed the determination to eliminate Iodine
Deficiency Disorders (IDD) through an intense program of salt
iodization and iodine delivery within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"When elimination of the IDD is achieved it will be a major and
total public health triumph, ranking with small pox and
poliomyelitis," said WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland at
the 52nd World Health Assembly ending here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iodine Deficiency Disorders causes brain disorders, cretinism,
miscarriages and goiter. It is the leading but preventable cause
of mental retardation. One-third of the world's population is
estimated to be at risk of the IDD.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed Tuesday at the World Health Assembly,
WHO members called on the director-general to "mobilize, and
collaborate with, international and bilateral development agencies,
non-governmental organizations, and the private sector in support
of the efficient and effective iodization of salt by both large-
and small-scale salt producers".
</P>
<P>
The resolution also recommended that WHO provide technical
support to member states to establish and strengthen systems for
monitoring the iodine status of their populations and the quality
of iodized salt, to identify the required financial and technical
resources for this purpose, and to support members in developing
links with the salt industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the director-general is to report
to the health assembly by 2005 on progress achieved in eliminating
iodine deficiency disorders.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1998, as a result of WHO's work, the number of
countries with salt iodization programs increased from 46 to 93.
Two-thirds of households living in IDD-affected countries now have
access to iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the goal of eradicating the IDD within the
next decade, WHO plans to support countries to ensure that salt is
iodized to the correct levels, and it will continue to disseminate
its technical findings concerning appropriate indicators for
monitoring and evaluating programs for IDD control.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, WHO will reinforce its partnership with the
salt industry, whose role is crucial in winning the battle against
the IDD.
</P>
<P>
WHO will also continue to collaborate with the United Nations
Children's Fund and the International Council for Control of
Iodine Deficiency Disorders.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Better Life in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
called on here Tuesday African countries to draw out the best ways
of giving their continent the hope for a better life in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally to mark the 36th anniversary of African
Freedom Day, Chiluba said that "Africa must change for the better
and its our responsibility to change it and make it better."
</P>
<P>
He said Africa today faces so many political conflicts, social
displacements and economic disruptions. The image of Africa to the
international community is dented, while its peace and stability
are threatened, he added.
</P>
<P>
" We should not allow that. It is primarily our task as
Africans, to sit together, dialog and find solutions to our
problems," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called for new impetus to the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) by making practical reality of African pledges to
strengthen the OAU, so that it becomes a viable instrument for
addressing the continent's problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the strengthening of the regional economic groupings
such as the Southern African Development Community and the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa is very important in laying
a solid foundation for the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said their aim should eventually be, to free Africa
from the grip of poverty and backwardness and to be an equal
participant in international economic relations.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of Pan-Africanism, solidarity and cooperation that
has inspired us since 1963 will continue to unite us towards
achieving our noble goals,"

he said.

<HEADLINE> Gandhi Distances Herself From Prime Ministerial Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, who withdrew her
resignation as Congress party president Monday evening, distanced
herself from the prime ministerial race here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the All-India Congress
Committee (AICC) of more than 1,400 delegates from all parts of
the country, Gandhi said Congress MPs will choose their leader
after the elections.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the prime minister's post is concerned, as always,
the Congress MPs will choose their leader after the elections,"
she said in her 15-minute emotional speech at the AICC meeting,
which was specially convened to express "deep gratitude" to her
for withdrawing her resignation.
</P>
<P>
Gandhi tendered her resignation as the party chief on May 17
after three senior party leaders, who were expelled later,
questioned her foreign origin.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-one years ago India accepted me when I became Indira
Gandhi's daughter-in-law. This country is in her every moment of
life. I married here, I became a mother here and I became a widow
in front of your eyes," Gandhi said. Gandhi was born in Italy, yet
she became an Indian after she married former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the just expelled three Congress leaders --
Sharad Pawar, P.A. Sangma and Tariq Anwar, Gandhi said these were
the people who came to her one year ago to request her to save the
Congress and have now joined the very forces that she fought by
entering politics.
</P>
<P>
"They want to sow the seeds of disbelief about my patriotism in
the minds of people and are hand in glove with those forces," she
further said.

<HEADLINE> New Expressway Completed in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A 44-kilometer-long expressway was
completed today in Shenzhen, a booming special economic zone in
south China's Guangdong Province, and will soon open to traffic.
</P>
<P>
The expressway, linking the Shenzhen Huangtian International
Airport in the west to the Yantian International Container
Shipment Port in the east, is the first expressway successfully
built by China in a hilly region.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities say the six-lane highway will further
facilitate cargo transportation through Shenzhen, thus playing a
vital role in the economic growth in Shenzhen and its neighboring
regions, including Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Related departments in Guangdong also praised the expressway as
the "Number One Highway of Guangdong" in terms of quality.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the expressway once suffered from a lack of
funds, and its builders managed to issue H shares in Hong Kong,
raising a total of 1.9 billion yuan (about 230 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Philippine Airlines Will Keep on Flying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Tuesday that Philippine Airlines (PAL) will continue to be in
business as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that the government is not likely to give
PAL Chairman Lucio Tan an extension of the June 4 deadline to
infuse fresh capital into the ailing flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is
not inclined to grant Tan's request for a one-month extension of
the deadline because other investors are waiting and willing to
pour money into PAL to keep it operational.
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to him (Tan) yesterday and he did not ask for an
extension. Even if he asks for it I don't think we will give him
an extension," the president said at a press conference here
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that "PAL will keep on flying as long as
I am president."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Tan cannot expect an extension of the next
Friday's deadline to raise the balance of the 200 million U.S.
dollars required by the SEC because the government is ready to
entertain the proposals of several investors, including two from
the Middle East and one from Singapore, to continue the airline's
operations.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has required the PAL management to produce 200 million
dollars in additional capital to be able to secure approval for
its rehabilitation plan and save the company from closure.
</P>
<P>
Tan has already placed in escrow 100 million dollars of the
capital needed for PAL. He had said earlier that he will form an
investors' group to raise the remaining 100 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Cote d'Ivoire Guests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, told President of the
National Assembly of Cote d'Ivoire Emile Brou that political
stability is the basis for economic development, and the healthy
growth of Cote d'Ivoire's economy can be attributed to its stable
political situation.
</P>
<P>
Brou and a delegation of Cote d'Ivoire's National Assembly
members are now on an official visit to China as guests of Li, who
met the delegation at the Great Hall of the People here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Brou agreed with Li's views on the relationship between
stability and development, and told his host that his country has
been engaged in opening up and developing friendly relations with
other countries since gaining independence.
</P>
<P>
He said the composition of his delegation, including three vice-
presidents and representatives of major political parties,
demonstrates the importance that Cote d'Ivoire attaches to
developing ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Li said he considers that bilateral relations have enjoyed
sound and steady growth, with enhanced cooperation in all fields
and more frequent high-level reciprocal visits since the formation
of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Li said he still remembers his visit to Cote d'Ivoire in 1986
when he was still the vice-premier. "The visit made a deep
impression thanks to the warm and friendly reception given by your
government and people," he added.

Geographically far apart, China and Cote d'Ivoire, both
developing countries, nevertheless share similar or identical
views on many issues, Li said, adding that he believes Brou's
visit will further expand existing friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Cote d'Ivoire's president, government, and
parliament, Brou extended their support and sympathy to China for
the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Li extended China's gratitude for this support, and said he
considers the incident a disaster for China. "However, it gave a
lesson to the Chinese people, generating their patriotic
enthusiasm," he said. And it also made the Chinese people
understand the vanity of liberty, democracy, and human rights as
something the U.S. flaunted, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are determined and confident to go along
the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and now more
deeply understand the value of state sovereignty, independence,
and national dignity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Brou said that human rights should be respected. However, one
country should not impose its own concept of human rights on other
countries by the use of its power.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's People's Congress system.

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Chemical company of the
United States has pledged to develop new businesses in China and
has great confidence in the China market, in spite of the current
economic difficulties in Asia.
</P>
<P>
So said Dr. Michael Lung, president of the Dow Chemical Pacific
Ltd. at a ceremony marking the opening of a Dow-funded joint
venture in Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Dow has funded 49 percent of the Shenzhen Sino-American OCT
International Trading Company, which has registered capital of 12
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the joint venture marks a significant step in
the development of Dow's China operations, said Lung, adding that
the joint venture is expected to help Dow expand market channels
and distribution networks in China.
</P>
<P>
It is also important to China, as it provides Chinese companies
with an alternative source of raw materials and avenues for
exports, added Lung.
</P>
<P>
Dow is now developing a world-class integrated ethylene plant
in collaboration with China National Petrochemical Corp. in
Tianjin in north China. The first phase of this project alone will
include an ethylene facility and over 10 downstream derivative
plants.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility studies for the project have been completed and
the proposal will be submitted to the State Council very soon.
</P>
<P>
Dow now does more than 700 million U.S. dollars of business
annually in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan regions.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Summit Ends With Determination for Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the 21 countries of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) agreed
here Tuesday to intensify their efforts to realize a free trade
area in the region by October next year.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Countdown to the COMESA Free Trade Area",
the two-day COMESA Summit, which closed Tuesday, called for all
member states to adhere to the provisions of the COMESA Treaty
for zero tariff and the elimination of non-tariff barriers and
other obstacles to trade by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The summit attended by presidents from 12 countries -- Kenya,
Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Namibia, Tanzania, Sudan Malawi,
Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi and
Djibouti as well as senior officials from other COMESA member
states.
</P>
<P>
In its final communique, the summit endorsed that all member
states should adopt the harmonized commodity description and
coding system for customs and statistics purposes.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to form a co-ordinating body of experts from
central banks and ministries of finance to oversee the
implementation of the policy measures on economic policy
co-ordinations and harmonization towards the eventual goal of a
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The summit endorsed the council decision regarding the need to
establish an Africa Guarantee Facility to cover political risk in
the regional and international trade, and to continue work on a
fast payment facility to allow exporters to be paid with
certainty and speed.
</P>
<P>
It agreed that member states, particularly those with growing
cross- border trade, investment and tourism, should introduce
limited currency convertibility in order to reduce transaction
costs, facilitate the flow of trade and investment and promote
the use of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA secretariat was directed by the summit to study the
issue of bilateral agreements to ensure that they are all
consistent with the objectives of COMESA, and to work out the
modalities for establishing a

regional investment agency to promote the region as a common
investment area.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who is
also chairman of the COMESA, said that the future of the COMESA
is brighter than ever before and "our priority concern is to
improve the well-being of our people."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the globalization of the world trade had
threatened to marginalize the region, so COMESA regional
integration is not only essential but also crucial to improve the
competitiveness of COMESA members in the world trade.
</P>
<P>
Moi once again reaffirmed that "peace is of paramount
importance. With peace, however poor we are, we can solve our
common problems."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the DRC, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia to
immediately end their conflicts and implement the U.N. resolutions
and the OAU Framework Agreement for the sake of regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It is decided that next Summit of the COMESA Authority will be
 held in Mauritius in 2000.

<HEADLINE> European Turbot Introduced into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
headed by Professor Lei Jilin have introduced into China the
European turbot, a commercially important flatfish species native
to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of adult turbots are expected to be on the
Chinese market at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The European turbot, as valuable as the salmon, is highly
regarded for its high nutrition value, delicious taste and fast
growth rate. The breeding of the fish has become an important
industry in Europe after several decades of research.
</P>
<P>
Lei said that turbot breeding can also be developed into a
major industry in China because it can flourish at low
temperatures and is rarely affected by disease.
</P>
<P>
"A baby fish can gain 800 to 1,000 grams of weight in one year,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
However, artificial breeding of its fries is difficult, with a
low survival rate, according to Lei, and the rate is still far
lower than that of other commercially important fish in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Lei's group has bred nearly 510,000 turbot fries thus far.
</P>
<P>
The output of turbot in Europe is around 1,400 tons, which
falls short of the market need. Some turbot products have also
entered the US and Japan markets, and have been selling well.
</P>
<P>
Insiders predict that the fish will also have a bright future
on the Chinese market.

The Senate debate on the VFA has now reached the last stage
where those opposed to it will deliver their final arguments and
the sponsors of the resolution endorsing ratification of the
accord will reply to close the debate.
</P>
<P>
PNA quoted Senator Francisco Tatad as saying that the period of
amendments to the resolution will follow, but "what may be amended
is the resolution and not the VFA agreement signed by Manila and
Washington early last year."
</P>
<P>
VFA would allow the resumption of large-scale military exercise
with U.S. troops in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
After the amendments, the senate will immediately go into its
second reading which will merely require a simple majority vote to
approve it.
</P>
<P>
It is on the third and final reading, expected on Monday next
week, that a two-thirds majority vote of the Senate is needed as
required by the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Outgoing Leader Advises Way to Avoid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian outgoing Head of State, Gen.
 Abdulsalami Abubakar said Sunday that the only way to avoid the
military's incursion into politics is that the incoming civilian
administration should run an accountable and responsive
government.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made this remark at a ceremony known as "durba" at the
palace of the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero during his visit to
Kano State.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the Post Express, a major daily in
Nigeria, the head of state said, "I wish to enjoin the incoming
civilian administration to ensure the sustenance of democratic
rule through good and accountable governance as well as creating a
conducive atmosphere of the prevalence of peace, harmony and
understanding among the different components of the Nigerian
state."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the incoming civilian administration fulfilled
its obligations, the Nigerian armed forces would have no option
than to be committed to the defense of the territorial integrity
and corporate existence of Nigeria in the new political
dispensation.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar expressed his readiness and happiness to transfer his
power to the president-elect Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29.

<HEADLINE> Experts Advise on Development in Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 environmental and
agricultural experts from both China and abroad attended a
symposium here today to offer advice to the Chinese government on
sustainable development in the Loess Plateau in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, experts warned that the deteriorating
ecological environment of the Loess Plateau will restrict
development of the region, where abundant energy and mineral
resources are of significance for China in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the meeting shared the opinion that the major
environmental problems in the plateau is water loss and soil
erosion, which result from both natural factors and human
activities such as improper land utilization.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Honglie, chairman of the Sustainable
Agriculture Working Group under the China Council for
International Cooperation on Environment and Development, the
experts conducted a field investigation to the plateau last week.
</P>
<P>
Sun, also an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said the two-day symposium will focus on technological transfer,
water utilization, water loss and soil erosion, land use and
environmental consequences, ecosystem improvement and eco-
agriculture, the rural market and agricultural production
practices.
</P>
<P>
The Loess Plateau, China's third largest plateau, covers an
area of 400,000 square kilometers. The looseness of the soil,
sparse vegetation, and frequent rainstorms in summer in the region
have caused serious soil erosion, which in turn has carved the
land into gullies and reduced the fertility of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of the 1980s, China has invested 100 million
yuan every year to conserve water and soil on the plateau.
According to an environmental program proposed by the State
Development Planning Commission and approved by the State Council
last year, the Loess Plateau will be a focus of major
environmental projects in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1991, the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development is composed of high-
ranking officials and renowned scientists from China and foreign
countries. The council offers the government advice on the
environment and sustainable development in China.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappings Down in Philippines in Last 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kidnap-for-ransom cases have gone
down considerably in the Philippines during the past 10 months
with the arrest of 91 suspected kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Tuesday by Police Director Panfilo Lacson,
chief of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, in a
speech before the Foreign Correspondents Association of the
Philippines in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said that during the 10-month period, the task force
solved 30 out of 37 reported kidnapping cases and arrested 91
suspects.
</P>
<P>
The task force also recovered 6.2 million pesos (155,000 U.S.
dollars) in ransom money, he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving credit to other agencies such as the Philippine National
Police and other law enforcement agencies, Lacson said the task
force "has substantially terminated the kidnapping industry in the
last 10 months."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned against any complacency in the drive against
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"This is an industry that makes profit its god. Thus, we must
continue to conduct a permanent termination system
round-the-clock," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin
Hussein is scheduled to visit Gaza on Wednesday to hold talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be Abdullah's first visit to Gaza since ascending to
the Jordanian throne in February. He will discuss with Arafat how
to move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections
in which One Israel leader Ehud Barak was elected the country's
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
During the last several days, Abdullah was in Europe and the
United States and the Middle East peace process was one of the
major issues that he had discussed with European and
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast meeting with American Jewish leaders in
New York on Monday, Abdullah said "There is such a sense of
euphoria in the Middle East now, replacing the months and years of
frustration" after hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was ousted in the election.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned however that "if something does not happen in the
next three or four months, I fear that the backlash will even
worse than it was a couple of months ago."
</P>
<P>
Just after Israel's elections, Abdullah promised that he will
try his best to help move the peace process forward and his
current trip abroad was aimed at rallying European and
U.S. support in this regard.
</P>
<P>
During the Gaza visit, he will inform Arafat what the U.S. and
the European leaders will do in restarting the Middle East peace
talks, a senior Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace track entered into another
stalemate since lase December when Netanyahu froze the
implementation of the Wye River accord, which asks Israel to hand
over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak's election victory brought new hopes into the peace
process, but his stated policies have already caused worries among
the Arabs over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Jerusalem is the undivizable capital of
Israel, and that Israel would not return to the borders before
1967, the year when Israel took away Gaza and the Golan Heights
from the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He also objected foreign military presense west of the
Jordan River.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Accounting Law, Enact Futures Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China will soon amend the existing
Accounting Law and enact provisional regulations on futures trade
management, according to the 18th Executive Meeting of the State
Council held here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, presided over by Premier Zhu Rongji, discussed and
passed in principle a draft amendment to the Accounting Law and a
draft of the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Futures
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that the existing accounting law has played
a positive role in regulating and improving accounting work in
China, and has thus contributed to the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, with the deepening of reforms and the
development of the socialist market economy, the law no longer
fits the current situation, and has failed to meet the demands of
macroeconomic control by the State.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to revise the Accounting Law in accordance
with the requirements of the socialist market economic system,"
they noted.
</P>
<P>
They went on to say that China's futures market, which began
trial operation in 1990, was once nearly out of control, and the
State Council had to issue two circulars to bring it back to
normal order.
</P>
<P>
In order to substantially strengthen its supervision and
management of the futures market and ward off potential risks,
they said, it is most necessary to formulate the provisional
regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made at today's meeting, the draft
amendment to the Accounting Law will be submitted to the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, for examination, while the provisional regulations on
futures trade will be promulgated by the State Council after some
further revisions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Probe Soeharto Wealth Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has instructed Justice Minister Muladi, Attorney General Andi M
Ghalib and three other officials to leave on Sunday for
Switzerland and Austria to investigate alleged wealth of former
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The team aims to verify information that some 9 billion U.S.
dollars had been transferred by Soeharto from a Swiss bank to an
Austrian bank, State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi said here
Tuesday after meeting with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He said the Justice Ministry will request a "letter of
authorization" from Soeharto before leaving for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The move proves the government's seriousness in investigating
the wealth that Soeharto allegedly amassed during his 32 years in
power, Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if Soeharto's alleged wealth abroad is found, the
first thing to do is bring the money back to Indonesia and then
more investigation will follow.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Time magazine reported recently that the Soeharto
family amassed a 15 billion U.S. dollar fortune during his rule.
</P>
<P>
The Soehartos' fortune includes 9 billion U.S. dollars in cash
that was transferred from a bank in Switzerland to another bank in
Austria shortly after the former ruler forced to step down in May
last year, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ghalib said he had asked the embassies of
Switzerland, Austria and the United States here to collect
information on the former president's bank accounts in the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian political parties including the ruling Golkar Party
have urged the government to speed up the investigation into
Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
However, Soeharto refuted the Time's report that he greedily
enriched himself and his family when he was in office.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on his six-day visit to India which ended
on Monday, Tofail said he discussed with Indian officials various
issues concerning trade, transit, investment, representative
offices of business houses as well as consular questions.
</P>
<P>
The major issue during his visit was tariff on Bangladeshi
exports to India, he said.
</P>
<P>
India reaffirmed that there were no quantitative restrictions
in regard to imports from Bangladesh, and that India had offered
tariff concessions to Bangladesh on a number of items, on a
non-reciprocal basis, a press release issued at the press
conference said.
</P>
<P>
But Dhaka has repeatedly complained of tariff and non-tariff
barriers to its exports to India.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh imports from India stood at 755 million U.S. dollars
during the 1997-98 fiscal year, while its exports to that country
were valued at 50 million dollars only, resulting in a huge trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Tofail blamed the previous government led by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party for sharply reducing tariffs on imports, which
he said had benefited all SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) members but Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Tofail said that during his visit, the two sides agreed to set
up a joint group of experts representing both governments, to
consider the modalities for the initiation of border trade between
the two countries, the modalities for the movement of goods from
one point in India to another through Bangladeshi territory in
pursuance of the India-Bangladesh Trade Agreement of 1980 and the
Agreement on SAPTA (South Asian Preferential Trade Arrangement)
concluded in 1993, by Bangladeshi carriers.
</P>
<P>
The joint group would also consider the request of Bangladesh
for deepening the tariff concessions provided by India on various
items and duty-free access on some items of their export on a
non-reciprocal basis and the request for further tariff
concessions by both the parties on items of interest to each
other.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the difficulties that Bangladesh faced
at Indian customs points and consular matters relating to
expansion of business and investment between the two countries.
They agreed to facilitate the issue of multiple entry visas to
bona fide businessmen and investors in joint ventures, and the
establishment of representative offices of business houses in each
other's territory, the press release said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China needs to make a greater
effort at training officials from various minority ethnic groups,
according to Li Dezhu, Minister in charge of the State Commission
for Nationalities Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li told a recent meeting of minority ethnic affairs officials
from all over the country that one of the key factors for
achieving national unity in China is to have a large number of
officials from minority ethnic groups, who are faithfully carrying
out the policies of the Chinese Communist Party toward minority
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years, many countries and regions have
suffered from serious ethnic problems and conflicts, China has
maintained its national unity, social stability and economic
development, he said.

levels to train high-ranking officials from various minority
ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> NATO Wants to Show Who's Boss in Kosovo War: Gorbachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has accused NATO of deliberately ignoring a political
settlement in Kosovo so it could "teach Yugoslavia a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"NATO decided to show who is the boss in the world and to give
this conflict as a kind of illustration of who is the boss in the
world," Grobachev told Australia's government-funded SBS TV.
</P>
<P>
"There were possibilities for a political settlement," he said.
"Those possibilities were not used and instead bombings started in
order to show who is the boss, without the mandate of the United
Nations, in disregard of the international law."
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the prospect of a new cold war on the horizon,
maybe even a hot war and that would be grave," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the NATO countries did not want Russia to
play a role in resolving the conflict, which was a sign of how
little Russia was regarded these days, a development Gorbachev
said had led to the U.S. now monopolizing world politics.

<HEADLINE> Turkmen Natural Gas to Flow to Turkey in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan is expected to export
its natural gas to Turkey and Europe through the Caspian Sea in
the year 2002 when the pipeline is completed, local Daily News
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that under an agreement signed by Turkey and
Turkmenistan, the planned 2,000-kilometer-long Turkmen natural
gas pipeline will begin in the coastal city of Turkmenbasi and
will connect to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku with a
300-kilometer length of pipeline running under the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will then connect from Baku to the Georgian
capital of Tbilisi and to Turkey's eastern province of Erzurum,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
From Erzurum, the natural gas will be distributed to other
Turkish cities.
</P>
<P>
In order to fully realize this project, Azerbaijan and Georgia
will have to allow pipeline construction on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas will
flow to Turkey annually after the pipeline was put into initial
operation, although the planned capacity of the pipeline would
allow it to carry a volume of 30 billion cubic meters per year.
</P>
<P>
Once the pipeline begins operations at full capacity, Turkey
plans to use 16 billion cubic meters of the natural gas for its
own use and to export the remaining 14 billion cubics to central
and southern Europe.

CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese medicine will
be subject to strict regulation in Australia's second richest

Victorian State Community Services Minister Denis Napthine, who
introduced the legislation in state parliament Tuesday, told MPs

<HEADLINE> 75 Percent Of China's Cotton Seeds Are Of Good Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ministry's Cotton Quality Supervision and Inspection Center
and the bureau did the study of major cotton producers in Hebei,
Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui and Hubei provinces, and in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists said that a lack of quality and a low germination
rate were the major problems of the seeds and that Xinjiang had
the worst quality problems.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Xinjiang had rapid development in cotton
production, but its seed breeding techniques were below standard,
causing the introduction of various cotton strains.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is now the largest cotton producer, producing a third
of China's cotton output.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China needs to make a greater

ethnic groups.

Although in recent years, many countries and regions have
suffered from serious ethnic problems and conflicts, China has

LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian traditional ruler of Ozora
Adhekegba Eluega II on Sunday fled his kingdom when irate youths
stormed his palace to protest his alleged intention to supervise
recruitment into an oil firm operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
Armed police were dispatched to the region in Isoko North Local
 Government area of Delta State to the west of Lagos, the

Nigeria's Major Dailies.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly set fire on houses in villages around the

<P>
Over the past four days, Moore had high level discussions with

Pacific region and wants to increase relations between the two
countries.

<P>
The two countries are concerned about the consequences of the
Asian financial crisis in terms of political and economic
stability, he said, and that they were in strong agreement on the
need to settle disputes in the region, such as competing claims in
the South China Sea, through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moore said he believes that Australia's defense relationship
with China is on a very sound footing, and that he is looking
forward to more dialogues on regional issues and positive
cooperation between the two defense forces.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), in a meeting

here today, said that China and Russia share a consensus on the
Kosovo issue, and are indignant about the U.S.-led NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia and the attack on Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia should increase consultation to stop NATO from
bombing Yugoslavia and bring the Kosovo issue on the track of
political settlement as soon as possible, he said, saying that the
Sino-Russian strategic coordinative partnership oriented toward
the 21st century based upon equality and mutual trust is conducive
to world peace and to the balanced development of a global

<HEADLINE> Barak's Government to Seek Peace With Arabs: Peres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's new government led by
Ehud Barak will seek comprehensive peace with Syria and Lebanon,
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected Israel's new prime minister on May 17,
"will give top priority to working out a full peace settlement
with Syria and Lebanon," Peres said in an interview at his Tel
Aviv bureau with Kuwaiti Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-A'm published here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The former Labor Party leader anticipated that Israel would
resume its peace negotiations with Syria from the point where they
had been frozen when he was leading the Labor Party government in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks had stopped when the two parties
entered a phase of pondering possible security measures in the
strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Peres said the recent poll, which resulted in the ouster of the
hard-line Likud Party Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was a
public referendum which reflected the Israeli people's
unwillingness to maintain the occupation of the Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's occupation of the nine-mile-deep border zone in
south Lebanon, Peres said "it's quite possible" that Israel would
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations resolution 425, issued after Israel's
first military incursion into Lebanon in 1978, urged
unconditional Israeli pullout from the occupied zone.

<HEADLINE> Humanism or Despotism? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An appalling humanitarian disaster
has been evolving in Yugoslavia as NATO's indiscriminate bombings
entered the third month on the pretext of "humanitarian
intervention" in the conflict of Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,200 civilians have been killed, over 5,000 seriously
wounded and nearly one million displaced in the Balkan country
since the U.S.-led NATO launched the bombings March 24 to prevent
what it termed "the spread of humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Of Washington's self-justification, the most high-sounding are
"fighting against ethnic cleansing," "fighting out of a moral
obligation" and "fighting for fear of any negative impact on U.S.
peace and security."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton claimed that "ethnic cleansing and
the slaughter of innocents can never be tolerated by a civilized
world." This has been repeated most widely in the Western media
as a justification for NATO's bombings.
</P>
<P>
But conflict between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
a purely internal affair of Yugoslavia deeply-rooted in its
history, is obviously not the only one in the post-Cold War world
where the United States is left without its traditional superpower
rival.
</P>
<P>
Not long after August 1995, when the Dayton Agreement was
signed for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a savage attack was
launched in Krajina, a region of Croatia that the Serbs had
inhabited for 500 years. An article carried in the April 5 edition
of Time magazine reported that 150,000 Serbs were driven out
within four days, "the largest ethnic cleansing of the entire
Balkan wars."
</P>
<P>
Investigators with the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague
concluded that this attack was carried out with "brutality, wanton
murder and indiscriminate shelling of civilians," said the Time in
its article "The Clinton Doctrine."
</P>
<P>
However, at the time, the U.S. did nothing to stop or even
protest the incident. The article said, in fact the Clinton
Administration tacitly encouraged the incident by sending "a
shadowy group of retired American officers" as advisors to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
That not a syllable was uttered on ethnic cleansing there and
then is a sharp contrast to the loud cries on Kosovo, raising
questions on the real motive of NATO's military intervention in
Yugoslavia, a small, developing country that has all along stood
unbent to Western powers.
</P>
<P>
The claim of "a moral obligation" sounds strange, to say the
least, when one sees what the U.S.-led NATO has been targeting:
hospitals, schools, TV and radio stations, bridges, railways,
highways, civilian airports and civilian factories.
</P>
<P>
The entire power grid as well as water and heating supply
systems were destroyed in Serbia. Not even ethnic Albanian
refugees and their villages, whom NATO keeps on vowing to protect,
were spared.
</P>
<P>
As if all these were not enough to fulfill its "moral
obligation," on May 7, the U.S.-led NATO launched a missile attack
on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese
journalists and injuring more than 20 Chinese diplomats.
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented atrocity constitutes a blatant trample of
international laws and diplomatic norms, an undisguised crime
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Washington's theory that how a foreign country manages its
internal affairs may directly influence the peace and security of
the United States is in itself a self-centered statement, in a
virtual denial of the principles of the U.N. Charter upholding the
equality of all sovereign states and non-interference of each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic conflicts similar to that in Kosovo are not rare among
NATO member states and, in particular, the United States.
</P>
<P>
In April 1992, Los Angeles was torn by three days of violent
clashes following massive protests against ethnic discrimination,
police bullying and judicial injustice. The U.S. government had to
send in more than 10,000 armored police forces to oppress the
protests, during which 58 people were killed, at least 3,000
injured and thousands of houses demolished.
</P>
<P>
Does Washington think its handling of internal affairs will
influence, directly or indirectly, the peace and security of other
countries? Does it allow interference from other parts of the
world?
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, Washington's justification for its
bombing of Yugoslavia is a typical logic of power. If such a logic
is allowed to prevail, where would be peace, democracy, equality
and justice in the world? In this civilized world, peoples of
small, weak countries have reached their conclusion and would
never succumb to the rule of the powerful.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The major task for China's ethnic
groups is to achieve political, economic and cultural developments,
said Li Dezhu, Minister in charge of the State Commission for
Nationalities Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said in an article carried by the latest issue of Ethnic
Work Research that the right of subsistence and development is the
most basic human right for any nationality, and so eliminating
poverty and promoting development is the major point of the Chiese
government's policies toward nationalities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Chinese government also pays great
attention to protecting traditional cultures of the minority
nationalities in China and fully respecting their customs.
</P>
<P>
He said that some western countries pay little attention to
helping minority nationalities and attempt to keep them in a
backward state, in the name of "protecting traditional culture".

Crimes, particularly thefts, have been rising in the desert
kingdom due to poverty and unemployment which stood at over 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
Qudah also blamed the rising crime rate on the lack of proper
education, parents' neglect of their children in a time of
economic recession.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, the chief of General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), in a meeting
with Pervez Musharaf, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee and chief of Army Staff of Pakistan here today, said
that the countries of South Asia should peacefully settle any
conflicts and problems through patient and candid dialogue.
</P>
<P>
South Asia is an important part of Asia, he said, and the
stability and development of the region is closely connected to
that of the whole continent and the Chinese government greatly
appreciates Pakistan's efforts to improve relations with its
neighbor India.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military ties with Pakistan are a vital part
of China's bilateral relations and an important part of the Sino-
Pakistani comprehensive cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
He said that hegemonism and power politics have made new
appearances in spite of the general global easing of tensions and
the fact that U.S.-led NATO avoided the United Nations and
wantonly bombed Yugoslavia, using humanitarianism as an excuse was
a typical example.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf expressed the hope that there would be a further
consolidation of the friendship between the two countries and two
armed forces as a result of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government agrees that the role of the UN should
be increased, he said, and that a regional organization should not
be used in settling international disputes.

Party in his coalition government, sources said on Monday. Barak

<HEADLINE> Singapore Decides to Adopt European DVB Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Broadcasting
Authority (SBA) Tuesday announced its decision to adopt the
European Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard as the national
digital television (DTV) standard in Singapore on the
recommendation of a technical committee.
</P>
<P>
SBA Chief Executive Officer Lim Hock Chuan told a press
conference that "after much deliberation, SBA decided on DVB as
the national terrestrial digital TV standard as it best meets
Singapore's needs."
</P>
<P>
"This marks the beginning of a new and dynamic era in
television broadcasting in Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, the technical committee, appointed in 1997
and known as the DTV Technical Committee, conducted comparative
field trials of the world's three DTV standards, namely the
American Advanced Televisions Systems Committee(ATSC) standard,
the European DVB standard and the Japanese Integrated Service
Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) standard over a
five-month period from May to September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The committee found that all three standards were of
exceptional quality and each demonstrated competitive advantages
over the others.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the committee evaluated and compared these standards
based on nine criteria and DVB did well in all criteria, leading
the rankings in seven out nine criteria.
</P>
<P>
The nine criteria are characteristics of transmitted signals
including mobile reception, availability of DTV equipment, cost of
implementation, applications, interoperability with broadcasting,
IT and telecommunications networks, potential for growth, spectrum
efficiency, scalability and security.
</P>
<P>
Lim also announced that SBA will be forming an industry-led
National Digital TV Committee to look into three broad areas of
DTV implementation, namely technical, promotional and content
development.
</P>
<P>
Digital Television (or DTV) refers to the complete digitization
of the TV signal from transmission to reception and is considered
to be the future of television around the world.
</P>
<P>
Confident that DTV will eventually replace the present analogue
TV and committed to introducing new technologies in Singapore,
SBA formed the technical committee to recommend a DTV standard for
Singapore, propose a time frame for implementation and discuss the
availability of DTV equipment in the market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Japan Should Maintain Only Defence Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A leading National People's
Congress Foreign Affairs Committee official said here today that
Japan should adhere to its Peace Constitution and maintain a
defence-only policy.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after the Japanese Senate passed
new Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines. Its House of
Representatives had already approved the documents.
</P>
<P>
Japan should continue on the path of peaceful development and
implement its own commitments, he said, calling the increased
Japan-U.S. military cooperation and expanded military role in the
Asia-Pacific region a serious step, one that worries the Chinese
and countries and regions in other parts of Asia and makes them
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
The key point of the documents, which were formulated by the
Japanese and U.S. governments and approved by the Japanese Diet,
is stronger military cooperation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
They empower the Japanese self-defence forces to leave Japanese
territory and cooperate with the United States in military
operations in "safeguarding regional security", but will in fact
threaten the peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
The move is a violation of the desires of the people of the
Asia-Pacific region for peace and friendship and will surely
arouse strong opposition, he said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations on coalition Continues in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Israeli
Arab parties started Tuesday morning their negotiations with One
Israel's negotiating team on the formation of a coalition
government to be headed by prime minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Parties of the united Arab List, composed of the southern
faction of Islamic Movement and the Democratic Arab Party, the
Balad and the Hadash, all sent their representatives to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
All Israeli Arab parties are interested in joining the
coalition, but are strongly opposed to the inclusion of the
hard-line Likud in the future cabinet for fear that it would
create obstacles to progress in the peace process, reliable
sources close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's negotiations with Arab parties are part of the
ongoing coalition talks One Israel is conducting with all
political parties. It had concluded the first round of talks on
Monday with Meretz, Yitsrael Ba'aliya, the Center party and
Shinui.
</P>
<P>
One Israel's negotiation team is scheduled to hold talks over
the coalition issue with right wing Likud and Shas Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some sources said that Barak, who beat Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May 17 election, is keen to include both Likud
and Shas in his government so as to create a ruling bloc with 90
to 95 seats in the next Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
This would guarantee that the defection of a single party
would not bring down the government in the future, the sources
explained.
</P>
<P>
To include Shas into the coalition is not simple due to the
rejection by Meretz and Shas's confrontation with the legal
system. Barak was reported to have laid down several conditions
and demands for Shas to consider.
</P>
<P>
Barak demanded the resignation of Aryeh Deri, who was sentenced
to four years in prison for fraud and bribes taking, from Shas
leader. shas will not allowed to retain the interior ministry
portfolio and Shas must respect for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Acting Likud leader Ariel Sharon on Monday appointed a
negotiating team, including four cabinet ministers, for the
coalition talks.
</P>
<P>
But right now no body knows which party will be included in
the coalition as the talks will continue for some time.

<HEADLINE> No Camera with George Mallory: Research Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Climber Eric Simonson said here
Tuesday that there was no camera with George Leigh Mallory who
died on the 8,848-meter Mount Qomolangma in 1924 with fellow
Briton Andrew Irvine.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that with metal detectors, his
expedition team had searched completely the area where Mallory's
body was found but to no avail. The team had eight climbing
members and eight Nepalese Sherpas.
</P>
<P>
"We can conclusively say here no camera with George Mallory.
George Mallory is now buried, there is no reason for another
expedition to ever go back to him," he stressed. "He can rest in
peace."
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Mallory carried a Kodak camera with
him which might contain a picture of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Simonson displayed to the press four artifacts belonging to
Mallory which are a pair of goggles, a piece of rope, an empty
oxygen frame and a handkerchief in his pocket which bears the
initials of "G.L.M."
</P>
<P>
He said that they are close proof that the body was that of
Mallory. With the provision of his family, the team had cut a
piece of tissue from his arm for further test.
</P>
<P>
"His head was frozen into the ground, so we never got a good
look at the face," he said, adding that it was very difficult
working at the height of 27,000 feet (8,327 meters).
</P>
<P>
Simonson said that Irvine's body was found by a Chinese climber
in 1975; the site is about 100 meters far away from where Mallory
was found. He said his team will return one or two years later to
look for Irvine's body.
</P>
<P>
The team has turned over all the artifacts it collected during
the expedition in April and May from the Tibetan side to the New
York-based American Foundation for International Mountaineering
Exploration and Research.
</P>
<P>
"We are honored to accept these historic findings and look
forward to working with the Mallory family and other scientific
and mountaineering organizations to solve the 75-year-old mystery
of the fateful Mallory and Irvine Everest (Qomolangma) summit
attempt," a spokesperson for the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that all three expedition objectives have been
met," Simonson said.
</P>
<P>
He said first, the team have highlighted the 75th anniversary
of the 1924 climb by Mallory and Irvine and called attention to
the vision and accomplishment of these climbers.
</P>
<P>
Second, the team have successfully completed an unprecedented
high-altitude search on the world's top mountain for evidence of
the 1924 climb, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we accomplished an evaluation of the technical
difficulties of the fabled Second Step, the most difficult
climbing challenge Mallory and Irvine would have faced on their
way to the top," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation is making a documentary
film on the research expedition.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa were
the first recognized conquerers of Mt. Qomolangma in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 800 people have conquered the mountain with
some 180 deaths in the course.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MP Sent to Prison Over Land Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan member of parliament was
sent to prison Monday for alleged failure to surrender a land
title to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
Aggrey Awori, an outspoken MP who is widely known for his
attacking of the ruling National Resistance Movement, was
committed to Luzira civil prison, the New Vision daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Haji Juma Muweesi, the plaintiff in the case, sued the
legislator for falsely obtaining his land title for Plot 1291 in
Ntinda, a suburb of the capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the MP to pay a fine of 400,000 shillings
(300 U.S. dollars) in addition to giving the owner back his land
title.
</P>
<P>
The MP, who was brought to court Monday morning, promised to
pay the money but did not turn up in the afternoon session as he
was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
Frank Othembi, magistrate at Mengo Court, was quoted as saying
that Awori did not obey the court directive and therefore should
be detained for 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Review Trade With South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has said Kenya might be forced to review its trade ties with South
Africa if the latter continued pursuing unfair trade practices at
the expenses of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
All the major Kenyan newspapers Tuesday quoted Moi as saying
that trade between Kenya and South Africa will never be the same
again.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's exports to Kenya surpassed by 20 times over
Kenya's exports in that market, which must be urgently addressed
to save local industries from collapse, said Moi Monday at the
opening ceremony of the fourth Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) summit.
</P>
<P>
"After this meeting, we will stick to COMESA (members) while
other countries will have to take second or third places," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The recent past has witnessed a war of words between Kenyan
businessmen and South Africa High Commission to Kenya over
bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Association of Manufacturers had called for an
embargo on South African products while the South Africa High
Commissioner to Kenya Grifiths Memela argued that Kenyan
businessmen are not aggressive enough in exploring South Africa's
market.

Walter J. Rockler, a Washington lawyer, pointed out in the
article that the United States and NATO have "engaged in a
flagrant military aggression" by ceaselessly attacking a small
country, with an aim to show that they "run the world." "The
rationale that we are simply enforcing international morality,
even if it were true, would not excuse the military aggression and
wide-spread killing that it entails. It also does not lessen the
culpability of the authors of this aggression," he said.(US-NATO-

<TEXT>

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO should
investigate the attack on China's embassy in Yugoslavia seriously
and thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
here today at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Although the embassy residences of two neutral nations and one
NATO member country were also attacked by the NATO, the U.S.-led
NATO could not lessen the seriousness of the attack on the Chinese
embassy or alleviate its responsibility, he stressed.

<P>
Even some leaders of the NATO nations could not believe in the
excuse of the so-called "information mistake", he said, adding

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A mass food poisoning that left
62 people ill after a buffet at a five-star hotel in Auckland,
the biggest city in New Zealand, is being investigated by NZ
health officials, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Auckland is the venue for the Informal Meeting of Leaders of
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which will be
held in September. The Carlton Hotel is designated to host APEC
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
NZPA said that three people who fell ill after eating the
Mother's Day meal at the five-star hotel on May 9 contacted
Auckland Healthcare, complaining of vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The local health authority then telephoned patrons listed by
the hotel, and found 62 people had been ill for 30-34 hours.
</P>
<P>
NZPA quoted Auckland Healthcare food program manager Kathy
Pritchard as saying it is proving difficult to determine what food
may have been responsible.
</P>
<P>
The Carlton Hotel will be home during the September APEC
meeting to New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. At least four
other world leaders could be staying there, according to NZPA.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Strong Displeasure at Ship Sunk by Filipino Warship: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is blamed for
violating Chinese sovereignty after its warship sank a Chinese
vessel in Chinese waters, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in response to a question about his comment
on the recent ship sinking incident at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, China's Qionghai 03091 fishing vessel was
chased and hit by the No.47 Warship of the Philippine navy in the
sea area surrounding Huangyan Island (15 degree 15 minutes North
Latitude and 117 degree 18 minutes East Longitude), sinking the
ship and causing 11 crew members to fall into water. Eight of the
11 members were rescued by other Chinese ships. The rest were sent
to Manila after being rescued by the Philippine side.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that Huangyan is part of the Chinese territory so
that the act of the Philippine navy constitutes a violation of
Chinese sovereignty. Also, the act endangered the lives of the
Chinese fishermen and caused heavy economic losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
China expressed strong displeasure at the act of the Filipino
navy, and urged the Philippine side to punish those responsible
for the incident and compensate the Chinese fishermen for their
losses.
</P>
<P>
"Proper measures should be taken to prevent similar incidents
from occurring again," he stated.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes Introduction of Tian'anmen Resolution: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China strongly resents and firmly
opposes the so-called resolution "marking the 10th anniversary of
Tiananmen incident" introduced by a few US congressmen, Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said in a regular press conference that the so-called
resolution, recently introduced by a few US congressmen, has
wantonly distorted facts about China's human rights conditions. By
making irresponsible remarks on China's internal affairs, they
have fully revealed their anti-China political face, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have already seen through their tricks, and
the attempt of those anti-China US congressmen to interfere in
China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights is
doomed to failure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister Discusses Overseas Investment In Chinese Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shi made the remarks at a conference on overseas investment in
state-level economic and technological development zones here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the economic and technological development zones
should continue economic and trade cooperation with foreign
countries, protect overseas investors' rights and interests, and
continue the preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The economic and technological development zone was a
pioneering part in China's reforms and opening-up, Shi said, and
in a decade and a half of exploration and construction, they have
even expanded to central and western China, which now has 32 state-
level such zones.
</P>
<P>
They account for much of China's overseas investment and have
had the fastest economic growth, he said, and still have many more
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
They should try to get more large high-tech projects and more
investment from major multinationals to develop by themselves some
globally competitive projects and brand-name products.

<HEADLINE> Expert Meeting on Trans-Asian Railway Network Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A four-day Regional Policy-level
Expert Group Meeting on the Trans-Asian Railway began here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being organized under the auspices of the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
"Borders may ... remain in place but frontiers may always open
through a process of integration of our thoughts and opinions
facilitating unhindered travel and transportation fostering
socio-economic upliftment of the regions," Bangladeshi Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad said while inaugurating the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has been giving high priority in
developing road and communication links across the country, Azad
said, adding that the opening of Bangabandhu Bridge over Jamuna
River has opened a new horizon in the country's communication
network.
</P>
<P>
"This would greatly contribute to the implementation of the
proposed Trans-Asian Railway Network," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, in the expert group meeting, integration of issues
would be eventual, but I believe, the integration of minds is a
prerequisite," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the 1960s, an attempt to develop road and rail routes in
the corridor Europe-South Asia-South East Asia to facilitate trade
and tourism, was made by ESCAP member countries through the
initiation of Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway projects," Dr.
Adrianus Mooy, Under-Secretary General of the United Nations and
Executive Secretary of ESCAP, said in his written opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important tasks of this policy-level expert
group meeting will be to consider the findings and recommendations
of the preliminary study and move towards defining the Action Plan
necessary to bring into being an efficient rail network serving
the economic and social development needs of the countries
concerned, he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are delegates from Myanmar, India, Sri
Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, China, Thailand and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is consequential to the efforts of the
participating countries for implementation of the Asian Land
Transport infrastructure Development Project which comprises Asian
Highway, the Trans-Asian Railway and land transport facilitation
measures. The meeting will deal with the Trans-Asian Railway
specifically.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Semiconductor Industry to Grow by Double Digit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Driven by the use of personal
computers, consumer electronics and communications equipment, the
worldwide semiconductor industry will experience double-digit
growth through 2001, said a report released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. market research firm Dataquest, the worldwide
semiconductor market will grow from 153 billion U.S. dollars this
year to 179 billion dollars in 2000, 218 billion dollars in 2001,
and to 244 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest analysts said the market for dynamic random access
memory( DRAM) will continue to shape the outlook for the overall
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
"A key assumption to the forecast is a DRAM shortage starting
in late 2000, which will cause DRAM revenue to peak in 2001," the
research firm said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, worldwide semiconductor revenue growth will
decelerate. And in 2002 and 2003, the market will grow by 5.9
percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
PCs, consumer electronics and communications equipment will
account for nearly two-thirds of total chip sales, according to
Dataquest. Of the top 20 high-growth semiconductor applications,
nine are communication applications, six are consumer applications
and four are PC workstation applications.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua)-- China plans to sell off some old
imported wheat, May 26-28, to reduce its old grain surplus to make
room for new grain, according to a recent issue of Market Daily.
</P>
<P>
A Grain Reserve Administration official says that the wheat
will be sold at auction on the wholesale grain market in the city
of Zhengzhou. The wheat was imported from Canada, the United
States and Australia in 1996 and was kept in granaries in more
than 20 different areas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the central government used to reduce similar
grain surpluses by allocating them to lower administrative levels
and that the new method shows the government's increased awareness
of the advantage of the marketplace.

<HEADLINE> IMP Official Says Kenya on Right Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has cleared its way for the
resumption of negotiations for a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan
package, a regional official of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, we believe Kenya has met all the prior conditions
 necessary for talks," said Goodall Gondwe, the IMF's deputy
director for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Gondwe as saying that
the final decision on whether and when to resume talks would be
left to the IMF' s board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Talks about the aid package were suspended in 1997 to reinforce
the fund' s protest against graft and poor governance in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The commitment to the crusade against corruption shown by the
appointment of Justice Aaron Ringera as head of Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority cleared one of the main obstacles to
talks between the fund and the Kenyan government, Gondwe said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and Kenya had also agreed on how to resolve one of
the other major thorny points, a high-profile fraud case, said
Gondwe.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's board met with a Kenyan delegation led by Finance
Minister Francis Masakhalia last week about the re-opening of
talks on loans.
</P>
<P>
According to Gondwe, the IMF did not expect Kenya to meet its
balanced budget target in 1998-99 because of fiscal discipline
problems.
</P>
<P>
The IMF understood the difficult economic conditions Kenya
faced and would not raise the missed target as a matter of bad
governance, he added.

CHANGCHUN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A variety of summer flowers are
now in bloom in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin

Though it is still late spring in this region, some flowers
including scarlet sage, morning glory, and tulips, which used to

the beautiful flowers and their fragrance make us think we have
already entered the hot summer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city government has created summer itself by means of
greenhouse cultivation and transplantation from other cities, and
has so far planted over 20,000 plants of several species along the
streets and city squares, including tulips last winter, which used
to be seldom seen outdoors in north China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Authority Warns Of Electromagnetic Radiation Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Radio and television relay stations
are the biggest source of electromagnetic radiation and impose a
potential threat to the health of residents nearby, the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) has warned.
</P>
<P>
Electromagnetic radiation is believed to have possible long-
term effects on people's health and to affect the normal operation
of electric appliances, medical equipment,and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are 10,200 radio TV transmitters with a
total output of 134,000 kilowatts. In some major cities like
Beijing, Guangzhou,and Wuhan, people living close to them had
direct exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
China also has over 81,000 transmitters with an output of 50,
000 kilowatts, for paging and mobile telecommunications services.
These transmitters are often built on the top of residential high-
rises and are becoming a new health threat to urban dwellers, SEPA
says. SEPA is considering ways to increase supervision and law
enforcement to reduce the risk from exposure to electromagnetic
radiation, its director Xie Zhenhua says.

<HEADLINE> China Giving Fines for Straw Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- In a joint effort, six Chinese
ministerial departments have banned the burning of the straw of
various crops along major roads and around airports to protect the
environment and safety.
</P>
<P>
People who do so and cause serious air pollution will be
subject to fines, according to a regulation jointly issued by the
State Environmental Protection Administration, ministries of
agriculture, finance, railways and communications ministries, and
the General Administration of Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
It prohibits the burning of straw within a 15-kilometer area of
airports, two-kilometer area of expressways and railways, and one-
kilometer area of major highways.
</P>
<P>
Municipal governments are also allowed to ban burning in
densely populated areas and near nature reserves, cultural relics
areas under state protection, forests, oil and grain depots, and
communication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection departments have been authorized to
fine violators.
</P>
<P>
China produces more than 600 million tons of crop straws each
year and farmers, especially in economically developed regions,
usually burn them whenever and wherever they like, thereby wasting
resources and causing pollution and even transportation hazards.
</P>
<P>
China plans to make better use of the straws within five years
to help solve the burning problem.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS, Rebels Blame Each Other for Breaking Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping Force
or ECOMOG backing the Sierra leone government and the rebel
Revolutionary United Front have blamed each other for breaking the
cease-fire Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire starting Monday is to clear the atmosphere for
substantive peace talks in Togo's capital Lome as from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"My men are not attacking, they are on the defensive," rebel
leader Foday Sankoh told local press in Lome, in response to
accusations from ECOMOG, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said the rebels remained committed to the truce, adding
he has in full control of the rebel's forces.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the ECOMOG, Colonel Chris Olukolade, had earlier
said that " Up till 5:00 a.m. this (Monday) morning we were under
intense attack from all these directions in places where we
control."
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG will not accept a situation where under the guise of
cease-fire some rebels want to take over positions that are
indisputably ECOMOG defense locations," he noted. The Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) today held a meeting of
west African foreign ministers before the former launch of the
Sierra Leone peace talks. The ECOWAS foreign ministers in Lome
are expected to help rivals in the country to start peace talks
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers meeting was designed to set the stage for
the peace talks, and endorse the on-going mediation by Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also aimed at setting the framework for
international assistance in the implementation of a subsequent
comprehensive agreement, notably in terms of truce monitoring,
humanitarian assistance and disarmament of combatants.
</P>
<P>
Senior envoys of Ahmad T. Kabbah's government led by
Attorney-General and Justice Minister Solomon Berewa have arrived
in Lome for the peace talks with the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The RUF will send about seven top officials with Solomon
Rogers, chairman of its war council, sitting in at the peace
talks, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. monitors have already started arriving in Sierra Leone to
observe the provisional cease-fire and the world body is expected
to deploy a larger observer force when a substantive agreement is
reached.

<HEADLINE> Western Chinese Oil And Gas Exploration Accelerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Western China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is entering a peak oil and gas production period,
with annual crude output capacity of 15 million tons in the
region's three basins.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai Mingzi, head of the Xinjiang Petroleum
Administration, some 40 oil and gasfields have been discovered in
the Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins with proven reserves
equal to 2 billion tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
He said that of 23 key oilwells being drilled in the Tarim
Basin, rich oil-bearing layers have been found in 13, and a large
oilfield with 45 million tons and a large gas field with 20
billion cubic meters of gas have been discovered in the Caidong
Desert and Hutubi County.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a rich oil-bearing structure with proven reserves
of more than 50 million tons was discovered in the Turpan-Hami
Basin recently. The Junggar Oilfield has started tapping its
Xiaoguai Oilfield, which has proven reserves of 59 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that because of the sharp increase in the
amount of proven oil and gas reserves, total crude oil production
capacity in the Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins is expected
to go up from 15 million tons to 17 million tons by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The three great basins are expected to have 1.5 billion tons of
proven oil reserves and annual crude output of 24 million tons by
the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Asia Needs Lower Rates for Sustained Growth: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB)
said Tuesday that Asia needs lower rates to ensure sustained
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Asian recovery is still fragile and growth will be below
potential until end-2000 or later and this means interest rates
have further to fall, said Mary Davis, chief Asia economist at
CSFB.
</P>
<P>
In the lead article of CSFB's Emerging Markets Quarterly: Asia
Report, which was released Tuesday, Davis said that strong
external balances and high levels of reserves indicate that credit
ratings should be upgraded, while budget deficits can easily be
funded locally, except for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A major external risk is a recession in members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but it is
unlikely in the near term, Davis said. The greater risk is that
overly tight policies derail the nascent recovery, Davis added.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong, the report said that domestic demand shows early
signs of recovery, with retail sales having seemingly bottomed out
and tourist arrivals ticking up. The key to sustained recovery for
Hong Kong still rests on property, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For More Investment In Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and business
people are calling for increased investment in Central Asia in an
effort to boost its trade with the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qunjie of the State Development Planning Commission told
a forum on increasing trade between China and the countries of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tadzhikistan and Kirghizstan
here today that the government will formulate policies to
encourage investment in agriculture, energy, technology, equipment,
and labor.
</P>
<P>
Government delegations from the five countries said at the
forum that closed here today that 300 projects are expected to be
funded by overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhesheng, the vice-president of the China Enterprise
Investment Association, told those present that the five countries
are China's close neighbors, that they and China complement each
other and that there is huge potential.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that Central Asian countries are facing
shortages and that they think that increased investment and
exports there will help China overcome difficulties caused by the
Asian financial crisis,
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and those countries was worth more than 900
million U.S. dollars last year, about double the figure for the
early 1990s. Those countries favor inexpensive, but high quality
Chinese clothing,shoes, machinery, and electronics products,
while China benefits from their cotton, fur, and minerals.
</P>
<P>
But China has a trade deficit and its investment in the region
accounts for only 0.2 percent of its total overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The Central Asian countries were separated from the Soviet
Union in the early 1990s and have a strategically-important
geographical location in linking Asia and Europe and they have
abundant oil and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Sadykhan Bekbergenov, the economic and commercial counsellor of
the Kazakhstan Embassy in China, said that there are 350 Chinese-
funded enterprises in his country and their products are popular
and that he hopes that more Chinese enterprises invest there.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Heping, a government official from the city of
Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, said that an increasing number of
Chinese enterprises can now invest overseas as the Chinese economy
gets stronger and his city has signed investment agreements with
Kirghizstan.
</P>
<P>
Trade has been increasing with central Asia thanks to the new
Eurasian railway. China has signed agreements on drilling oil and
gas and laying pipelines in Central Asia, and is planning to build
an industrial park there.

<HEADLINE> Chinese University Students Trade Technology For Company Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Three students at Shanghai Jiaotong
University have each traded scientific developments for as much as
ten percent of the technical shares of a Shenzhen company,
Monday's "Wenhui Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The three seniors in the electronics information college
developed a sound data output system that can help small and
medium-sized enterprises use their own phone systems to connect
with the Internet without computers.
</P>
<P>
The development last year won them the "Challenge Cup", a state-
level award for college students, and also caught the eye of
several enterprises, leading to a contract with the Shenzhen

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislation To Protect Private Property (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- In a move to protect private
property, China is examining a law to give private assets the same
treatment as state assets, sources at the National People's
Congress say.
</P>
<P>
A draft drawn up by Liang Huxing, of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Law Institute, was given a preliminary review by
the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that such a law would be a great step forward by
the government in protecting private property and would be the
materialization of the new constitutional ruling guaranteeing the
development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In a new amendment to the Constitution in March, private
businesses were promoted to the status of "important components"
of the socialist market economy from being mere "supplements".
The goal of the new draft is to give equal protection to all
legally-obtained properties, both state and private, without
regard.The NPC source says that it is the result of six years of
research.

<P>
Although the laws on market order and transactions are
basically good enough, those regulating property lag far behind,
because of the continued influence of the planned economy, an NPC
official explains,citing the General Rules of Civil Code and how
it proclaims that "state property is sacrosanct and not to be
offended", without a mention of non-state interests.
</P>
<P>
And, legal loopholes have led to fears for the safety of
personal property and a subsequent loss of capital to foreign
countries, observers say, and for some other reasons, the
interests of the common people are infringed upon from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC source, the draft proposes many changes to
existing practices in China in changing residence and real estate
registration. The formulation of the new law is in Category One
of the Legislative Agenda of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee,
which is expected to be adopted by the end of its office term in
2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Donors have contributed more
than 4.7 billion shillings (about 6.69 million U.S. dollars) to
facilitate Burundi peace talks during 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The donations were made by 21 donor countries and institutions,
the recipient, the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Foundation, has said.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Hashim Mbita, spokesman for the foundation,
named donors as Austria, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
China, Denmark, European Union, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Japan, Norway and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Others are the Netherlands, Sweden, Tanzania, the United
Nations, the United States, and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), according to media reports
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, established by former Tanzanian president,
Julius Nyerere, has been entrusted with facilitating Burundi peace
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said Nyerere has been impressed by the
progress made in a recent meeting by delegates of various
Burundian factions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which started on May 11 in Arusha town, north
Tanzania, has been convened by four committees established to find
a lasting solution to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere described the progress in the meeting as "appreciable"
and urged the delegates to continue with the same spirit during
the next session in June.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman Mbita also said the Committee on Nature of
Burundi Conflict, managed to conclude general debate on 21 items
pertaining to causes of conflict during the post colonial period
and approved a final report.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been riven by ethnic violence between the Hutu
majority and the Tutsi minority. The latter has ruled almost
continually since the country gained independence from Belgium in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have
been killed in a wave of massacres and a civil war in the tiny
central African nation.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Increases Investments in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's investments in agriculture
and rural development will account for 20.5 percent of the state
budget this year, surpassing the 1998 amount by 61.5 percent,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Priority investments and foreign Official Development
Assistance (ODA) in agricultural projects include 5 billion U.S.
dollars to fund a project to plant five million hectares of forest
and to assist the national program for hunger elimination and
poverty reduction in 1,715 poor communes, the report quoted
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other key projects focus on development of irrigation works and
water resource management, development of traditional rural trades
and agro-forestry products processing industries, upgrading rural
infrastructure and supporting agricultural promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agricultural experts, however, said that the
investment is only modest, meeting only half the sector's needs.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 20 international donors to agricultural
development projects in Vietnam. Among them are the World Bank,
the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, a total 130 ODA agricultural projects had
received 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in investment.

<HEADLINE> New York Beats Atlanta to Enter Eastern Conference Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks picked the
best possible time for their longest winning streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston scored 19 points and Patrick Ewing added 17 as
the red-hot Knicks completed a four-game sweep of the Atlanta
Hawks with a 79-66 rout and became the first team in NBA history
to advance to the conference finals as a No. 8 seed.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks won Game Five against the top-seeded Miami Heat to
close out the first round and then embarrassed the fourth-seeded
Hawks, who never hit their stride in the series. New York's five-
game postseason run matches the longest in club history.
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith scored 14 points for Atlanta, which shot just over
30 percent for the series. The Hawks missed 16 consecutive shots
and went scoreless for well over 11 minutes as the Knicks opened a
77-53 bulge during a stretch that spanned the third and four
quarters.
</P>
<P>
New York will face Indiana in the conference finals in a
rematch of their 1994 series, which the Knicks won in seven games
to advance to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will be meeting in the postseason for the fifth
time this decade, with Game One slated for Market Square Arena on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell capped a stellar series with 11 points off the
bench for the Knicks, who posted their first four-game sweep since
eliminating the Baltimore Bullets in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks have won seven of their last eight home games,
including the regular season. Atlanta dropped to 0-4 on the road
in the playoffs and has not won a postseason game outside of
Georgia since Game Two of the 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals
against Chicago.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a number of
model areas to increase the use of ISO14000 standards to improve
environmental control and coordinate regional environmental and
economic development, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
The model areas will be selected from economic or hi-tech
development zones and scenic spots in 46 major cities,according
to a State Environmental Protection Administration official.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of model areas will be helpful for improving
regional environment administrations, their international fame,
and their international trade, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Candidates of such areas need to have a comparatively
independent administration and a six-month-old environmental
control system in line with ISO14000 environmental control
standards of the International Standardization Organization (ISO),
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Model areas need to meet the requirements of enhanced
environmental awareness, standard environmental management system,
rational utilization of resources, and continued improvement of
environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the ISO14000 standards in 1996 and more than 100
enterprises have been given the ISO14000 certificates.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds Workshop on Environmental Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop is being held
here to discuss and review the first draft of a national framework
for environmental protection law and an environmental impact
assessment law for Myanmar, participated by various ministries.
</P>
<P>
The second two-day workshop, which began Monday, was organized
by the National Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) of
Myanmar in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Program
and the Hanns Seidel Foundation of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lal Kurukulasuriya, chief of the Regional Environmental Law
Program, said in his opening speech that the process of drafting
the National Environmental Law in Myanmar can be regarded as a
model and will be replicated in other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that because of the success of the process in Myanmar,
 Cambodia has requested similar assistance to draft an
environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar held the first national workshop on environmental
legislation in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The NCEA, since its inception in February 1990, has made
efforts to enhance environmental management in the country,
promoting public attention to environmental matters through public
environmental awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar adopted a national environmental policy in late 1994
with the aim of achieving harmony and balance between the
environment and development through the integration of
environmental consideration into the development process to
enhance the quality of life of all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the NCEA formulated and published Myanmar Agenda 21
which is a plan of action for sustainable development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Myanmar has altogether 57 environmentally related
laws. However, most of these sectoral laws are incidental
environmental laws and are not specifically intended for
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 167.7 Mln Dollar Aid to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has approved a
fund of 167.7 million U.S. dollars to supplement five ongoing
WB-assisted projects repairing flood-damaged infrastructure and
equipment in Bangladesh, said a WB press release reaching here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The funds are part of a broad assistance program to respond to
the urgent needs of the Bangladeshi government in the aftermath of
the worst floods in a century the country experienced last year.
</P>
<P>
The projects to be supported by the supplementary funds include
inland water transport, river bank protection, rural roads and
markets, coastal embankment and road rehabilitation and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the bank's assistance is to assist Bangladesh
in restoring key infrastructure and thereby enable restoration of
normal levels of economic and social activities, the release said,
adding that by providing supplementary funds for rehabilitation,
the assistance will reduce the government's need to cutback its
development program.
</P>
<P>
The WB has been following a three-part strategy to help
Bangladesh with its flood recovery effort: first, the bank
provided 200 million dollars last November in quick disbursing
assistance to help maintain macro-economic stability in the
short-term through the emergency flood rehabilitation project;
second, the bank has made use of supplementary credits and funds
freed up through restructuring of existing credits to repair
damaged infrastructure; and third, part of the bank's response
focuses on long-term strengthening of the country's capacity for
disaster preparedness and management, it added.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nuremberg Prosecutor: U.S., NATO Commit War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and its NATO
allies have committed military aggression by bombing Yugoslavia
and will not be exonerated from war crimes, a former Nuremberg
prosecutor said in an article published by "Chicago Tribune" on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Walter J. Rockler, a Washington lawyer, pointed out in the
article that the United States and NATO have "engaged in a
flagrant military aggression" by ceaselessly attacking a small
country, with an aim to show that they "run the world."
</P>
<P>
"The rationale that we are simply enforcing international
morality, even if it were true, would not excuse the military
aggression and wide-spread killing that it entails. It also does
not lessen the culpability of the authors of this aggression," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The former prosecutor invoked the judgment of the Nuremberg
Tribunal, which he said provides for "a primary source of
international law," to corroborate his view that the United States
and NATO can hardly elude the charges of "supreme international
crime" for kicking off "a war of aggression" against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an
international crime, it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within
itself the accumulated evil of the whole," Rockler quoted the
declaration of the Nuremberg Tribunal as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted Robert Jackson, Supreme Court Justice and the
head of the American prosecution staff, as saying "that launching
a war of aggression is a crime and that no political or economic
situation can justify it;" and that "If certain acts in violation
of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States
does them or whether Germany does them."
</P>
<P>
Rockler also cited article 2 of the U.N. Charter and resolution
2131 of the U.N. General Assembly, which prohibit the intervention
in the domestic jurisdiction in any country and threats of force
or use of force, and stipulate that forceful military intervention
is aggression and a crime without justification.
</P>
<P>
"Putting a 'NATO' label on aggressive policy and conduct does
not give that conduct any sanctity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He criticized NATO for having violated its basic commitment to
the United Nations by bypassing U.N. approval for the current
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The on-going airstrike by the United States and NATO also
constitutes "a continuing war crime," since international law
forbids unrestricted air bombing, Rockler said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "bombing the 'infrastructure' of a country -
- waterworks, electricity plants, bridges, factories, television
and radio locations -- is not an attack limited to legitimate
military objectives."
</P>
<P>
"Our bombing has also caused an excessive loss of life and
injury to civilians, which violates another standard," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over 1,200 innocent civilians, including
Serbians, Albanians and even Chinese correspondents, have been
killed and thousands more wounded in NATO's bombing spree over the
past 50-plus days.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Rockler went on to say, the bombing also impinges
upon "at least two provisions" of the U.S. Constitution on the
part of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"Under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, Congress, not
the president, holds the power to declare war and to punish
offenses against the law of nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under Article VI of the Constitution, treaties, far from being
mere scraps of paper as we now deem them to be, are part of the
supreme law of the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
He condemned "the random destruction and killing by advanced
technological means" as a way to set right so-called "humanitarian
violations." "This is mere pretext for our arrogant assertion of
dominance and power in defiance of international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rockler also lashed out at the government control of the media.
"Reporters rely on the controlled handouts of the State Department,
Pentagon and NATO, seeing their duty as one of adding colorful
details to official intimations of Serb atrocities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Promotes Database Software Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide market for
database management software (DBMS) grew 18 percent to five
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, said a new study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rapid market growth, Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a U.S.
market research firm that conducted the study, said the Internet
caused an explosion of data in terms of Web content.
</P>
<P>
In the future, many business practices, including business-to-
business electronic data interchange (EDI), e-commerce and e-
business, will utilize Internet technologies, compounding the need
for efficient storage and management software, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
The EDI market is expected to grow from 937 million U.S.
dollars in 1996 to two billion dollars by 2000, according to an
earlier forecast by Dataquest, also a U.S. market research firm.
This segment embraces the electronic communication of business
transactions, such as orders, confirmations and invoices between
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The DBMS controls the organization, storage, retrieval,
security and integrity of the data in a database. The software
accepts requests from the application and instructs the operating
system to transfer the appropriate data.
</P>
<P>
According to Frost &AMP; Sullivan, the majority of DBMS revenues
are generated in North America and Europe. The Asia-Pacific
region and the rest of the world are much smaller markets, but
they are expected to comprise larger shares of the world market by
the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The total database market is split into relational database and
object-oriented database. In a relational database, relationships
between files are created by comparing data, while the latter is
suited for data with complex relationships that are difficult to
model and process in a relational manner and also capable of
handling multimedia data types like images, audio and video.
</P>
<P>
The research firm said that relational database comprised
almost 98 percent of the DBMS market in 1998. Factors that will
drive the relational database software market include the growth
of the Internet, explosive interest in e-business and demand for
improved customer information.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests 19.2 Million Dollars in Chemical Company in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced on Monday that it has signed a joint
venture contract with Chengdu Chemical Company Limited (CCCL) of
China to establish a new company that will take over and expand
CCCL's high-purity potassium hydroxide business.
</P>
<P>
High purity potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a chemical product
used in industries such as food preparation, cosmetics, batteries,
ink and dye products. As these sectors in China expand and
upgrade, their need for KOH is steadily increasing, said IFC, a
member of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new company, Chengdu Huarong Chemical Company Limited (
CHCCL) will sign agreements with the IFC to receive 19.2 million
dollars in equity and debt financing after registration procedures
are completed.
</P>
<P>
The project will set an example for the industry through the
use of modern, efficient and less-polluting technology, the IFC
said. It will also promote development in two interior provinces
of China -- Sichuan, where the project is located, and Qinghai,
where there is potash required for KOH production.
</P>
<P>
The CHCCL will operate a new production line of high purity KOH
with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons. It will use the IFC's
financing to build an additional 20,000 tons per year production
line of high purity KOH in Pengzhou city, Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's financing to the CHCCL will consist of an equity
investment of 3.2 million dollars, or 25 percent of the company's
registered capital, and a loan of 16 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to raising capital, the IFC also arranged
substantial technical assistance funded by the governments of
Switzerland and Italy to improve the CCCL's accounting system,
management organization and cost control practices.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Wiring Inspections on Boeing 727s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Monday ordered inspections on electrical
wiring found in the fuel tanks of Boeing 727 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The FAA issued the directive after it ordered emergency tests
on the tubes that carry the electric wires last week.
</P>
<P>
The agency's order Monday requires 727 operators to remove wire
bundles from the fuel tanks, inspect them for any chafing and
replace them as needed. All the wires must also be wrapped with
an additional protective layer of teflon.
</P>
<P>
The FAA provided a timeline requiring planes with more than 30,
000 flight hours to complete the inspections and teflon wrapping
within 30 days. Planes under that mark have until they reach 30,
000 flight hours to perform the inspection and wrap the wires.
</P>
<P>
Worried that a mixture of fuel, air and electricity could spark
an explosion, the FAA issued its directive after workers found
severe wear on wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets.
Mechanics also discovered wear on wiring used to power in-tank
fuel pumps and signs of electric arcing.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the FAA ordered inspections of a similar area of the
727's cousin, the Boeing 737.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Assists Iraqi Oppositions against Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States will help
Iraqi opposition groups organize themselves in an attempt to
overthrow President Saddam Hussein, the State Department said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told a briefing that the administration
would assist these groups in establishing offices in New York and
London and possibly a satellite office in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the groups also would get computers, training in civil
administration and advice on distributing anti-Saddam information.
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups, newly united under the re-formed Iraqi
National Congress, had said they planned also to seek in a meeting
with Secretary of State Medallion Albright U.S. military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said Washington was not ready for military help.
</P>
<P>
"We're not prepared to take action that is premature," he said.
"There are a number of steps that have to be taken before we're in
a position to provide lethal assistance."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright wants to learn the opposition groups' plans
and see how the United states can help, and aid would begin
flowing after a general assembly of opposition groups in northern
Iraq in early July.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has proclaimed that overthrow of Saddam
is a major U.S. objective. U.S. Congress last year endorsed a
plan to provide 95 million U.S. dollars to Iraqi opposition groups
ad 2 million dollars for anti-Saddam radio broadcasts into Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Magic Coach Daly Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chuck Daly resigned his post as
the head coach of the Orlando Magic on Monday, nine days after his
team was upset in the first round of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old coach, whose career spanned two decade and
included two NBA titles in Detroit, was in the final year of a
three-year contract worth 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a great run, a great career," he said at a news
conference. "This is a finale for me in coaching. This will
conclude my coaching career."
</P>
<P>
Daly said the Magic's playoff elimination by Philadelphia in
four games and tensions with star Penny Hardaway didn't play a
role in his decision.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway's future with the team is unclear and he plans to
become a free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
"It's time. It's as simple as that," Daly said. "The mind is
willing but the flesh is weak."
</P>
<P>
Daly said all the travel and games had taken a toll, and he
decided it was time to leave coaching.
</P>
<P>
Orlando missed the playoffs in his first year, but this season
tied for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. Despite
the first-round playoff loss, Daly had described the lockout-
shortened season as one of the most satisfying of his career.
</P>
<P>
His contract included a clause that gave him the option to
continue coaching at $5 million a season, accept a position as a
club consultant for 200,000 U.S. dollars or leave Orlando for
another job.
</P>
<P>
Daly coached the 1992 Olympic team to a gold medal in Barcelona.
He and Lenny Wilkens are the only coaches to have won NBA and
Olympic championships.
</P>
<P>
Daly, who led the Pistons to titles in 1989 and 1990, was hired
by the Magic on June 3, 1997 and had a 74-58 regular-season record
in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
He was introduced into the Hall of Fame in 1994 and worked as a
television analyst for three years before joining the Magic. He
began his NBA coaching career with Cleveland in 1981-82 and guided
the Pistons for nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
When the Magic failed to qualify for the postseason in 1998, it
marked the first time Daly missed the playoffs after coaching a
full season.
</P>
<P>
Daly has a career regular-season record of 638-437 in 13 years.
In 12 playoff appearances, his teams went 75-51.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reduces BIR's Target by 400 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reduced
Monday the collection target of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
(BIR) this year by 16 billion pesos (400 million U.S. dollars) by
promptly allocating the difference evenly between the Bureau of
Customs and the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The Journal newspaper reported Tuesday that the decision will
reduce the BIR's target of 380.077 billion pesos (9.5 billion U.S.
dollar) to only 364.077 billion pesos (9.1 billion U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
It was "a reflection" of the government's resolve to keep the
projected deficit of 68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S.
dollars) within only 2.2 percent of gross national product, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Bureau of Customs has a new target
of 95.561 billion pesos (2.39 billion U.S. dollars) from 87.561
billion pesos (2.19 billion U.S. dollars) while the Bureau of
Treasury has 27.77 billion pesos (694.25 million U.S. dollars)
from 19.77 billion pesos (494.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted National Treasurer Briones as saying that the
deficit target remains unchanged despite doubts raised earlier by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which wanted Finance
Secretary Edgardo B. Espiritu to justify his insistence of keeping
the original target.
</P>
<P>
The realignment of collection targets was a direct consequence
of an IMF position tending to doubt the capability of the
Philippine government to achieve revenues totaling 521.907 billion
pesos (13.05 billion U.S. dollars) while spending 590.301 billion
pesos (14.75 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is expected to arrive on Wednesday to complete
unfinished business in the fiscal sector that has also delayed
approval of the next tranche of some 230 million U.S. dollar
support financing for Manila, the paper said.

TAIYUAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The electric engineering on a 266.6-
km-long railway, which connects Shenmu County in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province and Shuozhou City in north China's Shanxi
Province, is under way.
</P>
<P>
The spanning of a total of 425-km electric net lead for the
Shenmu-Shuozhou railway needs a total investment of 236 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The railway is the western part of the country's second trunk
line for coal transport from its west to its east, linking Shenmu
City with Huanghua City on the Bohai Bay in Hebei Province. The

<HEADLINE> Large-Scale Military Exercises Staged in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- An international naval and aerial
joint military exercise codenamed "OCELOT 99" was conducted on
Monday in the northwestern part of Poland and some coastal areas,
the Polish News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separate naval military exercise codenamed "
PIRANIA" was also conducted in the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
A variety of planes participated in the international naval and
aerial exercise, including Polish Mig-29s, Mig-23s, Mig-21s, Su-22
s, and some similar types of planes from the Czech Republic, as
well as French Mirage 2000s and German Tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the planes were used to "provide aerial
cover for enforced peace" in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the drill assumed that a "no-fly zone" had
been established between two warring nations. Once the zone was
violated, the international air forces would immediately go into
action.
</P>
<P>
The Czech, German and Polish air defense artillery and missiles
on the ground and in the sea would then launch attacks at presumed
targets.
</P>
<P>
In the naval situation, more than 30 naval vessels, planes,
bombers, landing craft, 5,000 military troops and all recognition
and command systems were involved in the drill codenamed PIRANIA.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was designed to improve the launching of artillery
and missiles, and locating and destroying submarines.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the two exercises, which were deemed
closely related to the ongoing Kosovo crisis, have been the
largest of their kinds in Poland so far this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Monday as investors were still concerned about higher interest
rates in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 174.61, or by 1.6
percent, at 10,654.67. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 23.64
at 1,306.65 while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell
66.48 at 2,453.66.
</P>
<P>
Investors' caution about higher interest rates was a major
factor in stock markets over the past week after the Federal
Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that
more signs of inflation would prompt it to raise the rates in the
coming months. The blue chip index gave up 84.04 points, or 0.77
percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
While investors were still worried about the warning today,
Credit Suisse First Boston issued a "sell" recommendation for
Citigroup, Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan and Bank One on the ground
that the Year 2000 computer bug in international counterparts
could disrupt business and hurt earnings for the U.S. banks. Both
the worries about rates and Y2K hurt the market.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 10.82 at 626.05 and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 9.96 at 785.41. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.74 at 440.40.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,054 down, 952 up and 536
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 734.99 million shares from 685.49
million in the previous session.

<P>
YANGON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
will pay an official visit to the Republic of Korea (ROK) soon to
strengthen  ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Invited by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the ROK
Hong Soon Young, U Win Aung will pay the visit, the Myanmar
authorities announced Tuesday without giving the date of his trip.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for U Win Aung to visit ROK since
November 1995 when former Myanmar foreign minister U Ohn Gyaw
toured the country.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Myanmar and ROK signed a loan agreement in
Yangon, according to which ROK was to extend a loan of 13.587
million Korean Won (then 16.8 million U.S. dollars) to Myanmar for
its electric power distribution improvement project.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, ROK's investment in Myanmar
amounted to 99.33 million dollars in 20 projects at the end of
1998 since Myanmar opened to foreign investment in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Calls for Defiance of Rebels' Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Jaffna Security Forces
Commander has called on the district's government agent and his
officials to defy the order of the Tamil rebels to abstain from
work on Tuesdays and Fridays, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Major General Lohan Gunawardena, the commander, said they must
report for duty Tuesday or they will have to face pay cuts, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The government agent and his staff had kept away from work last
Friday following the rebels' threat.
</P>
<P>
The threat last week was initially for the government agent and
his staff in the Jaffna district, the former stronghold of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who has been fighting the
Sri Lankan government since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in the north
and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that other government officials will also be
issued the same order by LTTE soon.
</P>
<P>
The courts in Jaffna had also been affected by LTTE threats
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been trying to sabotage government work in the
peninsula since early 1996 following military victories in the
area, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted official sources as saying that threats were all part
of an ongoing LTTE campaign to challenge government authority.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the rebels had stepped up operations in
the peninsula. The number of confrontations between the forces and
rebels had increased considerably of late.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Coach Claims Shuttlers Need Help From Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Going home empty-handed in the
Sudirman Cup and World Championships has made Indonesian head
coach Christian Hadinata determined to find a better way to groom
shuttlers for the Thomas and Uber Cups and the Olympic Games next
year.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia must involve more experts in psychology,
physical training, nutrition and in the field of medicine.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Indonesian badminton history, none of the
national shuttlers reached the semifinals in this month's
championships since it was first staged in Malmo, Sweden, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem in our failure in Denmark was our preparation,
which was not supported by experts. We only involved physical
trainer Tahir Djide three weeks before the championships," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best we can do in tournaments with very limited
preparation. It took shock therapy to learn that we have lots of
weaknesses," he added.
</P>
<P>
Christian said national shuttlers could not handle the pressure
during critical points in either tournament.
</P>
<P>
"They need more motivation and consistency. They were really up
and down. The athletes rely on their coaches to motivate them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shuttlers need a full-time expert at the National Training
Center in East Jakarta. Even world number three women's singles
Camilla Martin of Denmark and All England mixed doubles specialist
Simon Archer of England discuss their problems with their
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
"A sports psychologist is needed to overcome the pressure and
their mental barriers. We only need the help to build their
character to become tough athletes that never give up easily. The
psychologist has to be a full-timer so as to understand the
athletes' characteristics and personalities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said he hoped the Badminton Association of Indonesia
would support his idea.
</P>
<P>
"With our total failure in the championships, I hope top
officials will support my idea if we want to retain the Thomas Cup
and the Olympic gold in men's doubles next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian also mentioned a lack of sports science and
technology as a barrier for coaches to improve their skills.
</P>
<P>
The former doubles specialist named several shuttlers,
including men's singles Hendrawan, women's singles Cindana and
men's doubles of Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan, as potential
athletes for intense training.
</P>
<P>
"We must be able to train them better and improve their natural
talents to reach international standards," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cave Found to Be Largest Bird Nest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists on expedition
to a karst cave in southwest China's Guizhou Province have claimed
that the cave is believed to be the largest nest of migratory
birds in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of white-back rain-swallows are lodging in
the cave, which is located in Xiantang Township of Huishui County,
according to Professor of Geography Yang Jiongli from the Guizhou
Normal University.
</P>
<P>
The professor said the three-floor cave is 196 meters high and
50-70 meters wide. The cave, with a total height of over 300
meters, is the tallest karst cave found so far in the country.
</P>
<P>
Xiantang, which is 130 kilometers away from the provincial
capital Guiyang and covers 166.5 square kilometers, is home to 12,
629 karst caves.
</P>
<P>
The local people, many of them from ethnic minority groups,
hope to develop tourism with the karst caves and swallows.

<HEADLINE> Liabilities of Troubled Philippine Firms Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Total liabilities of Philippine
companies filing for a suspension of payment with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped 78.53 percent to 1.61
billion pesos (40.25 million U.S. dollars) for the four-month
period to April this year, Business World reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted data of SEC as saying that as of April 26,
only four companies have filed petitions for suspension of debt
payments, against 16 companies in the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Those which sought suspension of debt payments this year
included a manufacturing firm, an investment holding company, a
real estate firm and a lending company.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, real estate and manufacturing were the
sectors greatly affected by the financial crisis in 1998. Three
manufacturing firms owed more than what they earned last year,
prompting them to seek suspension of debt payments.
</P>
<P>
All told, 97 corporations have filed for suspension of debt
payments since April of 1982, with liabilities amounting to 121.95
billion pesos (3.05 billion U.S. dollars) as of April this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Industrialization of Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 experts and officials
across China are meeting at a symposium here to probe ways for
boosting scientific research in the field of traditional Chinese
medicine and the industrialization of the sector.
</P>
<P>
China is abundant in plant resources for medicine with 12,807
varieties, and the reserves of only 320 types of widely used
medicinal plants stand at roughly 8.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, participants at the symposium, which opened Monday,
agree that the traditional Chinese medicine sector has developed
slowly due to a relatively low level of scientific research and
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology has decided to launch
very soon a project to modernize the traditional Chinese medicine
sector for industrialization. Major objectives of the project
include selecting some medicines with proven cures for scientific
research for future entry into developed countries, setting up a
clinical experimental base for traditional medicine and a number
of herb planting and medicine production bases, establishing a
research and development system in line with internationally
recognized standards, and forming a number of industry groups with
sharp competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Given the smooth implementation of the projects, the
participants believe that the share of traditional Chinese
medicine at the international herbal medicine market will increase
from the present five percent to some 15 percent in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will cooperate with the State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, the State Drug Administration and
other departments concerned to implement the ambitious project.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Urged to Help in US Lamb Tariff Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Meat New Zealand Chairman John
Acland urged Prime Minister Jenny Shipley to consider "personally
approaching" United States President Bill Clinton in a bid to save
New Zealand's lamb exports.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the United States International
Trade Commission recommended a range of "safeguard measures" to
protect the U.S. sheep meat industry, including a tariff of around
20 percent on all lamb imports over the 1998 level and a
quantitative restriction of 52 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Tuesday quoted Acland
as saying on his recent return from lobbying in Washington against
proposed protectionist moves by the U.S. Government that the
signals from American bureaucrats are disappointing and New
Zealand's meat industry has "no cards left to play."
</P>
<P>
It's time for the NZ Government to roll out "big guns", he
said.
</P>
<P>
One possibility would be for Shipley to make a direct appeal to
Clinton, who will decide by the end of next week on the proposal
for tariffs to be used against New Zealand and Australian lamb,
NZPA quoted Acland as saying.
</P>
<P>
In terms of free trade and protectionism, Acland said, "we've
taken all our clothes off, and are standing there naked, while
America has put its fur coat on."
</P>
<P>
He was concerned that imposition of American tariffs could
provoke New Zealand farmers to street demonstrations when U.S.
President Clinton arrives for the Informal Meeting of Leaders of
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation in September in Auckland,
the biggest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"There's a likelihood that when he comes out here they'll march
a mob of sheep on to the golf course when he goes to play ... or
something like that," Acland said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand needs to tell the United States just how ridiculous
it is to hold itself up as a champion of global free trade, while
using tariffs or other trade barriers against unsubsidized New
Zealand meat, he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and Australia supply most of the United States'
lamb imports, and last year shipped about 258.5 million NZ dollars
(143 million U.S. dollars) worth of lamb to the Americans. New
Zealand earned about 120 million NZ dollars (66 million U.S.
dollars) from its share of the trade.

tough four-set battle to world number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
crashed out of the French Open at the first hurdle here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, champion in 1996, showed the sort of form that
brought him the Australian Open title earlier this year to
overcome Chang 6-2, 5-7, 6-0, 7-6 (10-8).
</P>
<P>
American Chang, the youngest champion in Paris when he won the

ranked 85 in the world, 3-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in just under
three hours.
</P>

a much easier day, beating powerful Croat Mirjana Lucic 6-2, 6-2
at a canter.
</P>
<P>
Women's world number one and top seed Martina Hingis dispatched
Dutch player Amanda Hopmans 6-1, 6-4 to set up a re-match of this
year's Australian Open final with local favourite Amelie Mauresmo.

The Williams sisters Venus and Serena both advanced, with Venus
dismissing France's Alexandra Fusai 6-1, 6-1 and Serena thrashing
6-4, 6-0.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's SEA Training Program Goes on Despite Shortage of Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's training program for
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei will continue
despite a lack of financial support from the government and the
public, an official with the National Sports Council (KONI) has
said.
</P>
<P>
Moch. Hindarto, who is in charge of athlete development,
expressed concern that the council only received promises for 9
billion rupiah (1.1 million U.S. dollars) from the National
Development Planning Board (Bappenas) and the Gelora Senayan
Management Board.
</P>
<P>
He said Bappenas had agreed to allocate 5.5 billion rupiah from
the state budget for KONI and would distribute the money in June.
This is well short of 22.3 billion rupiah KONI asked for.
</P>
<P>
"We will use the money to finance the athletes' participation
in overseas events. But I don't think the money will be enough
because we will only be able to allocate 1.5 million rupiah for
each athlete. This is only enough money to pay the departure tax,"
he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided that key players can practice with players at
provincial or regional chapters who are at the same level of
talent. But it will be difficult if the players' ability has
already exceed their countrymen," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Bappenas had turned down KONI's request for an
additional 7.2 billion rupiah for transportation and
accommodations in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said the amount of the bonuses would be decided by
KONI chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar.
</P>
<P>
KONI is facing difficulties financing the training programs and
accommodations for athletes competing in the Games. While waiting
for Bappenas to disburse the 5.5 billion rupiah, KONI was forced
to borrow 500 million rupiah from its treasury to finance board
and lodging, spending money and recreation costs for its athletes.
</P>
<P>
The council is only financing those athletes seen as having an
opportunity to win a medal in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will compete in 20 events at the SEA Games.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region, in
southwest China, is now taking substantial measures to help
workers laid off from state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all labor departments at regional and prefecture
levels have established re-employment centers which are
responsible for distributing unemployment insurance among the laid-
offs and helping them find a new job.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 4,311 state factory laid-offs in Tibet,
and 98 percent of them are receiving their subsidies on time,
according to government officials in charge of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Tibet has set up 90 re-employment
centers which have raised 2.59 million yuan in fund and paid 1.32
million yuan to the laid-offs for their basic living spending.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 280 of the factory laid-offs were trained at these
centers, and 133 of them got re-employed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Five people die from smoking-
related diseases in Mexico each time a clock strikes the hour, a
health official said Monday, while expressing concern that many
Mexicans start smoking in their early teens.
</P>
<P>
Marco Polo Pena, a leading member of the National Council
Against Addictions, said 80 percent of the 14 million smokers in
the country began the habit before they were 14, while five
percent smoked their first cigarette before they were 10.
</P>
<P>
Pena, a representative of the Mexican Institute of Social
Security, said 90 percent of all deaths from lung cancer are
associated with nicotine poisoning, which also causes 80 percent
of deaths from lung emphysema.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Mexico, an average number of five persons die
from smoking-related diseases every hour, 120 per day and over 42,
000 every year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are now 1.1 billion smokers on a worldwide
scale, Pena stressed the importance of promoting healthy habits to
be highlighted on the World Day Without Tobacco on May 31.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Brazil's Sao Paulo
exchange, the largest in Latin America, closed down sharply Monday
with the benchmark Bovesa index reducing by 4.88 percent to 11,154
points, against 12,727 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was some 403 million U.S. dollars against 384
million dollars on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
In Rio de Janeiro, the stocks also closed down 4.4 percent on
Monday, at 38,838 points against 40,650 points on the previous
session. The volume traded in Rio was some 4.44 million dollars
against 8.64 million dollars on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the sharp decline of the Brazilian stocks was
caused by the rumor that Argentina's currency, the peso, would be
devaluated, which could damage Brazil's economic recovery and
trade between Brazil and Argentina, though the Argentine
authorities have denied the rumor.
</P>
<P>
Economists said Argentine officials' denial of an exchange rate
change came too late and many traders remained unconvinced.

<HEADLINE> Romanian: Presidential Commission Set Up to Draw Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The target of the Presidential
Commission for improving the business environment in Romania is to
draw up a Fiscal Code, President Emil Constantinescu told a
Monday's press conference occasioned by the Commission's setting
up.
</P>
<P>
He said no healthy and prosperous business environment was
possible if it was not based on a comprehensive, clear, fair,
rational, transparent and stable Fiscal Code, that guarantees
quite high budget revenues.
</P>
<P>
The President's initiative is in reply to the frequent requests
made by the Romanian and foreign business communities in Romania
regarding the improvement of the tax system, which is considered
burdensome and to have a negative impact on both taxpayers and
revenues to the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the commission is a consultative
body that will carry out its activity on multilateral principles
of impartiality and its single objective is to propose a
comprehensive, clear, fair, rational and transparent Fiscal Code.
The Romanian and foreign business communities in Romania, the
Executive and the trade unions have representatives in the
Commission for improving the business environment in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's meetings will be public and will take place in
various cities of Romania, so that all categories of taxpayers may
bring amendments to the Tax Code Draft.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu insisted that the elaboration of a
Fiscal Code was pressing and expressed hope that the Code would
become effective under his mandate, and thus be submitted to
Government prior to the close of this year.

UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The first regional hearing
for the United Nations Millennium Assembly for Western Asia opened
in Beirut on Sunday, focusing on U.N. role in the new century, the
U.N. General Assembly reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The numerous comments and proposals from participants centered
on the need for the U.N. to redefine its role in the changing
world," the General Assembly said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"There was a broad criticism of the hegemony exercised by the
remaining superpower over both the General Assembly and the
Security Council," it said.
</P>
<P>
"How can we render the U.N. effective and restore its
credibility when we know very well what is happening in today's
unipolar world?" an identified participant was quoted as asking.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's representative Ghassan Salame said reform of the U.N.
should include a "revision of the concept of sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the cold war, he added, "the U.N. had prompted
high hopes, which had succumbed to a sentiment of despondency".
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting with participants from regional countries,
is chaired by U.N. Under-Secretary-General lakhdar Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Assembly, proposed by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, is expected to be held in New York in the autumn of 2000
and to accompany the 55th U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
It could be the largest gathering of heads of states and
governments ever, with preparations including collection of
regional proposals.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Released from Maryland Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson walked out of a
suburban Maryland jail Monday after only serving a quarter of his
one-year sentence for attacking two motorists in a fender-bender.
</P>
<P>
"His release was long overdue, as far as I'm concerned," his
attorney Paul Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson left the Rockville, Maryland, jail after staying 3 1/2
months there. The former heavyweight champion smiled but said
nothing to reporters outside the gate.
</P>
<P>
Tyson went home hours after an Indiana judge announced her
decision to end Tyson's probation for a 1992 rape conviction. The
Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 on Friday to grant Tyson's
release, but Indiana authorities needed to approve the decision
before Tyson could go home.
</P>
<P>
Tyson will be on parole until February and he must meet certain
probation conditions -- including 200 hours of community service --
during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Shelley Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he will have to sit down
and talk with Tyson about his boxing plans. Asked if he thought
Tyson might fight this year, Finkel said, "I haven't seen any
reason for him not to."
</P>
<P>
Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand
in Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, the
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 32, last fought on January 16. He was sentenced on
February 5 to one year, but another 60 days were added as
punishment for violating probation on his rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> Emerging Market Stock Down 24 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The emerging market stock
markets lost 24 percent of the value of internationally tradable
stocks as compared with the previous year, according to the 1999
edition of Emerging Stock Markets Factbook released by the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Factbook documents the ravages of the crisis on emerging
stock markets, through, for example, the IFC Investable Composite
index of 1,190 stocks, which measures returns on stocks which are
available to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Between April and September 1998, the worst months of the Asian
contagion, emerging market markets lost nearly 45 percent of their
value.
</P>
<P>
Widely considered the most authoritative source of information
available on emerging stock markets, the Factbook provides
statistics on 79 emerging markets for 1998 and earlier years, with
a focus on the 51 markets covered by a series of IFC Indexes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the worst crisis year for emerging markets
ever recorded, these markets had almost 24,800 listed companies,
representing more than half of the world stock exchange listings.
</P>
<P>
There combined market value of 1.9 trillion U.S. dollars was
equivalent to about 7 percent of world market capitalization, with
five of the world's 20 largest stock markets belonging to the
category. In terms of world stock trading, more than 1.9 trillion
of trades were conducted in emerging markets in 1998, about 8
percent of global stock trades.
</P>
<P>
The 13th edition of the Factbook contains some 370 pages of
basic economic data and key trends in capital flows and stock
prices, world stock market series, IFC Index features and results,
and detailed profiles on individual stock markets, said the IFC, a
member of the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Setting up U.N. Mission in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has proposed the establishment of the United Nations Mission
in East Timor (UNAMET) to organize a popular consultation on its
future.
</P>
<P>
He made the proposal in his report to the Security Council on
Saturday, which was released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the mission will include political, electoral,
civilian police, information and administrative/financial
components.
</P>
<P>
Its full membership includes 241 international staff and 420
U.N. volunteers, up to 280 civilian police and some 4000 local
staff, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For UNAMET to be effective, Annan said, it must have the full
confidence and backing of the Security Council, function with the
full cooperation of the Indonesian authorities and have the
necessary resources.
</P>
<P>
The time-frame is tight for the setting up of the mission as
the parties have set August 8 as the date for the ballot, he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, defined by the U.N. as one of the 17 remaining
Non-Self-Governing territories in the world, had been a Portuguese
colony until 1975. An internal rift led Indonesia to annex it the
following year. The U.N. has since been seeking a resolution to
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Indonesia and Portugal under the U.N. auspices
resulted in agreements in May for the ballot to decide whether it
will practice a wide range of autonomy or become independent.

<HEADLINE> Germany Celebrates 50th Anniversary of Its Founding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 24 (Xinhua)--A ceremony was held Monday in Berlin's
historic Reichstag building to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the federal republic.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 guest attended the ceremony, including German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with his cabinet members, the
outgoing president Roman Herzog with his successor, the
president-elect Johann es Rau, and leaders of Germany's all 16
federal states.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, in his last open speech, depicted a optimistic picture
of Germany's future while calling on his people to be more willing
to reform and not to forget the history.
</P>
<P>
" We can go into the 21st century with confidence," said
Herzog, whose term will end on July 1 when he will be replaced by
Rau.
</P>
<P>
The next generation of Germans are able to build their country
on current basis, that is a democratic, economically strong and
wealthy Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was a deficit that eastern and western Germans
had not actually merged with each other. He critisized the
government's short-sighted policy and German people's lack of
public spirit.
</P>
<P>
In a time that reforms are needed, it is necessary that
long-term aims always made clear, said Herzog.
</P>
<P>
Germans must not forget the country's dark Nazi past, a history
of mass-murders, war, speaking and thinking prohibitions, and
Germans must do their best to transfer this experience to the next
generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
" It's our duty ahead of history," said Herzog.
</P>
<P>
The next generation Germans should be "those who accept their
past and those who are going towards the future with
self-awareness" he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlies this day, a church service at the Berlin Cathedral was
held to open the celebrations, which marked the introduction of
Germany's constitution, the Basic Law, on May 23,1949. And on
September 21 that year, the Federal Republic of Germany officially
came into existence.

<HEADLINE> Any U.N. Resolution Should Be Result of Direct  Yugoslavia-U.n. Talks, Envoy Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday voiced its
hope to see the future U.N. resolution on Kosovo is "the result of
the direct negotiation between the Yugoslav Government and the
U.N.," because only in this way can the proposed resolution be
carried out in the future.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told the press conference that "We expect
the future resolution of the Security Council to be different from
the document of NATO, not to be any ultimatum or dictate."
</P>
<P>
However, the Yugoslav ambassador said that he wants to be the
future U.N. resolution "to be the result of the direct negotiation
between the Yugoslav Government and the U.N. And only on that
basis, such a resolution can have a chance to be implemented."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the bombing campaign should stop, this is the
natural and pre-condition of any peace efforts and achievement of
any peace settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat made the remarks as the NATO
bombing entered the third month Monday, creating serious
humanitarian crisis not only in Yugoslavia, but also in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that the Group of Eight statement, issued about
two weeks ago in Germany, is the basis for any future dialogue on
a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from seven major Western countries and Russia
issued a statement, saying that any foreign military presence in
Kosovo should be approved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome peace initiatives from other countries," he said,
"We are nevertheless determined to defend our country by all our
means until the very end."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Businesses' Y2K Preparations Far From Finished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The majority of small firms in
the United States have yet to undertake a formal assessment of
their Y2K compliance, according to a survey research released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses have already spent an estimated 10.6 billion
U.S. dollars on hardware and software upgrades that will help
avoid Y2K problems, said research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC), which just completed the survey research.
</P>
<P>
But as a whole, small businesses' preparations are far from
finished. With the countdown already started, IDC estimates that
small firms in the United States will spend an additional 6.9
billion dollars before the ball drops on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
Although some 2.9 million small businesses with PCs have
already reviewed their hardware and software formally to ensure
Y2K compliance, IDC estimates that 3.3 million others have waited
until the last minute to prepare for the millennium. The latter
have not yet made a formal assessment of what steps they need to
complete in order to be truly Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the largest share of small businesses in the
United States have little to worry about in the year 2000 because
they rely on standard software packages with upgrades and
"software patches" readily available over the Internet. But firms
still have to examine the programs that they use and decide to
upgrade.

<HEADLINE> FAO Supports Agricultural Projects in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The UN Organization for
Agriculture and Foodstuffs (FAO) is willing to lend assistance in
drawing up a national plan for the development of an endurable,
modern agriculture in Romania, Jacques Diouf, general director of
the organization, said on Monday in his meeting with Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
Diouf is paying a three-day visit to Romania starting on 23,
together with Manfred Lindau, representative for Europe of this
organization.
</P>
<P>
FAO official said to Constantinescu that he wished Romania
participated in bilateral programs within the World Trade
Organization, underlining that the agriculture has not only an
economic role but also a commercial and social one, through
traditions that must be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Both sides proposed to issue a national strategy for the
agriculture, through a collaboration between FAO and Romanian
universities, alongside the creation of the National Agency of
Agricultural Consulting, one to lend help to agricultural
producers.
</P>
<P>
FAO is the largest specialized UN organization, its objectives
being to guarantee the population's access to adequate food, in
view of eradicating nutritional insecurity and rural poverty; to
promote, develop and improve agricultural policies meant to
increase the contribution to economic and social progress; to
evaluate and analyze the worldwide situation in terms of
nutrition, agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and to bring the
problems of food to the core of international concern.
</P>
<P>
Romania has been a FAO member since 1961 and benefits from a
range of technical assistance projects. Presently, two projects
are in progress, namely the Polluted Soil Rehabilitation Project
and the Project for the support of private farmers in seven
counties affected by floods, providing corn for seed on a free
basis. Another two projects have been submitted for analysis and
decision-making. They refer to the development of a distribution
system for agricultural information and the elaboration of
agriculture and rural development strategies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Hand-over Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Hand-over process entered
the second day Monday with Professor Ibrahim A. Gambari,
ambassador of Nigeria's mission to the United Nations addressing
a public lecture in Abuja, urging the in-coming government to
strengthen political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The hand over process which started here Sunday with an inter-
denominational church service praying for the incoming
president-elect Alusegun Abasanjo will end next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Gambari made a comprehensive analysis of the factors
 hindering the progress of Nigerian society, in his speech titled
"The Road Map for Nigeria into the New Century".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria simply cannot tolerate the fact that its current per
capita income is well below the level at the time of its
independence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He listed major tasks Nigerians are facing as the consolidation
of national unity, the transition of the military's role,
democratization and economic and social development. The
incoming civilian government must give priorities to strengthening
political stability and alleviating ethnic conflicts, building up
the rule of law, good governance, said the professor.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the incoming administration to pay sufficient
 attention to the Niger Delta Issue, where local residents are
often conflicting with the government on oil income allocation and
environment deterioration.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he suggested the government should step
up its efforts in restricting, rehabilitating, and reconstructing
Nigeria's economy, and in diversifying the nation's economy from
its wholly relying on the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS,  Rebels Blame Each Other for Breaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping Force
or ECOMOG backing the Sierra leone government and the rebel
Revolutionary United Front have blamed each other for breaking the
cease-fire Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire starting Monday is to clear the atmosphere for
substantive peace talks in Togo's capital Lome as from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"My men are not attacking, they are on the defensive," rebel
leader Foday Sankoh told local press in Lome, in response to
accusations from ECOMOG, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said the rebels remained committed to the truce, adding
he has in full control of the rebel's forces.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the ECOMOG, Colonel Chris Olukolade, had earlier
said that " Up till 5:00 a.m. this (Monday) morning we were under
intense attack from all these directions in places where we
control."
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG will not accept a situation where under the guise of
cease-fire some rebels want to take over positions that are
indisputably ECOMOG defense locations," he noted. The Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) today held a meeting of
west African foreign ministers before the former launch of the
Sierra Leone peace talks. The ECOWAS foreign ministers in Lome
are expected to help rivals in the country to start peace talks
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers meeting was designed to set the stage for
the peace talks, and endorse the on-going mediation by Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also aimed at setting the framework for
international assistance in the implementation of a subsequent
comprehensive agreement, notably in terms of truce monitoring,
humanitarian assistance and disarmament of combatants.
</P>
<P>
Senior envoys of Ahmad T. Kabbah's government led by
Attorney-General and Justice Minister Solomon Berewa have arrived
in Lome for the peace talks with the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The RUF will send about seven top officials with Solomon
Rogers, chairman of its war council, sitting in at the peace
talks, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. monitors have already started arriving in Sierra Leone to
observe the provisional cease-fire and the world body is expected
to deploy a larger observer force when a substantive agreement is
reached.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Monday as investors were still concerned about higher interest
rates in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 174.61, or by 1.6
percent, at 10,654.67. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 23.64
at 1,306.65 while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell
66.48 at 2,453.66.
</P>
<P>
Investors' caution about higher interest rates was a major
factor in stock markets over the past week after the Federal
Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that
more signs of inflation would prompt it to raise the rates in the
coming months. The blue chip index gave up 84.04 points, or 0.77
percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
While investors were still worried about the warning today,
Credit Suisse First Boston issued a "sell" recommendation for
Citigroup, Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan and Bank One on the ground
that the Year 2000 computer bug in international counterparts
could disrupt business and hurt earnings for the U.S. banks. Both
the worries about rates and Y2K hurt the market.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 10.82 at 626.05 and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 9.96 at 785.41. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.74 at 440.40.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,054 down, 952 up and 536
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 734.99 million shares from 685.49
