<HEADLINE> India's 1996-97 Economic Survey Tabled in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram tabled the economic survey for 1996-97 before the
on-going parliament today, saying that the government would make
hard decisions to push the country's economy ahead.
</P>
<P>
During the current 1996-97 fiscal year starting April 1,
agricultural production is expected to show good recovery with an
estimated three percent growth as against a negative 0.4 percent
in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
But the industrial sector's development has slowed down to an
estimated 8.7 percent from 11.6 percent due to a fall in
electricity production and mining. As a result, the economic
growth rate is estimated at 6.8 percent against 7.1 percent growth
in 1995-96, the economic survey said.
</P>
<P>
Export growth has slowed down markedly in recent months. A
combination of sluggish imports and reasonably buoyant inflows of
invisible and capital flows have led to a build-up of foreign
exchange reserves by about 2.8 billion US dollars to 19.8 billion
from 17 billion at the end of March last year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit was expected to drop in the current fiscal
year owing to sharp deceleration in non-oil import growth. The
current account deficit is expected to decline from 1.7 percent of
GDP in 1995-96 to less than 1.4 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for prudent fiscal and monetary policies to check
inflation, which is expected to be one percentage point below the
7.6 percent average for 1995-96, the survey cautioned against
short-term temptations of easing money supply.
</P>
<P>
The survey asked the government to take hard decisions to peg
the fiscal deficit at four percent of GDP, check inflationary
pressures, curb external and internal borrowings and improve the
infrastructure sector for sustaining high economic growth.

<HEADLINE> UK to Join FBI Phone Tap System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has secretly agreed
with its EU partners to set up an international telecommunications
tapping system in cooperation with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
The agreement covers telephones and written communication --
telexes, faxes, and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
To make tapping easier, telecommunication companies would be
obliged to give security and intelligence agencies the key to
codes installed in equipment sold to private customers.
</P>
<P>
Britain is an enthusiastic supporter of joint action in this
area, which is conducted on an inter-governmental basis with no
role for the European Commission, the European Parliament or the
European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The British paper The Guardian said detailed plans are being
drawn up by officials in a secret network of EU committees
established under the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Key points of the plan are outlined in a memorandum of
understanding signed by EU states in 1995, it added.
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties argued the plans raised a number of privacy and
data protection issues and must be the subject of a full public
debate.
</P>
<P>
Doug Henderson, the Labor Party's home affairs spokesman,
expressed concern about accountability and said the rules of
authorization should be disclosed.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian investors purchased a
record volume of foreign securities in December, with American
shares topping the list.
</P>
<P>
According to Statistics Canada, Canadians bought 2.7 billion in
foreign offerings during the month, bringing the annual total to
13.5 billion dollars, which also set a record.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian investors channeled a significant portion of their
investment into U.S. stocks in the last four months of 1996," the
federal agency said, as quoted by reports today.
</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast to the pattern of the last three
years when they directed the major portion of their buying to
overseas stocks, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, foreigners returned to the Canadian market to
buy 2.4 billion dollars in securities, mostly bonds.
</P>
<P>
In November, they sold off 2.5 billion dollars in Canadian
securities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, total foreign investment in Canadian securities was
13.9 billion dollars, down from 16.3 billion in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Hope for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work with
Portugal to build a long-term and stable friendly relationship,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a meeting with visiting Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio, at which Sampaio extended his condolences
over the death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation, Li said, "A solemn memorial
meeting for Comrade Deng Xiaoping was held at the Great Hall of
the People this morning. The memorial speech, delivered by
President Jiang Zemin, voiced the aspirations of the people of all
ethnic groups across China."
</P>
<P>
Li went on, "The great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng, has taken root deeply
in the whole country, while the lines, principles and policies
proposed by Comrade Deng are well understood by the Chinese
people."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will turn grief into strength and continue
to fulfil Comrade Deng's wish, he said, adding that the country's
present situation of stable politics, growing economy, unity of
various nationalities and social progress will last for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that President Sampaio's current visit will
further promote the existing friendly cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the establishment of Sino-Portuguese
diplomatic relations 18 years ago, the two countries have been
enjoying smoothly developing cooperation in various fields. He
added that both sides maintain good cooperation in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li said that he appreciated Portugal's consistent "one
China" policy and its efforts to support China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio noted that there is smooth development not only in
bilateral relations but also in all matters concerning the return
of Macao to China.
</P>
<P>
According to Sampaio, the delegation accompanying him to China
is the biggest one ever to be sent by Portugal. He said he hoped
that the current visit would promote Portuguese-Chinese ties even
further.
</P>
<P>
He described the Portuguese-Chinese Joint Declaration on Macao
as "a document of historical and world significance". He added
that the settlement of the Macao issue will not only be an
important chapter in the history of Portuguese-Chinese relations
but also a new one in the history of the relations between the
European Union and China.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said his country is willing to work closely with China
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that since the signing of the joint declaration on
Macao more than nine years ago the two countries have cooperated
well to implement its terms. He added that there is much work to
do within the rest of the transitional period, less than three
years.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We hope that both of us will work more closely in an
effort to ensure a proper settlement of all kinds of problems
during the transition."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation at Sampaio's statement that the
government of Portugal will strictly abide by the joint
declaration and resolve the Macao issue with strategic foresight.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed that it would not be difficult to
find means of settlement of any problem, acceptable to both sides,
"if both of us can proceed from the consideration of the relations
between our two countries, with political foresight."

<HEADLINE> Sirens Bring Back Memories of Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- From ten o'clock this morning
sirens across the country were sounded for three minutes, in
memory of the late venerable Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Beijing, the sound of sirens could be
heard here and there, reminding people of the years when Deng was
busy with the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jingli, a driver of the No.389 passenger train between
Beijing and Taiyuan cities, sound his train's siren.
</P>
<P>
In the late years of the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976) Deng
made great efforts to restore order in railway transportation,
which was in serious chaos as local railway officials were engaged
in class struggle.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Shougang (Capital Iron and Steel) Group were in
deep mourning amid the blaring of sirens and in the course of the
memorial meeting that followed. But the furnaces were in full
operation.
</P>
<P>
"We will turn out more and better steel, providing high-quality
steel products for the country. This is the way we mourn Comrade
Deng Xiaoping," said Zhao Yan, a skilled worker at the No.3
furnace.
</P>
<P>
As the sirens hooted, more than 40 people working at the China
Youth Development Fund felt a sense of deep grief. In June 1992
the fund received a donation of 5,000 yuan, the donor being
identified only as "an old Communist Party member", to help school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
Arduous investigations showed that the donation came from Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Wenbin, who works with the fund, many people
have made telephone calls in the past few days saying they wish to
help more poor children attend school.
</P>
<P>
Great sadness also fell upon the people in charge of security
around Deng Xiaoping's house and his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping often sent people to visit us and help
solve our difficulties in work and life," Gao Jijun, a police
officer, said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's suburban Daxing County, natives of Liuminying
Village stood in silent tribute as the sirens sounded. Led by a
village official, they planted 500 pines and cypresses early in
the morning to commemorate Deng, who was a staunch advocate of
voluntary tree-planting. For 11 years in a row he planted trees in
different places around Beijing.

<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks here this evening with
visiting Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister David
Levy.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qian said that since China and Israel
established diplomatic relations five years ago they have signed a
total of over 10 agreements, and bilateral economic, trade,
scientific and technological cooperation has taken an important
position in their relations.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned in particular bilateral high-level visits, saying
that such visits have laid a solid foundation for strengthening
mutual understanding and promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Levy noted that Israel-China relations have reached a stage of
pragmatic development, and the two sides will jointly explore new
ways and fields for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both also agreed to set up a committee composed of experts from
concerned departments to discuss bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After hearing briefing by Levy on the latest developments in
the Middle East peace process, Qian said that China, as a
permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,
always holds that Middle East issues should be settled
comprehensively and fairly through political consultations on the
basis of relevant resolutions of the United Nations, and China
supports and participates in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
China will support every fair and rational agreement reached
between the Arab and Israeli sides, added Qian.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the international community hopes to see
the Middle East gradually become a peaceful region, and China is
ready to make every possible effort to assist this endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Chief Appeals for Democracy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said in Gaborone, Botswana today
that tribalism and military coups were major threat to Africa's
emerging democracies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing government ministers and opposition leaders from 18
African Commonwealth countries, Anyaoku said while military rule
seemed to be on the retreat on the African continent, there was
no guarantee such rule cannot return.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries were ruled by heavy-handed leaders who,
once elected, may see themselves as the sole conscience and
embodiment of the will of the people, Anyaoku was quoted by
Southern African Broadcasting Assoiciation (SABA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
A two-day African Commonwealth Summit, due to start on
Wednesday, will be under the chairmanship of Anyaoku with South
African Parliamentary Speaker Frene Ginwala as rapporteur, SABA
said.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Assoiciation (SAPA) said earlier that
ruling party and opposition parliamentarians from 18 African
Commonwealth countries would present their views on democracy to
their heads of state and government at the Commonwealth-organized
"round-table".

U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 80,000 employees of hospitals in the Sindh province

<P>
Pakistan's foreign debt now stands at around 30 billion U.S.
dollars while its foreign exchange reserves have been left no more
than one billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Economy to Continue Steady Growth, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will
continue to cruise along with steady growth, low unemployment and
low inflation for at least two years, a survey of corporate
economists concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the median forecast
by the National Association of Business Economists was that the
U.S. economy would grow by 2.6 percent this year. It was a more
optismistic outlook than the median forecast of 2.3 percent growth
issued by the group last November.
</P>
<P>
It also would be a quicker growing pace than last year when the
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, the business economists expected a slowdown to 2
percent growth. But one fifth of the economists said that they do
expect a recession in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly survey said that three-fourths of the 228 members
of the association believed "the level of unemployment at which
inflation increases is not sharply defined." However, they still
believed that a strong job market could trigger inflation.
</P>
<P>
Just over half the economists said that they expected the U.S.
Federal Reserve to keep monetary policy on hold for the next six
months, while 41 percent expected some tightening.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Remains Strong in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence
remained virtually unchanged in February from its high January
level, the New York-based Conference Board reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index prepared by the research body
held at 118.4, virtually unchanged from 118.7 in January.
</P>
<P>
The latest results showed consumers clearly upbeat about
current business activity. The Present Situation Index advanced to
143.4 in February, up two points to a 27-year high.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence survey is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer confidence held steady in February largely because
consumers continue to view current business activity as strong,"
said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Consumer Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also slightly more confident about the job
market. More than 32 percent say jobs are now plentiful, up from
just under 31 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also showed that there was a moderate decline in
consumers' expectations for the next six months. Fewer respondents
than last month looked for the economy to gain momentum.

<HEADLINE> "Civil Servants Exam Results Encouraging": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Encouraging results have been
achieved since China began to select civil servants through open
examinations three years ago, according to a personnel official
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuezhong, deputy minister of personnel, said that 27
provinces, cities and autonomous regions across the country have
begun to recruit civil servants through open exams. The number of
posts is 18,000, but more than 200,000 candidates are expected to
take the exams.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a national meeting held in this
capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The public selection of civil servants through exams is a
breakthrough for China's personnel system reform. Almost all
provincial governments hold such exams, and in some places they
are open to candidates from all over China.
</P>
<P>
Local regulations have been laid down on the basis of the
Provisional Regulations on the Civil Service System and the
Temporary Regulations on the Recruitment of Civil Servants, to
provide legal foundations for the exams.
</P>
<P>
This new examination and recruitment system will be universal
in China by the end of the century, according to Zhang.

LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people died in car
accidents and six more were reported missing in the past two days
as winds reaching up to 90 mph and driving rain lashed Britain in
the worst storms for seven years.
</P>
<P>
The people were killed in two cars collisions: one in King's
Lynn, in eastern England, and the other on the M5 near Bristol. In
both incidents the weather conditions were described as
"atrocious."
</P>
<P>
A rescue operation is still under way to save a group of
soldiers stranded on an exercise at Dartmoor.
</P>
<P>
As well as causing fatal accidents, the storms left routes
blocked by fallen trees and closed bridges across Britain.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before strong storms raced in from the Atlantic Monday
night, the Environment Agency issued tidal warnings for the
South-West.
</P>
<P>
"Amber" warnings of waves crashing over sea walls and beaches
were issued for north Cornwall, north Devon and Chesil Bank in
south Dorset.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers Without Health Insurance on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of New Yorkers
without health insurance has jumped in the last five years, the
New York Times said today, quoting a study which is said to have
implications for the entire country.
</P>
<P>
One quarter of New York City residents under 65 now have no
health insurance at all: the exact figure is 24.8 percent, up from
20.9 percent five years ago. And the number of children without
insurance has gone up twice as fast as the number of adults.
</P>
<P>
In New York State, the percentage of people under 65 who are
uninsured was 17.2 percent, up from 13.9 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crisis that is growing exponentially," said Mark
Green, the New york City public advocate, who released the report.
</P>
<P>
In his failed health plan, U.S. President Bill Clinton had
aimed to provide health coverage for the 38 million Americans
without health insurance. But ironically, by 1995, the number of
Americans without health insurance had grown to 40.3 million, or
17.4 percent of the population under 65.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed this growth in the number of people
without health insurance to more and more companies which have
curtailed health benefits as the cost of health care has gone up,
requiring employees to contribute heavily to premiums.

BUCHAREST, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Chamber of Deputies
(congress) Vice Chairman Vasile Lupu and Defense Minister Victor
Babiuc today went to the Chinese Embassy here to pay their homage
to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.

continue to go forward on the way pointed out by him."

Babiuc wrote: "Deng Xiaoping is a great friend of the Romanian
people, and his ideas have had positive influence on world
stability and cooperation."
</P>

Babiuc, who has visited China twice, told the embassy officials
that it was due to Deng Xiaoping's thoughts that China had made
such profound changes, that Hong Kong and Macao would be returned
to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Two US Utilities to Buy British Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two United States utilities,
the American Electric Power Company and the Public Service
Company, have decided to acquire Britain's Yorkshire Electricity
Group, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
American Electric and Public Service will each invest about 360
million U.S. dollars in the 2.43 billion U.S. dollar deal while
the rest will be provided through a loan to Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck at a time when the British market is
undergoing deregulation at a faster pace than the U.S. market. The
British government spun off its utility industry in 1990 to the
private sector, creating 12 regional electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
American Electricity Power, based in Columbus, Ohio state, is
one of the giants in the industry, serving about 7 million
customers. Public Service, based in Denver, serves about 3 million
customers. Yorkshire, based in Leeds, distributes electricity to
2.1 million customers in northest England.

according to Interfax News Agency.

<P>
However, Meri has asked Vahi to stay in the position until a new

has to step down after the prime minister resigns,
</P>
<P>
Meri is expected to nominate a new candidate in two weeks, press
reports said.
</P>

Vahi handed in the resignation as he is accused of involvement in a

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Companies Urged to Penetrate Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean companies should
intensify efforts to penetrate lucrative export markets in Japan
and the Far East, the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO)
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report, Jetro said Zimbabwe had a vast array of products
that could be sold in Japan, and these included African
handicrafts and antiques, in addition to such traditional exports
as tobacco and minerals.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, which earned Zimbabwe over 100 million U.S. dollars,
was another area the southern African country could exploit and
attract high-spending Japanese travellers, JETRO said.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Zimbabwe and Japan currently exceeds 182
million U.S. dollars, with the bulk of Japanese purchases of over
136 million U.S. dollars made up of tobacco and minerals.
</P>
<P>
JETRO said Zimbabwean companies could invite Japanese experts
to identify local products which could find export market niches
and use Japan as a launch-pad into the vast and lucrative market
in the whole of the Far East.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh dismissed here today reports about the
establishment of relations between Yemen and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here this afternoon, the visiting
Yemeni president affirmed that Yemen would establish relations
with Israel after it restores occupied Arabs territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy had recently been quoted
by Israel Radio as saying that Israel and Yemen would soon open
interests offices in the other country.
</P>
<P>
Levy also revealed that Israeli officials had met with Yemeni
Foreign Minister Abdul Krim al-Iriyani to discuss the mater.
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the Yemeni Ministry of Foreign Affairs
refuted Monday the reports
</P>
<P>
Saleh pointed out that Israel was not serious in its approach
to peace, particularly in the presence of the U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
He added that the establishment of any sort of relations with
Israel will only be considered in the frame of an Arab summit
conference.
</P>
<P>
On Yemen's request to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
Saleh said Yemen was in constant contact with GCC members, which
include Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
On his current visit to the UAE, President Saleh described it
as a "fraternal" visit to reassure himself about the health of UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Sheikh Zayed covered bilateral
relations and other issues, asserting that their views were
identical on all matters discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president left here after a previously unannounced
brief visit to the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Build First Oil Refinery by Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will build its first oil
refinery at Dung Quat in the Quang Ngai province in central
Vietnam by itself after withdrawal of foreign partners from the
project, Petro Vietnam (PV) said today.
</P>
<P>
PV confirmed its determination to undertake the project saying
that PV was in disagreement with seven foreign partners over the
unacceptable preferential conditions they have set in a
feasibility study for the refinery last year.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include Vietnamese government's financial help
to build infrastructure at the Dung Quat refinery and a government
policy ensuring refined oil prices.
</P>
<P>
PV said, under government approval, it will conduct a new
feasibility study for the refinery in which 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars capital will be mobilized from Official Development
Assistance (ODA) and other sources.
</P>
<P>
Dung Quat is an under-developed area, about 1,000 kilometers
from the oil fields to the south.
</P>
<P>
The oil refinery, which is planned to be completed by 2000,
would give a much needed boost to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam started to recover crude oil ten years ago. The total
crude oil production in 1996 reached 8.8 million tons, all of them
were for export. At the same time, it has to import 5 million tons
refined oil every year as a result of lack of refinery.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Against Building Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Several hundreds of people,
including Palestinian political leaders and Israeli left-wing
activists protested today against the Israeli government's plan
to build a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Faisel Husseini, a Palestinian National Authority official on
Jerusalem affairs, termed the plan as a "declaration of war
against the Palestinian people" at the demonstration held at
Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa), where the new Jewish neighborhood
is planned to be built.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told
the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of the Knesset
(Israel's parliament) that he would give the green light to the
construction plan in southern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Husseini told reporters that in his view the Israeli
government "is making a huge mistake and playing with fire."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Israeli government's offer of an
equivalent number of new housing units for Palestinian residents
in the eastern part of Jerusalem "is an empty gesture."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he would submit his proposals to the
cabinet Wednesday for approval of the building of 3,500 homes in
Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem, alongside the 2,600 for
Jews in the first phase of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The figure was agreed upon at a meeting between Netanyahu and
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert Monday, and was subsequently
confirmed by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials reportedly hoped that the announcement will
mute Palestinian objections to the construction of Har Homa, to
which Netanyahu has committed himself amid very heavy coalition
pressure.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian officials said that if the Israeli
government really concerns about the peace process and the
future of Jerusalem, it should sit and discuss the matter with
the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
As originally envisioned by planners, Har Homa will contain
about 6,500 homes. If 2,600 are to be constructed now, it
remains unclear when the remaining 3,900 will be built.

customer satisfaction was needed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Date for Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today
announced here today that the 7th presidential elections will
be officially launched on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Interior Minister Ali Mohammad
Besharati at a meeting of the ministry's officials with
Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that up to now
four people, three clergymen and one non-clergy, have so far
announced their candidacy to run for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, current Parliament
Speaker; Mohammad Khatami, former minister of culture and
Islamic guidance; Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, former information
minister; Saied Reza Zavareie, vice chairman of the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the 54-year-old parliament speaker
is the front-runner who has strong possibility of winning the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the main factor of his victory is the support
by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the strong religious
camp called the Association of Combatant Clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The official report said that next president is supposed to
assume office in August.
</P>
<P>
Since Iran's Constitution bars present President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani from running for a third consecutive term, so the
64-year-old president has to step down from the office.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Rafsanjani might serve as a deputy
leader or still as No. 2 man in the Islamic regime just
below Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The House of People's
Representatives or parliament today approved a 28 million U.S.-
Dollar-loan obtained from the African Development Fund (ADF), the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>

The loan provided by the ADF for the modernization of the Bole
international airport in Addis Ababa is free from interest and to
be repaid in 40 years time after a 10 years grace period.

The proclamation approved by parliament said the expansion of
the airport holds a significant place in promoting the economic
activities being carried out in the country.
</P>
<P>
The modernization project which costs about 126 million U.S.
Dollars would enable the airport to meet the standards set by the
International Civil Aviation and accommodate ever increasing
air-traffic during the coming 20 years, the proclamation added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parliament today also approved the air transport
service agreement signed by the governments of Ethiopia and

<HEADLINE> Britain Presents New Proposals on Lifting Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
launched a fresh bid to end the European Union's (EU) global ban
on British beef products exports by presenting a package of new
proposals to the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler,
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg put forward details of
the new plans and urged the EU Commission to take swift action to
lift the 11-month beef ban.
</P>
<P>
"I have urged the commission to ensure that the consultation
procedure laid down in the Florence Agreement is initialed
immediately so that we can resume exports of meat from animals in
export-certified herd as soon as possible," Hogg was quoted by the
BBC television as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The British agriculture minister has also written his
counterparts of the 15-nation bloc to "seek a constructive
contribution to the discussion of our proposals."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Agriculture Ministry said Monday
that the new certified herd scheme was designed to ensure that
exports come only from cattle which have never been in contact
with BSE or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Northern Ireland are likely to be among the first
wave to benefit from the possible partial lifting of the beef ban
as there are better records of cows' history in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a worldwide ban on exports of British beef
products last March when the British government acknowledged
possible links between mad cow disease to its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.

<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- France today denied that the
visit to be paid early next month by French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette will be cut short as the Israeli government has
thought.
</P>
<P>
"This visit is not cut short. It will take two days and be
carried out under the best auspices taking into account the
excellent Franco-Israeli relations," said French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commentaries by Israel over the schedule of de
Charette's visit "did not correspond well with the warm manner"
of Israel when it accepted the French proposal for the visit at
first.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether de Charette will visit the Orient House in East
Jerusalem, which was the seat of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the spokesman said that the foreign minister will
not go there this time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor strongly
protested with France over its arrangement for the visit by its
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government is unhappy with the ways in which the
visit will be made, as they have been presented. This stay of 24
hours does not correspond with a three-day visit they have
promised," said the spokesman.

South African imports increasing by 57 percent and exports by 172
percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Draw Inspiration From Deng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- With the sound of sirens
reverberating across China today, the name of Deng Xiaoping has
been written in history and rooted in the hearts of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
This morning, top Chinese leaders joined more than 10,000
people in the Great Hall of the People to bid final farewell to
Deng, the chief architect of China's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Since his death on February 19, the entire country has been
plunged into deep grief. And from that day on, people flocked to
Deng's hometown of Guang'an County, southwest China's Sichuan
province, to honor the memory of the venerated revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
In old revolutionary bases such as Baise, the Taihang Mountains
and Dabie Mountains where Deng Xiaoping had led troops to fight
numerous battles, people recounted and recollected his courageous
deeds.
</P>
<P>
When Shexian County in the Taihang Mountains was stricken by
heavy floods, Deng's family donated 12,000 yuan and financed 38
children who lost their beloved ones in the flooding.
</P>
<P>
When the sad news of Deng's death reached Tibet, native people
presented white hadas (a kind of silk fabric) and colored Buddhist
streamers to show their love for the elderly leader who brought
well-being to the highland region.
</P>
<P>
In 1950s, the troops under Deng constructed a highway linking
up Sichuan Province with Tibet, and decades later he once again
boosted Tibet's economy by way of mobilizing nation-wide
assistance to the region.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who are thought to be emotionally strong shed tears,
for it was Deng Xiaoping who contributed to founding the Chinese
army 70 years ago, bringing order back to the army in the late
years of the "Cultural Revolution" and carrying out military
reform in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"If there were not Comrade Mao Zedong, we Chinese people would
have to grope in the dark for longer time... If there were not
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese people would not have today's
new life," Jiang Zemin said in his eulogy to Deng Xiaoping at the
memorial meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was Deng Xiaoping who led the Chinese people in shaking off
the shroud of "Cultural Revolution" and building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Greek Foreign Minister Condoles on Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Thodoros
Pangalos visited the Chinese embassy here today to express
condolences on the death of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos signed his name on the visitor's mourning book and
expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of the Chinese leader
to Chinese Ambassador to Greece Yang Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a brief interview with Xinhua that the
name of Deng Xiaoping is closely related to the liberation of the
Chinese people and he is one of the greatest figures who have
changed the world face of the century.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Deng Xiaoping and his comrades inspired dreams of
the whole generation and his great cause to build and develop
China is one of the most important events which is compatible to
the important events like the Russian Revolution at the beginning
of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said he came here today to express his
respect to Deng Xiaoping, who died on February 19 at the age of
93.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, hundreds of Greeks including senior
government officials and representatives of overseas Chinese as
well as foreign diplomats accredited to Greece went to the embassy
to pay their tributes to Deng.

<P>
The Xiaogang villagers in Fengyang, east China's Anhui
Province, will never forget that Deng Xiaoping gave them strong
support when they were scolded for experimenting with the
household responsibility system, saying that the system was
correct if it could raise output.
</P>
<P>
Only under the agreement of Deng Xiaoping was the system
possible to be applied across the country. Today every household
in this get-rich-first village of Xiaogong hangs the portrait of
Deng to cherish the memory of the great leader who had led them to
shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
People from the special economic zones will not forget that it
is Deng who initiated the reform and opening-up policy and
pioneered the establishment of the special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
When people were wondering about whether the establishment of
such zones would also lead to capitalism, he answered: the special
economic zones belonged to socialism not to capitalism. He often
encouraged the pioneers to overcome various kinds of difficulties
to promote the development of the special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
People in Shenzhen, the city which took lead in the reform and
opening-up drive, are grieving over the loss of the architect of
China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will never forget their "minister of logistics," who
attached greatest importance to the development of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
"We will not forget Deng Xiaoping as a man who led us to live a
comfortable life," a lot of elegiac couplets dedicated to him thus.
</P>
<P>
Since the passing of Deng, people across the country have been
deeply saddened. But at the same time they have handled their work
calmly and in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiao, a farmer in Wangzhuang village, Liuling County, north
China's Shanxi Province, wrote an article commemorating Deng
Xiaoping, in which he said: "I was 13 years old when Chairman Mao
left us. I couldn't stop crying, not knowing what life lies
ahead. And now Xiaoping has gone, and he left us with a promising
and flourishing country."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Criticizes Some EU Members' Attitude on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
criticized Britain, France and Germany's attitude during Monday
night's discussion among European Union (EU) Foreign Ministers
on a proposal for Turkish Cypriot participation in the EU-Cyprus
structured dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides described the three members' joint attempt
as "unsatisfactory" and "not helpful," saying that Greece's refusal
to accept the proposed text was "correct".
</P>
<P>
Monday night's meeting focused on a joint British, German
and French proposal to include a phrase in the final text of
the common statement that "circumstances will allow soon the
participation of all the Cypriots in the accession process."
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Dutch EU rotating presidency called off
today's meeting between the EU and Cyprus, while a meeting of the
EU-Cyprus Association Council was scheduled to go ahead as
planned.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the three countries' attitude raises
certain questions, as they refused to accept other texts which
could have incorporated their concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the proposed text could not be accepted and
that Greece was very correct not to agree on the proposed
phraseology," Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He explained the proposed text could have multiple
interpretations, some of which were contrary to the EU
decision on March 6, 1996, which provides for Cyprus' membership
negotiations to begin six months after the Intergovernmental
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted it could have complicated Cyprus' accession
process and made efforts for a Cyprus solution more difficult.
It would also complicate the EU enlargement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has made it clear that it does not
object to Turkish Cypriots participation in membership talks, but
wants them to be part of the official delegation of the
internationally-recognized Republic of Cyprus, which, according to
an EU 1995 statement, is the "sole interlocutor."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides,
who is in Brussels for the Association Council meeting, had asked
for meetings with his British, German, French, Italian and Dutch
counterparts to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion, applied for
full EU membership in 1990. It signed an association agreement
with the European Community in 1972 and a customs union
agreement in 1987.

<HEADLINE> UN Starts Pulling out Peace-keepers of Angola on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
peace-keeping mission in Angola begins pulling out of the southern
African country on Friday, U.N. special envoy in Angola Blondin
Beye said here today.
</P>
<P>
Beye, who left Angola's capital of Luanda today for the U.N.
headquarters in New York, will on the same day report to the U.N.
Security Council which is expected to hold a special meeting on
the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said he would personally discuss the issue with Kofi
Annan, the new U.N. Secretary General, in an effort to put a
satisfactory full stop to the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Beye also gave credit to the good job done by the U.N.
peacekeeping troops, military observers and engineers, which he
said has laid a sound foundation to the success of a lasting
peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Beye disclosed that Annan will pay a visit to Angola, and he
said he will make public the exact date of the U.N. chief's visit
when he returns to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remaining 50 members of parliament from the
former rebel movement, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), will arrive in Luanda tomorrow to
assume their posts, a positive development toward national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The present government and the UNITA are currently narrowing
their differences over power sharing and a couple of other issues
before they form a national unity government and a united army to
usher Angola into an era of peace and development.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Foster Small-Scale Mining Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25, (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government is urging its State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) to
strengthen the small-scale mining sector through quality control
and training.
</P>
<P>
"We have about 600,000 small-scale miners in the country who
remain disorganized. If these people were organized, the country
could be earning more revenue," Energy and Minerals Minister
Abdallah Kigoda said here today while inaugurating the
Corporation's Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda called on STAMICO to educate the small-scale private
miners on the quality of minerals to ensure that they were not
exploited by tycoons who bought the minerals from them cheaply
and sold dearly.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our small-scale miners do not know the actual value
of the minerals they got. Therefore, this has led to their being
exploited, facilitating the rich to become richer while they
remained paupers," said Kigoda.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged STAMICO to provide cheap mining
facilities to the miners and also formulate an open market for
them to check smuggling of minerals into neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is because Tanzania is a leading producer of tanzanite
(a kind of precious stones) in the world. But it is funny that
these minerals find their way into neighboring countries," he
noted, adding that his ministry was putting final touches on the
mining policy.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Calls for Scientific Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- German Research Minister Juergen
Ruettgers has called on scientists to deal with gene technology
responsibly after reports that Scottish researchers successfully
cloned sheep.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ian Wilmut, an embryologist at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh, announced Saturday that he had successfully replaced
the genetic material of a sheep's egg with the DNA from an adult
sheep and create a lamb that is a clone of the adult.
</P>
<P>
That announcement shocked the scientific world, with many
researchers fearing that the same techniques could also be used to
take a cell from an adult human and use the DNA to create a
genetically identical human.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ruettgers referred to the embryo protection law of
Germany which bans the manipulation of human genetic make-up.
</P>
<P>
"Cloned humans are not allowed and will not come into being,"
he assured.
</P>
<P>
The successful cloning also triggered reaction from U.S.
President Bill Clinton, who on Monday ordered his national
bioethics advisory panel to review the impact of cloning
technology and make recommendations within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by White House spokesman Michael McCurry as
describing cloning as "a very troubling subject."
</P>
<P>
Upset by the same news, German member of the European
Parliament Dagmar Roth-Behrendt called the cloning "unethical and
unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
She called for the establishment of a European ethical
committee to deal with the issue in cooperation with the United
States and Japan.

JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians from 18
African Commonwealth countries meeting in Gaborone, Botswana
today called on their governments to entrench democracy in their
constitutions, and fund both ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at the end of a two-day roundtable meeting
on democracy and good governance, hosted by the Commonwealth
Secretariat, said a source here.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians urged the Commonwealth to develop a code
of conduct for all political parties to guarantee equality for
women and equal access to the media.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the responsibility of creating a culture
of mutual respect and tolerance fell to the governments and their
oppositions, which should strengthen democracy but protect the
right to oppose.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposals adopted by the parliamentarians at the
two-day meeting would be presented to a Commonwealth African
summit in Kasane, a game reserve in northern Botswana, scheduled
to begin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 heads of the state from the 18 African countries
are expected to attend the summit in Kasane, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The 18 countries are Botswana, Cameroun, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles,
Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> EU Pact with South Africa Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Spanish objections derailed
European Union efforts Monday to speed up trade talks with South
Africa, which remained bogged down on several fronts after three
years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At an EU foreign ministers meeting, Spain rejected a proposal
to partly fold South Africa into a trade and aid accord between
the Union and a group of 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations, known as ACP.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that South Africa must simultaneously conclude a
free trade accord with the EU and separate deals on trade in wine
and spirits and a fishing agreement.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers will return to the issue in March and
still hope to complete a deal at an April 24-25 meeting with their
ACP counterparts in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The size of South Africa's economy has made it difficult for
the EU to wrap it into its Africa trade pact. In 1995, South
Africa's exports to the EU totaled nine billion U.S. dollars,
almost half the 22.5 billion dollars of exports from the 70 ACP
nations combined.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the EU African affairs commissioner, Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, said South Africa had accepted "qualified membership" in
the EU-ACP accord that would deny it preferential access to public
works tenders in Europe and exempts it from aid stabilizing ACP
export products.

<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today denounced the European Parliament for "manifestly
interfering in France's internal affairs" by adopting a resolution
calling for the withdrawal of the new immigration law of France.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the French presidential office said that Chirac
personally handed over a letter of protest to the new president of
the European Parliament, Spanish conservative deputy Jose Maria
Gil-Robles, who was on a visit in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The deputies of Strasbourg-based European Parliament narrowly
adopted a resolution last Thursday, which said that the new
immigration law reminded one of "the appeal for denouncement" with
its requirement on Frenchmen to inform the authorities the time of
departure of their foreign guests from France.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly (lower house of parliament) today
began a second-reading debate on the new immigration law, also
called Debre bill in reference to its author, Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre.
</P>
<P>
The Debre bill has been amended by asking foreigners
themselves, instead of their French hosts, to inform the French
authorities the time of their departure from France.
</P>
<P>
The president of the National Assembly, Philippe Seguin, today
also denounced the resolution by the European Parliament and asked
President Chirac to react to it.

<HEADLINE> Intl Conference Bids for Ban on Mines' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano today urged an immediate ban on the production and sales
of Land mines worldwide as the Fourth International Conference on
Mines opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the three-day conference
attended by 400 delegates from 60 countries, President Chissano
said the ban is vital for human safety and well being.
</P>
<P>
"If the production and sales are not banned, our effort on
land-mines removal will be absolutely futile, just like pouring
water into a leaking barrel," said the president.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, Mozambique and Angola are among countries worst hit
by land mines.
</P>
<P>
An official report released today by the Red Cross said an
estimated 30,000 Angolans have been maimed by land mines, while in
Mozambique, over 10,000 lives have been lost to the land mines
during the civil war between 1978 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to President Chissano, it needs at least 46 years
for Mozambique to remove all the land mines planted in its soil
and be a mine-free country.
</P>
<P>
So far 30,000 land mines have been removed in the country, but
it doesn't mean much if compared with a total of three million
land mines planted in the southern African country, said
Chissano.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, what we are concerned are the mine-producing
countries. If they stopped mine production and sales, there would
not be the mine issue and the world would be much safer to live
in," he said.
</P>
<P>
An astonishing total of 118.73 million mines have been planted
on the earth where Angola is ranked first with 15 million mines,
followed by Cambodia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Viet Nam and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The International Campaign on the Ban of Mines, a
non-governmental organization, is currently striving for the
signing of an international agreement on the ban of the
production and sales of mines worldwide in Canada in December,
the organization's coordinator, Jody Williams said.

reconciliation and remains ready to contribute to South Africa's
efforts in national building.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Council Concerned at New Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council expressed on Tuesday its concern at a new settlement
policy of Israel in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an oral statement to the press on behalf the Security
Council, council president Njuguna Mahugu of Kenya hoped that
restraint and wisdom would prevail so as not to undo the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said he was requested by the council members to invite the
permanent representative of Israel to convey this concern and
solicit his views on how Israel intends to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council took up the matter at a complaint from the
Arab group at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In identical letters to the council and to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, the Arab group drew particular attention to the
"policies and illegal measures taken in occupied East Jerusalem,
aimed at Judaizing the city and changing its legal status and
demographic composition."
</P>
<P>
It said Israel had confirmed its decision to build a new
settlement in the Jabal Abu Ghneim region to the south of East
Jerusalem, following earlier decisions to build in the Ras
al-Amud district and to keep open an archaeological tunnel near
Moslem holy sites in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, Israel is continuing to deprive the Palestinian
inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are the original inhabitants of the
city, of their 'right of residence,' in the context of what
appears to be an underhand campaign aimed at driving the
Palestinian Arab inhabitants out of Jerusalem," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The group of Arab states members of the United Nations
wishes to insist on the vital importance of the issue, and
requests the Security Council to take the necessary steps to
induce Israel, the occupying power, to put an end to its policies
and actions, and in particular definitively to renounce any
settlement activity, particularly in the Jabal Abu Ghneim and Ras
al-Amud region."

<HEADLINE> UK Unveils Plans to Privatize London Underground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- British government Tuesday
announced plans for the privatization of London's Underground
railway system, the capital's transport lifeline, if it wins the
general election in May.
</P>
<P>
Making a statement in parliament today, Transport Secretary
George Young said privatization was the only way to finance the
heavy investment needed to modernize London Underground (LU), the
oldest in the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that most of the proceeds from the sale, estimated at
two billion pounds (3.28 billion US dollars), would be reinvested
in the system to help clear LU's 1.2 billion pounds (2 billion US
dollars) investment backlog within five years.
</P>
<P>
And most of any money left over would be set aside for
transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Secretary pointed out that the government had no
preferred option for the sale of the underground network, and a
White Paper detailing the proposals would be set out this Summer.
</P>
<P>
The options include: selling it as a single business, selling
lines individually, and the piecemeal sale of trains, lines and
stations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that LU's chiefs had recently complained of
massive government under-investment which had forced the
postponement of more than 200 projects.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Prime Minister John Major defended his government's
plan to privatize LU, insisting the move would provide a "world
class" network.
</P>
<P>
Standard and investment would be expected to rise under the
proposal while prices would not, Major said.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Labor Party condemned the plan as
"half-baked" and said that it would scrap the sell-off plans if it
wins the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Transport Secretary Andrew Smith said that privatization
would put LU's services at risk and would involve a giveaway sale
of public assets.
</P>
<P>
The London Underground network, part of which was built as
early as 1865, consists of 248 stations on 11 lines and carries
2.7 million passengers each day.

Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's decision to build a new Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Executive Lashes Out at Helms-Burton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ian Delaney, chairman of
Canada's Sherritt International Corp., has lashed out at the U.S.
policy toward Cuba, while declaring that his company is increasing
presence in the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
Delaney, who is barred from the United States under the
infamous Helms-Burton law, called the U.S. foreign policy toward
Cuba as "misguided" and stressed that Sherritt won't be bullied by
this.
</P>
<P>
"We will not entertain for one second any attack on the motives
of our company's officers or directors. We have the high moral
high ground," he was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
Delaney was speaking on the anniversary of the day last year
when Cuba shot down two small U.S. airplanes belonging to a group
of anti-Cuban emigres. The incident prompted the U.S. Congress and
politicians to pass the more anti-Cuba legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act bans the entry to the U.S. of executives
of some companies doing business with Cuba. It also allows U.S.
citizens to sue foreign companies that use property confiscated
from Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt mines nickel and cobalt in eastern Cuba. It has also
diversified into agriculture, tourism and other industries in the
Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, seven of its officials has been blacklisted by
the United States. Their spouses and children are also barred from
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our company...only does one type of business. We operate at
the highest levels of business conduct, ethically, economically
and personally," Delaney noted.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt is forging ahead with plans to inject millions of
dollars into the Cuban economy for transportation, communications,
real estate and other projects, he added.

<HEADLINE> A Series of Assassinations Reported in Algerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A series of assassinations took
place in the Algerian capital in the past several days, which
coincided with a vast offensive against Islamic extremists
launched by the country's security forces.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian daily, Liberte, reported today that five corpses
were found last Friday exposed on a street of Frais-Valon, a
district of Algiers between the popular suburbs of Bab-El-Oued and
Bouzareah.
</P>
<P>
A girl was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in the morning last
Saturday in a market place in Bab-el-Oued, while three other
people, including two girls, were killed in the afternoon in
Bouzareah, said Liberte.
</P>
<P>
A high school guardian was killed on Sunday in Casbah, the old
district of Algiers, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Algerian government announced on Monday that security forces
killed 83 extremists and destroyed five bases of the militant
movement, Armed Islamic Group, in a vast anti-terrorist operation
launched in several strongholds of the Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Western sources estimate the casualties from the six-year war
between Algeria's military-backed government and Islamists at
60,000 to 80,000.

<HEADLINE> EU Might Agree to Charge Fee for Card Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it might allow shops to transfer credit and debit card
fees to customers who pay with cards instead of cash, it was
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Retailers, restaurants and other service providers have fought
the banking and credit card industries for years over the right to
share the card costs charged by banks with their clients.
</P>
<P>
The banks say that consumers should be penalized for using
cards. But the EC believes that this has hindered fair competition
between different payment systems and weakened the retailer's
position with the banking system.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said the move would lead to more transparent
costs and allow retailers to negotiate better fees with banks,
adding that this would be far from being bad news for consumers.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Spends Least on Infrastructure in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has the lowest
infrastructure expenses in Asia, accounting for a mere two percent
of the country's gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that due to the least
expenses, lack of infrastructure is becoming a stumbling block to
the country's sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Peter Wallace, president of the country's Economist
Intelligence Unit, was quoted as saying that surveys showed that
the Philippines' expenditure in infrastructure is the lowest in
Asia since the average in Asia stands at 7 percent of the GNP.
</P>
<P>
However, Wallace said the country's ratio could go up to 6
percent if private sector investments in build-operate-transfer
projects and those of government-owned and controlled corporations
are added.
</P>
<P>
To sustain an almost 7 percent growth rate of the national
economy, the Philippine government should allot more money to
construct more infrastructure projects among other top priorities,
Wallace said.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli diplomat today
denied press reports that an Israeli military delegation inspected
military installations in the Turkish-occupied northern part of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus news agency reported that Matty Cohen, Charge D'Affaires
at the Israeli Embassy in Cyprus, made the denial in response to
the press reports that the defense cooperation agreement between
Turkey and Israel covers the Turkish-occupied northern part of
Cyprus, and that an Israeli delegation inspected military
installations at Lefkoniko airport and Bogazi, both of which are
in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, Cohen said that "no such delegation
has visited the north, nor is Cyprus in any way included in the
defense cooperation Israel has with Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Cohen also stressed that Israel "places great value on its
growing relations with Cyprus," saying that "the defense
cooperation that Israel has with Turkey, as it does with Greece,
would never be used to harm or in any way endanger Cyprus or any
other third country."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and seized
the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Hunger Hits Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Diyarbakir, center of
southeastern Turkey, has become a city of hunger, disease and
instability as a result of recent years of refugee influx, local
newspaper Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the regional Chamber of
Physicians, most people in this area, who live in their shanties
or makeshift tents, are underfed and facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
With only 300,000 residents three years ago, the
poverty-striken city's population has sharply soared to 1
million due to influx of refugees fleeing terrorist activities by
the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and their fighting with the
government forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the swelling refugee population had
produced a seriously negative impact on the health conditions of
the city, saying extremely crowded living space, inadequate
heating, undernourishment as well as violent incidents caused
grave physical and spiritual damage to the local people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a family of seven persons was found starving in
their shabby home and then sent to a local hospital. The father
of the family said they had not cooked for a week due to lack of
food.
</P>
<P>
The bad living conditions has led to the increase of
diseases. Around 15,000 to 20,000 typhoid fever cases have been
reported and the similar number of other diseases are observed
every year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that only 14 of the 204 medical centers in
Diyarbakir were still open now, many were closed owing to staff
insufficiency and safety standard problems.
</P>
<P>
No service evaluations are done and even no health data has
been collected over the past five years, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security troops has been fighting a battle
against the PKK in southeastern region in a bid to smash the
later's plan of establishing an independent Kurdish country since
 1984. As a result, Diyarbakir, as a major city of the region,
suffers a lot from the years of fighting.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Executive Secretary
Ruben Torres said here today that he is confident that peace
panels of the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) would soon sign a general ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the ceasefire would cover Cotabato, Maguindanao
province, and other areas in the southern Philippines which have
been rocked by the intermittent clashes between government troops
and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides, which Tuesday resumed their second round
of preliminary talks in Cotabato, were having their meeting today
"in a very friendly manner".
</P>
<P>
All indications showed that the two sides "might be able to
secure in no time a general ceasefire in Cotabato and other areas
now being troubled by the MILF", he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year, ending a 24-year-old war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the future this (ceasefire) will bring
temporary peace so that the two parties can negotiate without any
problem," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current talks are expected to be the foundation
upon which the Filipinos will build a progressive country, say
goodbye to poverty and welcome a new kind of life they have never
enjoyed for almost 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Philips to Sell Stakes in Cable Television Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Dutch electronics giant
Philips Electronics NV will sell 50 percent of its stocks in a
leading European cable television company to shift its focus to
consumer electronics business.
</P>
<P>
Philips said today that it would sell its shares in the United
&AMP; Philips Communications (UPC) to its partner, the U.S-based
United International Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, the TV joint venture will purchase all of
Philips' 3.17 million shares of common stock in the United
International Holdings.
</P>
<P>
Philips said it expected to complete the transaction by the
third quarter of this year, which would net a total proceeds of
about 800 million guilders (426.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the 800 million guilders, 308 million will come in the form
of new securities to be issued by the UPC, which has investments
in cable projects that serve nearly 2.1 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why Philips is withdrawing from the TV company,
Richard de Lange, president of Philips Media, said: "the future of
UPC is best served by having investors who are dedicated to this
type of industry."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Philips reported its first net annual loss since
1992, but the company vowed to catch up later this year.
</P>
<P>
Cor Boonstra, who became president of Philips in October last
year, has repeatedly said he would do anything to enhance value
for shareholders and would not wait for unprofitable units to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The United International Holdings, based in Denver, the United
States, provides cable television and related services in 25
countries outside the United States.

between the two supervisory authorities. This is now further
reinforced and formalized in the MOU," AMCM President Maria
Manuela Morgado said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC National Committee to Open Annual Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open at 3:00 P.M. tomorrow in
the Great Hall of the People here, said Liang Jinquan, spokesman
for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The session will last 13.5 days.
</P>
<P>
By noon today, 1,292 out of the 2081 members had registered at
the secretariat of the conference.
</P>
<P>
During the session, members will hear and discuss the work
report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee
and a report on the handling of proposals since its last annual
session.
</P>
<P>
Besides, as non-voting delegates, they will hear
and discuss a government work report to be delivered by Premier Li
Peng and other important reports at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee will make a speech at the closing
ceremony, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the CPPCC annual session, the spokesman
said, Comrade Deng Xiaoping passed away. The CPPCC National
Committee members will deeply cherish the memory of Deng Xiaoping
who made outstanding contributions as chairman of the Fifth CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the members will study Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
exercise their democratic rights by expressing views and raising
suggestions on important political, economic and social issues,
Liang said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Liang said, members of the CPPCC National
Committee have adhered to the system of multi-party cooperation and
political consultation under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and made new headway in promoting political
consultation, democratic supervision and participation in the
running of state affairs.

<P>
In the past year, according to the spokesman, eight special
committees of the CPPCC National Committee did investigations
and studies on more than 50 subjects relating to reform, opening
up and social development, and produced 41 reports.
</P>
<P>
Topics for such studies include ways to achieve a sustained and
healthy economic development and to bring about a fundamental
shift in the economic growth mode, reform in state-owned
enterprises, and cultural and socialist ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made by CPPCC National Committee members, Liang said,
were highly commended by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee and state president, at the new year reception
early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the General Office of the CPPCC
National Committee received 16,925 letters from non-communist
parties, CPPCC local committees and the general public last year.
Over 1,400 of these letters were forwarded to the CPC Central
Committee, the State Council and ministries.
</P>
<P>
The letters represent an important source of information for
the government. Writers of the letters raised constructive
suggestions for the central and local governments and criticized
undesirable social phenomena. The letters have thus played a positive
role in enabling government departments to be informed of public
opinion and make correct decisions.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy: Turkey Should Follow Possible Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus
today said that Ankara should closely follow possible threats from
Iraq's weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq
(UNSCOM), also said that Baghdad might still have a strong
military power. He arrived here Tuesday to brief Turkish officials
on the latest developments concerning his mission of destroying
Iraq's mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said his team and the Turkish side had agreed to further
their dialogue on this issue.
</P>
<P>
On the inspection of Iraqi weapons program, the U.N. envoy
welcomed Iraq's agreement to allow the wrecked parts of its
missiles to be checked abroad. "One of the difficult issues which
have been plaguing us in the last months has been solved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM will ship these parts to the U.S., France and
an unknown third country for analysis to determine whether they
are preserved for making weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus also expressed his concern over Iraq's chemical
weapon capacity and suspected that Iraq still retains a stock of
most advanced chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Chemical and biological weapons would represent a serious
security threat in the region if Iraq was allowed to retain
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the Turkish officials, Ekeus expressed
his hope that Ankara would cooperate with the U.N. and urge Iraq
to comply fully with the UNSCOM requests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said
that Ekeus' contacts with Turkish officials here were
"constructive and clear."
</P>
<P>
Ekeus left Ankara this afternoon following his two-day
official visit to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Canada Intends to Invest More in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada plans to invest a total
of 101.6 billion U.S. dollars in plant, equipment and housing this
year, up 5.2 percent than in 1996, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, business and government intends to invest 76.6 billion
dollars in plant and equipment, a 4.4 percent increase from 1996,
and the second strongest growth rate since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Lower interest rates, higher profits and increased capacity
use are providing a positive investment climate for manufacturing
companies," the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The investment drive in technologically advanced machinery and
equipment continues.... Leasing companies and cable and telephone
companies also display strong investment," it added.
</P>
<P>
Investment by manufacturing companies in machinery and
equipment is anticipated to increase 10.1 percent in 1997, led by
producers of chemicals, pulp and paper and transportation
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Investment by leasing companies in cars and trucks is expected
to reach 6.4 billion dollars in 1997, a significant increase of
1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cable and telephone companies plan to invest a total of 4
billion dollars, a 19.4 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the continuing competition between the two
technologies as well as investments made by new firms in the
industry," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, investment in residential housing is expected
to increase 7.7 percent, reaching 25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This growth is due to low mortgage rates and stronger demand
for new housing.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets French Magazine Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China wishes to establish a "long-term and
stable" relationship into the 21st century with France.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a meeting with Serge Berthier, Asia
regional head of the French magazine "International Politics."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Zhongnanhai, the seat of the central
government, Berthier offered his condolences on the passing away
of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few days we have been plunged into extreme
grief. We will turn grief into strength with practical actions to
cherish our memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Deng died last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China would continue along the road pioneered
by Deng Xiaoping, continuing to push forward reform, opening up
and the modernization drive. It will also continue to pursue its
independent foreign policy of peace, develop and strengthen
friendly and cooperative relations with all other countries on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and
maintain world peace and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made a positive review of the Sino-French relations. He
said that Deng Xiaoping had worked and studied for six years in
France when he was young. Many other Chinese leaders had also
worked and studied in France. "This shows that the two countries
have a long-standing history of exchanges," he added.
</P>
<P>
China and France have enjoyed fruitful cooperation in the
political, economic, cultural, and scientific and technological
fields over the past 30-odd years since the two countries were
linked diplomatically, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is looking forward to President Chirac's visit to
China, with a view to promoting the friendly cooperation between
the two countries. Jiang made a state visit to France in September
1994, and Chinese Premier Li Peng made an official visit to France
in April last year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the two countries can establish a long-term and
stable cooperative relationship into the 21st century," Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also answered Berthier's questions related to China's
political system and the issues of Taiwan and Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Canada Exports Record Oil, Gas in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports of crude oil
and natural gas reached record levels in December 1996, Statistics
Canada reported today.

During the month, Canada's natural gas exports rose 6.0 percent
to 7,683.3 million cubic meters, while crude oil exports rose 10.9
percent to 6,171,100 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Continued rising exports to the United States led to a 5.6
percent increase in natural gas production for the month, and
achieved a new record level of production, the federal agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil production rose 3.4 percent compared with December
1995, the eighth consecutive monthly increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada's natural and crude oil production "posted
solid advances."
</P>
<P>
Natural gas production increased 3.6 percent to 153,516.6
million cubic meters, while production of crude oil rose 2.4
percent to 117,144,300 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Exports of natural gas rose at a much slower rate in 1996 than
before. Exports rose 2.0 percent in 1996, compared with 10.8
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crude oil exports rose a solid 6.3 percent to a
record high of 65,258,300 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> IFO Expects Modest Springtime Upswing for German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The German economy could see a
modest springtime upswing after a slump at the end of last year, a
survey published here today showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic situation survey released by
the Munich-based Institute for Economic Research (IFO), the
optimism is mostly coming from strong export demand.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, massive job cuts are gradually coming to an
end, with industry employment likely to drop by only 0.5 percent
in the next few months. But a modest growth in short-time work is
also expected.
</P>
<P>
The IFO also said that the situation in the building sector at
the beginning of this year was no longer so negative as previously
predicted. However, over 50 percent of the western German
enterprises questioned in the survey and more than 40 percent of
those in the east expect further job cuts in this sector.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Surinam President's Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here today the Chinese people's willingness to work
together with the people of Surinam for "long-term and stable"
friendly cooperation with an eye to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Desire Delano Bouterse, special envoy
of the Surinam president and a senior Surinam politician, Jiang
thanked Surinam for pursuing a "one China" policy and not
developing official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse expressed, on behalf of the Surinam president,
condolences over Deng Xiaoping's death, for which Jiang expressed
his appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the envoy to convey to his Surinam counterpart,
President Jules Wijdenbosch, his greetings and invitation for a
visit to China at a convenient date. Jiang also said he
appreciated the "important contribution" of Bouterse to the growth
of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the friendly cooperation between China and Surinam
has achieved stable and fruitful development since the
establishment of diplomatic ties. In international affairs they
have given each other support and close cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Surinam is an important country in the
Caribbean region. The Surinam government and people have made
unremitting and successful efforts to maintain national
independence and sovereignty, and revitalize their national
economy, he commented.
</P>
<P>
Surinam is playing an important role in maintaining regional
peace and stability by pursuing a nonalignment policy, developing
friendly cooperation with other countries and actively promoting
and participating in the integration processes of Latin America
and the Caribbean, Jiang commented.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse said Surinam and China have a deep traditional
friendship, and their exchanges dated back 150 years. China was
one of the first countries to forge diplomatic ties with Surinam
after the latter's achievement of independence in 1975, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his country holds to a "one China" position and
appreciates China's foreign policy of peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
The fact that he came to China as an envoy of President
Wijdenbosch soon after the formation of the current Surinam
government is a demonstration of the special and strong relations
between the two countries, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse said that he considered his China trip successful. He
added that his country hopes to work with China in the future to
bring their friendly and cooperative relations in political,
economic, cultural and other fields to a new high.

<HEADLINE> UN-sponsored Afghan Peace Talks End With No Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks between the
Afghan Taliban militia and its rivals ended here today without any
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides agreed that a military solution to the
Afghanistan conflict was not possible, said Norbert Holl, the
United Nations special envoy to Afghanistan, here this afternoon
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Holl said that both sides agreed to continue their negotiations
on all pending issues.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he will make new proposals which he will
convey and explain to the political leaders of both sides in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Afghan Working Group discussed at length important
matters such as specific confidence-building measures, the draft
of a ceasefire agreement, the exchange of prisoners and the
situation in Kabul, Holl said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, hosted by the U.N. Special Mission to
Afghanistan, was another bid to end the on-going conflicts in the
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On the Taliban side, the meeting was attended by Mullah
Mohammad Sadiq, member of the Supreme Shura of the Taliban, Mufti
Masoom Afghani and Hajji Fazal Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council for the Defense of Afghanistan was
represented by General Mohammad Painda and Rasul Talib.
</P>
<P>
The working group, which has no decision-making power, met last
month without agenda but could not make any headway.
</P>
<P>
The talks bogged down as the three-party anti-Taliban alliance
demanded that the Islamic student militia demilitarize Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance includes the ousted Afghan government
led by former military chief Ahmad Masood, northern militia led by
war-lord Rashid Dostum and Hezb-e-Wahdat of Karim Khalili.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance said prior to the meeting that they
would press again their demand for the demilitarization of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who captured Kabul last September, rejected the
demand fearing that demilitarization of the capital could
encourage the opposition to recapture it.
</P>
<P>
The student militia, who now control two-thirds of the Afghan
territory, also opposed the formation of a neutral force for the
security of the Afghan capital or deployment of international
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Taliban proposed the formation of a joint
commission to handle the issues like ceasefire, exchange of war
prisoners and ultimately the formation of an interim government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban officials contended that ceasefire and exchange of
prisoners should be top on the agenda while the rest of the
matters would be taken up later.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Increases Contacts with HK, Macao, Taiwan, Overseas Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body has
sponsored a wide-range of activities to further its friendship
with compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and Chinese
nationals residing overseas, so as to advance the reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The activities held by the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has
yielded remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a liaison committee for overseas Chinese and
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, received 22 tourist
groups with a total of 500-plus overseas Chinese and compatriots
from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The committee invited 59 overseas Chinese and compatriots from
the three Chinese regions for a sight-seeing trip around the
National Day.
</P>
<P>
The visit, giving the visitors better chances of acquainting
them with economic and social growth on the Chinese mainland,
helped promote national reunification, said the chairman of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, they also helped to extend the CPPCC's
influence overseas, and increased its contacts with overseas
Chinese and those living in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the committee, in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", will support and assist the central
government to bring about a smooth transfer of Hong Kong's
sovereignty by increasing contacts with Hong Kong and Macao
members of the CPPCC National Committee, and to contribute to the
long-range stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The committee will further implement Jiang Zemin's eight-point
proposal on the peaceful reunification of the motherland,
increase contacts with Taiwan compatriots, advance exchanges and
cooperation across the Taiwan Strait, and steadfastly oppose any
attempts to create "Two Chinas", "One Chin One Taiwan", and
"Independence of Taiwan," the committee chairman said.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns to Block Proposed US, British Airlines Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU) top
antitrust official Tuesday warned that he might block the planned
alliance between American Airlines and British Airways (BA) if it
appeared likely to produce higher fares.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the European Parliament, Karel Van Miert, the
EU competition commissioner, said that the interests of the
companies forming the alliance risked clashing with those of
airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to keep in mind the long-term interest of
passengers," Van Miert said, adding that consumers wouldn't
understand how the liberalization of the airline market could lead
to higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was important to distinguish between "the
interests of companies that participate in accords, and on the
other hand, the global economic progress that stems from the
accord."
</P>
<P>
American Airlines and BA said in June last year that they
wanted to link their trans-Atlantic fares, flights and
marketing. If the alliance is approved, analysts said it will end
years of heartache for both carriers in their search for a
suitable alliance on the key transatlantic market, where some 70
airlines compete on routes from Europe to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the plan triggered fierce opposition from
both the EU and other airlines.
</P>
<P>
However, the planned alliance also faces a regulatory hurdle in
the United States, where it has been made conditional to the
conclusion of an "open skies" agreement the opening up the
U.S.-British aviation market to more competition.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are seeking immunity from U.S. antitrust
law, a waiver granted to three other alliances between European
and U.S. carriers since 1993, including one between Lufthansa AG
and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
While American and BA have already provided the commission with
information for its antitrust inquiry, Van Miert said the
commission was waiting for "complementary information."
</P>
<P>
Some aviation lawyers and industry executives have maintained
that the proposed American-BA alliance is different from former
linkups in that it would give the duo a combined 60 percent share
of the market for flights between the two carriers' home countries.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Shane, a lawyer who represents BA's arch rival Virgin
Atlantic Airways, has said that the alliance would give the two
"an incipient" monopoly across the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Attract Foreign Investment in Oil and Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said today that his government will take steps to
create a conducive environment for attracting and protecting
foreign private investment in the country's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The economic future of Pakistan lies in the development of the
energy sector, Sharif said while addressing the 3-day Pakistan Oil
and Gas Summit which continued its deliberations for the second
day today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan relies on imports for most of its oil needs and this
dependence may increase as the country develops and the population
grows, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan must strive to explore and develop oil and gas
resources as well as to follow the least cost options for import
of oil and natural gas to bridge the supply demand gap.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that his government is determined to liberalize and
deregulate the economy with a view to eliminating unproductive
controls, improving efficiency and reducing prices through fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our country a Gateway to Central Asia which will
usher in an era of peace and prosperity in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from 28 countries are participating in
the three-day event, the third since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan currently consumes some 120 million barrels of oil per
annum and demand is expected to rise by 50 percent in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan aims to double its oil production to 120,000 barrel a
day by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for More Cooperation With Transnational Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed the hope that British-funded, Hong Kong-based China
Light &AMP; Power Co. Ltd will expand its cooperation with China on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the statement this afternoon during a meeting
with Michael Kadoorie, chairman of China Light &AMP; Power Co. and a
delegation of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Li said China Light &AMP; Power is a transnational corporation
which has good cooperation with China in the energy sector. Its
cooperation with China in the first stage of the Da Ya Bay Nuclear
Power Station and a pumped storage project in south China's
Guangdong Province have been successful, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With the July 1 transfer of Hong Kong drawing near, Hong Kong
residents have been increasingly confident in the smooth transfer
of power and the territory's prosperity and stability. The Chinese
Premier hopes that the corporation will continue to contribute to
Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted the concern shown by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping for the construction of the Da Ya Bay project, saying "I
believe the second stage of the project will turn out better given
the experiences from the first stage."
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
Kadoorie, also executive director of the British Sir Elly
Kadoorie &AMP; Sons Ltd, expressed his regret that Deng could not step
on the land of Hong Kong and witness its return to the
motherland. However, he said, he believes that "the thoughts of
Deng will continue to guide Hong Kong into long-term prosperity
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Kadoorie said his delegation includes people from the energy,
hotel, banking and aviation sectors, who wish to continue their
commitments to China's modernization drive after Hong Kong returns
to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Japan to Hold Talks on Labor Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Japan are
scheduled to hold bilateral talks to discuss issues relating to
thousands of Filipino workers in Japan, the official Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Labor Undersecretary Jose Espanol as saying
that the Philippine delegation to the talks will include officials
from the departments of labor and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the planned labor talks will be held in
April in Manila, with the second round to take place in November
in Tokyo, according to Espanol.
</P>
<P>
Espanol said the Philippine negotiators would ask the Japanese
government to extend the visas for Filipino workers, mainly
artists and seamen, from three to six months.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government last year reduced the visas for
Filipino entertainers from six to three months due to many cases
of labor violations by Japanese nightclub owners.
</P>
<P>
Reports of hundreds of overstaying Filipino entertainers also
prompted the Japanese government to adopt stricter measures on
foreign entertainers.
</P>
<P>
The planned negotiations would also discuss the issues of
Filipino seamen working on Japanese vessels, welfare centers for
Filipino overseas workers, and overstaying Filipinos in Japan.

<HEADLINE> HK Organizations Not to Participate in CPPCC Beyond 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Parties and organizations in
Hong Kong will not join in the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) after Hong Kong returns to the
embrace of the motherland on July 1 this year, a CPPCC spokesman
said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Liang Jinquan, spokesman for the Fifth Session of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee, said at a press conference that the
CPPCC is part of China's socialist political system, which will
not be introduced in Hong Kong beyond 1997 according to the
principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the CPPCC will not set up any subordinate
organizations in Hong Kong after July 1, while no parties and
organizations from Hong Kong will take part in the CPPCC," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, in response to reporters' questions, he said that
after China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong, the CPPCC will continue to draw people from Hong Kong, so as
to give full scope to their significant role in the country's
political, economic and social life.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the new method of how to choose CPPCC
National Committee members from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) is up to the Standing Committee of
the CPPCC National Committee to decide in accordance with the
CPPCC charter based on discussions of the relevant parties.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National
Committee for the duty they have assiduously performed as well as
their active involvement in China's government and political
affairs over the years.
</P>
<P>
"They have set forth many good, valuable proposals and made
positive contributions to the great cause of the motherland's
reunification, construction and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual session of the CPPCC National Committee is due to
meet in Beijing tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos would undergo his annual physical examination on Friday,
several days ahead of his working visit to South Asia and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press briefing here today, Ramos said he
has requested the medical check-up as "a way of putting special
emphasis on the post operative progress report", referring to his
carotid artery operation undergone last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The surgery triggered off a controversy as to whether the
president is still suited to govern the country and led Charter
change opponents to believe that Ramos might not seek a second
term when his term of office expires in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he volunteered to have the annual check-up done so
that the people and himself can all reassure themselves of the
good health of the president.
</P>
<P>
The president, who will pursue his economic diplomacy program
in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Qatar and Bahrain during March
2-12, was against his physician's advice to lessen his stressful
foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
He kept a loose schedule, mostly held in the Presidential
Palace, for the first month after his operation, and had even
shunned some provincial trips.
</P>
<P>
However, he reportedly went back to his old habits this month
and had provincial trips at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit is his first foreign trip since his
operation and his 32nd since he assumed office in 1992. He is also
expected to go on a state visit to Canada and Mexico in May.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Phones Mubarak on Building of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu phoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ahead
of a critical meeting this afternoon on establishment of a new
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, reported the State-run
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give details of the phone call. But by doing
so, Netanyahu apparently tried to calm down the tensions arising
from the decision to set up the Har Homa settlement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Wednesday in a statement that his government
planned to build 2,000 apartments for Jews in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have repeatedly warned that continued
Israeli settlement policy will damage the peace process and could
spark fiercer violence.
</P>
<P>
In the first reaction to the anticipated decision, Jordan's
Crown Prince Hassan informed Israel Tuesday that he decided to
postpone a visit to the Jewish state again. He put off a visit
last fall after the opening of a tunnel close to Temple Mount,
Muslim's holy shrine in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat returned to Gaza this
morning from a visit to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
In the Moroccan capital of Rabat, Arafat held consultations
with King Hassan II on the issue of Jerusalem, asking the king to
convene an urgent meeting on Israel's decision to build Har Homa
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan monarch is the chairman of the Jerusalem
Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO Executive
Committee and Minister for Jerusalem Affairs of the Palestinian
National Authority, visited the Israeli Knesset (parliament) as a
guest of the Arab Democratic Party members of the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that the atmosphere surrounding Har Homa project
reminds people of the situation immediately following the opening
of the East Jerusalem tunnel, an event leading to days of bloody
clashes killing 61 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Palestinian demonstrators marched from Bethlehem
in the West Bank to Har Homa in protest against the construction
of Jewish settlement there. They declared that they will
continue to protest if Israel does not change its decision.

<HEADLINE> More Food Reaches Refugee Camps in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has stockpiled significant quantities of food for
some 170,000 refugees before the onset of the rainy season in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A press release reaching here today said that WFP sent 200
tons of food from Kindu to Kisangani by barge at the weekend, and
a further 300 tons is on wagons south of Kindu while an
additional 1,000 tons of food in Lubumbashi is in transit to
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that these supplies are sufficient for
170,000 refugees in eastern Zaire to sustain 20 days, the highest
stockpile of food since last October when the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, WFP completed the largest food
distribution in Tingi Tingi camp where refugees received a
seven-day food package containing maize, beans, corn-soya blend
and vegetable oil on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Convoys of trucks with 210 tons of food are scheduled to leave
Kisangani on February 26 for Tingi Tingi refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
However, the release noted, growing problems of heavy cloud
cover during the rainy season will limit the number of flights
WFP can make each day.
</P>
<P>
Land routes from Kisangani to the refugee camps are also
expected to become more difficult as bad patches in the road
become impassable due to rain which has already started in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted WFP spokesman Trevor Rowe as saying, "when
we have overcome many complex problems affecting food deliveries,
other uncontrollable constraints like poor weather and insecurity
are threatening to curb our operations."

<HEADLINE> Mohamed Ibrahim Egal Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The rebel faction leader
of Somali Land, Mr Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tur, has strongly opposed
the reelection of Mr Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal as the president
of Somali Land for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Mogadishu, Mr Tur described the
conference that elected Mr Egal as unrightful and not
representative by the Somali Land clans.
</P>
<P>
Mr Abdurahman Tur together with three other factions from the
northern Somalia have accused Mr Egal for creating hostility and
insecurity among the people in Somali Land. The statement which
was also broadcast on radio South Mogadishu supporting Hussein
Mohamed Aidid this morning has particularly faulted Mr Egal for
being responsible about the death of a bigger number than those
killed in the fighting against the former regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about what they called the patriotism of Somali Land,
the statement described Mr Egal as a man who has a deep hatred
for the Somali nationality. The statement pointed out that Egal
had recently handed over three Somalis to the government of
Ethiopia. According to the statement, Mr Egal controls a minor
part of Somali Land estimated about 28 per cent of the entire
territory.
</P>
<P>
The political organizations of SNM, SDA, USP and USF, all
members of the government of Hussein Mohamed Aidid based in south
Mogadishu, have also accused Mr Egal for making printing money of
his own, thus causing inflation and displacement as they put it.
These organizations have declared that they are stick to the
territorial integrity and the unity of Somalia, "The unity of
Somalia is sacred and no compromise about it," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mr Egal was elected as president by clan delegates on Sunday.
Among the famous clan delegates who elected Mr Egal are: The
Sultan of Garhajis subclan of Issak which earlier mainly
supported Mr Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tur. The field militia
commanders of the rebel forces, Colonel Mohamed Hussein Qalinle
and Colonel Ahmed Mire have also earlier joined Mr Egal with most
of their military hardware including 500 armed militiamen and
five tanks. However, Mr Tur and his less capable allied factions
argue that they still maintain representatives in some of the
main towns of Somali land such as Borame, Burao and Odweyne, an
argument based on illusion.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Opening of CPPCC Annual Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
People's Daily, tomorrow will publish an editorial to hail the
opening of the Fifth Session of the National Committee of the
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
which will open on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The editorial begins with cherishing the memory of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping who passed away last Wednesday in Beijing. Citing the
central contents of his united work concept in the new period, it
says, China's united front work during this period has
unprecedented wide representation, and it is essential to mobilize
all positive factors, unite all forces that can be united with and
all forces which can be allied with, in order to build China into
a modern, powerful socialist nation and join efforts to work for
the great cause of the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
At this very moment, the editorial notes, we cherished the
profound memory of the venerable Comrade Deng, who initiated the
the united front work and the people's political consultative
political consultative work in the new period, and who won
respects and reverence from the people of all ethnic groups across
China.
</P>
<P>
At the First Plenary Session of the Fifth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1978,
Deng was elected the first chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee after a decade of turmoil, and he has since contributed
tremendously in restoring the cause of the CPPCC and establishing
and developing the united front work in the new period, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Based on his scientific analysis of the new situation emerged
in effecting a great historical turn after the Third Plenum of
11th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Deng
pointed out that China has entered a new historical period with
the goal of achieving the four modernization as the central task
and so is the revolutionary united front work.
</P>
<P>
The ever stronger united front work and the outstanding successes
scored by the CPPCC over the past 18 years of reforms and
opening-up are inseparable from the wise direction of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In mourning Comrade Deng Xiaoping, we should precisely study
still better his theories regarding the united front work for the
new historical period and further adhere to the multi-party
cooperation and political consultative system and bring into
greater play the role of the people's consultative conference in
China's political life.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Opening of CPPCC Annual Session (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the opening of the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC
National Committee, the editorial adds, the CPPCC has pushed
vigorously for the standardization and systematization of
political consultation, democratic supervision and participation
in the running of state affairs. This has been achieved under the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the CPPCC has played an important role
in socialist economic development, implementation of reform and
opening-up policies in greater depth, promotion of a democratic
legal system, and cultural and socialist ethical progress. The
CPPCC has also made great achievements in forging closer ties with
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and Chinese nationals
residing overseas and in promoting a peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong, and the Chinese Communist Party will convene its 15th
National Congress. The CPPCC can accomplish a lot in this regard
since, being composed of people from different parties,
organizations and ethnic groups as well as people from all walks
of life, it has broad representation and can work for a harmonious
environment for the two great events, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges the CPPCC to unite all people who can be
united with, so as to bring about a situation where people are of
one heart and mind in working for the modernization of the whole
country.

Flights from the Algerian capital to Paris, France, will

began following the hijacking of an Air France airbus by
some members of an armed Islamic group of Algeria on December 25,
1994.

The French air authorities reportedly decided to transfer the
Air Algerie headquarters from the Orly Airport to the Charles de

Algerie passengers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Secularism Brooks No Change, President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has stressed that Turkey's secular system cannot be
changed, describing it as the duty for Turks to defend the system
created by Kemel Ataturk, founder of the republic.
</P>
<P>
In the face of a fresh wave of anti-secular activities in the
Muslim republic, Demirel has been engaged in an effort to
safeguard secularism through a series of interviews with major
newspapers and televisions recently.
</P>
<P>
Demirel was quoted today by the local English newspaper Daily
News as saying that the Turkish laws make it clear what kind of
acts were crimes agaisnt the secular system.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be a country of bans but, if necessary,
other laws can be passed on this subject," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president asserted that no one in Turkey had the right to
complain that he was not allowed to preserve the rules of Islam
because the country had guaranteed the religious freedom of the
people at any time.
</P>
<P>
"So if anyone says he wants Shariah (Islam), it means he is
not happy with the modern system and wants the old system, but
Turkey does not want to retrogress...," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Night rally held early February in the Turkish
city of Sincan, west of Ankara, has been the talk of the press and
public due to its strong anti-secular color.
</P>
<P>
The controversial speech, made by Iranian Ambassador to Turkey
Muhammad Reza Bagheri at the gathering to call for Shariah Law
also triggered a diplomatic row between Iran and Turkey, which is
seen as a damage to the initially warmer relations.
</P>
<P>
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said Tuesday that no
one should go against the people's faith and demanded respect for
the creed of the people, stressing that secularism cannot be a
substitute for religion.
</P>
<P>
Also in the interviews, Demirel said the presidential powers
should be further enhanced to make it possible for the head of
state to handle issues whenever the country was in what he
termed as an uneasy state.

<HEADLINE> NPC Delegates' Proposals Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
National People's Congress (NPC), has finished its assessment of
proposals submitted by delegates at the previous NPC session in
1996, said an official from the NPC Standing Committee today.
</P>
<P>
The NPC has drawn up new laws and regulations in relation to
the proposals and government offices have accepted suggestions
made by the delegates.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's fourth session, held last March, received 603
motions, including 124 submitted for review by specific committees
under the NPC according to a decision made by the NPC
presidium. The delegates also made 2,415 suggestions and aired
their views.
</P>
<P>
Some proposals led to the NPC standing committee's plan to
revise the Marriage Law, which has been in place for 17 years. The
revision will respond to the new situation and resolve new
problems brought about by the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The legislators will also review a series of new laws on
re-education through labor, and on college education,
administrative reconsideration, administrative permission
procedures and collection of administrative fees.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers' suggested that the NPC standing committee
develop an official definition of overseas Chinese to safeguard
the rights of the Chinese who reside out of the country and their
relatives in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of the delegates' proposals had official
responses while over 46 percent are still under review, according
to an official with the NPC Standing Committee's general office.
</P>
<P>
However some 24 percent have not been considered because of
various restrictions and nearly nine percent are for reference
only, he added, noting that the various committees paid close
attention to proposals and suggestions from delegates, who made
the motions after lengthy study.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in the socialist legal system mean that NPC
delegates are playing a greater role in society, and the study of
proposals and their implementation is getting more and more
refined every year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Output to Exceed Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Provisional findings have
revealed that Indonesia's rice production in 1996 is to rise by
1.6 percent, exceeding the increase of 0.58 percent forecast
earlier, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Amrin Kahar, director general for food plants and horticulture
of the Agriculture Ministry, said here today that the new findings
also suggest that corn output was up 10 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
If the 1996 tentative figures were true, it will be the first
time that domestic rice output reaches 50 million tons, Kahar
noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his optimism that the target of 52 million tons of
rice production set for 1997 would be achieved given good
conditions and no drought as predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said that with good rice production, it is unlikely that
Indonesia would need to import rice this year.
</P>
<P>
Kahar added that corn and cassava production also enjoyed an
increase, with corn production up 10 percent from 1995. However,
soybeans and sweet potatoes production declined, he said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 200 million, Indonesia achieved
self-sufficiency in rice in 1984. However, it is currently under
threat as rice fields are being eaten away by industrial expansion
and disturbed unfriendly weather.

HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China funds topped the
January performance table with an annual return of 41.97 percent,
according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (HKIFA) at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since June 1995 that China funds came
first on the performance table, a release from the HKIFA said
today.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of 1996, this sector never came
close to the top 10. However, from October onward, it had made
much headway up the table and climbed to rank second in December.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the HKIFA Andrew Lo said the strong performance of
China funds was largely attributable to an improvement in the
performance of China shares, which were fostered by China's
subdued inflation, an easing of credit condition and improved
exports.
</P>
<P>
Ranking second on the table was Malaysian equity funds, with an
annual return of 29.26 percent while Hong Kong equity funds fell
out from the top five though they posted a satisfactory annual
return of 25.94 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- India plans to raise the
fares of its railway service in its railway budget for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, tabled before the parliament here today by
Railways Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the fares of sleeper class
will go up by 5 percent and those of upper class 10 percent while
freight rates of all but essential commodities will soar by 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, to be exempted from the price increases are
second-class fares for ordinary, mail and express trains.
</P>
<P>
The budget also spared commuters using monthly and quarterly
season tickets for second class and first class.
</P>
<P>
Items of mass consumption like food grains and pulses, edible
oils, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, sugar and fresh fruit
have also been exempted from the 12-percent increase in freight
rates.
</P>
<P>
While the existing parcel and luggage rates have not been
touched, the railway minister proposed to levy a 20-percent
surcharge on parcel and luggage rates in superfast trains in view
of the superior quality of service.
</P>
<P>
Railway passenger traffic is estimated to go up by 3 percent
and the target of freight loading at 430 million tons for 1997-98
while the net railway revenue is estimated at 12.04 billion rupees
(339.15 million U.S. dollars), the minister said.

The 77-year-old Spaniard said the only condition was being

There are no other declared candidates for the post.

It had been assumed Samaranch would stand for a fourth term
after the IOC voted at Budapest in June, 1995, to raise the
retirement age to 80, three days after Samaranch had failed to
abolish the age-limit altogether.
</P>
<P>
The change meant Samaranch could extend his reign until 2001,
when he would be 81.
</P>

The previous age-limit had been 75 and under the old rule
Samaranch, whose mandate runs to September, would have become

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Papers Pay Last Tribute to Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers today
continued to devote full pages to the 10,000-people memorial
meeting held in Beijing Tuesday to bid last farewell to great
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away a week ago at the
age of 93.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Daily News rolled out a 16-page black-backdropped
special issue today to retrospect Deng's legendary life -- his
iron will, his military career, his political achievements, his
diplomatic demeanor and his pragmatic theory for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and for governing the
country.
</P>
<P>
A front-page photo of the memorial service highlighted Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, who on Tuesday eulogized Deng's great
contributions to the nation in an obituary tribute. The Chinese
paper carried the full text of Jiang's speech, 10 selected pieces
of Deng's inscriptions and messages of condolences from countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Express News front-paged a black banner, "The whole nation
bid farewell in grief to the great man of our time." Two streamer
headlines in the eight special pages in memory of Deng read,
"Eternal glory to the chief architect, Deng Xiaoping," and
"Without Deng Xiaoping, it would have been impossible (for the
Chinese people) to live the new life today."
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the paper said Jiang's speech at the memorial
meeting on Tuesday shows that the Chinese Communist Party will
adhere to the fundamental line guided by Deng's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, namely, China will
continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up after
the death of Deng.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in today's commentary that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's speech at Deng's memorial meeting has imbued Hong
Kong people with confidence in the future. Deng has passed away,
but China will continue to advance along the trail he blazed and
Hong Kong will realize smooth transition and maintain prosperity
and stability under the guidance of his "one country, two systems"
concept.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese papers, two local English dailies, the South
China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Standard, carried stories
about the memorial events in various forms in Hong Kong, major
Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen
and Deng's hometown, Sichuan Province.

ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has listed export promotion, investment and revival
of sick industrial units within the shortest possible time as top
priorities of his government.
</P>
<P>
The highest priority would be given to the promotion of exports
and he would personally review the performance after every month,
Sharif said when addressing a one-day convention of business
leaders here today.
</P>
<P>
All the institutions including ministries of finance and trade
would be geared up to accomplish the task, he said.
</P>
<P>
His second priority would be to take measures for encouraging
both domestic and foreign investment to give a fillip to
industrial development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would ensure that the sick industrial units be
brought into operation as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister assured the business community that the
government would implement its policies for a continued industrial
progress.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to restructure the entire tax system to accommodate
the business community's genuine suggestions provided you pay tax
honestly and come forward to help the government pull the country
out of the present economic crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the formation of seven or eight working groups to
review the problems being faced by the sub-sectors of the
industry.

He hoped that these groups will present their recommendations
either within a week or fifteen days so that necessary measures
could be initiated to resolve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would cut the budget deficit to
reduce dependence on both domestic and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Similarly government expenditure would be slashed to realize
domestic self-reliance while expanding the tax base, he said,

administration strong and tax reforms meaningful.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
has advised African governments not to depend on international
donor agencies continuously for fund to implement their programs
and projects, the local newspaper New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, African governments should strive to be more
self-reliant as international donor agencies no longer have as
much money as they used to have for donations, WHO Regional
Director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the resources within Africa are properly managed, the needs
of the continent will be catered for, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Samba, Africa has quality human resources which,
if well managed, will move the continent forward. But he regretted
that Africans are not dedicated enough to think of their society
first before themselves.
</P>
<P>
"If we think of Africa first, our sub-region second, our
nation third and ourselves last, we will be able to do it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, Samba said, the WHO is to open zonal offices in
all the six geo-political zones of the country, as well as the
capital of Abuja, for better coordination and implementation of
WHO-supported programs.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Residential Loans Grow in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residential
property market continued to grow rapidly in the beginning of this
year, shows the latest monthly survey conducted by the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The total amount of outstanding mortgage lending by the 33
institutions in the survey rose by 2.6 percent in January to 338.9
billion HK dollars (43 billion U.S. dollars). The growth rate is
higher than the monthly average of 1.7 percent over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in lending reflected the increased activity in
both the primary and secondary residential property markets in
December and January, according to David Carse, deputy chief
executive of the HKMA. A large number of new properties put on to
the market in January boosted the primary market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that residential mortgage loans would continue to
grow at a rapid rate in February since new loans approved but not

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Develop Posts and Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a target of 5-6
telephones for every 100 people by the year 2000, with a higher
rate for Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city of 20-25 telephones for 100
people, local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The target was set in the development plan for posts and
telecommunications for the 1996-2000 period. The national
telephone density in 1996 was 1.56 phones per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the national backbone trunk line will be
upgraded and expanded with alternative lines to ensure
communications in all conditions.
</P>
<P>
Optical cable is to be used for the subscribers' network by
2000. Between 90 and 95 percent of inter-provincial routes will
use optical cables.
</P>
<P>
Investment is to be concentrated on key national projects,
including the further completion of the T-V-H
(Thailand-Vietnam-Hong Kong) optical cable line and the
trans-continental optical line prepared for the launching of
Vietnam's own telecommunication satellite by the turn of the
century and the research of laying a submarine cable along
Vietnam's coast, said the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the automation and mechanization of the
postal services and encourages the postal and telecommunication
sector to cooperate with foreign partners.

<P>

from the ruling RPR and UDF parties not to harden their position
on the new immigration law, which is being re-examined by the
French National Assembly (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, incidents took place Tuesday evening between police

industrialized nations, whose politicians are mobilized to prevent
the misuse of the cloning technique to reproduce human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, the risk for the time being is only economic and
pharmaceutical, as the world's biotechnological companies are
competing with each other to produce identical animals through
genetic manipulation for economic purposes.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Masterplan for Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will launch a 150
billion-rupee (263 million U.S. dollars) master plan to provide
electricity to meet the country's demand even beyond the year
2015, Electricity Board sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 175 million dollars will be used for the supply
of power while 88 million dollars will be spent on distribution,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka which today depends on hydropower for 84 percent of
electricity supply had a severe electricity shortage last year
consequent to the drought resulting from the failure of the
monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
There were countrywide power cuts from two to 10 hours per day
and industry was adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
The master plan is to ensure that there will be no repetition
of such a situation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the plan aims to strike a reasonable
balance between hydropower supply and thermal power generation and
the ultimate aim is to increase thermal power to one-third of the
total.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Coalition Parties Continue to Patch Up Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's ruling FUNCINPEC
and Cambodian People's Party (CPP) whose rival troops came into
conflict in Battambang province earlier this month agreed today to
disarm the soldiers involved in the conflict and continue
investigation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
An investigation on the matter, with which a special committee
is in charge, will continue, according to Co-Minister for Defense
Tea Banh.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh made the remarks at the end of a meeting between
senior officials and officers from both sides, including Co-Prime
Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and the committee earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conflict over the control of a military barrack
on the peak of the strategic mountain of Phnom Thipadei, about 25
kilometers south of the Battambang city, the capital of the
northwestern Battambang province, started on February 10,
reportedly killing 14 CPP and two FUNCINPEC soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was subdued by top Cambodian military officers
from both sides with a few measures, including jointly ordering to
stop fighting and withdraw from the disputed area, setting up a
joint special committee to investigate the incidents and recalling
major local government and military leaders to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The four local government and military leaders recalled to
Phnom Penh will continue to remain in the capital and no decision
was made at the meeting on their fate, said Tea Banh.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and FUNCINPEC formed a coalition government in 1993
after U.N.-run elections and have since had many differences in
power sharing and vied for the allegiance of thousands of Khmer
Rouge defectors.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring of Liberian Army to Start Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The restructuring of the Armed
Forces of Liberia (AFL) into an efficient force representative of all
ethnic groups in Liberia is to begin early next month, the Daily Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring process will start with a screening exercise
in the first week of March, said Major-General Victor Malu, the
Commander of the west African peacekeeping force, known as
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
He did not give any details of the screening.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the force commander has assured Liberians that when the
restructuring is completed, the AFL would have been molded into a
compact force that would be a pride for all Liberians and also a force
that the economy of Liberia would be able to support.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the army would be tactically deployed in such a way that
they could effectively ensure the security of Liberia and the people.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to Liberia, which is a member of ECOWAS, in 1990
following the outbreak of the civil war that has claimed the lives of
more than 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The force will withdraw from the country after the general
elections is held on May 30 this year. And before that, it will engage
in the training of Liberia's armed forces and police force.
</P>
<P>
Responsible for the security situation in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, ECOMOG has made a plan to move military barracks from the
city center to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with AFL commanders and Liberia's minister of defence
over the weekend, Malu explained that the planned relocation of AFL
personnel is in line with the trend in most armies of the world where
steps are taken to keep military personnel away from city center for
cordial civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the AFL commanders to accelerate the relocation process
and assured that ECOMOG would contact relevant international
humanitarian bodies that could help rehabilitate the accommondation
facilities at Camp Schiefflin in the suburbs which also suffered
during the seven-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Crown Prince Decides to Cancel Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 26 (Xinhua) - Jordanian Crown prince Hassan
has decided to cancel his visit to Israel scheduled Saturday,
Jordan Times today quoted an official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source who declined to be identified said that Hassan is
still keeping in touch with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu over his decision.
</P>
<P>
Hassan had an invitation to attend the inauguration of a
peace center in Tel Aviv named after late prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin, but he declared Tuesday not to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince`s decision came against reports from Israel
that the Israeli government was to formally announce today that
it was going ahead with building Jewish settlements in east
Jerusalem against strong Palestinian and Jordanian warnings that
it would be in violation of the very essence of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who has clearly demonstrated his commitment to peace,
would visit Israel only if such a visit will serve the cause of
peace, the official source was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily today also carried a signed article saying
that Hassan's decision came clearly as a strong message of
protest against the policy adopted by Netanyahu in violation of
his country's agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Given the great admiration and respect that the Jordanian
leadership gives to the memory of Rabin, the crown prince's
decision should definitely be seen as the kingdom's anger over
Netanyahu's moves, said the article.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here Sunday between King of Jordan Hussein
and Netanyahu, Hussein warned Netanyahu that any new Jewish
settlement in Jerusalem would pose danger to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, an Israeli official said after the meeting that such
an issue would not be discussed at present and would be left for
the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's recent visit to European countries and Morocco also
focused on preventing any new Jewish settlements in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Rebels Form Third Party to Monitor Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) peace negotiators have formed a
neutral third party to monitor their informal cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The body was created Tuesday following the first day of
low-level talks between the government and the MILF accusing each
other of violating the truce reached earlier, the Philippine News
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political affairs, said
initial members of the independent monitoring body are the Notre
Dame University Education Peace Center, the Protestant Lawyers
League of the Philippines and another legal counsel group called
the Free Legal Assistance Group.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the group will still be discussed today during
the continuation of the peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that sporadic clashes in Buldon and Datu Agwak
towns in Maguindanao still occurred despite the truce agreement
signed by Joselin Nazareno of the government and his counterpart,
MILF counsel Lanang Ali, last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jaafar said the MILF has already submitted to the
government a draft which contained a variety of social, cultural,
economic and political issues faced by the Moro people in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The problems include ancestral domain, displaced and landless
Bangsamoro people, destruction of properties and war victims,
human rights issues, social and cultural discrimination,
corruption, economic inequities and poverty, exploitation of
natural resources and agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
"The issues concerned are what we perceived to be the
Bangsamoro people problem," Jaafar said, adding, "Whatever will be
the outcome of our discussions regarding these problems will serve
as a leverage on the coming formal talks."
</P>
<P>
The government panel is expected to answer today the issues
presented to them by the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The three-day low-level talks which started on February 25 will
also cover the date and venue of the formal government-MILF peace
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows Down in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Lebanon
slowed down in 1996 after three years of sustained increase, the
Bank of Lebanon said in its economic bulletin issued today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said its coincident indicator of economic
activity stood at 168.3 at the end of December, just a fraction
above its December 1995 level of 166.9.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said the economy had failed to achieve an even
development during 1996, but the rebuilding of the country's
war-devastated infrastructures, which was proudly promoted by the
government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, continued at the same
pace.
</P>
<P>
"Industry, trade, marine transport and construction sectors
followed a downward trend while reconstruction work continued on
the same pace and financial and tourism services marked
sustained growth," said the bank document.
</P>
<P>
The coincident indicator combines 12 economic categories
including imports, exports, electricity output and airport and
port activity.
</P>
<P>
The central bank created the indicator in 1993 to fill in the
gaps of reliable data which prevents precise calculation of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As an artificial standard, the indicator was put at 100 in
January 1993. A 17.1-percent increase of the indicator was
registered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The bank said foreign debt reached 1.77 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of last year, an increase of 0.46 billion dollars
compared with that in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade deficit rose by 1.5 percent to 6.5 billion
dollars from 6.4 billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments surplus tripled in 1996, standing at
786 million dollars from 246 million dollars at the end of
1995 "due to sustained net capital inflows that covered the
trade deficit," the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
A substantial part of the inflows came from Eurobond issues
placed at the international markets by Lebanon's leading banks.
</P>
<P>
Sources of Fransabank, the third largest privately-owned bank
in Lebanon, said today that a 17-day Israeli blitz caused the
dragging down of the economic growth to 4 percent from 6.5
percent of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, a political unstability due to
the debate on an extension of President Elias Hrawi's mandate
before the end of 1995 and a parliamentary election in
August-September 1996 was another main reason behind the economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The private investment in the national economy increased by
22 percent in 1996 to about 8.2 billion dollars, compared with
that in 1995, while the public investment in the reconstruction
increased by 33.3 percent, standing at some 1.4 billion
dollars last year, the bank's seasonal report said.

raise its people's average life expectancy to 68 years in 2000 and
75 years 2020, the Health Ministry announced here today.
</P>

to 42 per 1,000 by the year 2000 and 20 per 1,000 by 2020, while
the number of new-born children weighing under 2,500 grams will be
reduced to eight percent by the year 2000 and five percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The government also set a target of 30 percent by the year 2000
and 15 percent by 2020 for under-five-year-old child malnutrition
rate.
</P>
<P>
It also planned to achieve an average height for young
Vietnamese people at 1.65 meters by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will also stamp out diseases caused by
iodine deficiency disorders by 2005 and reduce goiter incidents in
children at 8 to 12 years old to below five percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Vietnam has 4.2 doctors, 10.6
medical workers, 6.2 nurses, 0.7 university graduate pharmacists
and 1.6 college graduate pharmacists per each 1,000 people. Each
Vietnamese received 4.2 U.S. dollars of medicines in 1995 from the
state budget against 0.5 U.S. dollars in 1990.

These included raising the GDP growth rate to 4 percent,
reducing the inflation rate to 15 percent, and reducing
government borrowing from the banking system by 0.5 percent of
the GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the increased food production and the
improvement in the manufacturing and mining sectors last year
have contributed to a rise of GDP whose growth rate was likely to
reach 4.7 per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
Rashid added that the inflation rate had declined from 22.7
percent in June 1996 to 14 percent in January 1997, which
represented an average of 17.1 percent compared to the targeted
15 percent by June 1997.
</P>
<P>
He further said for the first time Tanzania had managed to
record a saving of 0.5 percent of the national income as its
revenue collection reached 551.6 million US dollars, while
expenditure reached 525 million US dollars by January 1997.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out foreign exchange reserves reached 434.2 million US
dollars by the end of January 1997 from 240 Million US dollars at
the end of June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The BOT governor mentioned the underlying factor behind the
success as the performace of the government budget which had helped
to curb the rapid increase of monetary growth and in turn had
induced a fall in the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
He said there was allso a remarkable progress in the domestic
money market recorded by the end of January 1997, adding that there
was a considerable decline of Treasury Bill rates from 44.6 percent
of 1995 to 18.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There was sufficient foreign exchange offered for sale to the
public and to the interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM), he noted.
</P>
<P>
A total of 624 Million US dollars was offered for sale in the
IFEM in 1996 compared to 486 million US dollars in 1995, while
bureaux sold 694.4 million US dollars in 1996 compared to 787.7
million US dollars in 1995, according to the governor.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to consolidate the achievement recorded so
that the country acquires good prospects in the future.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pessimistic Over Negotiations With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said that there is less room for optimism at
resumption of peace negotiations with Syria today than a month
ago, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the assessment Tuesday evening when he was
addressing a closed-door session of the Knesset (parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the signing of Hebron agreement last month
Netanyahu struck a note upbeat about the prospect of renewing
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy declared Israel's willingness to
talk business on the basis of U.N. Resolution 242. Syria responded
that it would like to restart the talks only on the basis of
Israel's declaration of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights it
snatched in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The report quoting the premier as painting a grim picture about
the Middle East situation.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the committee on his talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton during his visit to the White House earlier this month,
Netanyahu said he asked the president to pay attention to Israel's
security vulnerability on the eastern front and along the coast of
the Mediterranean plain.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed terrorism confronting Israel and Israel's
needs to strengthen defense capability to prevent eventuality of
Syrian surprise attack. He specifically mentioned early warning
capability such as on Mt. Hermon in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Clinton that Israel opposes U.S. sale of
another 100 F16 war planes to Saudi Arabia. He warned that the
sales will change the balance of power in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He also told Clinton that the ground-to-ground missiles that
Russia is selling Iran poses a threat not only to Israel. He
said that in the second stage the Iranians will be able to
hit targets in Europe. In third stage, he said, Iran will
also be cable to attack the United States.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the Palestinians, Netanyahu also stressed a
hardline approach saying that he had asked his counter-terrorism
adviser to draw a list of Palestinian officers operating
"illegally" in East Jerusalem. He promised the committee that he
would study the list and consider what steps to take.
</P>
<P>
In any case, he declared that he would go ahead with
construction of the Har Homa Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem
in spite of Palestinian protest.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Palestinians to Resist Building Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official said today that Palestinians will resist if the
construction of a new Jerusalem neighborhood for Jewish residents
goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Higher
Education Minister, was quoted by Israel Radio this morning that
in her view the issue of the building plan is "extremely
sensitive."
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem headed by Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is scheduled to hold a special
session this afternoon to discuss the construction plan.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the committee is expected to approve
the construction of an estimated 2,600 homes in the Har Homa
(Jabel Abu Ghneim) in southeast of Jerusalem, together with some
3,500 flats for Palestinians in ten existing neighborhoods in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi described the plan as an attempt by Israel to make
the building as an accomplished fact prior to the final status
negotiations between the Jewish state and the PNA on the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, a Jerusalem member of the legislative Palestinian
Council, also rejected a package deal, which includes the
building of large number of homes for Palestinian residents in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
She predicted Palestinian resistance if the building plan
goes ahead, warning that the issue could endanger the peace
negotiations between Israel and the PNA, and affect the peace
process in the future.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, during a demonstration against the
building plan in east Jerusalem Tuesday, Faisal Husseini, PNA
minister for Jerusalem affairs, said that the construction of the
Jewish neighborhood "is a declaration of war against the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people, including Palestinian political
leaders, women and school children as well as Israeli left-wing
activists, participated in the demonstration held at Jabel Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa).
</P>
<P>
As originally envisioned by planners, Har Homa will contain
about 6,500 homes. If 2,600 are to be constructed now, it
remains unclear when the remaining 3,900 will be built.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Paper Calls Deng's "Will" Fabrication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese newspaper Wen
Wei Po today refuted as a complete fabrication the so-called last
will and testament of Chinese great leader Deng Xiaoping, which
circulated in Hong Kong and overseas media several days ago.
</P>
<P>
They were concocted by a handful of Chinese "democratic
activists," the paper, which is published here, reported.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned have made it clear that the so-called
Deng's last will was cooked up by a few Chinese "democratic
activists" in the United States and delivered to some newspapers
in Hong Kong, the paper quoted a spokesman of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Deng, who passed away in Beijing last
Wednesday at the age of 93, was an outstanding leader loved and
esteemed by the Chinese people and he enjoyed high prestige in the
international community. The fabrication of "Deng's last will"
will be treated with disdain by the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary today, Wen Wei Po noted that the "democratic
activists" had their ulterior motives in spreading such a lie.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Demands Diplomatic Respect from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has reaffirmed its
constant position that it wants not only a good neighborship
but also mutual respect from Iran, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Foreign Ministry sources as saying that
Turkey has long seen Iran as an important neighbor, but it
cannot be expected to make concessions concerning its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The sources also noted that Iran should end its support
for terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Tehran issued a protest Monday over remarks by the deputy
Chief of General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces, General Cevik
Bir, who called Iran a supporter of terrorism during a joint
U.S.-Turkish Council meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry told Turkish Ambassador in Tehran
Osman Koruturk that Bir's words were irresponsible, unacceptable
and similar to those by the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Tehran have been in a diplomatic quarrel following a
controversial speech made by Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Muhammad
Reza Bagheri at the commemoration of "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night"
on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally in Sincan, 40 kilometers west of Ankara,
Bagheri called for Shariah law in Turkey, which has drawn strong
criticism from the secularist forces.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri's remarks angered Turkish Foreign Ministry, which
lodged a protest note against its behavior, saying he should not
comment on Turkey's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador rejected the accusations of the Turkish
government, and left Ankara for Tehran last week, leading to
allegations that he had been expelled covertly.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran denied such a report and said that Bagheri
had just returned home for consultations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expects to Eradicate Illiteracy by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Education experts in Egypt expect
that illiteracy will be uprooted by the year 2000 from the country
where illiteracy rate has reached 47 percent of the total
population, today's Egyptian Gazette reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the 28.2 million illiterates, 60 percent are female, said
a report released here at an ongoing regional conference on adult
education.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian experts at the meeting, 60 percent of the
aims of the national illiteracy combating plans have been achieved
so far. The plans enacted in the early 1990s were designed to
reduce 18 million illiterates in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Education expenditure accounts for around 10 percent of Egypt's
national budget.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day conference opened Tuesday, experts from
23 Arab countries will work out a common strategy to combat
illiteracy that has stalked 45 percent of the total population of
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics revealed that 8 million Arab children do
not go to school and the illiteracy rates in the Arab world had
reached 45 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Examples of the high illiteracy rates in the Arab countries are
Jordan (82 percent), Tunisia (68 percent), and Saudi Arabia (64
percent).
</P>
<P>
In fact, the problem is not confined to the Arab world as there
are still 885 million illiterate people worldwide, with women
forming the majority, the English daily pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. attempts to combat illiteracy has been much
crippled by financial straits as at least 6 billion U.S. dollars
are needed annually.
</P>
<P>
Education experts at the meeting said that the "Education for
All" slogan adopted by UNESCO, which co-sponsored the conference,
has been successful. They said it should not be only confined to
places where such programs are based, but be extended to the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Results of the ongoing regional conference on adult education
will be examined at an international conference for combating
illiteracy to be held in Germany in July.

<HEADLINE> Qian Holds Talks with Special Envoy of Surinam President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks here today with Desire
Delano Bouterse, special envoy of the President of the Republic of
Surinam, stressing that bilateral ties have improved steadily in
the 21 years since the two countries established diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Bouterse conveyed condolences on behalf of
the Surinam government and people over the death of senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, to which Qian expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries are geographically distant and have
different national conditions, he said, they are both developing
countries that share the same or similar experiences, and they now
face the common task of safeguarding world peace, stimulating
economic development and improving people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
To improve the friendly cooperative relations between China and
Surinam is in the interests of both countries, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Bouterse came to China not long after the
founding of the new government of Surinam, and that this visit
reflected Surinam's emphasis on its relations with China. China is
willing to work with Surinam to push their cooperation in various
fields to a new level, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Friendly contacts between Surinam and China can be traced back
150 years, when the first group of Chinese came to Surinam and
contributed much to its development, Bouterse said.
</P>
<P>
Surinam hopes to reinforce personnel contacts between the two
countries, especially exchanges of high level visits in an effort
to promote bilateral ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that President Jiang Zemin welcomes President Jules
Wijdenbosch to visit China at his convenience, expressing the hope
that his visit would strengthen the existing bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic and technological cooperation
between the two countries has been satisfactory in recent years,
and China considers such cooperation part of the process of
learning from each other and seeking common development.
</P>
<P>
There is still great potential for economic and trade
cooperation between China and Surinam, Qian noted, and China is
willing to work jointly in various forms with Surinam based on the
principle of equality and mutual benefit, common development and
helping to meet each other's needs.
</P>
<P>
Bouterse said that as a new and developing country, Surinam
needs to speed up its development. He hopes that such sectors as
energy, mining and trade will become the focus of cooperation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Combat Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is developing a framework to combat
money laundering as part of the region's economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Harmonization of anti-money laundering legislation and the
need to establish the means for sharing information are of great
importance to the region, the local press today quoted a latest
SADC finance and investment report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Money laundering is a procedure to change the identity of
illegally obtained money so that it appears to have originated
from a legitimate source.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, money laundering can lead to the total corruption
of a financial and political structure thereby placing an
intolerable drain on the region's economy. It can further
undermine the soundness and stability of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The need to develop such a framework to enable the region to
combat money laundering should include mandatory reporting of
suspicious financial transactions, the SADC report said.
</P>
<P>
On central bank project matters, the SADC will investigate the
illegal use of currencies on member states' borders and how
the possible conversion of these currencies is handled.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the project is to investigate possible
problems with the present structure for the legally sound
repatriation of bank notes and coins to countries of issue within
the region and to formalize procedures in the same regard.
</P>
<P>
The SADC groups 12 nations in the southern African region.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- About 30 hectares of
Kilimanjaro Forestry Reserve at Lukani, Northern Tanzania, had
been destroyed by fire, making a total of 4,500 hectares of the
national reserve gutted by fire, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kilimanjaro Region has a total of 15 forestry reserves which
cover an area of 138,644 hactares, out of which 107,820 hactares
encircle the famous Mount Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Forestry Reserve Manager, Patrick Akitanda,
attributed the trend, particularly this year, to drought which had
hit most parts of Kilimanjaro Region.
</P>
<P>
"Drought has badly affected the forestry reserve as well as
making it prone to fire", the forestry official said, adding that
fire was likely to spread unchecked due to the dry leaves.
</P>
<P>
He further said worse still, part of the forestry reserve was
impassablle by foot as it was on steep slopes. The fire had
destroyed even the roots, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Other reserves which were reported to have been gutted by fire
were in Mwanga District. They included Kamwala Forestry Reserve
whose 170 hactares were razed, Kindoroko and Minja reserves which
lost 260 and 150 hactares respectively.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Likely to Get More Electricity in 3 Years: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is likely to get
around 2,000 megawatt of electricity from various power stations
to be constructed under both public and private sectors within the
next three and a half years, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister informed the parliament that 300 megawatt
(mw) of electricity is expected to be supplied by the next one
year from three barge-mounted power stations which would be
constructed under private sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has suffered huge load-shedding for several months,
which is causing enormous suffering to the people and loss to the
productive sector.
</P>
<P>
The Power Development Board (PDB) has received the competitive
proposals on January 30 for the three barge-mounted stations, said
the prime minister, adding that the stations, first of this kind
in Bangladesh, would be commissioned by the next one year.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina further told the house that the PDB also accepted
a proposal for construction of 250-300 mw power stations at the
west zone of the country utilizing the coals to be unearthed from
the coal mine discovered in Barapukuria areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PDB has initiated several other power stations
throughout the country to meet the increasing electricity demand
by the next three and a half years, she added.

parties, friendly organizations, and prominent figures from
various circles in many countries, chiefs of a number of
international organizations, many countries' diplomatic envoys to

in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan who sent a large number of
telegrams and letters of condolence, issued statements or held
discussions, and participated in memorial services to express
their grief and profound sympathy.
</P>
<P>
For this, we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude.
</P>
<P>
The Party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups in
China are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, adhere to the Party's basic line
unswervingly, continue to pursue the independent foreign policy of
peace, turn grief into strength, and work hard to implement the
"three-step" development strategy and build our country into a
prosperous, democratic, and civilized modern socialist country.

<HEADLINE> China May Have Developed Paper More Than 2,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Fragments of a paper-like
material have been found on a bronze mirror dating back to the Qin
(221-206 BC) and Western Han (206 BC-24 AD) dynasties by
archaeologists in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that the material, if proven to be
paper, will put China's invention of paper at 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It has been the common belief that paper was developed by Cai
Lun, a eunuch in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220).
</P>
<P>
The mirror was discovered among coins, painted pottery and
textile tools in a group of tombs at a construction site in Yima
city. Last year, archaeologists in Henan excavated a total of over
2,300 ancient tombs in a 68,000-sq-m area.
</P>
<P>
The find included neolithic building remains in Dengzhou,
4,000-year-old tribal ruins at the construction site of a
reservoir on the Yellow River, a pit with a set of 24 bronze bells
from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC), and the layout of a
ruined city from the Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC).
</P>
<P>
At the Shang city site, the experts found wheel tracks that
pushed the earliest date of Chinese carriages back at least 300
years.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Asked to Take Faster Move for Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Bangladesh's
major donors Tuesday praised the government's commitment to
reform, but insisted that faster move was needed for privatization
and administrative reform, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The aid group, at a two-day mid-term review meeting with local
officials, said they were aware of the new government's commitment
to reforms, but more expeditious steps were needed to fulfill
that.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh continued to spend 32 million U.S. dollars annually
to subsidize the loss-making public enterprises after attempts by
the past government to privatize those failed due to resistance
from workers' unions and even from within the government.
</P>
<P>
The new government of Sheikh Hasina was trying hard to realize
its commitment to donors by implementing the reform program, said
the donors, led by the world bank's mission chief in Dhaka Pierre
Landell Mills.
</P>
<P>
However, an effective, efficient and friendly administration,
was a must for Bangladesh to achieve its goals and the
privatization was needed to stop wastage of huge amount of public
money, allowing them to be invested in infrastructure and social
sector development, the donors added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah Ams Kibria, who opened the
meeting, admitted the reform was not an easy process and there was
always a price that has to be paid for that.
</P>
<P>
"We are fortunate that Prime Minister Hasina is committed to
reform which can bring about the well-being of the ordinary
people," said Kibria, who also briefed the progresses achieved in
the last few months and explained the economic policies of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the most undeveloped countries, received
annually around 2 billion dollars foreign aid.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Zones Still Seeing Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's five Special Economic
Zones (SEZ), a focus of Deng Xiaoping's massive economic reform
project, are still running full-speed ahead, averaging 4.6
percentage points higher than the rest of the nation in the growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan
Island, had a GDP of 215.5 billion yuan in 1996, 14.3 percent
higher than in 1995, a senior official with the State Council's
Special Economic Zones Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is an indication of the vigor and vitality in
China's SEZs," said Huang Taihe, director of the SEZ Bureau of the
SEZ Office. "Their upbeat economic performance is largely
attributable to efforts to be more vigorous in a functional way as
policy advantages decrease."
</P>
<P>
The SEZ's success story before the 1990s was said to have a
great deal to do with some favorable policies of the Central
Government, which have been weakened to some extent by the fact
that the privileges began to be extended to other parts of the
country, as China opened wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of extensive policy adjustments last year, the
SEZs maintained their rapid growth by consolidating pillar and
hi-tech industries, pushing a name-brand strategy, and looking for
new areas of economic growth, Huang explained in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the strength of state-owned firms and service
industries has been increasing. Statistics indicate that their
industrial output value grew 15 percent last year. In Shenzhen,
China's first SEZ, state-owned firms were growing at a 30-percent
rate, far outpacing that of the overseas-funded enterprises in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the SEZs attracted six billion US dollars in actual
overseas funds, up 12.5 percent over 1995, and their foreign trade
showed steady growth.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the price of retail goods in the SEZs was
held within five percent, one percent lower than the national
average, while average incomes of residents in the SEZs actually
went up 19.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the SEZs have more than a hundred projects as part
of an ambitious program to improve the infrastructure, especially
transport and energy, to fuel economic growth and provide a solid
foundation for further development.

<HEADLINE> Australia Exports Toxic Waste to India: Official </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Chavalit to Visit Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh is scheduled to pay a two-day visit to Malaysia
beginning on Thursday, government house sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit will set the stage for strengthening economic
cooperation with Malaysia and press for early settlement of some
frictions, although the trip is mainly a courtesy call by Chavalit
as a new prime minister and part of a familiarization tour of the
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
He has already visited the Philippines and Indonesia since he
took the premiership in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Among issues which Prime Minister Chavalit is likely to raise
with his Malaysian counterpart is a border dispute, in particular
the placement of three pillars demarcating the Thai-Malaysian
border.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia erected boundary pillars in the 1970s
across the 647-km border based on a treaty signed in 1909.
</P>
<P>
However, the positions of three pillars have created dispute
and have been causes of conflicts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit may also ask Malaysia to exercise caution in deporting
Bangladeshis who are working illegally in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Malaysia has launched crackdown campaigns on
illegal foreign laborers, in particular Bangladeshis. Many of them
have been deported back to Thailand, because they had entered
Malaysia via Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand argues that the Bangladeshis have had proper visas
before entering Malaysia and the problems have been their
overstaying and seeking employment illegally.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit is also expected to raise the fishing dispute, which
has been a chronic one, causing frictions from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side may propose to set up a joint task force to
tackle the fishing disputes and create a new framework for
fisheries cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit is also expected to try to iron out some customs
problems concerning perishable Thai goods in transit to Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Education ministers and their
representatives of Southeast Asian countries started here today a
three-day meeting to discuss regional cooperation in education.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the meeting, Philippine Secretary of

SEAMEO has expanded to cover numerous programs in educational
innovation and technology, higher education, vocational and
technical education and agricultural education.
</P>

"As we approach a new millennium, we see ahead a different kind
of playing field. Not only will there be a more universal use of
technology but also a continually changing technology. Thus, we
must all become life-long learners," Gloria said.
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of scenario, SEAMEO will continue to play an
important and critical role," she said.
</P>
<P>
Founded on November 30, 1965, the SEAMEO has been striving for
the promotion of regional cooperation among Southeast Asian
nations through joint projects in the areas of education, science
and culture.
</P>
<P>
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are full members of the SEAMEO,

HELSINKI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Four out of five Finnish
people oppose the country's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), a report released by the country's Council of
Economic Organizations said today.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 2,500 people, more than 80 percent agreed that
the country should, like other Nordic countries, develop close
cooperation with NATO instead of seeking full membership of the
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 percent of those polled backed the idea of joining
NATO, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that four out of 10 Finns aren't
interested in politics, a number which rises to six out of 10
among under 30s.
</P>
<P>
It described Finnish people's attitude toward the changes in
Europe as "pragmatic," since most of them have accepted Finland's
accession to the European Union (EU) in January, 1995 despite
strong opposition in a previous referendum,
</P>
<P>
Now, only a quarter of those questioned still want Finland to
leave the EU, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent considered it was right for Finland to
join the single currency provided most EU members join it first,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Transport Workers Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Transport Workers in Nepal
today staged a nationwide strike in protest of the government's
alleged reluctance to deal with their demands, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Few public transportation was seen in Kathmandu streets in the
morning due to the strike causing inconvenience to most commuters
in this capital city, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Transport Independent Workers Organization, a
national transport workers' union close to the opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML),
called today's strike after holding three fruitless meetings with
the transport authorities on its demands since last December.
</P>
<P>
The organization has demanded, among others, the government to
immediately implement the new transport regulations since the
country's Vehicle and Transport Management Act has been enacted
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of transport workers Tuesday refused to attend a
meeting called by the government authorities as a last minute
effort to call off the strike.
</P>
<P>
They said that they were fed up with such meetings without
concrete solutions to their demands and would make the strike
successful.
</P>
<P>
The government late Tuesday issued a communique to urge the
transport workers to call off the strike, promising that
arrangements have been made regarding their demands.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Transport Management, the new
transport regulations, centerpiece of the workers' demands, will
be soon implemented.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Car Sales in 1997 to Be Lowest in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automobile sales
this year are expected to register their lowest growth rate in
five years because of the sluggish economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hisashi Kunifusa, president of Isuzu distributor, Tri Petch
Isuzu Sales Co., said the company expects the country's automobile
market to grow by only 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the market will grow slightly to about 600,000 units
this year, compared to 589,000 units last year, the lowest growth
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The effects of slow sales during the second half of last year
have carried through to this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even if the economy improves in the second half of this year,
the best that can be hoped for is some improvement in vehicle
sales in 1998, according to the Isuzu forecast.
</P>
<P>
As for Isuzu, it expects a 5 percent sales growth on the Thai
market, to 130,000 units, this year, one third of which will be

<HEADLINE> Finland Sets 1998-2001 Framework for Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government today
passed a general framework of fiscal expenditure for the four
years, of 1998-2001, aimed at maintaining the policy of austerity
and preventing inflation.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, the total spending in 1998 and 2001 will
be 191 billion Finnish marks (about 38.2 billion U.S. dollars) for
each year. It will be 192 billion marks (38.4 billion dollars) in
1999 and 190 billion marks in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Finland's tight budget policy is to ensure that the country can
smoothly join the European Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry estimated that Finland last year achieved,
in debt and inflation, the basic standards, set by the Maastricht
Treaty for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
However, serious unemployment and heavy debts still troubled
the government because the Finnish economy had just sluggishly
recovered from the most severe depression since World War II.
</P>
<P>
In Finland, the jobless at present still stands at 400,000,
more than 15 percent, and much higher than in the average
industrialized country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, national debt amounted to 418 billion
marks (83.6 billion dollars), 10 billion marks (2 billion dollars)
above the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said today that the ratio of
national debt over gross domestic product (GDP) was now likely to
exceed 70 percent, but it would fall to 69 percent or so in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Highlights Success in War Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper today praised the country's success in the war
against drugs, saying the achievements under his presidency over
the last two and a half years have been greater than those of the
entire decade.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking just two days before the United States
gives its annual verdicts on efforts by Colombia and 31 other
countries to fight drug trafficking and decides whether or not to
"certify" them as allies in the drugs war.
</P>
<P>
Colombia failed to win certification last year and consequently
faced economic sanctions by the U.S.. The country is hoping that
President Bill Clinton re-instates "certification" this year.
</P>
<P>
Samper was speaking after the release of a report by the
Colombian authorities cataloguing the progress in the drugs war.
</P>
<P>
Besides destroying 60,000 hectares of drug crops, which
accounted for more than 90 percent of the total destroyed so far
this decade, the anti-drugs authorities also seized 115,665
kilograms of processed cocaine in 1995 and 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,511 drug processing laboratories have been destroyed in
the last two years, compared with 1,239 from 1990 to 1993, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, the police raided the biggest drugs
laboratory in the country, which had the capacity to refine 300
tons of cocaine, half of the amount which is believed to enter the
U.S. every year, it noted.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Lower House Approves President's Re-election Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Chamber of Deputies,
the country's lower house of congress, today gave the go-ahead to
a constitutional amendment that would allow President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso run for unprecedented re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second and final approval given by the lower
house. Of the 513 congressmen, 368 voted for the amendment, 60
more than the three-fifths majority needed and 32 more than the
first approval in January.
</P>
<P>
The amendment now advances to the Senate, where it needs the
approval of 49 of the Senate's 81 members.
</P>
<P>
Under the Brazilian constitution, presidents, governors and
mayors are banned from standing for re-election.
</P>
<P>
However, President Cardoso wanted to amended the constitution
before his term expired next year so that he can stand again and
continue his economic reform program which has successfully
brought down the country's rampant inflation to about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the amendment will pave the way for reforms of
the social security system and the civil service, which are
considered crucial to the long-term success of the reforms.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Backs Plan for Better Road Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) --Thailand has won support from
other ASEAN countries to prioritize the liberalization of road
transport links to make way for freer flow of goods in the region,
according to a report from northern Thailand today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand made the proposal Tuesday at the opening of the
two-day meeting of senior transport officials from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations held in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand
ahead of Friday's ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is seen as Thailand's continuous attempt to
facilitate the transport of goods by land through Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, and the three future ASEAN
members -- Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, to ensure that the
near-zero tariff set under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) will
lead to freer trade by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Under the concept, trucks carrying goods in transit can cross
from one country to another without being subject to tariffs and
tight checks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also agreed to set up a joint body made up of
senior economic and transport officials to look into matters such
as freedom of cross-border transportation, customs, insurance,
public health and quarantine, security, and the completion of
facilities within the set timeframe.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Rejects Tin-mining in Mangrove Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has rejected
an Industry Ministry proposal to allow tin mining to resume in
mangrove areas in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The rejection, made at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, was
aimed at protecting the country's few remaining mangrove forests,
which are important breeding grounds for marine life.
</P>
<P>
Mangrove forests are regarded as "nurseries" in which young
aquatic species feed and shelter before they are strong enough to
swim to deep sea.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the cabinet ordered a halt to tin mining in mangrove
forests along part of the Andaman coast.
</P>
<P>
However, recently some 25 concessionaires are reportedly
putting pressure on the Industry Ministry to allow the resumption
of tin-mining in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Korn Dabbaransi said after the meeting that
he believed that the 25 concessionaires would understand the
situation because of the market price of tin is now very low so
that their operations might not even be economically viable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmental activists applauded the government's
decision, saying that mangroves should be rehabilitated and
managed by communities who depend on their fertility for long-term
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Some activists said that considering the low tin price, the
concessionaires might want to develop the land for huge profits
instead of tin mining.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, Thailand had been a major tin producer and
exporter in the world. However in the last decade, the country's
tin output had dropped drastically because of low tin price and
high mining cost.

<P>
BRASILIA -- The consumption of petroleum byproducts in Brazil
will reach 1.65 million barrels per day during the first half of

MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
mapped out a five-year development program for the coconut
industry, one of the country's major foreign exchange earners, the
local newspaper Manila Bulletin reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, about 348,000 hectares of existing coconut
plantations in the country will be rehabilitated and at least
50,000 hectares of new coconut plantations will be procured.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has agreed to finance the program with a loan
amounting to 3.12 billion pesos (120 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
According to a study by the Philippine Coconut Authority, the
country's coconut industry stands to suffer a shortfall of 1.96
million tons between now and the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall was due to the decreasing pattern in the
country's coconut yield which has been dropping at a rate of 2
percent since 1990, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The exports of coconut products in the Philippines earned more
than 1.3 billion dollars in 1996, amounting for 15.4 percent of
the country's total export earnings last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Tries to Prevent Car Dispute Going to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will send a team to
Japan, the United States and Europe on Wednesday in a bid to avert
action against the national car policy at the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said Tuesday
after meeting President Soeharto that Indonesia hoped the world's
three biggest trading powers would not take the car issue to the
WTO panel of judges, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the U.S. and the European Union have filed a complaint
to the WTO over Indonesia's car policy last October, saying it
violated international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto in February last year ruled that producers
of a national car would be granted exemptions on import duties and
luxury taxes, which add about 60 percent to the price of other
cars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor Putra Nasional was chosen as the first national car
supplier and is requited to clear an eventual goal of a local
content exceeding 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a joint venture with Kia Motors, South Korea, Pt. Timor is
allowed to import the cars from South Korea until its own factory
becomes operational in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japanese vehicles dominate Indonesia's auto market at present.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Trade Expected to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade among the South
American Common Market (Mercosur) countries will stabilize in the
next two years following an average annual growth of 21.54 percent
in 1992-1995, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry predicted today.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary study, the ministry said exports from
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the four Mercosur member
countries, were maintaining their upward trend, except with the
free trade area formed by the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that exports among Mercosur countries increased
39 percent in 1993, 19 percent in 1994 and 5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, recovery of growth was inevitable
because of commitments made by the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government had reduced export tariffs and import
duties, while Argentina decided to charge a 3 percent duty on
imports from other countries which do not belong to the Mercosur.

<HEADLINE> Tax Collection Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China collected 56.79 billion
yuan in industrial and commercial taxes last month, up 13.4
percent over January of 1996, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total tax revenue, the central government's revenue
climbed 10.9 percent to 26.63 billion yuan while that for local
governments amounted to 30.16 billion yuan, an increase of 15.8
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, value-added industrial output rose
10.3 percent over the first month of last year while retail price
growth stood at only 3.3 percent on a year-on-year basis
nationwide, the smallest monthly growth over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Domestic value-added tax (VAT) and consumption tax, two major
tax items in China, enjoyed an increase of 14 percent to reach
26.5 billion yuan in January. Taxes from tobacco, wine brewing,
power and crude oil sectors witnessed strong growing momentum last
month.
</P>
<P>
Import taxes levied by customs, including import VAT and
consumption taxes, suffered a moderate 1.1 percent decline in
January to 4.77 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Individual income taxes and foreign-funded enterprise income
taxes grew rapidly and local tax revenue made steady progress,
with individual income collection surging by 48.4 percent to score
at 1.82 billion yuan and foreign-funded enterprise income tax
amounting to 1.68 billion yuan, a marked 50.5 percent in growth
from January last year.
</P>
<P>
Business taxes, among major local taxes, went up 11 percent to
stand at 14.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue increased 20 percent in nine regions and cities
including Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Xiamen, Shandong, Qingdao,
Shenzhen, Yunnan, Qinghai and Tibet, while four other areas
suffered declines in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, due to a slight deceleration of
industrial production, delayed taxable payments climbed by 7.8
billion yuan from the beginning of this year, which hindered the
collection of industrial and commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
Tax authorities called for further efforts to strengthen
taxation of some key enterprises to eliminate tax defaulters.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial and commercial tax revenue topped 644.6
billion yuan in 1996, up 19.7 percent from the previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Swiss teenager superstar
Martina Hingis, the youngest Grand Slam champion of the century,
is ready to become the youngest tennis player ever to be ranked
first in the world.
</P>
<P>
If injured Steffi Graf failed to defend her title at the Lipton
Championships next month, Hingis will officially anchor the top
ranking on March 31, a WTA Tour spokeswoman confirmed in Stamford,
Connecticut, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graf is expected to be sidelined for four weeks while nursing a
knee injury, which will keep her from defending the rankings
points she picked up in winning titles at Indian Wells and Lipton
last year.
</P>
<P>
With Graf out of those tournaments, Hingis will edge past the
German in the rankings at the conclusion of the Lipton event, the
WTA Tour said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss has kept her unbeaten record in 1997, winning four
singles titles this year while running her match record to 18-0.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Hingis is scheduled to play next week at
Indian Wells before moving on to the March 17-29 Lipton
Championships.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin plans to show off its
success as a modern economic and financial hub, said its mayor,
who hopes to establish China's third stock exchange in the city.
</P>
<P>
The sea port city, one of the three municipalities directly
under the Central Government, will focus on developing financial
and insurance services, Mayor Zhang Lichang said recently at the
annual meeting of the city's people's delegates.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of Tianjin's economic ambition is on helping the
securities market to flourish, modernizing the stock exchange
networks and piloting a futures market. Eventually, the city may
join Shanghai and Shenzhen to have its own stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said they will also improve the management of all
branches of Citibank -- Sino-foreign joint financial ventures --
while setting up financial and insurance companies both regionally
and nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the traditional trade center in north China will
speed up the formation of multi-functional business zones by
establishing some large-scale wholesale markets, and developing
comprehensive trade facilities and nationwide commodity fairs.
</P>
<P>
Jumbo business groups are encouraged to form especially to meet
the business challenges in the northeast, northwest and north
China.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of chain stores, sea port construction, real
estate and tourism is also on the priority list.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, service businesses thrived in Tianjin, accounting for
40.5 percent of the city's gross domestic product (GDP), up 1.5
percentage points from the year before.
</P>
<P>
To date, the city has 2,557 financial or insurance companies,
including 25 from foreign countries.

KIEV, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian banks have been caught
in a deep financial crisis because of unpaid loans, Ukrainian
Interfax News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The banks have given 59 percent of their long-term credit to
state enterprises, most of which could not be recalled because
Ukraine's guaranty law has never been properly implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not reveal the total sum of the banks'
long-term credit to the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
There have been 229 banks registered in Ukraine, but only 25
percent of them can operate normally, because the others are beset
by financial problems.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22 banks have declared bankruptcy. Another 20 have
been banned and six more have been ordered to stop commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Association of Banks estimated that the banks of
the country have a total capital of 3.6 billion Gryvnas (about 1.9
billion U.S. dollars) at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are business news
in brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) is targeting a
10 billion U.S. dollars exports goal this year or a substantial 40
percent of the 25 billion dollars total exports target set by the
Department of Trade and Industry for 1997.
</P>
<P>
PEZA Director-General Lilia de Lima said Tuesday that the
target represents 54 percent increase from the 6.5 billion dollars
exports revenues generated by the economic zones last year.
</P>
<P>
The electronics sector is expected to remain as the economic
zone's largest export product since this sector comprised 57.7
percent of the total investments registered with the PEZA last
year.
</P>
<P>
-- San Miguel Corp., the largest beer brewery in the
Philippines, planned to raise the prices of all its beer brands
from March 3, including a 10.5 percent rise for its flagship
brand.
</P>
<P>
The price increase is to adjust for an amended excise tax
which took effect last month, and to "help cushion pressures
brought about by rising operational costs," the company said
Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel's flagship Pale Pilsen will cost 10.50 pesos (40
U.S. cents), up from 9.50 pesos (36.3 U.S. cents), but prices for
the other brands were not disclosed. San Miguel has a share of at
least 80 percent of the domestic market, according to industry
officials.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the increase in beer prices was
unlikely to affect the company's balance sheet because the revenue
would mainly be used to cover the additional taxes on beer.

HEFEI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The fishery industry in east
China's Anhui Province has recorded rapid development since the
province launched a reform in the sector in 1994.

The integration of cotton growing with the processing and sale
of cotton products has turned Xinjiang into China's top cotton
producer. Its annual cotton output has increased from less than
80,000 tons in 1980 to more than one million tons in 1996, which
accounts for one fourth of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province, famous for its yaks, has introduced advanced
techniques for processing of cashmere-like yak hair, and the
province's high-grade yak hair sweaters take a big share in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
In the Weibei Plateau, over one million farmers attend training
classes on apple tree planting every year, and so far 530,000
hectares of apple trees have been planted in the area with an
annual apple output of three million tons. Apple planting and
processing has become one of Shaanxi's pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The five autonomous regions and provinces have been actively
promoting economic, science and technology cooperation with
foreign countries to boost agricultural development, and as a
result northwest China has attracted more and more foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada, France, Israel, Mexico and the World
Bank have launched cooperative projects on uncultivated land
reclamation, saline-alkali land improvement, the ecological
balance of land, crops, fruit trees and vegetable growth in desert
land with these five provinces and autonomous regions.

Cooperating with the World Bank and the World Food Program,
Yan'an Prefecture has reclaimed nearly 70,000 hectares of land in
the uncultivated hills and valleys along the Yanhe River. Terraced
fields, orchards, grassland and forestry centers have been built

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Modern science and technology
have helped agricultural development take a giant leap forward in
northwest China, a developing region which makes up one fourth of
China's total land space.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that the grain output of the five
autonomous regions and provinces in northwest China reached 32
billion kilograms, a record number in history. Moreover, another
two million farmers got rid of poverty last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the promotion of science and
technology contributed to about 40 percent of the agro-economic
growth in the region in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China includes the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi
provinces.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 80 million, northwest China has rich
resources, but the region used to suffer from low temperatures,
droughts, desertification, windstorms and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the bad climate hindered the agricultural
development in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
To rectify the situation, the five autonomous regions and
provinces increased their investment in agro-science and
technology projects on water and soil conservation, breeding of
quality seeds, dry farming techniques, water-saving irrigation
methods and high-efficiency agriculture and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, hundreds of scientific and technological
discoveries were made annually, benefitting millions of rural
households.
</P>
<P>
In the cold high plateau areas, fruit trees and vegetables are
growing well with the application of solar energy in the
greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
The farm products also witnessed a healthy growth in the areas
that have water shortages, after using farming techniques such as
drip irrigation, seeping irrigation and plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province has raised its per hectare wheat output by 30
percent by spreading seeding and filming techniques. Xinjiang's
per hectare cotton output reached 1,320 kilograms, the highest
figure among China's all provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The application of modern farming and farm produce processing
techniques have helped raise the productivity in northwest China
and a number of new pillar industries have emerged.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Serbs to Participate in Election in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Tuesday called upon Serbs in the U.N.-administered region of
Eastern Slavonia to take part in the upcoming municipal elections
and urged Croatian leaders to provide firm guarantees that Serb
rights will be respected.
</P>
<P>
"Failure by the Serb community to participate in elections and
take advantage of those rights and guarantees will only work
against that community's best interests," Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said in a report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I therefor call upon the residents of the region to consider
carefully their options, to follow wise leadership and to take up
their future as citizens of the Republic of Croatia," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, some Serb leaders are encouraging
others to boycott the election, because of fear that they will be
held accountable for crimes committed during the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia. Croatia has published a tentative list of 800
Serbs indicted for war crimes. Serbs fear some more lists could
follow.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was concerned over the recent increase in the
number of Serbs leaving Eastern Slavonia, "which could constitute
a threat to the international efforts to promote peace" both in
the area and the rest of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the Croatian government to issue formal, public
confirmation of promises made orally to the United Nations to
guarantee the rights of the Serb minority and to consider
favorably application by young Serbs to avoid mandatory service in
the Croatian army.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Surge on Dow's Gains, Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
all staged strong rallies and ended sharply higher Tuesday,
fuelled by Wall Street's overnight gains and a solid dollar.
</P>
<P>
Leading British shares on the London market fell from a high of
4,357.9 reached earlier in the day, less than five points lower
than their record closing high, as a weak Dow today and caution
ahead of US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan's speech in the
US Congress Wednesday limited their gains.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index ended at a session low, up a moderate 13.6
points at 4,344.7.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares continued their strong gains on the
back of an overnight rally on Wall Street and a firmer dollar
which was favorable for German exports, with the DAX-30 index
ending 49.0 points higher at 3,233.21.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Paris also made strong gains today and moved
back above the 2,600-point level once again on the back of New
York's Monday night rally and a solid dollar, with the CAC-40
index closing up 39.87 points at 2,607.72.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 13.6
points at 4,344.7. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 49.0 points
higher at 3,233.21. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed 39.87 points
up at 2,607.72.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Commitment to Gulf Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has reaffirmed U.S. commitment to security in the Gulf region and
the safety of American troops stationed there, the White House
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was assuring Saudi Arabia's second Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz over
the security issue during their talks at the White House on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The president told Prince Sultan that we remain committed to
ensuring security and stability in the critical Gulf region and
will work with Saudi Arabia to respond to any external threats to
our mutual interest," the White House said in a statement released
following the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "stressed his determination to protect the security of
American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia" to Sultan, "and they
discussed our cooperation in the fight against terrorism," the
statement went on.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not specifically mention the investigation
into the June 25 bomb attack on a U.S. military housing complex in
a Dhahran air base, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. administration officials had expected the probe, which
has been a point of contention between the United States and Saudi
Arabia, to come up in discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis reportedly have arrested some 40 Saudi Shiites for
the bombing. But the United States still maintains it has reached
no conclusions as to who was responsible for the attack, and
senior U.S. law enforcement officials have complained over the
cooperation they are receiving from Saudi investigators, whom they
say have failed to turn over requested pieces of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The White House statement said Clinton and Sultan had also
discussed the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-Saudi relations are strong and will remain so," the
statement said. "We have expanding trade and commercial ties that
benefit both our economies."
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, who arrived in Washington on Monday, is to
meet with Defense Secretary William Cohen at the Pentagon on
Wednesday and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday,
before heading back to Saudi Arabia on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Positive Development in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Recent positive developments in
the Liberian peace process have increased the willingness of the
donor nations to give a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
The willingness of the donor countries to become more involved
in Liberia is possibly "the most important message" to come out
of a recent ministerial meeting to support the process, United
Nations under-secretary-general Marrack Goulding said.
</P>
<P>
Goulding made the remarks at a one-day meeting, held at the
U.N. headquarters in New York last Thursday, which was attended
by representatives of member countries of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), donor nations and relevant U.N.
agencies, the Nigerian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speeches by Tome Ikimi, foreign affairs minister of Nigeria,
which currently holds the chairmanship of the ECOWAS, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan set the tone for the well-attended
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Norway, one of the donor nations, has said it is now more
willing to contribute resources to the peace process because of
the evidence of seriousness on the part of the faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
"That (the faction leaders' action) is going to unlock the
contribution from Norway," said a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other donors also confirmed their
readiness to help in airlifting, training and provision of
equipment and troops pledged by some west African countries to
the sub-regional peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Both Ikimi and Annan called for the strengthening of the
Nigerian-led peace-keeping force as the implementation of the
Abuja Peace Accord enters the last and crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
According to Goulding, there was consensus at the meeting on
the need to strengthen ECOMOG, which currently has 8,980 troops
against the estimated 18,000 it required to effectively cover
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports put the number of ECOMOG soldiers at about
12,000, with some 8,000 from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is also evidence of political will on the
part of ECOWAS and the international community to bring the
process to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"There was a great deal of optimism about what has been
achieved in the last few months" in Liberia, Goulding said.
</P>
<P>
The achievement is highlighted by the just-concluded
disarmament and demobilization process in Liberia, which
witnessed the disarming of 28,000 factional fighters.
</P>
<P>
The figure is more than two thirds of the realistic estimate
of combatants.
</P>
<P>
A general agreement was reached at the meeting that general
elections should be held in Liberia on May 30 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
But disagreement still exists on whether to allow Liberian
refugees living in neighboring countries to participate in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, some people wanted the
elections to be as inclusive as possible while others,
particularly the countries hosting the refugees, expressed
reservation about the participation of the refugees, which
constitute some one quarter of Liberia's current population of
2.82 million.
</P>
<P>
The countries are concerned about the "controversy that would
arise if people speaking the same language as the Liberian
refugees but in fact are nationals of neighboring countries are
registered as voters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been agreed that the international community
should hasten efforts to repatriate the Liberian refugees as many
as possible before the elections to enable them to vote.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, capital of Liberia, ECOMOG has urged Liberians
who fled the civil war to return home to participate in the
effort to rebuild their country, saying that the security
situation has been greatly improved after the successful
disarmament exercise.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Solar Energy Opens in Yaounde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The seminar on solar energy
and development opened in Yaounde today with emphasis on the
advantages of solar energy in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Participants mentioned that in most African countries, 70
percent of the population live in rural areas. However, the
living communities are small and isolated with no access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
But they need electricity for pumping water and increasing
production, one of the participants noted.
</P>
<P>
They cannot get it in the conventional way. But with solar
energy, they can have electricity at a very low cost,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy is an important social economic asset especially
in rural areas where electricity is still a rare commodity.
</P>
<P>
Forty participants from around the world attending the seminar
will identify national projects to be involved within the
framework of the world energy program aiming at developing solar
energy in rural zone.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Fled Civil War Urged to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's peace-keeping
force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, today urged Liberian refugees
and people displaced by the civil war to return home and join the
effort to rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander, Nigeria's Major-General Victor Malu, was
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that with the
prevailing good security situation in Liberia, returnees have
nothing to fear.

Citizens in Liberia are currently going about their own normal
businesses and striving to pick up the pieces of their lives
disturbed by the war, said Malu.
</P>
<P>
The general promised that ECOMOG would never allow anyone to
disturb the lives of Liberians again, and the continuing military
operations by ECOMOG across the country to retrieve all weapons
from the former warring factions is to create a better place for
people to live in.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is scheduled to held its post-war general elections on
May 31 this year to end the devastating seven-year-old civil war.

<HEADLINE> France Issues New Arrest Warrant against Algerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- France's top anti-terrorist
judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has issued the second arrest warrant
against Algerian terrorist Djamel Lounici, who is assumed to be
one of the emirs of Islamic extremists in Europe and is now jailed
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials said that the warrant, signed on February 17
and accompanied with a request for extradition of Lounici from
Italy, was issued after the dismantling by French police of an
arms trafficking network which sent logistic supplies to Islamic
guerrillas in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Condemned to death by the Algerian government, Lounici, 34, was
a member of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front and was running a
back-up network of logistic supplies for Islamic militants in his
home country from several European countries.
</P>
<P>
He was also wanted in France for projecting a series of
terrorist attacks in Morocco in the summer of 1994 from Islamic
neighborhoods in the suburbs of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Italy will put him on trial in early April and has agreed to
France's request for his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Judge Bruguiere visited Lounici in his Italian jail in December
last year after a terrorist bombing attack on a Paris underground
train in the Port Royal station killed four people and wounded 90.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1962 in Algiers, Lounici was first arrested in
Switzerland in 1994 for possessing a false Moroccan passport and a
false identity card.
