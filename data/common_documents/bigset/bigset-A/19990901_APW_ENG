<HEADLINE> Web Cos. Fight Sales Laws As Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six companies with large Internet businesses  
joined forces on Wednesday to try to boost consumer confidence in 
buying products and services over the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which includes Microsoft Corp., America Online Inc.,  
and IBM, plans to urge governments to reduce discrepancies between 
laws in the U.S. and abroad that may inhibit people from buying 
items over the Internet. It also will try to come up with a code of 
conduct to prevent unscrupulous behavior by Web retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The other members of the group, which is called the Electronic  
Commerce and Consumer Protection Group, are Dell Computer Corp., 
Time Warner Inc. and Visa U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	The group plans to argue, for instance, for consistent rules  
protecting consumers who use credit cards to pay for products, said 
Ron Plesser, coordinator of the group and a partner at the 
Washington firm of Piper &AMP; Marbury. The United States gives 
consumers a grace period to contest a disputed bill, and also 
limits liability for purchases made after a card number is stolen, 
while some other nations don't, Plesser said. 
</P>
<P>
	These types of inconsistencies are ``obviously a barrier to  
businesses,'' Plesser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is just the latest industry alliance to try to combat  
what some Internet companies see as government practices that are 
inhibiting the growth of the Web. Early this year, for instance, 
leading companies ranging from IBM to German publisher Bertelsmann 
AG formed a global group to discourage governments from imposing 
Internet taxes as well as a European privacy measure that would 
make it tougher for companies to transmit personal data about their 
customers over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Smith Skips Out To See Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills defensive end Bruce  
Smith took a second day off from practice Wednesday to be with his 
ailing father. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he'll rejoin the team Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still in the hospital right now,'' Smith said in a  
telephone interview. ``I'm coming back tonight. I can sit down and 
talk more about it tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's father, George, has been troubled by several ailments  
including emphysema. He is in a rehabilitation center near Smith's 
home in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wouldn't be specific about his father's condition or say  
if it were immediately life-threatening. ``It's really a number of 
things that he's dealing with,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oft-injured veteran defensive end credits his father for  
inspiring him to keep playing -- and to play through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wrote him off about six or seven years ago,''  
Smith said last month. ``They said he had six months to live, and 
my father's still hanging around. He's not in very good shape but 
he's still passing on knowledge and experiences and wisdom, and 
that's where I get my will to keep pushing on.''

<HEADLINE> Bowie Fans Can Download New Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fans won't need to push their way into the store  
to be first in line for David Bowie's new album -- but they will 
need a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fee, fans can download ``hours ...'' from the Web sites of  
about 50 music retailers beginning Sept. 21. CDs of the recording 
will not hit stores until Oct. 4 in Britain and the following day 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Bowie said he is determined to help Internet  
music releases become the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	A credit card payment will allow customers to download the album  
to their hard drive. But to prevent piracy, they will not be able 
to transfer it to a disk. The price will be set independently by 
the retailers.

<HEADLINE> Latest Ozone Hole Weaker Than '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The ``ozone hole'' over the Antarctic is expected  
to grow this year to around twice the size of Europe, but it is 
weaker than last year because polar winds have eased, a U.N. expert 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone forms a protective layer that shields the earth from  
damaging ultraviolet rays. Any reduction in the ozone layer can let 
harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun reach the earth's surface. 
Too much UV radiation can cause skin cancer and destroy tiny plants 
at the beginning of the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was the biggest and the strongest ozone depletion in  
Antarctica,'' said World Meteorological Organization ozone expert 
Rumen Bojkov. ``This year is not as strong as last year, but it is 
as strong as half of the years of the 90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WMO said last September's ozone hole covered an area 2 1/2  
times the size of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	As in previous years, ozone depletion started in July and  
intensified during August, Bojkov said. The hole currently covers 
3.09 million square miles, close to the size of Europe, and will 
probably grow to about twice that, Bojkov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal fluctuations in the intensity of atmospheric winds  
contribute to the hole's size, he added. Last year, the 
whirlpool-like winds that develop annually in the stratosphere 
above the South Pole were very strong. 
</P>
<P>
	One cause of ozone depletion is the chlorine and bromine  
released by manmade chemical compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, 
contained in some aerosols. 
</P>
<P>
	Those chemicals ``have leveled off'' thanks to the Montreal  
Protocol, which commits countries to eliminating production and use 
of ozone-depleting substances, Bojkov said. 
</P>
<P>
	But WMO says it could be 20 years before ozone levels recover  
noticeably, and full recovery can be expected around 2050. 
</P>
<P>
	Bojkov was still concerned that the world was not doing enough  
for its protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall process of ozone recovery will be delayed by at  
least a decade or two if there are not some substantial measures 
for regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases in the coming 
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ground Broken at New FBI Crime Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUANTICO, Va. (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh broke ground  
Wednesday on a $130 million crime laboratory the agency hopes will 
erase concerns about shoddy work at the old lab in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh refused to speak with reporters and was hustled away by  
aides after his brief public appearance. He has yet to speak 
publicly about why it took his agency six years to acknowledge 
using incendiary tear gas canisters in the siege at the Branch 
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important day for us,'' Freeh told about 250  
employees at a ceremony near the construction site. ``It's our job 
and our mission to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state-of-the-art lab is to open in early 2002 and will  
replace one that opened in 1932 in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI 
building, which was made for office workers not scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	``That building didn't envision the kind of work we do today,''  
lab director Donald Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 463,000-square-foot building will be near the FBI training  
academy and on the grounds of a Marine base about 30 miles from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The old lab's 1,100 employees performed 583,000 forensic  
examinations and more than a million fingerprint comparisons last 
year. Much of the work is done for state law enforcement agencies 
that lack the expertise to conduct sophisticated DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have complained about careless handling of evidence at  
the FBI lab. A scathing internal report blasted the lab for flawed 
work and court testimony biased in favor of prosecutors in cases 
such as the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Procedures were changed at the lab last year following an  
outside review by scientists and crime experts, and the lab was 
accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolos Negotiate Over 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Despite a slow and sometimes bumpy  
negotiating process, Eddie DeBartolo's spokesman said an agreement 
is still likely between DeBartolo and his sister over who will 
control the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, DeBartolo reportedly said he would return to the  
49ers if he and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, could not reach 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still haven't reached a final agreement. I'm still  
hopeful this will be resolved soon,'' spokesman Rick Rice told the 
San Francisco Examiner in an interview published Wednesday. 
``Whatever resolution there is, we know it's going to be a 
decoupling of the assets. Eddie and Denise are going to have 
separate businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the July announcement of a deal that would end  
DeBartolo's control of the team was premature. Talks between 
DeBartolo and Denise DeBartolo York are ongoing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo York's spokesman, Sam Singer, also said both sides  
were continuing to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow pace of talks does not mean a final accord is unlikely,  
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportscaster Al Michaels said during ABC's ``Monday Night  
Football'' broadcast that DeBartolo told him he expected to return 
to the team if there was no deal by Feb. 1, the date the National 
Football League lifts its suspension of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In late July, the team owner, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. said an  
agreement had been reached between DeBartolo and his sister, giving 
DeBartolo York control of the club. Rice immediately called news of 
a deal ``premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo was suspended from the NFL earlier this year after he  
pleaded guilty to a federal felony in a Louisiana 
gambling-and-bribery case involving that state's ex-Gov. Edwin 
Edwards.

<HEADLINE> New Judge Chosen for Soliah Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former federal judge has been picked to  
preside over the trial of the Midwestern housewife accused of 
trying to bomb police cars two decades ago when she was a member of 
a radical group. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge James M. Ideman was appointed Tuesday to  
the case after the defense vetoed the first choice, Superior Court 
Judge J.D. Smith, who is a former police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the defendant, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah,  
officially became Sara Jane Olson in court records -- the name she 
adopted as a fugitive and has lived under as a doctor's wife and 
mother of three in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was formerly the People vs. Kathleen Ann Soliah,''  
said Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler, who presided at the 
hearing. ``Now it will be the People vs. Sara Jane Olson, a.k.a. 
Kathleen Ann Soliah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the name she was married under, the name her children  
know her by,'' said her attorney, Susan Jordan. ``It is the name 
she has lived under for 23 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota granted Ms. Olson's petition for a name change this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	A pretrial hearing was set for Sept. 13. Ms. Olson, 52, will be  
entitled to a trial within 60 days after that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson, who is free on $1 million bail, is charged with  
planting bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in 1975. Neither 
bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the effort was retaliation for a shootout  
with police that killed six of her fellow members of the Symbionese 
Liberation Army, the radical leftist group best known for 
kidnapping newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's innocent and that will be her defense,'' Jordan said.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Kubrick Film Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick's last film has left too many  
wide eyes in Singapore's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials here wants to snip part of an orgy scene in ``Eyes  
Wide Shut'' before it releases the dark sexual thriller to the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributor Warner Bros. has appealed the decision by  
Singapore's Films and Publications Department, saying it is under 
contract to show the movie in its entirety -- or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it would be a real waste if people don't get to see it  
here,'' Warner Bros. Singapore spokeswoman Li Sok Heng said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. first submitted the film's European version, which  
contains full frontal nudity. When censors asked for cuts, Warner 
Bros. appealed and submitted an American version, which digitally 
masks the nude scenes. Censors haven't yet responded to the U.S. 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore, a city-state known for its strict rules and  
conservative values, routinely censors or bans films, publications 
and TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason why they can't let this come in,'' said  
Dennis Yin, film critic for Inside Singapore magazine. ``It's 
critically acclaimed. It's not a soft-porn flick.''

<HEADLINE> Want To Pay Down Debt? But How? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The news that more Americans are paying down  
their credit card debt might make other consumers think about doing 
the same. And financial advisers say lowering debt should be the 
first step in a household budget program. 
</P>
<P>
	But anyone thinking about attacking their debts should go about  
it carefully. What may look like a great deal on credit may not be 
so hot after all. And taking out a home equity loan or selling 
stock may not be the answer, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who want to cut their debt ``need to come up with a  
plan, to sit and figure out all their options,'' said Howard 
Dvorkin, president of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services Inc., 
a not-for-profit group based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorkin and other advisers warn consumers against the temptation  
of low introductory interest rates that credit card issuers have 
offered for some time. Issuers market these rates -- some as low as 
2.9 percent -- as a great way to pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people think they'll grab a low rate, transfer balances  
from other accounts and, as the introductory rate expires, transfer 
to another issuer with a similar deal. And switch again after that. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, few people card-hop, according to Dvorkin. ``A lot  
of people have the intention, but I don't think it happens a lot,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason is many customers just go ahead and pay a higher rate  
after the introductory, or teaser, rate expires. Others call up the 
card issuer and try to negotiate a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumers can't count on that happening. Issuers are  
rethinking their strategy, and it may become harder to get lower 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next six months, banks will have pressure to maintain  
significant earnings growth,'' Dvorkin said. ``I question if these 
companies will be as flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late August brought word from Bank One, one of the nation's  
biggest banking companies, that its earnings would fall because of 
weakness in its credit card business. Bank One and other issuers 
are finding that more Americans are paying down their debt, and at 
a faster pace. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is still more than $1.3 trillion in consumer credit  
outstanding, and for the time being, low-interest offers are still 
arriving in the mail. Consumers shouldn't sign up unless they've 
considered how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're not a mathematical whiz, the Internet has resources to  
help you figure out how expensive credit cards are. (Some are 
provided by financial services companies hoping you'll do business 
with them). 
</P>
<P>
	SmartMoney magazine has a calculator in its Web site  
(www.smartmoney.com) to compare deals from different issuers. It 
can show that a rate that looks good for the first six months may 
in the long run not be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's say you have an average balance of $3,000. You get a card  
with a six-month rate of 4.9 percent, which becomes 15 percent when 
the teaser expires. Over the first year, you'll pay $298 in 
interest, and your rate will really work out to about 9.94 percent. 
If the rate becomes 18 percent, your interest is $344 and the rate 
works out to 11.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After that first year, the rate goes to a solid 15 percent or 18  
percent, or whatever the offer's terms stipulate. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer  
Federation of America, ``the first strategy that should be 
considered is reducing one's expenditures'' and diverting that 
money to debt payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Start by looking at what you buy and asking if you really need  
it. Not just a new car or big-screen TV, but smaller items. Do you 
buy a $1 cup of coffee or $3 latte? Buy lunch or brown-bag it? Just 
a few dollars spent every day can turn into $1,000 over the course 
of a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people, including financial advisers, believe a home equity  
loan is a good way to pay off expensive debt. Dvorkin disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're turning unsecured debt into secured debt, which is not  
a very wise choice in case something happens down the road ... they 
can go after your house,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is to sell mutual funds or stocks. But  
selling securities means capital gains taxes, and, if you're 
thinking about taking money out of a retirement account, big 
penalties and a possible move into a higher tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	The best thing to do may be to go get some help. Ask a  
professional adviser or credit counseling service about the best 
way to pay down your debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Counseling services are found in the Yellow Pages and on the  
Internet. Even if there isn't one located right near you, many 
offer their services nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Downside of AIDS Battle Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite the good news about wonder drugs that  
have blunted the deadly effects of AIDS, much about the disease 
hasn't changed -- namely that 40,000 Americans are infected each 
year, many in their teens and early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	As 2,000 researchers, physicians and activists concluded the  
four-day National HIV Prevention Conference on Wednesday, they left 
with renewed warnings that pills alone won't stop the disease any 
time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly want to say to people, `Wake up!' Prevention is  
just as important in 1999 as it was in 1981,'' said Dr. Ronald 
Valdiserri, deputy director of the center for HIV prevention at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Well-worn reminders about abstinence and condom use are having a  
hard time competing with news of the drug cocktails that can reduce 
the amount of virus in the blood to undetectable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the advances in drug treatments have left some people  
with a false sense of security that the disease is all but cured. 
Scientists want to make people more aware of the advances, but they 
also need to be careful not to go too far, Valdiserri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're walking a tightrope here,'' he said. ``Medical care  
providers ... don't want people to be so frightened out of their 
wits that they may be infected with HIV that they don't get 
diagnosed for five or 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, he said, they want to be concerned with ``not  
putting out a message that's so strong people think, `Gee, you 
know, maybe it's not such a big deal anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years of declining AIDS deaths means more Americans than  
ever are living with HIV. The CDC estimates the total number is as 
high as 900,000. While infected people are living longer, it also 
means there are more people capable of spreading the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	And new infections are holding steady at a rate of roughly  
40,000 a year, a pace that hasn't slowed this decade. About half of 
new infections are believed to be among Americans under 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies released during the conference also showed that risky  
sexual behaviors are continuing among young Americans. A survey of 
3,492 gay men aged 15 to 22 found that 7 percent were infected with 
HIV and 41 percent had anal sex without using a condom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about every hour of every day a young person  
being infected somewhere in the United States,'' said Dr. Donna 
Futterman, director of the adolescent AIDS program at Montefiore 
Medical Center in New York. ``Given that we know how to prevent 
HIV, there's no reason for the epidemic to be continuing at this 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some activists blame the president and Congress, who have failed  
to increase funding for HIV prevention programs as they have for 
research and treatment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fisher of the activist group AIDS Action said its time  
for another awareness campaign to match the mass mailings of AIDS 
information launched by then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop under 
President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many newly sexually active young people were too young to read  
when that came out'' in the 1980s, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now American youth are seeing slick ads for AIDS drugs that show  
people engaged in rock climbing and other athletic activities. The 
messages that say drugs help people with HIV to lead active lives 
are overpowering the warnings that AIDS still kills, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want positive messages about people living with HIV,'' he  
said. ``But we also need to send the message that getting HIV is 
not a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists and researchers say there's a need to deliver the same

<HEADLINE> Graduate Produces Work on a CD-ROM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The art world is going high tech. The first  
thing a visitor sees at an exhibit of art students' productions 
opening today at the Corcoran Gallery of Art is a computer monitor 
with a mouse and two sets of earphones. 
</P>
<P>
	To appreciate that work, the visitor must sit at the monitor,  
don the earphones and click on an icon with the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	This piece is a CD-ROM called ``1948: Memory Fragments -- A  
Narrative in Three Voices.'' The artist is David A. Valentine, who 
received his degree in 1997 from the Corcoran College of Art and 
Design, one of the nation's leading art schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``His major was fine arts,'' said Linda DeF. Williams, the  
school's director of alumni affairs, ``but as you can see, he knows 
about technology too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine is a former animation cinematographer who ran his own  
computer animation consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	His piece is part of an exhibit of alumni work held every two  
years at the gallery, the capital's first art museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The school cultivates an older tradition, too. An oil painting --  
Fred Folsom's ``Edna Flying,'' a nude gliding over a landscape -- is 
back in a corner of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the show does little to recall the days when art  
students spent more of their time on watercolors or making drawings 
of antique statues. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students seem to be trying to outdo one another in  
cultivating exotic ways of expressing themselves. Some however, 
reject the high-tech trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Van Meter makes cyanotypes, created by laying an object  
directly on a sensitized photographic plate. Some early 
photographers practiced a similar technique more than 150 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technical process for creating these photograms is simple,  
permanent and non-toxic,'' the artist explained in a statement. 
``Machinery of any kind is unnecessary. My personal response rebels 
wildly against the barrage of computer technology with its 
unapologetic deluge of poor quality images.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She calls one of her small prints, which uses doll clothing,  
``Barbie High Heels: Float Like Boats on Top of the Sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Gellner Levin used hydrocal, which looks like white  
plaster, to mold the life-size figures of eight frolicking babies, 
called ``Fertility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``'Fertility' looks at the issue of reproductive technology and  
multiple births,'' she said in a statement. ``We Americans are 
technically sophisticated beyond our human capacity to care for and 
protect those children we are now able to produce en masse.''

<HEADLINE> Former Officers Acquitted in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Two former police officers were  
acquitted today of charges they killed a woman who once made news 
when she claimed her baby had been stolen from her womb. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated for about six hours Tuesday and today before  
acquitting Roberto Briseno and Randall Ledbetter on capital murder 
and lesser murder charges in the 1994 slaying of Laura Lugo. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ledbetter paid Briseno to kill Ms. Lugo, his  
mistress, because he believed she was making threatening phone 
calls to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls actually were being made by Ledbetter's other  
mistress, Janet Ramirez, the third person accused of Ms. Lugo's 
murder. Ms. Ramirez pleaded guilty to murder and testified against 
the men in exchange for a 20-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ramirez claimed Ledbetter, a U.S. Border Patrol agent at the  
time of his arrest, gave Briseno bullets and a partial payment of 
$1,000 to kill Ms. Lugo. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she and Briseno lured the victim to a remote area under  
the pretense of a meeting with Ledbetter, and Briseno shot Ms. Lugo 
in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lugo disappeared in December 1994, 11 weeks after winning a  
custody battle for her 2-year-old son, whom she said was taken by 
two women who lured her to a Mexican clinic, drugged her and had a 
doctor perform a Caesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA tests proved Ms. Lugo was the boy's mother. The two women  
said she had agreed to give her child up for adoption, but changed 
her mind and fabricated the baby-snatching story to win the boy 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lugo's bullet-riddled and burned remains were found six  
months after her disappearance, which was unrelated to the custody 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nat Perez, the defense attorney for Briseno, said Ms. Ramirez  
lacked credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, I think it was a situation of no evidence. The  
only evidence was Janet and her evidence wasn't credible,'' Perez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledbetter's attorney, Peter Hilman, did not return a call from  
The Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Bill Hagen, who lacked much direct physical evidence  
linking Briseno and Ledbetter to the crime scene, said he knew his 
case depended on jurors believing Ms. Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question she has serious credibility problems,'' he  
said, but insisted her testimony had been corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line was all the little pieces that we found ...  
everything supported what she said,'' Hagen said.

<HEADLINE> Little Leaguers Get Little Fanfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- One elderly woman clapped when the team emerged  
from customs at Narita Airport. And that was only after a TV crew 
had pointed out the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Little League world champions returned home Tuesday,  
wearing their World Series baseball caps and unfazed by the little 
fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great that we could come this far,'' said 12-year-old  
star pitcher Kazuki Sumiyama, who struck out nine in Saturday's 
championship game. ``From the very start we played to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tsutomu Kameyama, a former pro baseball player in Japan,  
was thankful to be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy we made it home in one piece, and can finally get  
some Japanese food,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys from Hirakata, in western Japan, are the fourth  
Japanese team to win the Little League World Series, following 
Chofu Little League of Tokyo (1976), Wakayama Little League (1968) 
and West Tokyo Little League (1967). 
</P>
<P>
	The latest winners beat Phenix City, Ala., 5-0 in the  
championship game in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 7,000 teams from around the world played in the  
tournament. More than 6,500 of them were eliminated in the first 
three weeks of play, which began in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirakata advanced to the championship final with a 12-2 victory  
over Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A throng of 5,000 greeted the Phenix City players when they came  
home Monday night. The world's No. 1 team enjoyed no such welcome, 
but no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach was just happy to escape strict American tobacco  
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can smoke freely now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, there's no ticker tape parades planned for the team's  
return to Osaka, western Japan's commercial center, and Mayor 
Takafumi Isomura has yet to fit a reception for the boys into his 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	They might not have time to meet him anyway. They're due in  
school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the excitement of the trip, even meeting the New York  
Yankees, one impression lingered for captain Takashi Sakurai, who 
at 4-foot-7 was the shortest player in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's so big,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 69 Dead in Argentine Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A Boeing 737 jetliner hurtled  
through an airline fence and crashed in flames during takeoff, 
killing dozens of people aboard after hopscotching a busy boulevard 
near this downtown airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The LAPA airlines plane finally stopped next to a golf course  
along the Rio de la Plata river Tuesday evening after striking 
several cars on the road and bursting into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw people on fire,'' said one survivor, Fabian Alejandro  
Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 69 of the 103 people aboard Flight 3142 were killed,  
local news agency Noticias Argentinas quoted officials as saying. 
City Health Minister Hector Lombardo said 59 bodies were recovered 
before noon today amid a continuing search of the debris. 
</P>
<P>
	LAPA, or Lineas Aereas Privadas Argentinas, said 95 passengers  
and five crew were aboard, but the Buenos Aires-based airline gave 
no casualty figures. LAPA is a major domestic carrier with only a 
few international routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency crews scoured the wreckage today, taking badly burned  
bodies to a local morgue. Reports said investigators were also 
trying to determine if cars had been crushed or dragged by the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials reported receiving 34 people, many with  
burns. At least one of the injured -- a coast guard officer whose 
leg was severed -- was not a passenger, the news agency Diarios y 
Noticias reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a day of mourning for all of Argentina,'' said  
Interior Minister Carlos Corach. 
</P>
<P>
	LAPA spokesman Ricardo Wilson said the plane took off from Jorge  
Newberry airport, Argentina's second-largest, at 8:55 p.m. and lost 
contact with the tower a minute into its scheduled flight to 
Cordoba, 475 miles northwest of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither he nor investigators released a possible cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Another LAPA official, Guillermo Capotti, said today that  
results of the investigation would take time and he would not 
speculate on local media reports focusing on a problem in one of 
the plane's turbines. 
</P>
<P>
	It only took seconds for some aboard to realize something was  
going wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunez said he felt the plane losing control, lifting just feet  
into the air before settling back down. The engines went silent and 
the plane swooped to earth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to save myself through the rear of the plane,''  
Nunez told Noticias Argentinas. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane sheered through a fence and clipped a billboard  
alongside the highway. La Nacion newspaper reported that three 
bodies were found in the wreckage of a car near the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Desposito, a coast guard official patrolling the river's  
Costanera Avenue, described a ``ball of fire.'' Desposito, who was 
uninjured, pulled his car over and ran to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled four people out. Two of them were dead,'' Desposito  
said. ``I saw many people who were badly burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bystander in his 30s, who wouldn't give his name, said he  
saw a young man and a woman escape by jumping from the plane. 
``They were shouting frantically, 'We're safe! We're safe,''' said 
the man, interviewed by The Associated Press at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Many still anxiously waited today to learn what happened to  
relatives aboard the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside one hospital, Rosa Lombardo wept as she waited for word  
on the whereabouts of her husband. ``I always worry about him when 
he flies. I can only hope,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst known aviation disaster at the Buenos Aires  
downtown airport. With the airport closed, authorities said flights 
would operate instead out of the Ezeiza International Airport west 
of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's last major air disaster killed 74 people when an  
Argentine DC-9 operated by Austral airlines crashed Oct. 10, 1997. 
That plane crashed near Nuevo Berlin, close to the western border 
of Uruguay, while en route to Buenos Aires from the northeast 
Argentine city of Posadas.

<HEADLINE> GOP Head Seeks Buchanan Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson,  
hoping to avoid a high-profile defection, has requested to meet 
privately with Pat Buchanan before the GOP presidential candidate 
decides whether to bolt to the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has agreed to the session, which is being scheduled for  
later this month, his top strategist and sister, Bay Buchanan said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Nicholson has personally contacted me and asked to set up  
a meeting with Pat, which we're attempting to do,'' Bay Buchanan 
said in a telephone interview. Nicholson did not say why he wanted 
to talk to Buchanan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had  
said Nicholson wants to personally urge Buchanan to remain 
Republican. However, Nicholson's aides said they didn't know 
anything about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talks with the presidential candidates all the time,'' said  
spokesman Mike Collins. The chairman was on vacation and 
unavailable, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a political commentator and former Nixon White House  
aide, is a harsh critic of the GOP establishment, which he says has 
forsaken its conservative roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he lags in polls and would not be assured the Reform  
Party nomination, Buchanan could siphon social conservative votes 
from the eventual Republican nominee if he ran as a third-party 
candidate. He won the New Hampshire primary in 1996 and gave 
President Bush a scare in the 1992 primaries with his potent blend 
of social conservatism and populist, anti-trade rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Party officials privately question whether Buchanan's  
departure would have a major impact. Some argue that his trade 
views would attract a fair share of hard-hat Democrats hurt by the 
Clinton administration's free-trade policies. Others say his 
showing so far in the 2000 campaign proves that Buchanan has lost 
his political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Nicholson is smart to reach out and try to keep  
all Republican moving in the same direction,'' said GOP strategist 
Ed Gillespie. ``You don't want to have someone who's been a 
Republican staffer, a Republican candidate and who's spoken at 
Republican conventions in past cycles leave the party in anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But the fact is Buchanan has not had the run he did the first  
two times,'' Gillespie said. ``I don't think you'd see droves of 
Republicans turning in their registration cards saying, `Cancel me. 
I'm going Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson placed the call Tuesday, the same day that officials  
close to Buchanan revealed that he had intensified discussions 
about bolting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat will listen to what he has to say and will take it under  
consideration,'' said Bay Buchanan, who confirmed Nicholson's 
request after GOP officials circulated word of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Buchanan adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the candidate is proceeding as if he will bolt the party -- even 
though a final decision has not been made. The only thing that 
would stop him, the adviser said, ``is if the wall suddenly went 
up'' and Buchanan decided at the last minute he couldn't abandon 
the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the signs:  
</P>
<P>
	--Bay Buchanan is calling fund-raisers and state chairman to  
gauge their reaction to a possible Reform Party race. 
</P>
<P>
	--The campaign's Internet site had been touting news stories  
about a Reform Party bid, a practice Bay Buchanan said she ended. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In a staff meeting this week, advisers discussed how they  
would organize an announcement rally if he bolted. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both Buchanans are also studying the arcane Reform Party  
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision is expected to be announced in October, though  
Buchanan will tantalize the party throughout a September publicity 
tour to promote his upcoming book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire: 
Reclaiming America's Destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by his publisher, a headline reads,  
``Why would Pat Buchanan break ranks with the Republican Party?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he does leave, Buchanan would not be assured of the  
presidential nomination in the fractious Reform Party. Backers of 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura have wrested the party leadership from 
associates of party founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot allies are urging Buchanan to run, Ventura has been  
cool to the idea. Perot backers have quietly suggested to Buchanan 
that the Texas millionaire would not stand in his way if he sought 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee will have access to more than $12  
million in federal funding, millions more than Buchanan is expected 
to raise as a GOP candidate. His GOP campaign is in debt, 
marginalized by a poor showing at the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll.

<HEADLINE>  Violence Follows East Timor Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Rampaging anti-independence militiamen  
shot and then hacked to death a man outside the U.N. compound in 
East Timor's capital today in the most brazen outburst of violence 
since the territory's historic independence referendum this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing came as the United Nations began counting ballots  
from the referendum, which is expected to favor the territory's 
independence from Indonesia. Indonesia's forces invaded East Timor 
in 1975, triggering years of guerrilla warfare and human rights 
abuses in the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence since Monday's vote has raised fears that the territory  
could slide back into lawlessness as pro-Indonesia militias -- 
sensing defeat -- try frantically to take control of whatever they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of militiamen armed with homemade guns, military rifles  
and machetes clashed with rock-throwing separatists outside the 
headquarters of the U.N. team that oversaw the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The militia were firing shots all around. The pro-independence  
people panicked and lots of them ran to the shelter of the U.N. 
compound,'' Associated Press Television News cameraman Dean Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen, who are backed by elements of the Indonesian  
military, also set fire to a nearby house and a roadside shack, and 
black smoke hovered above. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. compound did not appear to be the target of the attack,  
and officials said no one entered. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence happened under the gaze of the unarmed U.N. police  
officers who sealed off the compound. Several people were injured, 
initial reports said. It was unclear if U.N. personnel were among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people -- including U.N. officials and journalists --  
took shelter in an auditorium in the compound, a U.N. officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers stationed at a nearby barracks were vastly  
outnumbered and did not intervene when the melee erupted. 
Indonesian riot police dispatched to the scene about an hour after 
the violence began fired volleys of warning shots and dispersed the 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mohammad Muis, Indonesia's military commander in East  
Timor, said his forces were on full alert. Police in Jakarta said 
360 officers from an elite unit would be flown in on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portugal, a top government official expressed alarm today  
about the mounting violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We exhort Indonesia to give very clear instructions to its  
police, to its security forces, to control once and for all the 
situation, to stop allowing the militias to act with impunity,'' 
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said in Lisbon. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Violence Follows East Timor Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Rampaging anti-independence militiamen  
shot and then hacked to death a man outside the U.N. compound in 
East Timor's capital today in the most brazen outburst of violence 
since the territory's historic independence referendum this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing came as the United Nations began counting ballots  
from the referendum, which is expected to favor the territory's 
independence from Indonesia. Indonesia's forces invaded East Timor 
in 1975, triggering years of guerrilla warfare and human rights 
abuses in the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence since Monday's vote has raised fears that the territory  
could slide back into lawlessness as pro-Indonesia militias -- 
sensing defeat -- try frantically to take control of whatever they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of militiamen armed with homemade guns, military rifles  
and machetes clashed with rock-throwing separatists outside the 
headquarters of the U.N. team that oversaw the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The militia were firing shots all around. The pro-independence  
people panicked and lots of them ran to the shelter of the U.N. 
compound,'' Associated Press Television News cameraman Dean Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen, who are backed by elements of the Indonesian  
military, also set fire to a nearby house and a roadside shack, and 
black smoke hovered above. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. compound did not appear to be the target of the attack,  
and officials said no one entered. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence happened under the gaze of the unarmed U.N. police  
officers who sealed off the compound. Several people were injured, 
initial reports said. It was unclear if U.N. personnel were among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people -- including U.N. officials and journalists --  
took shelter in an auditorium in the compound, a U.N. officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers stationed at a nearby barracks were vastly  
outnumbered and did not intervene when the melee erupted. 
Indonesian riot police dispatched to the scene about an hour after 
the violence began fired volleys of warning shots and dispersed the 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mohammad Muis, Indonesia's military commander in East  
Timor, said his forces were on full alert. Police in Jakarta said 
360 officers from an elite unit would be flown in on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portugal, a top government official expressed alarm today  
about the mounting violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We exhort Indonesia to give very clear instructions to its  
police, to its security forces, to control once and for all the 
situation, to stop allowing the militias to act with impunity,'' 
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian police ``constantly arrive at trouble spots one or  
two hours late,'' Gama said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Safety Fined for Hitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers safety Rodney Harrison was  
fined $15,000 by the NFL on Wednesday for hitting St. Louis Rams 
receiver Isaac Bruce with his helmet twice on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Harrison was not fined for the hit on which Rams  
quarterback Trent Green suffered a season-ending knee injury in the 
exhibition game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	That play was carefully reviewed, an NFL spokeswoman said, and  
officials determined there was no violation of rules because 
Harrison was coming off a block and therefore did not have an 
unrestricted path to the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison, who has been fined by the league in the past, said the  
fine wouldn't change the way he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it did I might as well throw my uniform in and go home,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Harrison was fined $10,000 for a hit on Kansas City's  
Andre Rison and also for taunting the receiver. He also was fined 
$10,000 for a hit on San Francisco tight end Brent Jones, but 
appealed and had it rescinded.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Gains 55.09 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today, reviving after four  
straight declines in the Dow Jones industrials sent some investors 
on a search for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 55.09  
at 10,884.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 4.70 at 1,325.11, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 11.78 at 2,751.13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow began the day nearly 500 points below its record close  
of 11,326.04 reached just last Wednesday. While traders expected 
the big decline to lure some buyers, few market analysts expect a 
major rally any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has likely set the table for a rocky month of  
September,'' said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., citing a lack of market leadership and the 
persistent worries about higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some strength today came from technology issues. Intel  
rose 2 5/16 to 84 3/8 after unveiling a new microprocessor chip 
intended for use in devices that route information across the 
Internet. Analysts said the development raised expectations that 
the boom of the Internet will feed continued growth at computer 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, IBM was up 3 at 127 9/16. IBM and Cisco said  
Tuesday they will jointly provide networking equipment and services 
to companies looking to do business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper also contributed to the Dow's strength,  
gaining 1 11/16 to 48 3/4 after PaineWebber raised its rating on the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus Hotel Corp. rose 2 7/8 to 31 15/16 amid reports that Hilton  
Hotels is negotiating a deal to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board today provided the latest sign that the  
U.S. economy continues to grow at a brisk pace. The research 
group's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a key barometer of 
future economic activity, rose 0.3 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Conference Board's report was counterbalanced by a  
Commerce Department report that showed home building and other 
construction spending was surprisingly weak in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that robust economic growth will encourage the Federal  
Reserve to raise interest rates for a third time this year have 
shadowed the market in the past few sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose sharply after the Fed's second rate increase as  
investors temporarily raised their hopes that the central bank may 
leave rates untouched for the rest of the year. But as fear 
returned to Wall Street, prices turned lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 556.2 million shares, 
slightly behind Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 2.53 at 430.36.

<HEADLINE> Nelson in Minn. To Promote Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- What do country singer Willie Nelson and  
Gov. Jesse Ventura have in common? A love of music, it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two differ on many policy issues, they have enough  
in common to make Minnesota's chances ``very good'' to host a Farm 
Aid concert in 2000, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great idea,'' Nelson said after a hour-long  
meeting Tuesday with Ventura and his wife, Terry. ``Minnesota is an 
agricultural state. The governor is in on it and would help us 
promote it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said Minnesota would love to host the concert if chosen,  
but added that it was too early to speculate where in the state it 
might be held. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer said a final decision won't be made on a site until  
after this year's concert -- scheduled for Sept. 12 in Bristol, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson and fellow musicians John Mellencamp and Neil Young  
founded Farm Aid in 1985 to bring attention to the plight of 
farmers. Subsequent concerts have included Aerosmith, Dave Matthews 
Band and Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he left, Nelson was asked what he and Ventura had  
discussed. ``We talked about music -- we talked Led Zeppelin,'' 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reporter said the governor seemed more of a rocker than a  
country fan. ``So am I, I guess,'' Nelson said and laughed as he 
walked away.

<HEADLINE> MIT Student Dies From Laughing Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An MIT junior found dead in his dorm  
room apparently died while trying to get high by inhaling laughing 
gas from a plastic bag, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Richard Guy, a 22-year-old from Mission Viejo,  
Calif., was found early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner said the physics major died of asphyxiation  
as a result of nitrous oxide intoxication. Nitrous oxide displaces 
oxygen in the blood, and when used as a recreational drug it can 
cause dizziness, light-headedness and euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were trying to determine where Guy obtained the nitrous  
oxide, which is not a controlled substance and is often used as a 
painkiller by dentists. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy was alone at the time of his death, and school officials  
believe he was inhaling the gas to get high, said Ken Campbell, a 
spokesman for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're treating it like an accident and that's because we have  
no evidence of a suicide,'' he said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes aren't scheduled to begin at MIT until Sept. 7, but  
freshmen and some upperclassmen had already moved into their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, 18-year-old freshman Scott Krueger died three  
days after he was found in an alcohol-induced coma on a fraternity 
floor. No one was prosecuted, but in July the school revoked the 
diploma of a man who bought alcohol consumed by Krueger and other 
pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a shame,'' said Chris Johnson, 19, an MIT sophomore  
from Columbia, Tenn. ``Some of the smartest kids in the world are 
here. Maybe they think they're too smart to suffer the 
consequences.''

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Tour Central New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- There wasn't much the rangers at the  
Women's Rights National Historical Park could tell their prominent 
guest that he didn't already know. ``When you're looking for 
work,'' one said, ``you can give us a call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I can work for cheap,'' President Clinton said with a  
smile. ``I've got a good pension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who can count on an annual $151,800 presidential  
pension when he leaves the White House in 2001, and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton took a tour Wednesday of historic sites in 
central New York, including a house where abolitionist Harriet 
Tubman lived. 
</P>
<P>
	They also visited the birthplace of the women's rights movement  
-- the Wesleyan Chapel -- where in 1848 a group of women and male 
supporters issued the Declaration of Sentiments, a tract based on 
the Declaration of Independence calling for equal rights for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons walked along a wall that had the declaration  
chiseled into its face and was covered by a falling sheen of water, 
discussing fine points of the women's rights movement with rangers 
Maryellen Snyder and Leroy Renninger. 
</P>
<P>
	Having recently read a biography of abolitionist William Lloyd  
Garrison, an early supporter of women's rights, Clinton was 
familiar with much of the history behind the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope our coming here will raise the visibility so more  
Americans will come,'' Clinton told reporters traveling with him. 
``There are things here that every American should know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In full vacation mode, the president declined to answer  
questions about a new investigation of the Branch Davidians 
incident in Waco, Texas, or the attack on the U.N. compound in 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were enjoying sunny skies, the shimmering blue  
Skaneateles Lake by the borrowed estate where they were staying in 
the town of the same name, and excited crowds wherever they went. 
Daughter Chelsea stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``It reminds me  
so much of where I spent my childhood because I spent every summer 
at the little lake in Northeast Pennsylvania. The nights were cool, 
and the mornings were cool.... It's so nostalgic, I called my 
mother last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons began the day with a stop at a specialty foods shop  
in downtown Skaneateles that featured chocolates made by Albert 
Kumin, who was White House pastry chef for President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of some 70 people gathered outside and the Clintons  
lingered to shake hands and sign autographs. The president obliged 
a woman on the other side of the police tape by placing a letter in 
the mailbox for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off on an excursion,'' the president told the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd scene and visits to historical sites may not seem very  
relaxing for a vacationing couple. But they did seem like good 
politics. Mrs. Clinton is building up for a campaign for Senate 
from New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the historic sites were on the America's Treasures tour  
Mrs. Clinton took last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent more than one-half hour in the home of  
William H. Seward, secretary of state under presidents Lincoln and 
Johnson and the prime mover behind the purchase of Alaska, which 
was called ``Seward's Folly'' at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading to scenic Seneca Falls, the Clintons stopped at  
the site of a home Tubman moved to after the Civil War. Tubman 
helped conduct 300 slaves to freedom along the underground railroad 
and spied for the North. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also visited the McClintock House, where the  
Declaration of Sentiments was drafted, in nearby Waterloo.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas' Hall Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Arkansas defensive end Carlos Hall  
pleaded guilty today to charges in two counties, including an 
accusation that he stole checks from the university. He drew 
probation on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall pleaded guilty in Washington County to theft of property  
after being accused of stealing $220 worth of checks made out to 
the University of Arkansas. In Pope County, he pleaded guilty to 
charges related to a July 10 traffic accident in which a woman was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearing up his legal problems could lead to his being  
reinstated to the Razorbacks' football team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are relieved it has been settled,'' coach Houston Nutt said  
in a statement made to the Jacksonville Patriot newspaper . 
``Carlos has been under in-house discipline for over a month. He's 
been doing everything he can to do it the right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision on Hall's returning to the team would be made  
later, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who initially was accused with stealing three checks from  
a university mailroom and forging them, was ordered to make $220 in 
restitution and perform 200 hours of community service in the 
Fayetteville case. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was ordered to pay $150 in court costs.  
</P>
<P>
	Hall was suspended from the Razorbacks after being charged this  
summer. He faced a Sept. 20 hearing in Pope County, but a clerk 
there said Hall's case had been settled today. Hall was sentenced 
to probation, which Hall lawyer Bob White said would be 
administered out of Washington County, where the university is 
based. 
</P>
<P>
	White said Hall would be sentenced to 3 1/2 years' probation in the  
Pope County case, 168 hours of community service and ordered to pay 
$1,600 in fines and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington County Circuit Court said prosecutors today  
presented only a theft of property charge -- a misdemeanor -- before 
Judge William Storey. Hall initially had been accused of forgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges, made July 20, said Hall stole three checks totaling  
$220 from a university mailroom, then endorsed and cashed them. The 
checks had been made out to the university. 
</P>
<P>
	At Russellville, he was accused of leaving the scene of an  
accident in which a person was injured and with driving under the 
influence of alcohol. The accident on Interstate 40 near 
Russellville and Hall was charged in Conway, 40 miles away, after 
stopping to fix a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds, is a third-year sophomore. Last  
year, he had 45 tackles, 23 by himself and 11 for losses.

federal money Wednesday for California, Pennsylvania and North

	``There is not a specific dollar amount. It will depend on what  
they need,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Clinton ordered federal aid to help with recovery  
efforts in Butte, Shasta, Tehama and Tuolumne counties, all struck 
by wildfires this month. Damage surveys are continuing and other 
areas could qualify for federal aid later on. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, federal money will help make repairs after  
Hurricane Dennis, which struck this week. Clinton authorized the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster 
relief efforts in a nine-county area on or near the state's 
Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, Clinton will send federal money to help local  
and state flood cleanup from storms Aug. 20 and Aug. 21. The money 
for residents of McKean County could include disaster housing, 
grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. 
</P>
<P>
	As in California, other Pennsylvania areas could qualify for  
federal help in the future.

<HEADLINE>  Survivors Flee Turkey's Quake Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- Mobbing bus stations and jamming roads,  
panicked residents fled the center of Turkey's earthquake zone 
after two strong jolts rocked buildings weakened by a quake earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person was killed. Many of the 166 injured hurt  
themselves jumping from balconies and windows when Tuesday's 
5.2-magnitude tremor hit, followed by a 4.6-magnitude aftershock 20 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrified customers at a bank in Izmit banged on windows they  
could not open. Children at a kindergarten set up in a tent city 
for quake victims shrieked, ``It's moving! A new earthquake!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new tremor, like the 7.4-magnitude Aug. 17 earthquake, was  
centered in Izmit, a city of 300,000 on the Sea of Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling debris struck a 30-year-old man in Izmit, adding to a  
two-week death toll that has topped 14,300. Thousands more are 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A full 16 days after the devastating 7.4-magnitude quake,  
rescuers and the Turkish public were caught in the drama of yet 
another desperately hoped-for rescue today, when residents of the 
city of Golcuk, southeast of Istanbul, reported hearing people 
under rubble from the Aug. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers and soldiers with shovels ran up to the site,  
despite the extremely remote chance of finding anyone alive. Search 
dogs signaled there was someone beneath the rubble; at early 
afternoon doctors and nurses rushed to the scene with a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's hoping for a miracle,'' Channel D television  
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Would-be rescuers kept digging into the night, hauling away the  
roof and then floor after floor. A new tremor late in the day 
frightened the search dogs, who ran from the rubble and had to be 
comforted by their trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's jolts caught some as they re-entered damaged homes.  
Seismologists said the tremors were aftershocks that would persist 
for months, and they urged people to give up on salvaging 
belongings from wrecked homes. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tuesday's tremors, many in Izmit and adjoining towns in  
the 200-mile-long quake zone were more than ready to give up -- and 
get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just packed our bags and hit the road,'' said Cem Ergezer,  
filling up his gas tank to take his parents to the Aegean Coast. 
``That last quake frightened us very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Izmit, a bus company brought in extra buses to cope with the  
terrified exodus. Employees sold tickets outside their damaged 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tempted to leave too. But if I leave, there is no one to  
sell these people bus tickets. So I must stay,'' said one worker, 
Ufuk Kardes. 
</P>
<P>
	After bitter criticism of the initial rescue effort as slow and  
haphazard, the government promised Tuesday to step up civil defense 
training and form rescue teams to deal with natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	It also announced upcoming decrees to make it easier to adopt  
children orphaned by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowing to a national outcry, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel  
vetoed a bill today that would free almost half the country's 
69,000 convicts. Parliament passed the controversial bill Saturday 
as the country was reeling from the Aug. 17 earthquake, then 
adjourned for summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers initially meant the amnesty as an abrupt solution to  
crowding in Turkey's prisons, where riots, hunger strikes and 
hostage-takings are common. But it outraged many in the public, who 
perceived it would free thousands of murderers, corrupt officials 
and armed gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities dispatched 29 judges and prosecutors to the quake  
zone to compile evidence against contractors whose allegedly shoddy 
construction contributed to the high death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Duzce, prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 33  
people held responsible for the collapse of several buildings where 
1,117 people died and hundreds were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates that up to 600,000 people were left  
homeless by the earthquake, with most living in tents and shelters 
scattered throughout the quake zone.

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Tour Central New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- There wasn't much the rangers at the  
Women's Rights National Historical Park could tell their prominent 
guest that he didn't already know. ``When you're looking for 
work,'' one said, ``you can give us a call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I can work for cheap,'' President Clinton said with a  
smile. ``I've got a good pension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who can count on an annual $151,800 presidential  
pension when he leaves the White House in 2001, and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton took a tour Wednesday of historic sites in 
central New York, including a house where abolitionist Harriet 
Tubman lived. 
</P>
<P>
	They also visited the birthplace of the women's rights movement  
-- the Wesleyan Chapel -- where in 1848 a group of women and male 
supporters issued the Declaration of Sentiments, a tract based on 
the Declaration of Independence calling for equal rights for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons walked along a wall that had the declaration  
chiseled into its face and was covered by a falling sheen of water, 
discussing fine points of the women's rights movement with rangers 
Maryellen Snyder and Leroy Renninger. 
</P>
<P>
	Having recently read a biography of abolitionist William Lloyd  
Garrison, an early supporter of women's rights, Clinton was 
familiar with much of the history behind the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope our coming here will raise the visibility so more  
Americans will come,'' Clinton told reporters traveling with him. 
``There are things here that every American should know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In full vacation mode, the president declined to answer  
questions about a new investigation of the Branch Davidians 
incident in Waco, Texas, or the attack on the U.N. compound in 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were enjoying sunny skies, the shimmering blue  
Skaneateles Lake by the borrowed estate where they were staying in 
the town of the same name, and excited crowds wherever they went. 
Daughter Chelsea stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``It reminds me  
so much of where I spent my childhood because I spent every summer 
at the little lake in Northeast Pennsylvania. The nights were cool, 
and the mornings were cool.... It's so nostalgic, I called my 
mother last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons began the day with a stop at a specialty foods shop  
in downtown Skaneateles that featured chocolates made by Albert 
Kumin, who was White House pastry chef for President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of some 70 people gathered outside and the Clintons  
lingered to shake hands and sign autographs. The president obliged 
a woman on the other side of the police tape by placing a letter in 
the mailbox for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off on an excursion,'' the president told the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd scene and visits to historical sites may not seem very  
relaxing for a vacationing couple. But they did seem like good 
politics. Mrs. Clinton is building up for a campaign for Senate 
from New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the historic sites were on the America's Treasures tour  
Mrs. Clinton took last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent more than one-half hour in the home of  
William H. Seward, secretary of state under presidents Lincoln and 
Johnson and the prime mover behind the purchase of Alaska, which 
was called ``Seward's Folly'' at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading to scenic Seneca Falls, the Clintons stopped at  
the site of a home Tubman moved to after the Civil War. Tubman 
helped conduct 300 slaves to freedom along the underground railroad 
and spied for the North. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also visited the McClintock House, where the  
Declaration of Sentiments was drafted, in nearby Waterloo.

<HEADLINE> Star 2-Year-Old Out of Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- More Than Ready, unbeaten in five  
starts and generally considered the leading 2-year-old colt in 
training, will not start in the $200,000 Hopeful on Saturday at 
Saratoga because of a slight fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing because the Hopeful was the race we were  
pointing for and we had thirty days to gear up for it,'' trainer 
Todd Pletcher said of the colt, who in his fifth start and fourth 
stakes won the Sanford by 9 3/4 lengths July 29 at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing it very conservatively,'' Pletcher added  
Wednesday. ``With a horse of this magnitude, I think that's the way 
to play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park  
still his ultimate goal, More Than Ready is now expected to start 
in the Futurity on Sept. 19 and the Champagne on Oct. 9, both at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that ``the colt was a little quiet'' after Sunday's  
five-furlong workout over Saratoga's training track, Pletcher had 
him scoped. The procedure revealed the presence of a small amount 
of mucous. The colt's temperature was also 101.3, nearly a degree 
higher than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it was a little higher concerned us,'' Pletcher  
said, ``so we pulled some blood on him and his white count came 
back slightly elevated, indicative that he was possibly coming down 
with a virus or bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After having been walked an extra day, another blood test was  
taken. The second test results showed the white count improved but 
still not ideal, and the decision not to run him the Hopeful 
followed.

<HEADLINE> Intel Introduces New Internet Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is making a big move into the  
fast-growing Internet networking business, signaling trouble for 
some smaller rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel unveiled a new chip on Wednesday to power the equipment  
that routes information across the Internet. The move is an 
ambitious bid by the world's largest maker of microprocessors to 
expand beyond its core business of making chips for personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's new ``network processor'' is intended to replace more  
expensive chips as the brains of switches and routers that shepherd 
data through corporate networks and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The move prompted Wall Street investors to reconsider some  
smaller companies that compete in the space. Shares of network 
chips supplier MMC Networks Inc. dropped 13 percent, down $4.12 1/2 at 
$26.75, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. MMC also was hit by 
a decision Tuesday by IBM, a major customer, to stop selling 
networking equipment and focus on selling chips and other parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, meanwhile, rose 2 percent Wednesday, up $1.25 at $83.43 3/4.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM, for its part, is aggressively defending its sales of  
networking chips. The company plans to announce Thursday a new 
family of networking chips that it will start selling to makers of 
communications equipment, including Nortel Networks Corp. and 
Alcatel, of France. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also formed a new research and development unit devoted to  
improving its chips. And the company is spending $100 million on a 
new unit to boost sales to communications equipment makers, 
according to a source close to IBM. An IBM spokesman declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has good reason to want to expand its chip business. While  
sales of desktop PCs continue to rise, demand is slowing. Intel's 
unit sales of chips are increasing only about 10 percent a year, 
less than half the growth rate of just four years ago. At the same 
time, the average price Intel charges for computer chips has 
dropped sharply as a result of industry price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	To help buoy the company's profits and sales, Intel is pushing  
to sell more lucrative chips, such as those used in powerful 
business machines at the hub of computer networks. Wednesday's move 
into networking chips is the latest such foray to augment its PC 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply further evidence of Intel's scramble to  
diversify,'' said Drew Peck, a financial analyst with Boston-based 
Cowen &AMP; Co. ``It's just one relatively small element of a much 
bigger effort at Intel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, by far the largest chip maker with $26 billion in sales  
last year, is seeking to exploit its size. Intel can keep prices 
low because of its large-scale manufacturing operations, a strategy 
that has helped the company get its microprocessors into 90 percent 
of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said it already has lined up several major customers of  
its Internet chips, including network equipment makers Cisco 
Systems Inc., Newbridge Networks Corp. and Cabletron Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also said it would invest $200 million in small companies  
that are developing products using the chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The company stressed that its new ``IX Architecture'' system  
would help makers of networking equipment easily add new features. 
Intel's new chip design ``will help customers deliver faster and 
smarter networks on Internet time,'' Mark Christensen, head of 
Intel's Network Communications unit, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The unveiling was part of a flurry of announcements by Intel at  
its annual conference for developers this week in Palm Springs, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Intel unmasked its Coppermine Pentium III processor,  
an enhanced version of its high-end PC chip, to be released in 
October. It will operate at a speed of at least 700 megahertz. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also demonstrated its much-touted Merced chip for powerful  
business machines, which the company has been developing with 
Hewlett-Packard Corp. and intends to start shipping in volume by 
the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> Cadbury To Buy Dr Pepper Bottling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British beverage and  
candy giant, and a partner have agreed to buy Dr Pepper Bottling 
Co. of Texas for $283 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury plans to merge the Texas bottler with its own bottling  
company to form the largest independent soft-drink bottler in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Turner, chief executive of Irving-based Dr Pepper Bottling  
of Texas, said the combined company plans to go public in one or 
two years. Turner will become chief executive and hold an 
approximately 7 percent stake in the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury and a Washington investment firm, Carlyle Group, also  
agreed to assume about $408 million in debt. The two companies plan 
to merge the Texas bottler with their own American Bottling Co., 
based in Darien, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury's soft drinks include Schweppes, Dr Pepper, 7 Up, Canada  
Dry, A&AMP;W Root Beer and Sunkist. The company uses independent 
bottlers, such as Dr Pepper Bottling of Texas, to produce its 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas company produces soft drinks for sale in Texas,  
California and other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year ended June 30, it posted net sales of $709 million.  
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were 
$85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury confirmed a month ago that it and Carlyle were  
discussing an acquisition of the Texas bottler. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlyle owns 60 percent of American Bottling, with Cadbury  
holding the other 40 percent. They created the company nearly two 
years ago to distribute soft drinks in the Midwest, but it has had 
trouble meeting demand for its products.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky on Mission to Slim Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky is on a mission to slim down.  
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern announced she has been enrolled at  
a Jenny Craig Inc.'s weight loss program since earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who has struggled with excess weight knows that this is  
a very personal issue, and it's not easy to talk about,'' said Ms. 
Lewinsky, in a statement released today on the company's Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Craig, the company's co-founder, said that Ms. Lewinsky  
has been motivated since starting the program and is ``progressing 
toward her goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not say how much weight Ms. Lewinsky intends to  
lose. Ms. Lewinsky, whose affair with President Clinton led to his 
impeachment, meets regularly with a program consultant to plan 
weekly menus and get suggestions on exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has not been paid to endorse the diet program and  
is being treated just like any other client, said company spokesman 
Brian Luscomb. Some clients of the diet program are featured in 
company commercials, but Ms. Lewinsky is not scheduled to appear in 
any of the ads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Craig Inc., based in La Jolla, Calif., has approximately  
750 weight loss centers worldwide.

<HEADLINE> John Hancock Adapts To Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s board  
of directors has adopted a plan to distribute the company's value 
to policy holders in the form of stock, cash or policy credits. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is the latest step in the Boston-based company's move  
toward an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock, which was founded in Boston in 1862, announced  
last year it was planning to go public, joining two of its top 
competitors, Newark, N.J.-based Prudential Insurance Co., and New 
York-based Metropolitan Life Insurance, as they move ahead in the 
process known as ``demutualization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a mutual insurance company, John Hancock is currently owned  
by its policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's looking forward to the days when shareholders call the  
shots. John Hancock has even settled on a ticker symbol: JHF, short 
for what will become the company's new name, John Hancock Financial 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Demutualization allows John Hancock to more effectively compete  
in the rapidly consolidating financial services world, where the 
lines that once divided industries like insurance, banking and 
mutual funds have begun to blur, Stephen L. Brown, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer said Wednesday after 
announcing the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there's still a lot more consolidation to come in the  
insurance business,'' Brown said, adding that by going public, the 
company will also have greater access to capital to make 
acquisitions and expand operations like mutual funds and asset 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hartwig, an economist at the Insurance Information  
Institute, a nonprofit trade association based in New York, said 
John Hancock is one of many mutual insurance companies trying to 
become full-fledged financial services providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason they're doing it is there's a view now that we're  
in a period of financial services integration,'' Hartwig said. 
``The objective by demutualization is to go public, to raise 
capital, and use that capital to make acquisitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock expects the demutualization plan to affect about 3  
million policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was approved Tuesday by John Hancock's board of  
directors. It must be approved by two-thirds of policyholders at a 
Nov. 30 vote, and it also needs the support of state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock hopes to make an initial public offering in the  
first quarter of 2000. The company and its subsidiaries had a total 
of $124.4 billion under management at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most policyholders will have the option of receiving cash or  
stock. Policyholders who live outside the United States, are in 
bankruptcy, or who can't be located will only be able to receive 
cash or enhancements in the values of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Policyholders and customers of John Hancock subsidiaries, like  
John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Co. and John Hancock Funds are 
not eligible to participate in the demutualization, the company 
said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Create Smarter Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have genetically engineered brainy mice nicknamed  
``Doogie,'' pointing the way for research that could lead to human 
babies with higher IQs as well as drugs to treat Alzheimer's 
disease and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Inserting an extra gene, researchers produced a strain of mice  
that excelled in a range of tasks, like recognizing a Lego piece 
they'd encountered before, learning the location of a hidden 
underwater platform and recognizing cues that they were about to 
receive a mild shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The improved learning and memory came from increased production  
of a brain protein called NR2B. The mice carried the enhanced 
abilities into adulthood, when learning ability and memory 
naturally taper off, and passed their heightened learning abilities 
on to their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``This points to the possibility that enhancement of learning  
and memory or even IQ is feasible through genetic means, through 
genetic engineering,'' said Joe Z. Tsien, the assistant professor 
of molecular biology at Princeton University who led the research 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published in Thursday's issue of Nature, indicate  
a common mechanism lies at the root of all learning, identify the 
protein NR2B as a key to brain function, and could lead to a drug 
to treat memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's, by increasing NR2B 
levels, Tsien added. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of NR2B protein normally decreases with age,  
correlating with the loss of memory and learning ability commonly 
experienced by older people, Tsien said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new mouse work represents a breakthrough in understanding  
how the brain functions at the molecular level, said Dr. Robert 
Malenka, a psychiatrist and behavioral sciences specialist at 
Stanford University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``To jump from this very elegant molecular work in a mouse model  
to humans is a very, very big jump,'' said Malenka, who was not 
involved in the research. ``Nevertheless, it is a jump we can make 
and will make eventually. When we jump to humans, it will probably 
be a lot more complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One complication is the risk that any drug that would increase  
NR2B levels could also increase the risk of stroke, because both 
stroke and learning are related to the same neurological switches 
in the brain, Malenka added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ron McKay of the National Institute of Neurological  
Disorders and Stroke said drug companies are already investigating 
manipulation of NR2B levels to treat strokes. Any research that 
illuminates how NR2B works in the brain would be valuable in that 
work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of genetically engineering smarter babies raises  
big ethical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are looking at is the baby steps toward a world in  
which we can design our descendants,'' said Arthur Caplan, director 
of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania 
Health System. ``I don't think that is necessarily bad. Finding 
ways to repair autism or mental retardation associated with Down 
syndrome or Alzheimer's or other disabling neurological diseases is 
a very good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the inherent risks, it makes more sense ethically to  
begin applying this discovery to treating diseases and disorders, 
rather than trying to create smarter babies, Caplan added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I would be worried quite yet about seeing  
hordes of tiny Einsteins in my neighborhood,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as parents strive to improve their children by sending  
them to better schools or giving them piano lessons, there will be 
those who want to genetically enhance their offspring, said Caplan. 
As in other areas of life, the rich would have an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have a brain gap in this society when some children  
go to kindergartens that cost $15,000 a year and other children go 
to kindergartens that don't have adequate plumbing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsien nicknamed the smart mice ``Doogie'' after the teen-age  
genius in the television show ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using a tiny glass needle, the scientists injected a gene  
carrying a blueprint for the protein NR2B into the nucleus of a 
fertilized mouse egg, then implanted the resulting embryo into the 
uterus of a mother mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice born with the extra gene made more NR2B than usual in their  
brains. 
</P>
<P>
	That extra production boosted mental abilities by enhancing the  
function of brain-cell switches called NMDA receptors. The results 
confirm the idea, proposed in 1949, that these switches play a key 
role in learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The NMDA switches require two signals to open, which fits in  
with the idea that learning involves associating pairs of events or 
facts, like a tone and an electrical shock. Boosting levels of the 
NR2B protein kept the mouse NMDA switches open longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The same protein and NMDA receptors exist in the human brain.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you associated food with a bell, a voice with a face, a  
face with a name, these are all associative learning, the major 
forms of learning in humans,'' Tsien said. ``To associate those 
things you require some kind of cellular machinery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so nice to convince ourselves that we are working in the  
right machinery.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners Call Up 3 From Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners have called up infielder  
Mike Blowers, right-handed pitcher Dennis Stark and outfielder 
Charles Gipson from the minors on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blowers, 34, who played with the Mariners from 1992 to 1995 and  
again in 1997, was signed by the team to a minor league contract on 
Aug. 28, after playing 73 games for the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's 
Central League. He played three games at first base for triple-A 
Tacoma before being called up in time to join the Mariners for 
Wednesday's game against the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stark, 24, was called up from double-A New Haven, where he was  
9-11 with a 4.40 ERA. The 6-foot-2, 210-pound Stark was the 
Mariners' fourth-round selection in the 1996 June draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Gipson, 26, was recalled from a rehab assignment at single-A  
Everett. He separated his right shoulder on July 11. He was hitting 
.318 in 30 games in three stints with the Mariners this season. 
Gipson began the season in Seattle before being optioned to Tacoma 
on April 14. He was recalled in May and again in June.

<HEADLINE> Denver Post Names New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Glenn Guzzo, managing editor of the Akron (Ohio)  
Beacon Journal, is taking over as editor of The Denver Post, 
replacing Dennis A. Britton, who has been editor and executive vice 
president for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Post Publisher Gerald E. Grilly said Tuesday that Guzzo will  
start around Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Grilly did not explain Britton's departure in detail.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought a change was appropriate,'' Grilly said. ``Dennis  
has been a valued member of the Post's management team and we wish 
him well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guzzo, 48, a Detroit native, has been managing editor of the  
Beacon Journal since 1993. The Knight Ridder newspaper won a 
Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was vice president/news for Knight Ridder from 1989 to 1993,  
an editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer for eight years and an 
editor at the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Britton, 58, came to The Denver Post in March 1996 after rising  
through the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, the Los Angeles Times 
and the Chicago Sun-Times, where he was editor and executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Britton also worked at the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur  
Foundation in Chicago, and co-authored two books on congressional 
and presidential dealings with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post, a Media News Group newspaper controlled by Dean  
Singleton, has been locked in a bitter, years-long newspaper war 
with the Denver Rocky Mountain News, a Scripps Howard newspaper.

<HEADLINE> More Than 5,000 Gas Ovens Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amana Appliances is recalling more than 5,000  
gas-fueled, down-draft ovens that have a faulty lock. The oven can 
open during the self-clean cycle, exposing people to high 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday no injuries  
have been reported, but customers should stop using the 
self-cleaning feature but can continue to use the oven for cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	The oven comes in either black or white. The model number  
AGDS901E or AGDS901WW appears on lower left side behind the utility 
drawer. The cooking surface has two gas burners on the left side 
and a gas grill on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Major department store and appliances stores sold the ovens  
nationwide from October 1995 through July 1999 for between $1,500 
and $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should call Amana for a free replacement of the  
self-clean locking mechanism, at 1-800-266-3535.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Couple Takes in Sex Offender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- It's a story of a neighborhood losing its  
innocence, of a couple testing their faith, of an ex-con seeking a 
second chance. But it doesn't have a storybook ending. 
</P>
<P>
	After 20 years in prison, Nate Sims returned in late July to  
Danville, the quaint college town where he had settled as a 
teen-ager. Within days, his picture was in the local newspaper; 
next to it were the phrases ``sex offender'' and ``high risk.'' He 
had been convicted of rape and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately lost his new job at a packaging plant and was  
soon living out of his rattletrap car. Under Kentucky's newly 
enacted Megan's Law, named for a 7-year-old New Jersey girl 
murdered by a released molester living in her neighborhood, Sims 
was arrested for not being at the address he'd reported to parole 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly everything changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a jail cell, the 52-year-old Sims found himself  
living in a $150,000 house in upscale Riverview Estates -- with a 
couple who trusted him enough to bed him down across the hall from 
their children's playroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shock,'' Sims said recently in a voice that seemed  
too soft to have come from his 6-foot-4 frame. ``I ain't never had 
anyone lift a hand for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark and Tammy LaPalme explained that they were ``baby  
Christians,'' out to test their newfound, born-again faith. They 
decided to open their five-bedroom home to someone needing shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, we feel like God's blessed us in so many ways,'' said  
Mark LaPalme, 38, a gangly man with an earnest voice. ``We've been 
so selfish with it up to now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day on television, Tammy LaPalme saw a tall man running from  
a camera crew. She recognized him from a newspaper article 
headlined: ``Boyle (County) registers first high-risk sex 
offender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a sign from God,'' Mark LaPalme said.  
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife asked themselves the question printed on a pink  
and yellow cloth bracelet that she wears: ``What Would Jesus Do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims moved in on Aug. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told Mark and Tammy, `I hope you all know what you're  
getting into,''' Sims recalled last week as he sat at their dining 
room table. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything happened so fast that the LaPalmes never bothered to  
inform their neighbors. They didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	Bright yellow fliers soon appeared everywhere in Riverview -- in  
newspaper boxes, on street lights, even stapled to the leaves of 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``!!BEWARE!! Sex Offender at Mark &AMP; Tammy LaPalme residence,''  
they said, giving the address and phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters started coming. An anonymous writer complained: ``You  
say to `Love thy neighbor,' but you are demonstrating a total 
disregard for our feelings, our fears, and our safety. That's not 
my idea of a good `neighbor.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Streets normally filled with twilight walkers and kids on  
bicycles were suddenly desolate. People who never locked their 
doors started shuttering up at night and looking into alarm 
systems. An elderly resident began patrolling the neighborhood on 
his red scooter, squawking into a walkie-talkie when a strange car 
entered the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was spotted with a pistol in his back pocket.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was thrust upon us big-time,'' said Cynthia Ellsworth, who  
lives a few doors down from the LaPalmes. ``I think the people here 
have reacted as normally as people anywhere would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LaPalmes responded by pulling down the notification leaflets  
and replacing them with white fliers of their own. ``Let he who is 
without sin cast the first stone!'' the sheets said, quoting Bible 
verses on forgiveness and brotherly love. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Bruce Petrie, a neighbor who describes himself as born  
again, was not swayed: ``My understanding of my Christian duty is 
first to my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Jill Lee's college-age daughter began calling on a cell  
phone to be escorted from her car to the house and her 8-year-old 
son was placed under virtual house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any change he would have left over from lunch, he would say,  
`Do you think we could give this to that man so he can go live 
somewhere else and I can go visit my friends again?''' Mrs. Lee 
said. ``It was very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighborhood kids stopped visiting the LaPalmes' children --  
daughter Sydney, 8, and son Tyler, 7. One neighbor came by 
LaPalme's car lot in nearby Harrodsburg to complain that he'd 
ruined his chances of selling his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've moved a nuclear waste dump right next to me,'' he told  
LaPalme. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors began checking up on LaPalme and found that he had  
been charged with forging a registration document on a used car, a 
case he is fighting. They whisper to a reporter about the deputy 
who came last month and confiscated cars on LaPalme's lot because 
of bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPalme, who said he and his wife were converted on their car  
lot by a born-again customer, Wayne Aldridge, who was also a former 
sex offender, believe they simply followed in Christ's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've gotten so far from it has been persecution,''  
LaPalme said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Sims, he said he has done his time and just wants to move  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, he pleaded guilty to raping and sodomizing a woman  
during a break-in near Louisville. Sims squinched his eyes tight 
and said he can't explain the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Cause I never did anything like this before,'' he said. ``I'd  
always just been a thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims had a property-crimes record going back to age 15, and he  
had been in and out of prison twice following the rape conviction -- 
for theft and burglary while on parole in 1986 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims briefly took part in a sex offender treatment program three  
years ago but was kicked out, he said, dismissing it as ``a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a risk-assessment hearing before his release, prosecutor  
Sandy McLeod told the judge that Sims has ``serious psychopathic 
tendencies ... the highest risk that the evaluator has ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors couldn't believe the LaPalmes would expose their  
children to such risks. Mark LaPalme said the family was not 
fearful. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a peace that's come over us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And neighbors, too, began tentatively making peace with the  
situation. Last week, a few resumed their evening walks, and others 
held a neighborhood meeting to discuss how the law on released sex 
offenders might be refined. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as suddenly as he had arrived, Sims left the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the LaPalmes' house Monday after his first day at a  
new job cleaning uniforms, he found a camera crew from the 
syndicated television show ``Extra'' waiting for him. He packed his 
bags and fled without even saying good-bye. 
</P>
<P>
	``They drove him out of here,'' Mark LaPalme said of his  
neighbors. ``They didn't want him in this neighborhood. They didn't 
want him in this town. And that's what they accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Ellsworth said nobody won anything here. Especially not  
Sims, who said he was just looking for another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how to give him a chance,'' she said. ``What are  
we supposed to do? Just ignore him and lock our doors?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> US-China Trade Progress Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barring new snags, President Clinton and  
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will make a major effort to get 
derailed trade talks back on track when they meet on the sidelines 
of an Asian-Pacific conference in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides want to repair the severe damage done this year to  
Beijing-Washington ties. And improving trade relations is in the 
interest of both countries, say officials from both sides and trade 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Informal trade talks between officials from the two countries on  
China's long-sought bid to join the World Trade Organization are 
likely to begin even before the Clinton-Jiang session in Auckland 
on Sept. 11, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope at a minimum we can have the two leaders talk about  
the importance of the WTO accession agreement for China,'' said 
David Leavy, a White House national security spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, avoiding new snags is the key. Recently, the  
relationship has been plagued with little but snags. 
</P>
<P>
	First, there were Republican outcries over campaign  
contributions to Clinton's re-election campaign by Chinese 
interests. Then came a bipartisan House report documenting alleged 
widespread Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on May 7, the United States accidentally bombed the  
Chinese embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, U.S-China ties came under further strain when the  
president of Taiwan advocated a change in the relationship between 
his island and the mainland, suggesting relations henceforth be 
``state to state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China viewed that as a move toward Taiwanese independence. It  
considers Taiwan a renegade province and has said it would use 
force, if necessary, to block independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States maintains unofficial links to Taiwan under the  
Taiwan Relations Act, which authorizes the sale of defensive 
weapons to the island and pledges to treat threats with concern. 
The law is deliberately vague on the question of whether U.S. 
forces would help defend Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the elevated rhetoric across the Taiwan Strait,  
there have been optimistic words from both China and the United 
States on using the New Zealand meeting to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we hope that this meeting can be the occasion for  
significant progress on WTO,'' said Stanley Roth, assistant 
secretary of state for Eastern Asian and Pacific affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO is the Geneva-based organization that oversees and sets  
rules for international trade. U.S. businesses see China's entry as 
important to opening Chinese markets. For China, it also could mean 
new markets -- and an end to the annual, emotional debate in 
Congress over renewal of normal trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
	But China hasn't been able to join the WTO because of U.S.  
demands that it first liberalize its markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries almost reached a deal in April, during a visit  
to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. The Chinese made a 
number of market-opening concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, bowing to pressure from Congress, refused to  
approve a deal. He claimed China had to do more to protect U.S. 
steel and textile companies and open its market to American 
financial service firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the embassy bombings -- and China froze the trade  
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hard liners in China remain opposed to resuming trade talks  
with the United States, just as many U.S. congressional 
conservatives oppose closer relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, both presidents must walk a careful line.  
</P>
<P>
	China wants to join the trade organization, but there's a limit  
to the price it will pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally believe that China is already qualified to ascend  
to the WTO,'' Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese ambassador to the United 
States, told a news conference. ``I hope our American friends will 
not further raise the threshold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Democratic official close to the talks said Clinton and  
Jiang would not use the meeting to hammer out an agreement -- but 
would only act if they could seal the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, some U.S. officials, including U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky, were flying to Auckland after Labor Day and 
ahead of the Clinton-Jiang meeting in hopes of seeing their Chinese 
counterparts to prepare the groundwork. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained to be seen whether Clinton and Jiang would be able  
to announce a final market-opening trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's a dance because of the embassy bombing,'' said  
economist Lawrence Chimerine of the trade-oriented Economic 
Strategy Institute. ``I know the Chinese leadership still wants to 
do it and I know our government wants to do it.''

<HEADLINE>  64 Killed in Argentine Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Investigators pulled badly burned  
bodies from the charred wreckage of an LAPA airlines Boeing 737 on 
Wednesday, the day after a fiery crash claimed at least 64 lives in 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	The jetliner lifted only a few feet off the ground Tuesday  
evening before roaring through an airport fence, skimming across a 
busy roadway and striking cars and heavy machinery before stopping 
beside a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took out everything in its path before stopping and the  
plane broke in half,'' said businessman Julio Arevalos, who jumped 
from the burning wreckage. ``The flames were coming from the front 
of the plane and there was smoke everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 64 of the 100 people aboard domestic Flight 3142 were  
killed, said government spokeswoman Olga Riugord. The Buenos 
Aires-based Lineas Aereas Privadas Argentinas said 95 passengers 
and five crewmembers were aboard the Boeing 737-204C. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash near downtown Buenos Aires's Jorge Newbery airport was  
Argentina's worst aviation disaster in memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm born again. When I see the images on  
television I can't believe I was there,'' Arevalos told The 
Associated Press. He said the plane dropped to the ground seconds 
after liftoff, bouncing three times as it broke apart. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the golf course screamed for the passengers to get out  
of the wreckage, which came to rest on land beside the Rio de la 
Plata River. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were shouts, cries of desperation, people on fire. It  
was hell,'' said another survivor, Jose Gamallo, who spoke with 
Buenos Aires reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in white gloves zipped bodies into plastic bags as  
investigators scoured the rubble Wednesday. A crane lifted up what 
appeared to be an engine and later removed a section of fuselage 
from near two sandtraps. 
</P>
<P>
	LAPA spokesman Ricardo Wilson said the plane took off at 8:55  
p.m. and lost contact with the tower a minute into its scheduled 
flight to Cordoba, 475 miles northwest of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither he nor investigators released a possible cause. A team  
of Boeing investigators flew to Argentina on Wednesday to assist in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the plane's two black boxes has been found, according to  
media reports. There was no immediate word on the fate of the pilot 
or the co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 survivors had only minor injuries and were released  
from hospitals, doctors said. Others were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many had severe burns over much of their bodies. Others had  
broken limbs, arms or legs,'' said Dr. Julio Comando, from the Juan 
A. Fernandez Hospital where most survivors were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a day of mourning for all of Argentina,'' said  
Interior Minister Carlos Corach. 
</P>
<P>
	Another LAPA official, Guillermo Capotti, would not speculate on  
local media reports focusing on one of the plane's engines. The 
plane was delivered to LAPA in April 1970 and had logged more than 
67,000 flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Desposito, a coast guard official patrolling Costanera  
Avenue near the river, described a ``ball of fire'' as he pulled 
his car over and ran to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled four people out. Two of them were dead,'' Desposito  
said. ``I saw many people who were badly burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The region's last major air disaster killed 74 people when an  
Argentine DC-9 operated by Austral airlines crashed Oct. 10, 1997, 
in western Uruguay. The plane was flying from the northeast 
Argentine city of Posads to Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine 737 is the world's most common commercial  
jetliner with more than 3,000 in use.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Washes Away Sea Turtle Nests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KURE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- The high surf kicked up by Hurricane  
Dennis washed away dozens of sea turtle nests during what had been 
one of the state's best nesting seasons on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's primary nesting turtles are loggerheads, which the  
government classifies as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the loss was still unclear as the state's network of  
volunteer turtle trackers fanned out along the coast to assess the 
toll. Damage found so far varies greatly from beach to beach, with 
Oak Island losing 61 of its 105 turtle nests and Wrightsville Beach 
losing none. 
</P>
<P>
	Susi Clontz, the sea turtle coordinator for Kure Beach and  
Carolina Beach, said the first few nests she checked this week were 
gone without even a trace of the wooden stakes and yellow ribbon 
she had used to mark them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of her nests did survive. ``I was so happy to see one I  
did a little dance,'' she said. ``Last year, I lost them all during 
Bonnie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Dennis, almost every beach in the state had reported  
above-average nest totals this year, said Ruth Boettcher, 
coordinator of the N.C. Sea Turtle Project, the network of 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than half of them had hatched before Dennis sent its  
heaviest surf ashore Saturday through Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Turtle nests also are washed away during high tides that  
correspond with a new moon, Boettcher said, but Dennis struck a 
population struggling to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main objective to recovering a species, getting them back  
to healthy enough numbers, so they can recover from these kinds of 
catastrophic events,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> New World Trade Chief Takes Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Mike Moore formally took over as director-general  
of the World Trade Organization on Wednesday, meeting with his 
staff and even offering to meet with protesters demonstrating 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Zealand prime minister was all smiles on his  
first day in the job after a leadership race that split the WTO in 
two and ended with a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement that finally settled the leadership dispute,  
Moore will serve three years in office and will then be replaced by 
his rival for the post, Thai commerce minister Supachai 
Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian nations had backed the Thai candidate and were angered  
when the United States later decided to throw its support behind 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said his major concern would be to make sure that smaller  
countries had the same access to the benefits of the WTO as larger 
ones at the global trade meeting in Seattle in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO was created to give each nation, each member  
government, the opportunity to raise standards of living, to expand 
the production of and trade in goods and services and to promote 
sustainable development,'' he said. ``I intend to devote all my 
efforts to ensuring that we live up to that promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore also stressed the importance of reaching an agreement for  
China to join the organization as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is a superpower and has to sit at the table one day.  
I'll do anything I can to facilitate China's membership,'' he told 
Associated Press Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	China's application has been pending for 13 years as members  
have negotiated with Beijing over conditions that would apply to 
the world's most populous country.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Lists Mom-Friendly Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM helps employees screen new nannies. Texas  
Instruments sends mobile toy stores around its offices to help 
workers save on holiday shopping time. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more companies are going the extra mile to help their  
workers, according to Working Mother magazine's 14th annual list of 
the best 100 companies for working moms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are really listening to what their employees have to  
say,'' said Deborah Wilburn, executive editor of the magazine. 
``It's not so much, 'What are the hours that you're in the office', 
but 'Are you getting the job done','' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine is published its annual list -- seen as a badge of  
honor in Corporate America -- Wednesday in its October issue. It can 
also be seen on the company's Web site, www.workingmother.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine does not rank the 100 companies, but names 10  
companies as exceptionally progressive: Bank of America, Cigna, 
Deutsche Bank, Fannie Mae, First Tennessee Bank, IBM, Eli Lilly, 
Lincoln Financial Group, Lotus Development and Prudential Financial 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has been among the top 10 for 12 years -- longer than any  
other company. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer manufacturer believes its secret to success is  
really not a secret at all, just logic, creativity and 
responsiveness to workers' changing needs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when the company realized some parents preferred to  
have at-home child care, it launched a pilot program in New York 
and North Carolina that helps screen nannies for their employees. 
The program began last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a workplace that is still reflective of what it  
looked like in the '50s and '60s, with the same kinds of rules in 
place, you're not going to be very appealing a place for women to 
come to work,'' said Ted Childs, vice president of global work 
force diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies on the list are also using creative solutions.  
</P>
<P>
	At Bristol-Myers Squibb, employees can receive free baby  
formula, mailed to them in installments, for their baby's first 
year of life. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chase Manhattan Bank, a backup child care service provides a  
safety net for parents whose baby-sitter may call in sick or fail 
to show up on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, nearly 3,000 children were cared for in the care  
center, the largest such corporate facility in the country. The 
center has also won prestigious accreditation by the National 
Association for the Education of Young Children. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, companies are beginning to wake up to the need for  
elder care services, said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families 
and Work Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``As our employee base continues to age, we learn from our  
employees,'' explained Mary Anne Detmer, diversity and work-life 
manager at Rochester-based Eastman Kodak, which offers backup elder 
care as well as free in-home assessments of elderly dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the struggle to balance work-life issues is far from  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 90 percent of companies allow workers to take time off to  
attend school events, and half let workers stay home with mildly 
ill children without using vacations or sick days, according to a 
1998 study by the Families and Work Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet only 9 percent of companies offer child care at or near the  
workplace, 33 percent offer maternity leaves more than 13 weeks 
long, and 23 percent offer elder care resource and referral 
services.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Machinists Prepare To Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Even as Machinists union leaders touted the  
Boeing Co.'s contract proposal as the best in the aerospace 
industry, the company was engaging in a large-scale ad campaign to 
persuade workers to vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not taking this for granted,'' Boeing chairman Phil  
Condit said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Machinists accept the contract, it could encourage other  
unions to make similar demands when they negotiate future 
agreements, because the issues at stake mirror battles occurring 
throughout the U.S. manufacturing and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company ran double full-page ads -- outlining contract basics  
and urging union members to vote -- in Seattle's two daily 
newspapers on Tuesday. The ads also ran today in the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer and others were scheduled for newspapers serving 
cities with substantial Boeing work forces, including Spokane, 
Everett, Tacoma, Bellevue and Kent in Washington; Portland, Ore.; 
and Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit appeared in TV ads Tuesday, telling workers that ``after  
intense and thoughtful negotiations, we have a contract that we're 
proud to present to employees for ratification. It offers 
unprecedented job security, the best wages and retirement plan in 
the industry, and world-class benefits. It's the right thing for 
employees and the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condit wasn't getting any argument from the union.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say it again: That's the best contract in aerospace,  
period. By far. Talk to anyone around the country,'' said Bill 
Johnson, president of International Association of Machinists 
District Lodge 751. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44,000 Machinists union members will vote at union halls  
today on the 44-month contract. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some grumbling on the eve of the ratification vote --  
concerns about job-security provisions and pension benefits for 
those already retired. But union leaders remained convinced that 
the contract was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've negotiated what we feel is a very good contract,'' said  
Dick Schneider, who led the union's bargaining effort. ``We 
recommended the tentative agreement to our members and it will be 
up to them whether to accept or reject it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the membership turns the offer down, ``then we strike and try  
to go back to the table,'' Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	A walkout by Machinists in the Seattle area, Spokane, Wichita  
and Portland, Ore., ``would greatly harm'' the company, Schneider 
said. ``I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said Boeing is optimistic about the  
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. The  
Machinists have struck over two of the last three contracts, most 
recently for 69 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed contract would continue Boeing's traditional  
five-day work week, with workers paid overtime for weekend shifts, 
and it makes no increases in member costs for medical benefits. It 
offers a 25 percent increase in pension benefits. The deal provides 
a 10 percent signing bonus worth $4,400 to the average worker, and 
annual wage increases of 4 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also strengthens union oversight of proposals for  
subcontracting work to outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Job security is the key issue for the union. Boeing plans to  
deliver a record 620 planes in 1999, but -- under pressure from 
rival European consortium Airbus Industrie -- has been working for 
over a year to streamline its operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Union naysayers shrug off a provision that guarantees ``no  
layoffs as the direct result of subcontracting or offloading,'' 
noting other language that exempts ``commercial airplane strategic 
work placement requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to get a total ban on outsourcing, but obviously that  
wasn't there,'' Schneider said. ``We feel the language we have 
attained affords us protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern was pension benefits for more than 8,000  
already-retired members. The goal was a tripling of benefits -- from 
$40 a month per year of service to $120 -- but negotiators settled 
for a 25 percent increase to $50 per year of service.

<HEADLINE> Bird Had Heart Trouble With Celtics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers were aware that Larry  
Bird had an irregular heartbeat when they hired him as coach, and 
realize he might leave after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of his contract,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh  
said today. ``He hasn't come in and definitely told me that, but 
I've always known it was a three-year deal and at the end of it he 
was going to make up his mind whether he wanted to coach or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was not available for comment today, and it was not clear  
if the possibility of his leaving coaching was tied to his heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe today reported that Bird said he had discussed  
quitting with Walsh, but Walsh told The Associated Press he never 
talked to Bird specifically about that. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, in dealing with Larry for the last two years, from  
the very beginning, he only committed to coach for three years,'' 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bird joined the Pacers in 1997, he said he didn't expect to  
coach long. Walsh said it's possible Bird could move into the front 
office as general manager or even team president, Walsh's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll continue to talk about that,'' Walsh said. ``But we  
really haven't sat down and had a definite discussion about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's heart ailment was disclosed in an excerpt in this week's  
Sports Illustrated from his upcoming book, ``Bird Watching: On 
Playing and Coaching the Game I Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says he did not tell the Boston Celtics and team doctors that  
he felt irregular heartbeats during offseason workouts late in his 
NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew there was something wrong with my heart,'' Bird  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart ``episodes,'' as he called them, apparently didn't  
occur during the regular season. He said he would feel sudden 
exhaustion and his heart would start ``jumping around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring in 1992 and joining the Celtics' front office,  
Bird felt the ``episodes'' more often. He finally told team 
physician Arnie Scheller and was diagnosed with atrial 
fibrillation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was put on medication and told to exercise, eat healthy and  
drink alcohol only in moderation. But his condition worsened in the 
spring of 1997, right before he became the Pacers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little scared because it didn't seem like it was going  
away,'' Bird wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said today he was aware of Bird's heart ailment.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Larry and I were talking about the job originally, he  
told me he was seeing a doctor and he had an irregular heartbeat or 
something like that and that he had to watch his diet, what he 
drank, what he ate, and that he would have to take medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, it was a matter of finding the level of the  
medicine in order to have his heart beat regularly. Once they found 
that, it seemed to me it was OK and he didn't have any more 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is not life threatening and not as serious as  
ventricular fibrillation, which doctors believed caused the death 
of former Celtics teammate Reggie Lewis. But on March 17, 1998, 
while coaching Indiana in a tight game against the Chicago Bulls, 
Bird almost passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was standing on the sideline and hoping for a television  
timeout because I felt like I was gonna to pass out,'' Bird wrote. 
``Finally, the ref whistled time. Whenever we have a timeout, they 
always put a chair on the court for me so I can sit down and talk 
to the guys. This time I fell into that chair because I was going 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point earlier, Pacers cardiologist King Yee used  
defibrillator paddles to jolt Bird's heart back to a normal rhythm. 
Yee told Bird to be more serious about his condition and 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Dr. Yee was trying to scare me,'' Bird wrote. ``I'm  
not going to be stupid about this heart condition, but I'm not 
going to live my whole life in fear of this thing, either. If it

<HEADLINE> Mafia Hit Man Executed in Missouri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- Mob hit man David Leisure was executed early  
Wednesday for the car bomb slaying of an underworld boss, becoming 
the first organized crime figure put to death in the United States 
since Louis ``Lepke'' Buchalter in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Leisure, 49, was convicted of killing James Michaels Sr., whose  
slaying in 1980 set off a deadly feud between the Leisure and 
Michaels crime families of St. Louis. Two cousins of Leisure were 
sentenced to life in prison for their part in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The lethal injection was delayed more than two hours while the  
U.S. Supreme Court considered and rejected last-minute appeals 
arguing that he should be spared because he was mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers said his IQ measured in the low 70s, he wasn't toilet  
trained until age 8, he dropped out of school in the third grade, 
and he used alcohol and drugs as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Jay Nixon contended the punishment fit  
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing uncontroverted is that this guy placed a bomb  
that not only killed one person but put at risk hundreds of others 
on a major freeway in St. Louis,'' Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leisure was the first organized crime figure put to death in the  
United States since Buchalter, an assassin for Murder Inc., went to 
the electric chair at New York's Sing Sing prison, said Clark Hall, 
former supervisor of the FBI's organized crime section. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall called the St. Louis crime families ``also-rans'' compared  
with larger, more notorious families in other major cities. But the 
battle between the Leisures and Michaelses terrorized the city for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the defense in seeking clemency for Leisure was  
Michaels' grandson James Michaels III, who had urged Gov. Mel 
Carnahan to end the cycle of killing by sparing Leisure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Michaels family and the Leisure family have experienced  
enough grief for one lifetime,'' the younger Michaels wrote.

<HEADLINE> North Face CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Colo. (AP) -- Jim Fifield, president and CEO of The  
North Face Inc. has resigned after an agreement to sell the alpine 
sporting goods company fell through. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced today that its agreement to be purchased  
by TNF Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of Leonard Green &AMP; partners, 
L.P., had been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actively involved with the proposed Leonard Green  
transaction and I am disappointed with the termination of the 
agreement,'' Fifield said. ``I continue to believe the company 
enjoys an outstanding brand name and products and I look forward to 
remaining a member of the company's board of directors and a major 
shareholder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Green had agreed to acquire North Face for $17 a share,  
or about $212 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors appointed William Simon as interim chief  
executive officer to oversee the day-to-day operation of the 
company, effective immediately. Simon had been serving as the 
company's vice chairman and previously served as its CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of North Face, which makes outerwear and sports-related  
equipment, were trading Wednesday down 68 3/4 cents to $8.06 1/4 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Reunite 2 Old Teammates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- While he'll miss Houston,  
Michael Dickerson is excited about rekindling the magic with his 
college backcourt mate Mike Bibby in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great. Mike and I have some great chemistry. Mike  
knows what I'm going to do before I even do it. That's what makes 
him such a great point guard,'' Dickerson said Wednesday during his 
first visit to Vancouver, five days after the Grizzlies acquired 
the second-year guard from the Houston Rockets in a blockbuster 
11-player trade that also involved the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, at shooting guard, and Bibby, at point, formed the  
Arizona backcourt for two years, including 1997 when the Wildcats 
won the NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had something really special. Winning the championship,  
that just united us even more. Mike is a great point guard. I'm 
just excited to be here,'' Dickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, fourth in the NBA in 3-point shooting accuracy last  
year, was acquired to address the Grizzlies' needs at shooting 
guard, and is expected to win the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he gained valuable experience starting for the  
Rockets, while also playing alongside all-stars like Hakeem 
Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one thing I'm going to miss, our veteran players.  
That's the only thing I don't like about leaving there. They gave 
me a lot of confidence,'' Dickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's looking forward to playing in Vancouver, a two-hour  
drive north of his hometown of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take this opportunity and run with it,''  
Dickerson said. ``I'm looking on the bright side, this is a great 
team with great players and I think I'm going to compliment them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Dickerson, the Grizzlies acquired Othella Harrington,  
Brent Price, Antoine Carr and a first-round draft pick from the 
Rockets, in exchange for Steve Francis, the second player taken in 
last June's draft, and Tony Massenburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando sent Don MacLean and a future first-round pick to  
Houston in exchange for the Grizzlies' Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, 
Rodrick Rhodes and Makhtar Ndiaye. The Magic also dealt their 2002 
second-round pick to Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Said Spied on Panama Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- By eavesdropping on conversations of top Panamanian  
officials, American agents were able to uncover an immigrant 
smuggling ring allegedly operated by some of that country's 
government officials, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating from the U.S. embassy, agents bugged top officials and  
associates of President Ernesto Perez Balladares and discovered at 
least five other government officials suspected of smuggling 
people, The Miami Herald reported, citing unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In one conversation, Panama's intelligence chief, Samantha  
Smith, is allegedly heard discussing the arrangement of visas for 
Chinese immigrants bound for the U.S., the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not indicate what kind of bugging equipment was  
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had intercepts on a whole bunch of conversations,'' a  
senior U.S. official told the Herald on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether government  
officials sold Panamanian visas to Chinese immigrants for illegal 
entry into the United States, the Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Balladares has denied he pressured officials to approve  
visas for Chinese citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Panamanian government officials suspected of involvement  
in alleged smuggling ring were fired in June, after Perez 
Balladares learned of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fired officials include Smith, a CIA-trained intelligence  
officer, Cesar Martans, director of Tocumen International Airport, 
and Luis Arauz Chang, head of the national police's aviation 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Panamanian immigration records show that only 135 legal visas  
have been issued to Chinese immigrants this year, but community 
leaders say substantially more have arrived.

<HEADLINE> Clintons May Soon Be Homeowners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- While President Clinton and his family  
settled into a borrowed lakefront mansion for a few days of rest 
and relaxation in upstate New York, they also edged closer to 
buying a New York house of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were enchanted by a 110-year-old Georgian colonial  
they toured last weekend in Westchester County, N.Y., and may move 
to purchase it soon, people familiar with the couple's house search 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family needs a place to live when Clinton leaves the White  
House in January 2001. And if Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to run 
for the Senate seat now held by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan she must establish residency in New York before 
Election Day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the Clintons were prepared to make an  
offer on the $1.7 million house in Westchester County. But two 
people familiar with the house search said the Clintons had their 
hearts set on the Georgian colonial on Old House Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say that to avoid affecting the Clintons'  
negotiating position, they will not release details on any purchase 
until a deal is sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	A relaxed, cheerful Clinton stopped on the way to a Syracuse  
golf course Tuesday to shake hands, sign at least one autograph, 
and trade pleasantries with a crowd of about 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman wished him good luck on the golf course, and another  
asked whether he had gone jogging earlier in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	No, the president replied, he slept in. ``I was a bad boy,'' he  
said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's golf partner was Democratic fund-raiser Terence  
McAuliffe. After their round, the president visited McAuliffe's 
mother, who recently had a hip replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also took a break Tuesday after three days of  
Democratic fund-raising and out-and-out campaigning among New York 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	She hunkered down for a day of reading at the home where the  
Clintons are spending the week. Their daughter, Chelsea, shook 
hands and even kissed a baby during a sightseeing tour through the 
quaint village of Skaneateles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's presumed candidacy for a Senate seat from New  
York is a big part of the reason why the Clintons are vacationing 
in upstate New York, and Republicans tried to exploit that with a 
new television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most folks in Skaneateles don't get to stay for free in  
multimillion-dollar vacation estates; don't get to travel free on 
planes paid for by the taxpayers,'' Republican National Committee 
chairman Jim Nicholson said at news conference in nearby Auburn, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad shows Nicholson seated next to an open briefcase with  
$10,000 in cash -- the amount he said an average New Yorker would 
save over 10 years if Clinton signed the GOP's $792 billion package 
of tax cuts. ``Most folks never get to see what $10,000 looks 
like,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Mrs. Clinton's  
exploratory committee is paying for the public costs of political 
events, including a stop Monday at the New York State Fair. The 
committee also has a separate advance team and spokesman working 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' ad is airing only on cable television in  
Skaneateles, and Nicholson said it was intended primarily for the 
president's consumption.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Signals in Economic Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another sign the U.S. economy continues to  
grow at a brisk pace, a key barometer of future activity rose 0.3 
percent, in July, the same rate as in the prior two months, the 
Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has registered gains in  
nine of the last 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	There are concerns that rising interest rates could slow growth  
later this year, said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the 
Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``But overall, strength in manufacturing conditions and a robust  
labor market more than offset the negative contribution of higher 
interest rates,'' he said in releasing today's figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for July, which were slightly better than expected,  
reinforce Tuesday's economic data that showed the manufacturing 
economy grew in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight of the 10 leading indicators posted increases,  
underscoring the continuing strength of the current economic 
expansion,'' Goldstein said. ``The two key drivers of this latest 
increase were manufacturing and the labor market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the economic expansion, now in its ninth year, is  
showing some signs of cooling, including a separate report today on 
a decline in construction spending. 
</P>
<P>
	With mixed inflation signals, stocks were rising today, helped  
by bargain-hunting after four days of declines in the Dow Jones 
industrial average. The Dow, down nearly 500 points since hitting a 
record last Wednesday, rose 108.60, or by 1 percent, to close at 
10,937.88 in moderate trading today. Yields nudged higher in the 
inflation-sensitive government bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mixed economic news is a sign of slow growth, not a weak  
economy,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said there was a good possibility that inflation-fighters  
at the Federal Reserve could avoid raising interest rates for a 
third time this year, ``but it is still a mixed call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction spending was surprisingly  
weak in July, according to a report today from the Commerce 
Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending fell unexpectedly in July, declining 0.5  
percent. Spending fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$695.7 billion. In June, construction spending fell slightly, 
according to revised figures. 
</P>
<P>
	July's construction spending decrease was worse than many  
analysts' expectations. They were forecasting that spending would 
actually go up between 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity -- driven by low  
mortgage rates -- were a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Reserve has raised key interest rates twice this  
summer, and that makes buying a home more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising mortgage rates took a bite out of the housing market in  
July. Existing-home sales fell 3.9 percent, while sales of new 
homes rose a slight 0.1 percent but still reached the 
second-highest level ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are feeling a little less confident about the future  
economic and job prospects, in part because of the rise in interest 
rates. The Consumer Confidence Index fell for a second straight 
month in August, according to a Conference Board report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> A.C. Green Rejoins L.A. Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A power forward with NBA championship  
rings is returning to the Los Angeles Lakers, and he bears little 
or no resemblance to Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	A.C. Green, who hasn't missed a game in 12 years and who plans  
to become a minister when he retires, is rejoining Los Angeles, 
where he played his first eight NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Green, who holds the NBA record for consecutive  
games at 1,028, was acquired Wednesday by the Lakers in a trade 
that sent Sean Rooks to the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	Green averaged 4.9 points and 4.6 rebounds for Dallas last  
season. Rooks was with Los Angeles for three years, averaging 2.7 
points and 2 rebounds in 36 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Green won two NBA championship rings with the Lakers in the  
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	On a team that featured Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  
Green led the Lakers with 7.8 rebounds a game in their 1986-87 
title season, then averaged nine rebounds as they repeated as 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed as a free agent with Phoenix in 1993. The Mavericks  
acquired him in a trade in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowledgeable fans are well aware of the skills that A.C.  
Green will bring to this team,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West 
said in a statement. ``He's a solid rebounder and defender and does 
a lot of little things that don't show up in the box score but help 
you win games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also brings intangibles such as experience, character,  
professionalism and veteran leadership that will help us both on 
and off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Green: ``It's good to be back home again and back in our  
community. Hopefully I'll be able to help the other players with 
their knowledge and understanding of the game, and help us advance 
farther in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Green has career averages of 10.4 points and 7.8  
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who played briefly for the Lakers last season before his  
erratic behavior led them to release him, said recently he hoped to 
play for Los Angeles again. West, however, said that wasn't likely.

	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC shareholders voted overwhelmingly  
Wednesday to approve the company's acquisition of Atlantic 
Richfield Co., which will create one of the world's largest energy 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99.3 percent vote in favor at a special shareholders'  
meeting in London's Royal Festival Hall followed 99.3 percent 
approval by Atlantic Richfield shareholders that was announced in 
Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco shareholders also approved a split of BP Amoco shares  
which will have the effect of doubling the shares on issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of Arco and BP Amoco agreed last April to the merger,  
which still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission and 
the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will make BP Amoco ``an even more significant player  
on the international stage,'' said co-chairman Peter Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall become the largest non-state owned oil producer in  
the world, as well as the largest oil and gas producer in both the 
United States and the United Kingdom,'' said Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of the merger, the company has been shedding jobs as part  
of a cost-cutting plan or because of sales of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco chief executive Sir John Browne said last month that  
12,500 jobs have been shed so far this year, and another 2,000 
layoffs were expected by year's end.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The question of who owns rights to the  
Internet address www.WhiteHouse.com -- which now peddles pornography 
-- has reached federal court. But the people pressing the case have 
nothing to do with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, it is the maker of the White House brand of apple juice  
and apple sauce that is battling Dan Parisi, contending he is 
infringing on the company's trademark by using the Web address to 
display X-rated pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Parisi, attorneys for the Virginia-based National  
Fruit Product Company said the sex site ``dilutes and tarnishes the 
distinctive quality of our client's famous mark in violation of ... 
the Federal Trademark Act.'' They want Parisi to transfer control 
of the domain name to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	No chance, said Parisi, who beat the company to court. Two weeks  
ago he filed a request for declaratory judgment against the fruit 
company in U.S. District Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing by Parisi's attorneys calls his site ``one of the  
largest and most famous Web sites in the world.'' Far from being 
exclusive, the attorneys wrote, the name ``White House'' has been 
adopted by hundreds of businesses around the country -- as well as 
countless towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Parisi, a New Yorker who operates his Web site out of Jersey  
City, N.J., said he tried to solidify his hold on WhiteHouse.com by 
applying for a trademark on his particular use of the term ``White 
House,'' just as 32 other companies have done before. He said his 
application was initially approved, but then ultimately denied. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the apple products that appear under the White House  
label, their name was born in 1913 when the National Fruit Product 
Company of Winchester, Va., borrowed the name ``from the 
presidential mansion across the river in Washington, D.C.,'' 
according to the company's definitively G-rated Web site 
(www.WhiteHouseFoods.com). 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Roblyer, an Atlanta attorney who wrote to Parisi on  
behalf of the company, declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including lawyers for the Clinton administration, have  
long said that Parisi's site lures children and other unwitting 
computer users trying to reach the official site of government's 
executive branch (www.WhiteHouse.gov). 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, White House Counsel Charles Ruff wrote: ``We  
too believe in the First Amendment -- and in humor, although we see 
nothing humorous in your use of the White House domain name to draw 
children and other unwitting Internet users to your Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parisi yielded to Ruff's specific demand -- that he stop using  
images of Clinton, his wife Hillary and the White House on the 
site. Nowadays, the site's only reference to its namesake in 
Washington is a section of nude photos of what are called ``first 
ladies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parisi said he is ``trying to get away from porn and into other  
businesses,'' such as free e-mail and chat features, a store, an 
auction area and computer games, most of which will be free. The 
Web site's sex pictures and movies, though, will remain off-limits 
to all but paid subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 400,000 to 500,000 different computer users visit the site  
each month, many of whom visit multiple times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if National Fruit Product Company were to give in and offer  
to buy rights to the domain name, Parisi said he's not interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would we sell this? We're having a very good business  
right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Tait Breaks Off Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Chiefs president Carl  
Peterson sounded like he meant it when he apologized for using 
obscene language while dealing with first-round draft pick John 
Tait, says the father of the deeply religious young Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Carl first of all that we accept his apology. I believe  
he's being sincere,'' Alan Tait said Wednesday from his home in 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, in the meantime, was trying to work out details for a  
meeting he requested with the Tait family this weekend at their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will welcome Carl into our home,'' Alan Tait said.  
</P>
<P>
	John Tait, a 309-pound tackle and the first offensive lineman  
taken in this year's draft, stormed out of Peterson's office in 
Arrowhead Stadium on Tuesday along with agent Ethan Lock and 
accused him of cursing and bullying him. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward, Peterson called Tait's father and apologized  
for his language and asked to meet with the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is for him to come back here and talk with  
Ethan Lock,'' the elder Tait said, ``and wade through all the 
personalities, all the egos, all the vocabulary and get back to 
what's important, getting John on with his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I will look forward to getting the chance to meet  
him. We've got seven children. I guess Carl will have to meet them 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, both sides said they were close to agreement on a  
five-year deal. But negotiations broke down and became acrimonious 
on a couple of points, including whether Tait would forfeit his 
entire signing bonus if he did not play through the life of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of you guys would like to be treated like we were  
treated,'' said Lock, who said Peterson cursed ``four or five times 
when he was yelling at John and trying to intimidate him. John's a 
strong Mormon. After the second one, he stood up and said this is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate for John and the Chiefs and the fans. It  
takes a lot of nerve for a 24-year-old kid to say no to $4 million 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A junior from BYU, Tait has said he might sit out this season  
and re-enter the draft next year. He said Peterson ``just lost 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I don't know if it was meant to intimidate me  
or whatever. I just want a fair deal,'' Tait said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Tait said he had heard from people all over the country  
supporting his son's stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of John for conducting himself in a dignified  
manner, and that John has been honorable through this whole 
process, regardless of the outcome,'' the elder Tait said. ``We 
just hope he and the Chiefs can get along and have a mutually 
rewarding relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While apologizing for his language, Peterson said, ``I felt that  
I had a point to make and I made it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was aware that he may have offended what he described  
as ``a devout Mormon family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said Alan Tait ``couldn't have been more gracious''  
during their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's negotiations, Peterson said it became obvious  
that, ``A few of the items we thought we had agreements on were not 
agreements. Unfortunately, as the day wore on the negotiations kind 
of went south.''

<HEADLINE> Guard Killed During Prison Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, N.M. (AP) -- A correctional officer was stabbed to  
death in a fiery inmate revolt that caused extensive damage to a 
private prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility  
erupted Tuesday evening. Law officers regained control early today 
and imposed an inmate lockdown, said state Secretary of Public 
Safety Darren White. It was one of a rash of violent incidents 
recently at privately run prisons in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	White said the guard, Ralph Garcia, 42, of Tucumcari, was  
stabbed numerous times. He did not know how many inmates were 
involved in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is going to be to find whoever is responsible for the  
cold-blooded murder of this guard and hold them accountable,'' 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	White said it was too early to determine the cause of the  
disturbance at the prison about 120 miles east of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	It at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday as Garcia and other guards  
attempted to lock down the prison after an inmate was stabbed in a 
gymnasium, White said. Garcia was surrounded by a group of inmates 
and stabbed to death. The condition of the inmate wasn't 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	White said inmates blocked the doors with soda machines so  
guards could not gain access, and set fires in four dormitory areas 
-- known as pods -- burning furniture and recreational equipment. 
``There was destruction of much of the property that was contained 
in and around the pods,'' he said. Each pod holds about 50 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	A prison ``special response team'' re-established control of  
three of the pods shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday, and took the 
fourth from prisoners' control early today, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we know, no one escaped,'' state police Deputy Chief  
Herman Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not uncommon for inmates to attack each other,'' White  
said. ``It's a totally different set of circumstance when a guard 
is brutally attacked and murdered inside of a prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prison is owned by Florida-based Wackenhut Corrections Corp.  
Wackenhut has a $25 million-a-year contract to hold about 1,500 
inmates at two facilities in New Mexico. Wackenhut spokesman Pat 
Cannan said he had no information from the prison this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gary Johnson and state Corrections Secretary Rob Perry last  
week threatened to move New Mexico inmates to prisons in other 
states following a rash of killings and disturbances at the 
Corrections Corporation of America prison at Estancia and 
Wackenhut's facilities in Hobbs and Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
	At Santa Rosa, an inmate died Aug. 23 died after he was beaten  
with a laundry bag full of rocks in a day room. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first year, the Hobbs prison has been the site of three  
inmate stabbing deaths, six nonfatal stabbings, a near-riot and 
incidents of guards allegedly using excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 18, three inmates and two guards were injured in a  
disturbance at the CCA prison in Estancia.

<HEADLINE> Griese Ready As Broncos' No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In his first day on the job as the Denver Broncos'  
No. 1 quarterback, Brian Griese felt like a different person. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest difference for me was that I had to shave this  
morning,'' said Griese, who abandoned his usual facial stubble in 
anticipation of facing a phalanx of media. ``I usually don't shave 
when I come to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I feel a lot different, but I'm ready for the  
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is formidable. Not only does he take the reins of  
a two-time defending Super Bowl champion which is bidding for an 
unprecedented third straight title, but he never has started an NFL 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, there is a lot of pressure,'' he admitted Wednesday.  
``Everybody knows that. But as long as the pressure I put on myself 
is greater than all of these peripheral pressures, then I think I 
will be fine. I'm hard on myself -- probably a lot harder than you 
guys (media) will be on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning move on Monday, Broncos coach Mike Shanahan  
benched Bubby Brister, the heir apparent to John Elway, in favor of 
the 24-year-old Griese, a second-year pro who threw just three 
passes in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised like most of you were,'' Griese said. ``But I  
thought I was going to play this year at some point -- not because 
Bubby was going to falter, but because it's a long season. Not a 
lot of guys can make it through the season without getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I was preparing myself like I was going to play. Now it's a  
little bit sooner than I thought, but it's the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, outplayed in four preseason games by Griese, complained  
that he was misled by Shanahan into thinking the job was his, and 
that he didn't expect to be fighting for his job during meaningless 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese saw it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``When a player feels like he's not competing anymore, he's  
really not a player anymore,'' he said. ``If you are out there and 
you are not competing, you are not going to be out there long. I 
understood that Bubby had the job, and I respected that. I had to 
compete just for myself and to keep myself sharp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Griese also came to Brister's defense.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the things that happened this preseason were not his  
fault,'' Griese said. ``There were a lot of people who let him 
down. But like I told Bubby, I don't want anything to happen to him 
because we're going to need him this year. What he did last year is 
evidence that he can do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he was going to support me. I know he's going to be  
a great help to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he felt ready for his new role, he said, ``I think so.  
There are going to be some growing pains. But I expect to play 
well, I expect the team to win. And I expect us to take off from 
where we were last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to go out and play the way I've been playing. I  
don't have to do anything miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese's teammates, gearing up for Friday night's exhibition  
finale against San Francisco, were more concerned about the team's 
overall play than its quarterback controversy. The Broncos have had 
two straight poor performances in falling to 2-2 in the exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened, Mike made his decision, now we have to move on,''  
safety Tyrone Braxton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame it all on Bubby. Defensively, we stunk it up  
and we put the offense in some bad situations. Whenever you lose 
games, you tend to put the blame on the quarterback. But 
defensively we have to look in the mirror and try to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith said the offense was ``just not  
executing. A lot of times people want to perceive this as a one-man 
game, but it doesn't happen that way. It takes 11 guys being on the 
same page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added center Tom Nalen: ``Controversy? That's a media thing. I  
don't feel any controversy in the locker room. We're just trying to 
get better as a team.''

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo Complete Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. said Wednesday it  
has completed its alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries 
Ltd., giving Goodyear control of Dunlop tire operations in North 
America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will create the world's biggest tire business, with  
about 22 percent of the global tire market, pushing it past 
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan and Michelin of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear will pay $936 million to Sumitomo, acquire 10 percent  
of the manufacturer and help form six joint ventures around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo will get a 1.4 percent stake in Goodyear in a stock  
swap valued at $88 million earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to save $300 million to $360 million during  
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear earned $682 million on $12.6 billion in sales last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate building on Dunlop's past achievements and  
increasing sales on both continents, as well as in Japan, where we 
have gained an important foothold,'' said Samir Gibara, Goodyear 
chairman, president and chief executive officer.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 52nd Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire ended a 25-at-bat drought with his  
52nd home run and became the career leader in homers by a first 
baseman Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from Ryan Dempster off the scoreboard in  
left field, a drive estimated at 459 feet, for his first homer in 
eight games. That left him three behind major-league leader Sammy 
Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought was McGwire's longest since a stretch of 32 at-bats  
from June 9-19. His longest this season is 40 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has hit 494 home runs as a first baseman, one more than  
Lou Gehrig.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Moves World HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, best known  
for its Rogaine baldness treatment and Nicorette and Nicotrol 
smoking cessation products, relocated its world headquarters to 
Peapack on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes 15 months after P&AMP;U consolidated the London and  
Kalamazoo, Mich., headquarters of its predecessor companies to a 
temporary base in Bridgewater, several miles south of here in 
central New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the new facility can  
accommodate about 1,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The new campus comprises 550,000 square feet of office space  
spread among 10 buildings on 70 acres. The leafy, college-like 
setting includes aboveground and underground walkways connecting 
the buildings and a clock tower and fountain in the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn posted sales of $6.76 billion and  
profits of $691 million, successfully completing a turnaround 
engineered after struggles following its 1995 formation from 
Swedish and Michigan companies. On Tuesday, the company completed 
its acquisition of Sugen Inc., a South San Francisco biotechnology 
company developing several promising cancer treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzhenry said the company will continue operating the  
Bridgewater facility, with about 360 employees, at least through 
2007. It will house the sales and marketing staffs for U.S. 
consumer health care products, such as Rogaine and Nasalcrom, a 
nonprescription nasal spray for allergies.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Executes Organized Crime Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man was put to death by injection early  
Wednesday for planting a remote-controlled bomb that killed a rival 
in what investigators said was a battle between two organized crime 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leisure, 49, was condemned for planting the car bomb that  
killed James Michaels Sr. in 1980 as he was driving in St. Louis. 
Leisure was put to death after all his appeals were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark Hall, former supervisor of the organized crime section of  
the FBI, said the Leisure and Michaels families were ``also-rans'' 
compared to larger, more notorious families in other major cities. 
But the battle between them terrorized St. Louis for more than a 
decade and resulted in plenty of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the last organized crime figure to be executed in the  
United States was Louis ``Lepke'' Buchalter, who was electrocuted 
in New York in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys didn't deny Leisure, of St. Louis, planted the  
bomb, but argued it was his two older cousins who were the real 
ringleaders. They got life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the bombing was prompted by a dispute between  
the two families over control of a St. Louis labor union.

<HEADLINE> Govt., Tribes Negotiate on Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Tribal leaders want Gov. Gray Davis to  
rewrite his plan for expanded Indian gambling. His initial 
response: no dice. 
</P>
<P>
	Californians had approved a voter initiative to expand Indian  
gambling, but the state Supreme Court last week invalidated the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes have until early October to reach an agreement with  
Davis to avoid having thousands of video slot machines shut down by 
federal authorities. Talks were to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis offered a plan Tuesday aimed at fulfilling some of the  
initiative's purpose. It would double the number of slot machines, 
but tribes would have to share 25 percent of their gross profits 
with other tribes, as well as allow union activity in the gambling 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes sought changes in the plan, but a Davis spokesman  
said the governor's negotiators would not budge. 
</P>
<P>
	``After today, it was such a shock that we feel compelled to  
move forward with our initiative,'' said Richard Milanovich, tribal 
chairman of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	That initiative is another version of Proposition 5, the  
initiative approved by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes have been collecting signatures to qualify the plan that  
essentially duplicates Proposition 5 and amends the state 
constitution to exempt tribes from a ban on Nevada-style gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes' counterproposal was submitted to Davis' negotiating  
team, led by William Norris, a former federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Davis plan, tribes now operating about 15,000 slot  
machines -- and non-gambling tribes that want to jump into the 
lucrative business -- could add as many as 15,000 more. Proposition 
5 had no limit on the number of machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would allow for Nevada-style games, in addition to  
slots, but with a compact limiting future casino expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	While Milanovich said only part of the Davis plan is acceptable,

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clothing designer GUESS? is recalling more  
than 78,000 girls' T-shirts with a liquid-filled bubble patch on 
the front. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday the liquid  
contains a petroleum distillate that can be harmful if ingested. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubble patches come in three shapes -- a heart, a circle and  
a rectangle -- with liquids in three different color combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-shirts were sold in clothing stores nationwide from June  
1997 through March 1999 in sizes small through extra large. They 
cost $10 to $26 depending on the style. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should stop wearing the T-shirts immediately and  
return them to the store where they were purchased for a refund, 
the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Picks Convention Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Reform Party 2000 national convention  
will be held in Long Beach, Calif., and officials say their 
nomination process is the one to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much a foregone conclusion who the Republican  
nominee will be and who the Democratic nominee will be. The only 
unknown quantity at this point is our nominee,'' Illinois Reform 
Party Chairman Larry Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention will be held Aug. 10-13, said Michael Farris, the  
Pacific regional representative to the party's 11-member national 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The location decision required a two-thirds vote, passing 8-3 in  
a vote Wednesday night. The three members who didn't vote for 
California voted for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris said California was chosen mainly because of its detailed  
proposal. California officials had already proposed specific hotels 
and gathering places for the convention. Minnesota officials were 
still deciding among four possible cities for a convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was discussion about tabling it, but we sort of needed  
to get on with the process,'' Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party Chairman Rick McCluhan said he's looking  
into calling a special convention of the delegates from all states 
to try to overturn the executive committee's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they made the decision for the wrong reasons,''  
McCluhan said. ``We had the (Reform Party founder Ross) Perot 
faction in control of the committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gargan, the chairman-elect of the national party, was  
pushing for the event to be held in Minnesota. But Gargan, who was 
backed by Reform Party member and Gov. Jesse Ventura at the annual 
convention last month in Dearborn, Mich., wasn't one of the voting 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Verney, an ally of Perot who holds the chairmanship  
until Jan. 1, conceded that one of the reasons some committee 
members decided against Minnesota was that ``they didn't want to 
take a chance that Gov. Ventura would overshadow the candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said California also had more specifics on where the  
convention would be held and that some members thought Ventura 
would ``be bigger news if he were in California.''

<HEADLINE> Homeless Samaritan Gets Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- As Marian Neal prepared to spend her  
second night in a homeless shelter, she pondered her good fortune: 
People inspired by her decision to donate a kidney to a little boy 
had pledged thousands of dollars to help her find a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal said in an interview Tuesday it was difficult to fully  
describe how grateful she was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so overwhelmed today,'' Neal said. ``I really  
appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She moved into a homeless shelter Monday after someone told  
Alexandria housing officials she was living in a friend's public 
housing unit, which is against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Federal Express employee says she has been unable to  
afford her own place, because a back injury has kept her out of 
work for four years. She was denied Social Security benefits, and 
currently is number 60 on Alexandria's public housing list. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are long waiting lists in city housing,'' Sandy Murphy,  
an aide to Mayor Kerry Donley, said. ``It's not like there is city 
housing lying empty around the city that we could move people 
into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio station WRQX-FM discussed Neal's predicament  
Tuesday, and listeners pledged more than $5,000 to help her. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal seemed surprised by all the attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are other people in more difficult positions,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But radio listeners said they felt compelled to help Neal  
because of what she did for 7-year-old Terrance Varner. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal met the boy while living in her friend's public housing  
unit. He lived a few doors away with his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	The two became fast friends, and Neal began taking Terrance, who  
suffered from kidney disease, to dialysis three days a week so his 
grandmother would not miss work. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Neal learned she was a compatible donor and gave the  
boy one of her kidneys in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it. She hardly knew him,'' said a friend  
and former neighbor of Neal's. She chose not to be identified, 
because she said she also has had run-ins with Alexandria housing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was glad to talk about Neal. ``She's been a great  
friend,'' this woman said, adding that Neal did a lot for the 
residents at the public housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal and another friend started a program for children at the  
complex that featured Bible classes, homework help and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
	She misses the children, and plans to visit them soon. She seems  
particularly eager to see Terrance again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's having a difficult time with this -- with not seeing me as  
often,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two like to go to the playground, which Terrance couldn't do  
before the kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I never do anything else in my life, there's a little boy  
that I've helped,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely Neal will help others.  
</P>
<P>
	She is attending Northern Virginia Community College with the  
help of a federal Pell Grant for low-income people, and she says 
she thinks she wants to be a social worker when she graduates.

<HEADLINE> ITF: Court Made Right Call on Korda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Petr Korda lost his appeal of a ruling that  
he failed a drug test at Wimbledon in 1998, he was ordered to 
return more than $660,000 in earnings from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's writing the check right now,'' Deborah Jevans,  
executive director of the International Tennis Federation, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	If he's not, the ITF is prepared to go to court.  
</P>
<P>
	After his quarterfinal loss at Wimbledon, the 31-year-old Czech  
was selected for the ITF's random testing program. His two urine 
samples came back positive for the steroid Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda said he did not know how the substance got into his body.  
His claim was upheld by the Independent Appeals Committee, a 
three-member panel of medical, technical and legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF appealed that decision to the Court of Arbitration for  
Sport and won the case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the whole integrity of the sport and its  
anti-doping program,'' Jevens said. ``The Appeals Committee is 
truly independent of the ITF. The ITF administration has to prove 
there was a banned substance, a doping offense. The burden then 
moves to the player to show exceptional circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ITF lawyer Darren Bailey said the key to the ruling was the  
``exceptional circumstances'' clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``The panel didn't accept that the player didn't knowingly take  
the substance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion and once No. 2 in the  
world, was ranked No. 116 last June when he retired from tournament 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF, the international governing body of tennis, is joined  
in the anti-drug program by the ATP and WTA tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear that the burden of proof rests with the player  
to prove on the balance of probabilities how a banned substance 
came to be present in his body,'' Jevans said. ``This sets a clear 
precedent for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players must demonstrate the circumstance in which the offense  
occurred if they wish to seek a reduction in the mandatory 
sanctions based on the relevant degree of intent, fault or 
negligence on their part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Martin, president of the ATP Player Council, said the  
language of the rules has been ``very hazy,'' and that's going to 
be changed now that the Korda case is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing for Petr,'' he said. ``That's no way to  
finish your career. Despite the fact that he somehow allowed the 
substance into his body, I think everybody should have a little 
compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, a member of the WTA Tour board of directors,  
praised the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you test positive, you test positive,'' she said. ``He  
never came out and said why he thought it had gone into his system. 
It was always kind of a really gray area.''

<HEADLINE> ADHD May Be Overdiagnosed in Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Doctors may be overdiagnosing some groups of  
children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and 
overprescribing drugs to treat the condition, according to a new 
study published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers examined about 30,000 grade-school children in two  
districts in southeastern Virginia and found that pupils took drugs 
for ADHD in school at two to three times the expected rate, 
according to the study in the American Journal of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	ADHD is characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty in  
paying attention and keeping still. About 90 percent of patients 
take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to 
calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting 
stimuli. 
</P>
<P>
	ADHD has been estimated to affect 3 percent to 5 percent of  
school-age children nationwide, with less than 3 percent actually 
receiving medication, said Gretchen LeFever, a pediatric 
psychologist and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent  
of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD 
medication in school during the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe this many children have the specific  
brain-related problem called ADHD,'' said Ms. LeFever, assistant 
professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Center for Pediatric 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is a joint program of Eastern Virginia Medical School  
and Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFever said there probably are regions across the country  
with similar trends, indicating more research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very high rate of ADHD, by anyone's estimate,'' said  
psychologist Nadine M. Lambert of the University of California at 
Berkeley, a longtime ADHD researcher who was not involved in the 
current study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers reviewed records of pupils enrolled in  
the second through fifth grades in Portsmouth and Virginia Beach. 
They chose those two cities because they were the most diverse in 
southeastern Virginia, Ms. LeFever said. Portsmouth is a small, 
urban, poor, mostly black district while Virginia Beach is a 
larger, wealthy and mostly white. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found that ADHD medication was used by three  
times as many boys as girls and twice as many whites as blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the medication increased as children aged. By the fifth  
grade, 19 percent to 20 percent of white boys received ADHD drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Louis H. McCormick, a faculty member in the family medicine  
department at Louisiana State University medical school, said the 
study confirms what he has long suspected in his own 20-year 
practice, that kids are being overdiagnosed with ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that other conditions, such as anxiety or  
depression, can mimic the symptoms of ADHD, said McCormick, a 
family doctor in Franklin, La., who has given seminars on ADHD. He 
also is a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a blood test to evaluate ADHD. ADHD is an  
educated guess,'' McCormick said. ``... You need better data from 
all 50 states to really get a handle on the prevalence.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Makes Pledge to U.S. Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
accepting the endorsement of more than 100 farm activists, pledged 
Wednesday to open up foreign markets to U.S. agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is the cornerstone of international economic  
policy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to Iowa for the first time since his overwhelming  
victory last month in the Ames straw poll, Bush also picked up the 
endorsement of more than half the Republicans in the state 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Donning a green cap, the GOP presidential front-runner stood  
amid hay bales on a farm just outside Des Moines to spell out his 
trade proposals, an important issue in a state where the farm 
economy is sour. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would pressure European allies to lift a ban imposed  
on genetically altered commodities, and said it was a mistake to 
block China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese bargainers made ``drastic concessions'' that could have  
lowered tariffs and opened that giant market to foreign goods, Bush 
said. ``We should have taken them up on their offer,'' he said, 
while still acknowledging that he has concerns about China's record 
as a trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed President Clinton for not pressuring Congress to  
extend the ability of presidents to negotiate ``fast track'' trade 
deals and said the next president ``must reclaim the authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmers are expected to export $49 billion worth of  
commodities this year, down from the peak of $59.8 billion three 
years ago. The Agriculture Department is expecting only slight 
improvement in 2000. Economists blame the decline on the Asian 
economic crisis and a worldwide glut of grain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor said farmers should be allowed to divert farm  
income into tax-free savings accounts, which could be used to 
provide a cushion for notorious unstable farm income. That would 
allow farmers to build a cushion in good years to last through lean 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he would push for reform of a crop insurance  
system that many farmers can't afford, and touted his backing for 
ethanol, alcohol distilled from corn and mixed with gasoline into 
fuel backers say is environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is it good for the farmer, it is good for the quality  
of air all across America,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Bush was peppered with questions about  
whether he had used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there's no evidence he has actually used drugs, he  
refuses to flatly declare that he hasn't. The issue has gained 
momentum because Bush has ruled out drug use for only the past 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was a role model for children who might consider  
drug use, he said, ``I consider myself someone to share the wisdom 
of a mature adult. I'd say to children, 'You should not abuse 
drugs, you should not abuse alcohol.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush attended a fund-raising luncheon, where he raised $75,000  
for Republican legislative candidates, and took questions at a news 
conference, where he announced the endorsement of 31 members of the 
state's House of Representatives and 16 members of the Senate, a 
majority of Republicans in both chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	He then headed to a farm just outside Des Moines to accept the  
backing of farm leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush vowed to break open foreign markets, calling them  
``incredibly important in the long-range of the agricultural 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are an important issue in Iowa because farmers are  
suffering historic low commodity prices and many are near 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told the farmers he would bolster the farm economy by  
expanding trade but also would move to give immediate aid to those 
in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, the issue is hopefully going to be resolved  
by an administration passing, signing and distributing emergency 
aid,'' Bush said. ``Last year Congress passed an aid package that 
got bottled up in a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collecting a network of farm and legislative backers gives Bush  
an important organizational tool, bringing large numbers of 
community opinion leaders and organizers into his camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Key lawmakers said they were endorsing not only Bush's message  
but his character. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support the governor's message, we support the governor  
personally,'' said Iowa Senate President Mary Kramer, a West Des 
Moines Republican.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block To Buy Discount Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tax preparer H&AMP;R Block, which has been  
buying mortgage and accounting businesses, has agreed to buy the 
nation's fourth-largest discount broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Block said it is acquiring Detroit-based Olde Financial Corp.,  
the parent company of Olde Discount Corp., for $850 million in cash 
in its largest single acquisition yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The move takes the Kansas City-based H&AMP;R Block closer to its  
goal of becoming a one-stop financial-services center for 
mainstream families and provides it an opportunity to generate more 
revenue from its 16 million customers. That involves not only 
preparing taxes, but selling annuities and mutual funds, and doing 
financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many investment decisions spring from tax preparation,'' said  
Paul Mackey, a senior analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very wealthy go to trust departments, major investment  
firms, the Merrill Lynches of the world. But there's a huge mass 
market worried about retirement, educating kids. There's a huge 
opportunity to cross-sell to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olde Discount offers brokerage and other financial services at  
181 branch offices in 35 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Olde manages $37 billion in assets for 600,000 clients. The  
average age of those clients is 50, and they earn roughly $67,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Demographically, that's a nearly perfect match with H&AMP;R Block's  
top 4 million customers. They earn $65,000 annually and average 44 
in age. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block tax preparers can't provide information to the  
financial services arm -- and vice versa -- without a customer's 
permission, but analysts are optimistic about the possible results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Synergistically, it seems to work,'' he said. ``I think it  
will work big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, H&AMP;R Block tested what role it might have in the  
financial services market by establishing eight service centers in 
Indianapolis, Ind.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	That test will be expanded to include 70 additional stores where  
customers can get financial services -- as well as help preparing 
taxes. While that number is sure to increase, many other H&AMP;R Block 
offices in the country will continue to do just tax returns, Mackey 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Close To Buying $1.7M Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton are negotiating  
to buy a gracious mansion in a suburb of New York City, sources 
familiar with the couple's house hunt said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent two hours last weekend touring the  
Westchester County house, which was listed at nearly $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're involved in trying to secure that house, in trying to  
buy it,'' a source familiar with the negotiations said. ``They've 
made some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons offered something less than full price, but sources  
would not detail the quiet negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said the Clintons are not ready to  
announce any deal for the 110-year-old white colonial on a little 
more than an acre of parklike grounds. But sources said an 
announcement could come Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons liked the Georgian-style house in the town of  
Chappaqua, about an hour from Manhattan. The house is near golf 
courses and boasts a swimming pool, lush landscaping and an 
exercise room on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice house,'' Clinton said after touring it Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons squeezed the house-hunting trip between a week's  
vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and a fund-raising tour 
through the tony Hamptons area of Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The house apparently passed security muster this week. The  
Secret Service checked out the house with an eye to protecting 
Clinton when he is a private citizen. Former presidents have a 
small security detail. 
</P>
<P>
	The family needs a place to live when Clinton leaves the White  
House in January 2001. And if Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to run 
for the Senate seat now held by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, she must establish residency in New York before 
Election Day 2000.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Helps ABC Top Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There are no car chases or laugh tracks. Few  
special effects are ever used. And the host just sits around and 
asks questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, a prime-time game show has become the most popular  
television program this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The final night of ABC's two-week ``Who Wants To Be a  
Millionaire'' series drew 22.4 million viewers on Sunday, the most 
people to watch a show since the ``Home Improvement'' finale in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	The quiz show also virtually swept the top rated shows,  
capturing five of the top six slots. The only competition was from 
``60 Minutes,'' which finished No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millionaire'' host Regis Philbin jumped the gun when he  
announced on the air that the show would return for another 
two-week run in November, ABC spokeswoman Pat Preblick said. It's 
not clear whether it will return as a weekly series or an almost 
daily, two-week event, as with its first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely coming back in November,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	As is often the case with any success, rival networks who  
noticed the show's excellent ratings for the last two weeks are 
already talking about creating more prime-time game shows in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had ordered six episodes of a ``What's My Line'' remake to  
air this summer. But producers weren't able to complete the shows 
in time to make it on the schedule. Look for it next year, network 
spokesman Chris Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of `Millionaire' has opened everyone's eyes about  
what game shows can potentially do in the summer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And ABC is developing a game show about current events starring  
comedian Norm McDonald called ``Have I Got News For You.'' That 
project would share something else with ``Millionaire'' -- both 
would be remakes of British shows. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, ABC had a 7.3 rating and 13 share. CBS came in  
second with a 6.5 rating and 13 share, and NBC had a 6.3 rating and 
11 share. Fox had a 5.6 rating and 10 share, Nielsen Media Research 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN, which sought an advantage against its rivals by premiering  
some fall series early, saw it pay off with its first ratings 
victory against the WB since April 1998. UPN saw strong ratings -- 
by its standards -- with the debut of its wrestling show, ``WWF 
Smackdown!'' 
</P>
<P>
	UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share, the WB had a 2.2 rating and 4  
share and Pax TV had a 0.9 rating and 2 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 7.4 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.0 
rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.0 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 23-29, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire-Sunday,'' ABC, 14.0; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.0; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Thursday,'' ABC, 10.9; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Tuesday,'' ABC, 10.6; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Wednesday,'' ABC, 10.4; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Friday,'' ABC, 10.1; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 9.8; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 9.5; ``NFL Preseason Football: Denver 
at Green Bay,'' ABC, 9.1; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Ellen Foster,'' CBS, 
8.5; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 8.5.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Phone Co. Undercuts Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Little-known telephone service provider IDT  
Corp. is escalating the long-distance rate price war, undercutting 
the industry's giants with charges as low as 3.5 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hackensack-based company on Wednesday announced its new rate  
for domestic long-distance calls: 5 cents per minute any time, plus 
a $3.95 monthly fee. For customers who also sign up for IDT's 
dial-up Internet service, the 10-year-old company plans to offer 
rates as low as 3.5 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes two days after AT&AMP;T Corp., which has about 55  
percent of the $41 billion annual market for consumer long-distance 
calls, slashed its rates to 7 cents a minute for calls made any 
time; customers also must pay a monthly $5.95 fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint charges the same monthly fee, for rates of 5 cents a  
minute at night and 10 cents other times. MCI WorldCom offers 
weekend and weekday nighttime rates of 5 cents a minute, with 
daytime fees as high as 10 cents a minute, plus a monthly fee of 
$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Jonas, IDT's chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company intends ``to make it clear to consumers that they can 
do better with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven cents a minute is yesterday's news. Limiting 5 cents to  
evenings and weekends is also yesterday's news,'' Jonas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether IDT will significantly increase its base of 50,000  
long-distance customers was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications analyst Mel Marten, of Edward Jones in St.  
Louis, said that while the carriers are competing strictly on 
price, ``someone looking at basically a no-name company'' should 
consider whether it provides good customer service and gets bills 
right, information hard to get without some research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not many customers are going to go to the trouble of switching  
long-distance carriers to save a few pennies,'' Marten predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	But IDT spokeswoman Judy Fishof said that by midday Wednesday  
the company was ``getting overwhelmed with calls to get this 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like we don't even need to advertise,'' Fishof said.  
</P>
<P>
	IDT, formerly called International Discount Telecommunications,  
derives much of its revenue from routing calls overseas for other 
carriers. It is the No. 1 carrier of telephone calls via the 
Internet, with about 250,000 customers, and also sells prepaid 
calling cards. 
</P>
<P>
	While IDT only has about 900 employees and turned a modest  
profit of $6.4 million on revenues of $335 million last year, it is 
growing rapidly. For the three months ending April 30, its revenues 
hit $192 million, up 120 percent from a year earlier, and 
before-tax profits were $11.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marten predicted the price war will continue -- and the  
communications industry will keep consolidating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking out a few years, we're going to see a handful of  
companies offering a package of (telephone, wireless, cable and 
Internet) services across the country,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Strike Continues in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Eight-year-old Rochell Crowell had been looking  
forward to starting the fourth grade -- cracking open new textbooks, 
absorbing new lessons, making new friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Rochell found herself at the Pencil Palace Day Care and  
Nursery School when the first day of school in the nation's 
10th-largest city was canceled by a last-minute teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the teachers should go on strike,'' Rochell said  
Tuesday. ``We're going to have to stay in school and miss our 
summer break next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strike by all 7,200 teachers in this long-struggling  
district continued today and 172,000 students from kindergarten to 
12th grade were again told not to come to school. Negotiations were 
to resume this afternoon. School reforms proposed by the 
administration, such as the institution of merit pay, were among 
the contentious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't continue to let them know what we want, we'll  
never get what we need,'' special education teacher Jackie Ahmed 
said this morning as teachers gathered outside Cass Tech High 
School for more picketing. 
</P>
<P>
	For children, the strike means an extension of summer vacation --  
but working parents had to scramble to find something to fill the 
unexpected days off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us, but it's not good for the parents,'' said  
Shirley Howard, assistant director of the Pencil Palace, where 
Rochell was one of 15 new kids who joined about 40 regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pencil Palace charges $20 for each extra student per day,  
and for parents in its working-class neighborhood -- many raising 
their children alone -- that's a big additional expense, Howard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional children stretched the Pencil Palace staff thin.  
There were the usual activities, meals and play time, but no formal 
teaching -- it was enough just to keep watch over the brood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting to have a full house,'' said Patricia Watkins,  
an instructor at the nearby Considine Recreation Center, which 
offers a gym, arts and crafts and other activities -- a safe haven 
from the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's school union has not walked out since 1992. Under a  
1994 Michigan law, public school employees are barred from striking 
and can be fined a day's pay for every day they stay out. The law 
has never been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly that the teachers have found it necessary to have  
this job action,'' said Mark Sperling, principal of Cooley High 
School and the father of four children in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would very much like for them to be here. I would very much  
like for the students to be here, too. But I can understand that 
there are unresolved issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers are unhappy with proposals for a longer school day,  
merit pay and other reforms proposed by the district's new interim 
schools chief, David Adamany. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany took the place of the superintendent after the  
Legislature voted in March to replace Detroit's elected school 
board with one appointed by the mayor. Similar takeovers have 
occurred in Chicago and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking over a district beset by mismanagement and  
chronically low test scores, attendance and graduation rates, 
Adamany promised big changes. 
</P>
<P>
	He told parents and students that when they returned after their  
summer vacation, they would find schools had undergone $80 million 
worth of renovations, and new incentives to learning would be in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, however, objected to proposals to crack down on  
teacher absenteeism and to extend the school day by roughly 2 1/2 
hours, to 8 1/2 hours, and the school year by 10 days, to 191 days. 
They argue the real way to improve schools would be steps such as 
cutting class size. They also want salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the district is offering up to $3,000 a year in  
merit pay to teachers with good attendance, three years of 
satisfactory performance, advanced coursework and national 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	The union argued that the district's criteria are unclear and  
that merit pay could allow administrators to reward undeserving 
teachers and punish others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with some very complex, complicated matters,''  
said district negotiator Charles Wells. ``There's a number of 
things that both sides need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few other big cities have had teacher strikes in recent years.  
Teachers struck for one day in Seattle last year, for five days in 
Denver in 1994 and for one day in Boston in 1993, said Celia Lose, 
a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight-year-old Willie Cash, who is about to enter the third  
grade, was taking the Detroit strike in stride: ``I don't care,'' 
he said aloofly. ``I don't like school.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Clemency Offer Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is poised to hold hearings on  
President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 members of the 
nationalist Puerto Rican group FALN. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers maimed by bombs set by the militant group  
accused the president on Tuesday of trying to provide his wife's 
all-but-announced U.S. Senate campaign with a boost by pandering to 
New York's more than one million Puerto Rican residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a Senate race going on and I believe in my heart that  
votes in the Senate race have a lot to do with clemency being 
offered at this time,'' said New York City Police Det. Anthony 
Senft. Since being struck by an FALN bomb in 1983, Senft has 
undergone numerous operations to reconstruct his face and hip. He 
is blind in his left eye, has lost some of his hearing and the tip 
of one finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Senft and other officers held a similar press conference with  
New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir last week to decry 
Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga, said Tuesday the Senate Foreign  
Relations Subcommittee on Terrorism, which he heads, will hold a 
hearing on the issue in the coming weeks. Coverdell said the 
Clinton administration needs to explain its sudden departure from a 
long-standing U.S. policy against making concessions to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., who gathered law enforcement  
officials for a news conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday, 
urged the House of Representatives to also hold a hearing. Fossella 
said he will introduce a resolution condemning FALN clemency when 
Congress returns to Washington next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a travesty,'' Fossella said. ``Releasing terrorists  
before they have served their time is the wrong signal to send to 
the rest of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Hillary Rodham Clinton moving ever closer to entering the  
Senate race from New York her husband's clemency offer is fast 
developing into a political hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Fotis, executive director of the Law Enforcement Alliance of  
America, called the president's move ``clearly a ploy to garner 
support for Hillary Clinton's Senate bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Conservative Union began airing television  
advertisements lambasting the deal this week in the upstate New 
York area where the Clintons are vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-August, Clinton said he would commute the sentences of 16  
FALN members if they renounced the use of violence. Human rights 
officials have argued that the sentences handed out to the 11 men 
and five women were too harsh in light of their crimes. None were 
involved in any deaths, officials said. The sentences ranged from 
15 years to 90 years in prison 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the FALN -- the Spanish initials for Armed Forces of  
National Liberation -- staged some 130 bomb attacks on political and 
military targets in the United States between 1974 and 1983. The 
attacks left six dead and dozens more wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether the ultranationalists will go along with  
Clinton's requirement that they renounce violence to secure their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Connor, whose father was a banker killed by a FALN bomb in  
1975, said he was convinced the clemency offer was politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about it and thought about and I can't come to  
any other conclusion. It makes me sick. It's a betrayal'' Connor 
said. ``Is my father's life worth less than his (Clinton's) wife's 
election?''

<HEADLINE>  22 Umpires Told `Yer Out!' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For 22 umpires, baseball's final message to  
them Wednesday was: ``Yer out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Effective Thursday, 22 of baseball's 68 umpires will lose their  
jobs, stemming from their union's failed attempt earlier this 
summer to try to force an early start to negotiations for a new 
labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' union couldn't prevent their terminations but  
reached an agreement with baseball Wednesday night that guarantees 
their full pay and benefits for the rest of the year and their 
right to try to win their jobs back in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, owners agreed that all umpires on staff as of  
Friday -- there will be 71 of them -- are entitled to a postseason 
bonus, an amount that totals $1.42 million for 71 umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the umpires dropped their court fight and unfair  
labor practice charges against baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's a shame for baseball,'' said umpires union  
head Richie Phillips. ``Baseball will suffer from the loss of these 
enormously talented people that the commissioner's office has 
arbitrarily determined to hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five umpires who were hired by baseball in July will  
become permanent starting Thursday. Many of them have been vacation 
fill-ins from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they want to send a message that they don't care,''  
Phillips said of baseball's owners. ``They don't care about the 
quality of umpires. They don't care about all that experience not 
going on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 22 umpires will be out of work as of 6 a.m. EDT Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The resignations will stand and the new umpires are permanent  
employees,'' said commissioner Bud Selig. ``We are proud to have 
them on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American League umpire Mark Johnson had tears in his eyes as he  
walked out of the courtroom of U.S. District Judge J. Curtis 
Joyner, who had mediated the deal. It took 16 hours of talks 
between lawyers for baseball and the umpires' union to produce the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed, but there's still light at the end of the  
tunnel,'' he said. ``There are still other options and roads we can 
try to follow to try to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitration process will take several months at a minimum,  
meaning there's no way the 22 will be back this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Jerry Crawford said the umpires accepted the  
deal because it is ``the best we can come up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have the 22 guys' lives on the line,'' Crawford said.  
``It gives us a chance and fight another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Garcia, one of the game's most respected umpires who also  
will lose his job, said the union did not consult with the rest of 
the affected umps about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there wasn't any time. The lawyers come in, say  
this is what they've got. You have 15 minutes to decide,'' the AL 
umpire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those also losing their jobs are NL crew chiefs Frank  
Pulli and Terry Tata; the NL's Eric Gregg, known for his 
300-pound-plus frame; and Joe West, disliked by some players for 
his aggressive and sometimes combative attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said the deal would cost owners an  
additional $500,000 beyond what the umpires' labor contract called 
for. The union, however, must obtain a $100,000 bond and refund 
that amount if it loses the arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the union announced 57 umps were quitting, effective  
Sept. 2. They said then they feared a lockout and wanted to spark 
an early start to negotiations for a labor contract to replace the 
one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan collapsed when 27 umps, mostly in the AL, either  
failed to resign or quickly rescinded their resignations. Baseball 
then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted 22 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The union conceded that the 22 umps, whose resignations were  
accepted by the American and National leagues last month, have 
umpired their final games this season.	   In management's view, their departures are permanent. In the 
union's view, they'll only be gone until an arbitrator orders them 
rehired with back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason money was a key issue for the umpires. Some  
management lawyers had argued that the 22 being terminated could be 
denied those bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their labor agreement, each umpire gets an annual $20,000  
postseason bonus, whether they work postseason games or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's deal allows individual umpires to forgo the payment  
and give it to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' bitterness toward baseball was still evident after  
the agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed that when talks recessed Tuesday night, the sides  
had agreed that any of the 22 umps could work the rest of the year 
at Selig's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took that off the table this morning,'' said umpires'  
lawyer Susan Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged making the change but said it wasn't  
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put it in because they weren't going to  
work any more,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires sued Monday, hoping to get an injunction that would keep  
the 22 at work. Curtis scheduled a hearing for Tuesday, but instead 
pushed the sides to work out a deal.

	``We still have the 22 guys' lives on the line,'' Crawford said.  
``It gives us a chance and fight another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Garcia, one of the game's most respected umpires who also  
will lose his job, said the union did not consult with the rest of 
the affected umps about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there wasn't any time. The lawyers come in, say  
this is what they've got. You have 15 minutes to decide,'' the AL 
umpire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those also losing their jobs are NL crew chiefs Frank  
Pulli and Terry Tata; the NL's Eric Gregg, known for his 
300-pound-plus frame; and Joe West, disliked by some players for 
his aggressive and sometimes combative attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said the deal would cost owners an  
additional $500,000 beyond what the umpires' labor contract called 
for. The union, however, must obtain a $100,000 bond and refund 
that amount if it loses the arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the union announced 57 umps were quitting, effective  
Sept. 2. They said then they feared a lockout and wanted to spark 
an early start to negotiations for a labor contract to replace the 
one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan collapsed when 27 umps, mostly in the AL, either  
failed to resign or quickly rescinded their resignations. Baseball 
then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted 22 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The union conceded that the 22 umps, whose resignations were  
accepted by the American and National leagues last month, have 
umpired their final games this season.	   In management's view, their departures are permanent. In the 
union's view, they'll only be gone until an arbitrator orders them 
rehired with back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason money was a key issue for the umpires. Some  
management lawyers had argued that the 22 being terminated could be 
denied those bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their labor agreement, each umpire gets an annual $20,000  
postseason bonus, whether they work postseason games or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's deal allows individual umpires to forgo the payment  
and give it to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' bitterness toward baseball was still evident after  
the agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed that when talks recessed Tuesday night, the sides  
had agreed that any of the 22 umps could work the rest of the year 
at Selig's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took that off the table this morning,'' said umpires'  
lawyer Susan Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged making the change but said it wasn't  
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put it in because they weren't going to  
work any more,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires sued Monday, hoping to get an injunction that would keep  
the 22 at work. Curtis scheduled a hearing for Tuesday, but instead 
pushed the sides to work out a deal.

<HEADLINE> Indians' CF Lofton Comes Off DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians center fielder Kenny Lofton  
was activated from the disabled list Wednesday after missing most 
of the last month with an injured hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, who was back in the lineup for Wednesday's game against  
Anaheim, has appeared in just one game since July 27. He aggravated 
the injury in his only game back on Aug. 14 against Baltimore and 
returned to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny said he was ready, that he wanted to play and so that's  
it,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton is hitting .306 with six home runs and 24 stolen bases  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland also purchased the contract of starter Jim Brower from  
Triple-A Buffalo. Brower, 26, posted an 11-11 record with Buffalo 
this season and has never played in the major leagues before.

</P>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Matt Hartl, a key player on the 1995  
Northwestern football team that competed in the Rose Bowl, died 
Monday of Hodgkin's disease. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartl, a fullback who played primarily as a blocking back,  
helped the Wildcats become the first Northwestern squad to play in 
the Rose Bowl since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few months of the Rose Bowl, doctors discovered a tumor  
in his chest and diagnosed him with Hodgkin's disease, the same 
cancer his mother had beaten more than 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the 1996 season while undergoing treatment, he  
returned for the 1997 season, starting in 11 games for the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to play the next season but could not because the  
disease reoccurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartl's death came about two years after his mother died at the  
age of 45, her heart fatally weakened by the radiation treatments 
that helped cure her cancer.

	STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Alex Haynes, a pioneering auto industry  
executive who helped adapt seat belts for use by Ford Motor Co., 
died Monday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes worked as a member of the automaker's design engineering  
department in the 1950s. He was asked by Henry Ford II to look into 
seat belts after both men had heard of recent studies showing 
better crash survival rates if passengers stay in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes became known as ``Mr. Safety'' for his emphasis on making  
automobiles and trucks safer. But it was not yet a popular cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes, along with a team of international engineers, later  
helped develop the automotive division Hyundai Motor Co.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Sugarman, a sculptor whose colorful  
geometric aluminum designs were seen in museums around the world, 
died Aug. 25. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Sugarman was among the first to make  
large-scale sculptures that sat directly on the floor, not on a 
pedestal. He enjoyed having his artwork directly in the viewer's 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	His pieces were originally made of painted wood but he later  
switched to aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	He designed his first polychrome sculpture in 1959 and turned to  
large outdoor sculptures in 1970 beginning with one for the Xerox 
Corporation in El Segundo, Calif. Over the next two decades, he 
designed 30 more sculptures in both the United States and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Bird Stays With Pacers One More Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird never promised he would grow old  
with the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame player, who this week disclosed he has had  
periodic bouts of irregular heartbeats, will remain with the team 
at least one more season as coach, and he could stay with the team 
beyond that, although it might put Donnie Walsh out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of his contract. He hasn't come in and definitely  
told me that, but I've always known it was a three-year deal, and 
at the end of it he was going to make up his mind whether he wanted 
to coach or not,'' Walsh, the team's president, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Bird is watching his diet and taking medication  
to treat atrial fibrillation, which is not life threatening. He 
first experienced the irregular heartbeats late in his career with 
the Boston Celtics, and Walsh said he knew about the condition when 
he hired Bird in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, it was a matter of finding the level of the  
medicine in order to have his heart beat regularly. Once they found 
that, it seemed to me it was OK and he didn't have any more 
problems,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that Bird indicated to Walsh  
the 1999-00 season would be his last as coach. Walsh told The 
Associated Press he never talked to Bird specifically about that, 
although he has been aware of that possibility all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``In dealing with Larry for the last two years, from the very  
beginning, he only committed to coach for three years,'' Walsh 
said. ``But he's going to coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've also spoken to him about continuing on as general  
manager, president, whatever you want to call it. So we'll continue 
to talk about that. But we really haven't sat down and had a 
definite discussion about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was not available for comment Wednesday, and it was not  
clear if the possibility of his leaving coaching was tied to his 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Pacers in 1997, he acquired a minority  
ownership of the team and said he didn't expect to coach for long. 
Walsh said he would step aside if Bird wants his job in the front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd talk to the owners about that, I'd talk to Larry about  
that. If the best thing would be for me to leave the team, I'd 
leave the team. But we haven't really gotten into that yet,'' Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, who had never coached basketball at any level, was the NBA  
coach of the year in his first season with Indiana in 1998, when 
the Pacers were a franchise-record 58-24 and reached the Eastern 
Conference finals. Last season, shortened to 50 games by the league 
lockout, the Pacers were 33-17, won the Central Division 
championship and again reached the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's heart ailment was disclosed in an excerpt in this week's  
Sports Illustrated from his upcoming book, ``Bird Watching: On 
Playing and Coaching the Game I Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew there was something wrong with my heart,'' Bird  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would feel sudden exhaustion and his heart would  
start ``jumping around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was put on medication and told to exercise, eat healthy and  
drink alcohol only in moderation. But his condition worsened in the 
spring of 1997, right before he became the Pacers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little scared because it didn't seem like it was going  
away,'' Bird wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Wednesday he was aware of Bird's heart ailment.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Larry and I were talking about the job originally, he  
told me he was seeing a doctor and he had an irregular heartbeat or 
something like that and that he had to watch his diet, what he 
drank, what he ate, and that he would have to take medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is not as serious as ventricular fibrillation, which  
doctors believed caused the death of former Celtics teammate Reggie 
Lewis.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Treasury Bonds Fall Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bond prices fell for a fifth  
straight session Wednesday as a declining dollar unsettled bond 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32  
point, or by $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.08 percent from 6.06 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop of the dollar further below 110 Japanese yen has raised  
worries in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, a weaker dollar raises the price of imported  
goods, adding to inflationary pressures. If inflation heats up, the 
Federal Reserve may decide to raise interest rates for a third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates lower the value of existing fixed-income  
investments, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if traders are buying yen and selling dollars, they  
may be selling such dollar-denominated assets as U.S. government 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 
1/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.93 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.80 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.19 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 
percentage point to 4.99 percent. One-year yields were 5.27 percent 
as the discount held steady at Tuesday's late rate of 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.44 percent from 5.63 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 point to 114 5/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.79 percent from 5.78 percent late 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> DNA Test Clears Imprisoned Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORMVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 60-year-old man who spent 17 years in  
prison for rape became a free man Wednesday after a DNA test 
cleared him. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent H. Jenkins, also known by the Muslim name of Warith  
Habib Abdal, was convicted of robbing and raping a 23-year-old 
woman who was attacked in a Buffalo nature preserve in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer claimed improper police tactics prompted the victim  
to identify Jenkins months after the rape, even though she wasn't 
initially able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence testing that was completed in April showed  
virtually beyond any doubt that Jenkins was not the rapist. The 
technology was not available when he was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John T. Elfvin ruled Tuesday that Jenkins  
was wrongly convicted of the rape, opening the way for him to be 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, Jenkins said he had shut his feelings away  
for so long that he couldn't find any emotions to describe. ``It's 
hard to tell what grew around my heart and what I'm feeling,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins is the 61st inmate in the United States to be exonerated  
by DNA testing.

<HEADLINE> Cargill Cleared of Price-Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court cleared Cargill  
Inc. on Wednesday of taking part in an international conspiracy to 
fix the price of citric acid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate a  
damage suit by soft drink companies and other buyers of citric acid 
that was dismissed by a federal judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said there was no evidence Cargill, a leading  
processor and distributor of agricultural, food and industrial 
products, conspired with four other major firms that admitted 
agreeing to divide markets and set prices. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the four, Archer-Daniels Midland, pleaded guilty in 1997  
to conspiring to fix prices of citric acid and lysine, an animal 
food additive, and was fined $100 million, then the largest 
criminal antitrust penalty on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three companies, Haarman &AMP; Reimer, Hoffman LaRoche and  
Jungbunzlauer, also pleaded guilty to criminal charges. A number of 
employees have been prosecuted, including three senior ADM 
executives who were sentenced to prison in July. 
</P>
<P>
	All four companies also settled civil suits by bottlers and  
processors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cargill, based in Minneapolis, insisted it had no part in  
any conspiracy and simply followed a common practice of basing its 
prices on those of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Citric acid, with worldwide sales of $2 billion to $3 billion a  
year, is used to extend the shelf life of soft drinks, canned 
fruits and vegetables, detergents, drugs and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
	The four companies admitted agreeing between 1991 and 1995 to  
divide the market and raise prices by limiting sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill entered the market in the late 1980s and gained a 20  
percent U.S. share by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, a class action by Varni Brothers Corp. and the 7-Up  
Bottling Co. of Philadelphia, accused Cargill of joining the 
conspiracy in 1993 when it joined the European Citric Acid 
Manufacturers Association, a group to which the other four 
companies belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit noted that Cargill had announced in early 1992 that it  
planned to double its citric acid production capacity but announced 
in late 1992 that it would increase capacity only 50 percent. The 
suit also cited an FBI report in one of the criminal cases that 
quoted Barrie Cox, an ADM employee, as saying he had frequent 
discussions with Cargill's national sales director about citric 
acid bidding prices in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court largely discounted Cox's statements,  
saying they showed, at most, ``sporadic price discussions'' two 
years after Cargill was alleged to have joined the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill's scaling back of its expansion plans, and its posting  
of prices that largely mirrored those of its competitors, were not 
evidence of a conspiracy, said Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the 
3-0 ruling. He said Cargill's expansion of its U.S. market share 
came largely at the expense of ADM and Haarman &AMP; Reimer. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the companies that admitted fixing prices, ``none identified  
Cargill as a co-conspirator,'' O'Scannlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Therese Stewart, a lawyer for the companies that sued Cargill,  
said the court disregarded an earlier antitrust decision and made 
it extremely difficult to get a price-fixing conspiracy case to 
trial. Even ``evidence of actual agreement between an admitted 
conspirator and the defendant on certain bid prices'' isn't enough, 
she said, referring to the FBI's statement from Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Favretto, a lawyer for Cargill, said Cox's  
statements were never corroborated and were considered by the 
federal government in a four-year investigation that cleared the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is ``a further vindication of our position,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Grande Dame of Film Festivals Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Venice may be the grand old lady of film  
festivals, but she showed her mettle Wednesday, opening with a 
jumbo jolt of Hollywood star power and sheer sex appeal: Tom Cruise 
and Nicole Kidman in ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tale of a marriage rent by jealousy and sexual obsession is  
the final work of renowned director Stanley Kubrick. He died on 
March 7, just days after finishing the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kubrick's movie showed us the way to go,'' said director Emir  
Kusturica, the head of the Venice jury. ``He showed us that cinema 
is still art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a special tribute to Kubrick, Venice is screening ``Eyes Wide  
Shut'' at all three of its 56-year-old festival's main venues. And 
audiences in Venice and elsewhere in Europe get to see the original 
version -- without the digitally-added figures that obscured nudity 
in an orgy scene to appease the censors who rate films for American 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference before the premiere, Cruise, Kidman and  
producer Jan Harlan eulogized Kubrick as not only a great director, 
but also as a smart, sensitive, funny man. 
</P>
<P>
	Both actors said working with him was an all-absorbing  
experience -- ``thrilling, difficult, exhilarating,'' in Kidman's 
words. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick's works include ``Paths of Glory,'' ``Lolita,'' ``Dr.  
Strangelove (Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the 
Bomb), ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``The 
Shining'' and ``Full Metal Jacket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're 70 or 80 years old, we'll look back on this century  
and say: 'I was there with Stanley Kubrick,''' Cruise said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie had a mixed reception in the United States, where  
reviews ran the gamut from ``masterpiece'' to Pauline Kael's pithy 
``piece of crap.'' Neither the reviews nor its only modest box 
office success seemed to disappoint the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``His movies have life beyond the opening week. ... It's like a  
great novel: you're always going to go back and look at it,'' 
Cruise said. 
</P>
<P>
	European critics are likely to be far more reverential toward  
Kubrick's swan song than their American cousins, and the movie is 
expected to do well at the European box office. 
</P>
<P>
	Venice is an important European launching pad for Hollywood  
movies and the festival has a substantial complement of U.S. 
offerings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the American movies premiering there: ``Fight Club,''  
starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton; Woody Allen's ``Sweet and 
Lowdown,'' starring Sean Penn and Uma Thurman; and horror king Wes 
Craven's first conventional movie, ``Music of the Heart,'' with 
Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other offerings include ``Holy Smoke'' from the Oscar-winning  
director of ``The Piano,'' Jane Campion; ``Topsy-Turvy'' from Mike 
Leigh, director of the acclaimed ``Secrets and Lies;'' ``The Cider

and actor Antonio Banderas' directorial debut, ``Crazy in 
Alabama,'' starring his wife, Melanie Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival wraps up Sept. 11 with another nod to Hollywood -- a  
career achievement award for Jerry Lewis, revered by many European 
critics and film historians as a king of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick was honored with the career achievement award in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Gator QB Gets One More Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The injuries, suspensions, demotions  
and dilemmas are behind him. This year, Doug Johnson hopes to tap 
into the awkward lessons of his past to prove himself a worthy 
Florida quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He put his pro baseball career on hold, recovered nicely from  
the injuries that hampered him last year and stayed in Gainesville 
all summer to polish up on the offense he'll direct. 
</P>
<P>
	He also got coach Steve Spurrier's vote of confidence, something  
that had been inherently missing during his tumultuous sophomore 
and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson takes the field Saturday in No. 4 Florida's opener  
against Western Michigan, he'll take the first step in trying to 
win a title, the way Danny Wuerffel and Shane Matthews did earlier 
in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside is too painful to imagine. If Johnson fails, he'll  
be the first Florida quarterback not to lead the Gators to at least 
the Southeastern Conference championship since Spurrier arrived as 
coach in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would probably be the worst thing, leaving here without a  
championship,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think anything else could 
happen here that I haven't already gone through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tumult started in the summer of 1996, when the Tampa Bay  
Devil Rays drafted Johnson to play third base in their minor league 
system. Thus began a two-year struggle between Johnson, who claimed 
he couldn't be happy without testing his potential in baseball, and 
Spurrier, who appreciated Johnson's talent but questioned his 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be happy if I don't play both,'' Johnson said at one  
point, intensifying the disagreement between quarterback and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, Johnson started on opening day in 1997.  
The early results were scintillating. He threw seven touchdown 
passes in a half against Central Michigan. He threw three more in a 
victory over Tennessee and five against Kentucky, more or less 
outplaying both Peyton Manning and Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	By October, things had changed. A four-interception performance  
against LSU was followed by news that he had missed curfew before 
the game. He was suspended for the next game. His return was 
troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	At season's end, he injured his shoulder in the Citrus Bowl, a  
result of nearly two nonstop years of throwing both baseballs and 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he would not back down from his desire to play baseball.  
That desire, plus the injury, put him behind Jesse Palmer heading 
into last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson eventually worked his way into a rotation system with  
Palmer, then got the job when Palmer broke his collarbone in 
midseason. Johnson threw for 2,346 yards and 19 touchdowns, but 
couldn't engineer a victory over Florida State. Once again, Florida 
settled playing for leftovers instead of titles. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought about a shift in Johnson's outlook.  
</P>
<P>
	He committed to put baseball on hold in 1999. And even though  
Johnson suffered a broken fibula in the Orange Bowl, Spurrier stood 
behind him, taking the rare step of naming him the starter some 
eight months before the next season would begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy again, Johnson kept his promise, stuck around over the  
offseason and proved one of the team's hardest workers. It made an 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell this summer that he was putting a lot of focus  
into it,'' said receiver Darrell Jackson. ``Every day he was in the 
weight room. He was out here throwing every day, even when his leg 
was bothering him. He was hanging out more, laughing with the 
fellas and stuff, growing on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also became more of a master at the complex Florida offense,  
which is what Spurrier wanted all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a better player,'' Spurrier said. ``He  
understands the game now. He understands how important it is to 
know everything about the offense. He's matured quite a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also has a better understanding of his coach, what makes him  
tick and how to handle the sometimes frustrating relationship. 
Spurrier himself used to be the quarterback at Florida. He won a 
Heisman Trophy, but expressed to Johnson that his career didn't 
feel complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks he could've played even better, but he didn't have  
anyone pushing him like he needed to be pushed,'' Johnson said. 
``He's going to push me as hard as he can push me. He's going to 
get on me because he wants me to play the best I can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, he says, is all part of growing up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a firm believer that people have to fail before they  
succeed,'' Johnson said. ``Things happen for a reason. I can't 
control if I get injured. But I want this year to play out so that 
you can take everything that has happened to me, say I learned from 
it, and here's the final product.''

<HEADLINE> Ruby Dee Reflects on Life and Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the entertainment business, award-winning  
actress Ruby Dee would seem to have all the cards stacked against 
her: She's a woman in her 70s, she's black, and she has strong 
opinions about serious topics. 
</P>
<P>
	But her recent accomplishments -- a one-woman show and two  
best-selling books -- belie the notion that Hollywood is only for 
ingenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are as many ways to be an artist as there are ways to be  
a human being,'' she said. ``Success is like the air -- you can't 
hold it. I act and I write as an African-American, as a woman, as a 
member of the species. It's all from the perspective of being a 
human being in this maddeningly hurried, enticing community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress made her Los Angeles stage debut earlier this summer  
with ``My One Good Nerve: A Visit With Ruby Dee,'' directed by 
Charles Nelson Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Her one-woman show was performed first for friends, then on  
college campuses and at fund-raisers. It was presented off-Broadway 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't call it a play, because that means there's a  
beginning, middle and end,'' she said. ``All of the pieces are 
separate, each has its own tone. It gives voice to some 
perspectives that aren't often heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee, winner of Obie and Emmy awards, said she discovered her  
talent for humor through the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I surprised myself because most serious subjects have a twist  
of humor to them,'' she said. ``I had to learn from audiences that 
I was screamingly funny even if I'm contemplating the subjects of 
war, murder, rape, countries toppling, world changes. It's from the 
darknesses that I find humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her show is a cohesive compilation of some of the short stories,  
humor and poetry in her book of the same title, which was published 
by John Wiley &AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	She explained: ```My One Good Nerve' began with a pile of  
things, some that I wrote down as far back as a decade ago. It 
began with my making notes when I was asked to speak at funerals 
and special occasions. I didn't think of them as a book, just as 
things I had been thinking about for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book takes on all topics, including racism. One of the poems  
is a version of the nursery rhyme ``Jack and Jill.'' It goes like 
this: ``Jack and Jill moved up on a hill to get away from the 
slaughter. And things were going real swell until a minority 
married their daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee is working on a second volume of the book, which was No. 1  
on the Los Angeles Times' local best sellers list for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Ossie and Ruby: In This Life Together,'' published by  
William Morrow, chronicles her marriage to actor Ossie Davis. This 
book made the Times' Top 10 list at the same time as ``My One Good 
Nerve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee, 74, and Davis, 81, had been repeatedly asked to write a  
book about how actors can have a loving, long-term relationship. It 
wasn't until they neared the half-century mark in their marriage 
and were offered help in the writing that Davis agreed. Copies were 
given to guests at their 50th wedding anniversary party. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple produced the PBS specials ``Martin Luther King: The  
Dream and the Drum'' and ``A Walk Through the 20th Century.'' They 
had roles in the Spike Lee films, ``Do the Right Thing'' and 
``Jungle Fever.''

<HEADLINE> Toronto Film Festival Seeks Locals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This year, as always, the Toronto International Film Festival  
will devote its opening night ``gala'' to a Canadian release: Atom 
Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,'' to be released in the United States 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, dozens of other Canadian films will never make it  
across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto is now host to one of the industry's most important  
festivals, with local talent faithfully showcased. But Canada still 
has no real identity or appeal for filmgoers in the United States. 
Many artists -- Ivan Reitman, Jim Carrey, Dan Aykroyd -- end up in 
Hollywood, and the few successful ones who stay behind -- like 
Egoyan or David Cronenberg -- are rarely thought of as Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a Canadian film does come out in the states, it's just  
seen as some odd little independent film. `Where does it come 
from?' They place it as an odd little film from America,'' said 
festival director Piers Handling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, American films have conquered the marketplace. And  
there seems to be a lack of curiosity in the U.S. about other 
cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian releases are just one part of the festival, which runs  
from Sept. 9-18. The schedule includes more than 300 movies and 
some of the world's most celebrated directors: Chen Kaige, Charles 
Burnett, Woody Allen, Errol Morris, Jim Jarmusch, Steven 
Soderbergh, Aki Kaurismaki, Arturo Ripstein, Abbas Kiarostami and 
Manoel de Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' stars Sean Penn as jazz guitarist  
Emmet Ray and co-stars Uma Thurman and Samantha Morton. Morris, 
best known for the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' tells the 
story of a man obsessed with execution technology in ``Mr. Death.'' 
Burnett's latest, ``The Annihilation of Fish,'' is a romantic 
comedy starring Lynn Redgrave and James Earl Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Other highlights are program series on documentaries, emerging  
directors, contemporary Spanish films and African cinema. And back 
again are the beloved after-hours movies of ``Midnight Madness,'' 
with such titles as ``Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris,'' ``George Lucas 
in Love'' and ``Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festival's closing night film will be ``Onegin,'' an  
adaptation of Pushkin's classic narrative poem, starring Ralph 
Feinnes and directed by his sister, Martha Feinnes. The cast also 
includes Liv Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a film with star power,'' Handling said.  
``We were looking for something that wasn't too dark, or too 
troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 150 world and North American premieres, Toronto  
serves as a platform both for upcoming studio releases and for 
films still seeking a U.S. distributor. This year's prospects 
including ``Onegin,'' Paul Schrader's ``Forever Mine'' and 
``Gregory's Two Girls,'' Bill Forsyth's sequel to his beloved 
comedy, ``Gregory's Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto festival doesn't have the glamour of Cannes or the  
mountains of Sundance, but because screenings are public the 
industry values the chance to show films to a ``real'' audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sundance is basically for insiders and skiers,'' said Mark  
Urman, co-president of Lions Gate Releasing, which will have 
several movies at Toronto. ``And Cannes is basically for the 
industry and French people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response at Toronto is comparable to what would happen if  
the film played at a theater near you. The film is dealt with in a 
`thumbs up, thumbs down' way. You get a very strong reading of how 
a film will fare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. market, Canada would seem to have two major  
advantages over other foreign countries: mostly English-language 
movies and a culture at times so similar that you don't know the 
story is based in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you look at films imported from Britain, it's their  
very exoticism that makes them appealing,'' said Urman, whose 
company was the U.S. distributor for last year's opening film at 
Toronto, ``The Red Violin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Canadians suffer both from too much familiarity and too  
much foreignness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian movies that make it to the U.S. often have an  
international focus. ``The Red Violin'' was set all over the world 
and starred an American actor, Samuel L. Jackson. Egoyan's ``The 
Sweet Hereafter,'' which opened the 1997 festival, starred the 
British actor Ian Holm and was based on a novel by American author 
Russell Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fall, Lions Gate will release another movie shown at  
Toronto in 1998, the drama ``Last Night.'' Although a ``Canadian'' 
production, this story of a city waiting for the end of the world 
doesn't use Toronto itself as a character, as would surely happen 
if the setting were New York City or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are passing references to the people living in Toronto  
and some of the accents are Canadian, but in every other regard it 
could be any other major metropolis,'' Urman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain blandness about Toronto,'' Handling said.  
``It's why Americans like to shoot movies up here; they can make it 
look like any city they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The local community has long supported the festival, with  
downtown theaters making screens available for everything from 
mainstream releases to such obscurities as the Canadian film 
``Pamplemousse'' and Japan's ``The Excitement of the Do-Re-Mi-Fa 
Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when the festival is over, theaters will go back to what  
they usually show: American movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the idea of using the same screens that usually show  
Hollywood movies,'' Handling said. ``We don't marginalize our 
movies. You can see an African film or an Iranian film where the 
screen is big and you can have popcorn. And with Canadian movies, 
it's a chance to give audiences a sense of pride about their 
culture.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper's Lawyer Softens Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Master P's attorney has backed off  
accusations that the rapper and his entourage were denied 
membership to an exclusive country club because of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Edwin Hawkins was quoted in the current issue of Time  
magazine saying that the denial by the Country Club of Louisiana 
was ``just plain racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins softened his stance somewhat in an interview with The  
(Baton Rouge) Advocate on Monday. ``I don't want to go as far as I 
did in Time magazine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he continues to believe that Master P's group was  
treated differently because they are black. ``Whatever I said that 
day, I meant in my heart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Juban, president of the club's board of directors, denied  
that Master P, whose real name is Percy Miller, was the target of 
racism. ``We have minority members here,'' he said. ``This is the 
most open club I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Master P, who owns the successful No Limit Records, paid $2.6  
million for five houses in the gated community beside the club and 
applied for membership. One neighbor is former Gov. Edwin Edwards, 
who said he sees no reason why Master P shouldn't be allowed to 
join the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must be one hell of a golfer and they don't want to be put  
to shame by his golf score,'' Edwards quipped.

<HEADLINE> New Child Car-Seat Rules in Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first in a three-year series of steps to  
improve child car-seat safety began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter head protection standards went into effect at midnight  
Tuesday, meaning that most new seats now will have to be equipped 
with a tether strap that anchors the top of the seat more securely 
so children are thrown about less in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is the first phase of a federal plan to create a  
universal, easy-to-use children's seating system. The goal is to 
eliminate confusion among parents that results in incorrect 
installation of up to 80 percent of car seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Once all autos and seats have the new system, the government  
estimates up to 50 lives will be saved and 3,000 injuries prevented 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should not abandon the hundreds of thousands of child  
seats already are in use, government officials say. Seat 
manufacturers and automakers are offering kits to add the tethers 
and new attachment points to existing seats and cars for parents 
who want them. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe existing seats are safe when installed properly,  
but that the new regulations are needed to simplify that task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, it varies from seat to seat and vehicle to vehicle  
what type of restraint system you have,'' said Steve Oesch, senior 
vice president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an 
industry-backed research group that supports the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system will make child restraints safer, simpler and more  
secure,'' said Dr. Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, the federal agency issuing the new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, the safety administration is requiring that  
automakers do their part by beginning to equip new cars with anchor 
points for the top tether straps. 
</P>
<P>
	In most sedans, the anchors will be on the shelf between the  
rear seat and rear window. In minivans, the anchors will be on the 
floor behind the seat. Eighty percent of vehicles sold in the 
United States for the 2000 model year must have the anchors, with 
the percentage increasing in succeeding years. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sept. 1, 2002, car seat makers also must add two more straps  
to attach the seat bottom to a car without using its seat belt 
system. Automakers must equip all new vehicles with standardized 
attachment points for both the top and bottom straps by that date 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. plans to equip all its 2000 models with the top  
tether mounts. Its Windstar and new Focus models also will come 
with the lower mounts. A government official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said Volkswagen may also get a head start by 
announcing that all three attachment points will be standard 
equipment on its 2000 model year Beetles. 
</P>
<P>
	Car accidents are the leading killer of children ages 14 and  
under. With dozens of seats being offered to protect infants and 
toddlers, parents have been frustrated by the difficulty of finding 
the right one for their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobiles also come with a wide variety of seats and seat-belt  
designs, adding to the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new head protection regulation reduces the amount a child's  
head can move in a 30 mph crash from 32 inches to 28 inches. While 
some existing seats can meet the stiffer requirement without a 
tether strap, most cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the tether and anchor system was proposed as a means  
of standardizing seat installation. 
</P>
<P>
	Child seats now cost from $40 to $220. The highway safety  
administration, in a study last year, estimated that a universal 
latching system would increase the cost by $10 to $65 per seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety administration said people with questions about the  
new system should call their seat's manufacturer, the maker of 
their automobile or NHTSA's auto safety hot line at 888-DASH-2-DOT. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bradley Appeared in Cold War Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a lone railroad track stretches across the  
screen, then splits into two, a man ponders the path he will 
follow. ``Am I deluding myself about how much any one person can 
help another 50 people?'' he muses. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-and-white images and monotonous narration are from a  
1968 U.S. propaganda film that would be little more than a Cold War 
relic -- except for the fact that its subject and star, Bill 
Bradley, is now running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old Young Man,'' a United States Information Agency film,  
boosted Bradley before the world as a symbol of American pluralism, 
idealism and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	The film was translated into dozens of languages, with copies  
dispatched to U.S. diplomatic posts in places like Ankara and 
Katmandu, Rangoon and Jakarta, Kabul and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a memento of a bygone era in international relations, in  
which Bradley played only a bit part. It also serves as evidence of 
the expectations that Bradley, a Rhodes scholar and basketball star 
before he entered politics, has carried since his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw in him a kind of wisdom beyond his years, which is where  
the title of the movie came from,'' recalled Michael Ahnemann, who 
produced ``Old Young Man'' for the USIA. ``Most people I 
interviewed in the film said, 'Oh yeah, he's going to be president 
some day.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Author John McPhee, who had profiled Bradley in the New Yorker  
in 1965, appears in the film remarking on the sky-high expectations 
Bradley is carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in some ways a personality before becoming a person,''  
McPhee says. ``I'd be disappointed to see him not become a leader. 
That's where his talent is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was just 24 when filming began in 1968, shortly after he  
entered the National Basketball Association. He was already a star 
from his college basketball exploits at Princeton University and at 
the 1964 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1969 memorandum from the USIA, on file with the film at the  
National Archives in College Park, Md., says ``Old Young Man'' 
struck themes including America's ``commitment to a better 
society'' and the ``dynamics of a pluralistic society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camera follows Bradley to Harlem, where he was active with  
an outreach effort for black youths. Discussing the book ``Manchild 
in the Promised Land'' -- a real-life account of poverty and 
desperation in New York slums -- Bradley prompts one black teenager, 
``Lots of these scenes are familiar to you, huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on a New York street with a microphone, Bradley asks  
startled passersby: ``Do you think you're happy? What do you think 
makes you happy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley is presented as a thoughtful and compassionate  
American, he also at times seems brooding and indecisive -- even 
``melancholy,'' said Ahnemann. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bradley opted not to run for president in 1992, Ahnemann's  
son told him, ``Just like in the film, dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's reluctant to make the final decisions about things. The  
movie is full of that,'' Ahnemann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film was a departure from the standard USIA documentary that  
bluntly drove home its pro-America propagandist message. 
</P>
<P>
	George Stevens Jr., director of the USIA's motion picture and  
television service from 1962 to 1967, had invited young filmmakers 
like Ahnemann to create USIA documentaries that, while still 
propaganda, were more artistic and subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old Young Man'' reappeared occasionally through the years in  
conjunction with Bradley's political career. Bradley's presidential 
campaign culled the film, which had been released by the government 
into the public domain, to obtain archival footage of the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said the film ``shows the  
consistency of themes that he has cared about through his life -- 
discipline and hard work, caring for others, passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahnemann, who went on to a successful career in film and  
television and remains friendly with Bradley, is delighted that the 
Old Young Man himself is finally running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``My contemporaries hated the film,'' Ahnemann said. ``I thought  
a lot of Bradley came through, and I thought that was a fairly good 
accomplishment. But no one at that time saw that, man! Everybody 
said, 'This is a straight movie about a square guy.'''

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Sign Goaltender Thibault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks have signed goaltender  
Jocelyn Thibault and two defensemen to multi-year contracts, the 
team announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks acquired Thibault from the Montreal Canadiens  
last November, along with Dave Manson and Brad Brown in exchange 
for Jeff Hackett, Eric Weinrich, Alain Nasreddine and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thibault was originally the first round pick of the Quebec  
Nordiques in the 1993 entry draft. He was traded to Montreal after 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Thibault had a 21-26-5 record with four shutouts  
for the Blackhawks. He also became just the fifth goalie in NHL 
history to win his 100th career game before the age of 25. He 
joined Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur, Tom Barrasso and Grant Fuhr in 
that elite club. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks also signed deals with Brown and Jamie Allison,  
both restricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown played in six games with the Blackhawks last season,  
scoring one goal, with seven assists and 205 penalty minutes. 
Allison, acquired last season in a trade with the Calgary Flames, 
appeared in 39 games with the Blackhawks with two goals and two 
assists.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices May Drop After Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the Labor Day weekend approaches, a series  
of sharp gasoline price spikes that have pinched motorists' 
pocketbooks since March appear to be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because crude oil prices appear to be stable and other  
pressures that helped push gas prices upward, such as refinery 
breakdowns and higher summertime demand, are waning. 
</P>
<P>
	After the holiday weekend, prices will begin to drop, said Bill  
Berman, a petroleum industry analyst and publisher of the Price 
Pump Report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will drop more quickly on the East Coast because there's  
more price competition. It will drop more slowly as you go west of 
the Mississippi because there are fewer refiners and fewer gasoline 
stations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since late June, the average price of gasoline nationwide  
climbed 11.5 cents per gallon to $1.31, according to an Aug. 20 
Lundberg Survey. The increase followed an 8.5-cent jump in March 
and a 14-cent spike in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	California motorists, who use more costly blends reformulated  
fuel to reduce air pollution, were hit even harder. The average 
price rose 14 cents per gallon during the period, according to the 
Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation may already be changing. There are signs that  
wholesale prices in some markets have begun to fall in anticipation 
of weaker demand, said analyst Trilby Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a substantial downward move,'' she said. ``There's  
more likelihood for weakening pump prices than there is for rises, 
assuming crude oil prices do not rise further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier increases in the retail market prompted the Federal  
Trade Commission to launch a formal investigation of West Coast 
prices. Attorneys general in California and Nevada are cooperating 
in a separate probe of gas prices in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies have blamed the increases on market forces,  
including refinery problems and cuts in world production. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest driving force of gas prices increases have been  
crude oil price increases, which have doubled since the first of 
the year,'' said Paul Oves, a spokesman for Tosco Marketing Co., a 
subsidiary of oil refiner Tosco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside the West Coast, demand patterns have been pretty  
typical of the driving season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanations haven't placated motorists who are paying  
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	At Castaic in north Los Angeles County, Jesus Benavidez of  
Norwalk, Calif., filled two personal watercraft at a Shell station 
where prices for self-serve gas ranged from $1.599 to $1.779. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going higher and higher, you just can seem to get a  
break,'' Benavidez said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like other holiday travelers, Benavidez was prepared to  
spend more to enjoy his trip. Twenty dollars worth of gas for the 
watercraft would give him four hours of riding time on Lake 
Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more fun you want to have, the more gas you've got to  
get,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices began to climb after the Organization of Petroleum  
Exporting Countries announced in February that they would reduce 
production by 2.7 percent, or 2.1 million barrels a day. Greater 
demand in Asia, where South Korea, Thailand and other countries are 
emerging from recessions, also has boosted pressure on crude 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the problem was made worse by a series of  
accidents that forced four refineries to halt or reduce production, 
cutting supplies by about 15 percent. At the peak of the shortfall 
in April, prices reached $1.99 in parts of San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California market is just historically, chronically,  
always tighter than the rest of the country,'' said John Cook, an 
oil industry analyst with the Department of Energy. ``Refining 
capacity is just adequate to meet seasonal demand requirements in 
California under normal circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell during May, but began to climb again in late June as  
the July Fourth holiday approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices should begin to decline again after Labor Day, analysts  
said. But that depends on crude oil prices remaining stable. OPEC, 
so far, appears unwilling to rock the boat. Following a meeting 
last weekend in Venezuela, oil ministers from that country, Saudi 
Arabia and Mexico reaffirmed pledges to continue with current 
production levels until next March. 
</P>
<P>
	``If driving is declining -- and driving is most likely to  
decline -- then the price of gasoline is going to decline with it,'' 
said Berman. ``Barring unforeseen events, gasoline prices will peak 
Labor Day weekend and probably will drop off after that.''

<HEADLINE> Lost Mozart Score Found in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian musicologist has discovered what  
appears to be a long lost work by Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothea Link came across the passage, scored for strings and  
soprano, in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35 bars by the great composer precede the Mozart aria  
``Vado, ma dove?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new material is not in Mozart's own hand, the signs  
point almost conclusively to his authorship, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the evidence that this is fully by Mozart is very  
strong,'' said Stanley Sadie, a British musicologist and Mozart 
specialist who is an editor for the New Grove Dictionary of Music 
and Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Link, who has spent the last year teaching at Dalhousie  
University in Halifax, believes that Mozart wrote ``Vado, ma 
dove?'' for the singer Luisa Villeneuve in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
	It was intended to replace one of Villeneuve's arias in ``Il  
Burbero di buon cuore,'' an opera by Vicente Martin y Soler, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Substitute arias, as they were called, were standard practice in  
Mozart's day, when established opera singers were entitled to arias 
that suited their voices.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Eat More Fruits, Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sunday dinners in the South, where chicken  
is skillet-fried and collards and green beans are seasoned with ham 
hocks and fatback, are getting healthier through another 
institution -- the black church. 
</P>
<P>
	A church-based nutrition program got parishioners to eat better  
-- an extra fruit and vegetable serving every day, says a two-year, 
federally funded study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It might not sound like a huge improvement, but cancer  
specialists say any increase in fruit and vegetable consumption is 
important in cutting Americans' risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get a whole serving increase through a program like this is  
just fabulous,'' said Colleen Doyle, a nutrition program 
coordinator with the American Cancer Society. ``It's very 
encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in September's edition of the American  
Journal of Public Health. Older parishioners and frequent 
churchgoers showed the most improvement in their eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute, which funded the study, says  
eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day helps prevent 
cancer and other diseases. A serving is just half a cup of fruit or 
cooked vegetables, a cup of salad or a 6-ounce glass of fruit juice 
-- 100-percent juice, not sugared ``juice drinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But fewer than a third of Americans follow that dietary advice.  
And black Americans have significantly higher rates of some cancers 
than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	So North Carolina researchers, citing the high percentage of  
blacks who attend church, decided to study whether church-related 
activities could change parishioners' eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Congregations involved in Black Churches United for Better  
Health planted gardens outside their sanctuaries, serving the 
vegetables at after-church suppers. Some pastors even preached a 
pro-health message from the Bible, which says the body ``is a 
temple of the Holy Ghost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooking classes, lessons on canning and freezing fresh produce  
and brochures on good eating were offered, as well as cookbooks and 
help in modifying favorite family recipes to be more healthy. 
Participating churches received money to help buy fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,519 parishioners surveyed at the start of the study in  
1994 ate an average of only 3.7 servings of fruits and vegetables a 
day. At the end of the 20-month program, those in churches chosen 
to participate in the program ate 0.85 more servings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who attended church more than once a week ate 1.3 more  
servings compared to those attending church less than once a month, 
who ate only 0.1 serving more. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill,  
N.C. State University, Duke University and the state Health 
Department selected the churches from 10 rural eastern North 
Carolina counties with minority populations of at least 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are working on two similar programs designed to  
encourage church members to eat more fiber, exercise and receive 
cancer screenings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lay leaders such as Patricia Pratt of Friendship Baptist Church  
in Rose Hill helped encourage congregations to serve tomatoes, 
squash and other items from the church gardens. Fruit juice was 
substituted for sodas and sweet tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before this program, we had fried chicken and barbecue,'' said  
Mrs. Pratt. ``Now we have baked chicken. It has made a difference. 
My diet and my husband's diet are different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lead researcher Marci Campbell believes other religious groups  
could improve their eating habits by following the lead of the 
black churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Partnering with the church is an effective way to improve  
health,'' said Campbell, a nutrition professor with the University 
of North Carolina medical and public health schools in Chapel Hill. 
``God is more motivating than doctors.''

<HEADLINE> Williamsburg Program Draws Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A Colonial Williamsburg program that  
re-creates the harsh treatment of slaves is drawing fire from black 
re-enactors who say they deserve better treatment on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a group of black employees wrote a letter to the  
Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's education division saying they 
feel typecast as slaves and deprived of the opportunity to advance. 
The employees also said they are underpaid and treated 
insensitively. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent staff shuffling only heightened their unhappiness, they  
told the Daily Press of Newport News in a story published 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as though with each restructuring, only one black at  
a time is promoted,'' the letter read. ``This leads us to believe 
that those in charge of programming are afraid if they promote too 
many of us, they won't have any 'slaves' to make their programs 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Elliott, Colonial Williamsburg's vice president of  
education, said the foundation is aware of the employees' concerns 
and has been meeting with staff since May to work things out. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation this year added depictions of the treatment  
blacks received to its re-enactments as part of a program called 
``Enslaving Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program placed costumed re-enactors in the role of slaves.  
Black employees portrayed runaways, preachers and slaves, and white 
employees sometimes portrayed slave masters, their treatment of 
blacks often leaving visitors shocked.

<HEADLINE> UPS Driver Sues Teamsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A United Parcel Service driver who was beaten and  
stabbed by Teamsters because he worked during a 1997 strike is 
suing the union and 10 officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Wednesday in Broward County on behalf of  
Roderick and Earthly Carter, names the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters Local 769, and 10 officials, including then-president 
Anthony Cannestro, Sr. The suit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Roderick Carter, a former Miami Hurricanes linebacker, was  
pulled from his UPS truck and attacked on Aug. 7, 1997, during a 
two-week national strike. Six striking UPS workers participated in 
the beating, and one, Benigno Rojas, stabbed Carter six times with 
an ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was unable to work for nearly two months after the  
attack. The union bailed out the attackers, all of whom were 
convicted in criminal court. Rojas served time in jail for 
aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, Mr. Carter is not comfortable at work, he doesn't  
feel safe at home, and he constantly is concerned for his two young 
daughters and his wife,'' said Joseph Hillock, spokesman for the 
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which filed the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the complaint, the day before the attack Carter  
told a television reporter he wasn't striking because he needed to 
support his family. That evening, the Carters received several 
hang-up calls and one threatening call, all of which were traced to 
Cannestro's home. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit charges Cannestro and union officials Rolando Pina and  
Joshua Zivalich with civil conspiracy for allegedly condoning the 
attack. The suit also names Anthony Cannestro Jr., Rojas and the 
others involved in the attack: Marcelo Rodriguez, Orestes Espinosa, 
Angel Mielgo, Werner Haechler and Adrian Paez, 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton Orr, labor counsel for Local 769, declined comment  
because he had not seen the complaint.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock average closed 2.1 percent  
higher Wednesday on increasing talk about government intervention 
to stop the dollar's decline. The U.S. dollar continued to fall 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 365.92  
points, at 17,802.48. On Tuesday, the average closed down 482.41 
points, or 2.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.22 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.96  
yen from its level of 110.18 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also 
below its late New York level of 109.59 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, talk of intervention in the currency market  
helped export issues gain. Bank stocks, hard hit Tuesday, also rose 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen would help exporters by making their products less  
expensive abroad, and thus more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher the yen goes, the stronger the collective market fear  
of intervention becomes, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern is mounting in other quarters, too. On Wednesday  
afternoon, Hubert Neiss, director of the International Monetary 
Fund's Asia and Pacific department, said in a speech in Tokyo that 
``a further rapid appreciation of the yen could well put an end to 
the recovery, as has happened before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neiss called this ``an important risk,'' the clearest signal yet  
of growing concern about the surging yen in the international 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 84.85  
points, or 0.8 percent, to close Tuesday at 10,829.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 39.22 points, or 2.69 percent, to 1,496.24. 
The TOPIX closed down 40.92 points, or 2.73 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged up in Tokyo from its New  
York level early in the session after some players bought back the 
greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	But currency traders were less optimistic about Bank of Japan  
intervention, and drove the dollar lower after seeing no signs of 
buying by the central bank to support the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar last traded below 110 yen in Tokyo on Jan. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.08 yen, up from  
116.06 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8650 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9150 
percent, driving its price up to 100.29 yen from 99.87 yen.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Million Youth March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Million Youth March can return to Harlem  
once again, despite the hate-filled speeches and violence that 
marked the event in its first year, a federal judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Denny Chin overruled city officials who had  
denied organizers of the march a permit. Officials cited the 
anti-white and anti-Semitic slurs of the march's main backer, 
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, and the violence that broke out last year 
as their reasons for blocking the march. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chin said the city was at least partly to blame for the  
chaos that erupted at the close of the initial rally. Twenty-eight 
people were injured, including 16 police officers, when officers 
moved in to shut down the event moments after the court-ordered 
ending time had passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scenes of demonstrators throwing barricades and other  
objects are disturbing, but also disturbing is the spectacle of 
dozens of police officers in riot gear moving in on the stage, with 
a helicopter swooping overhead ... when the rally was indeed about 
to conclude,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling Tuesday, the judge suggested the city show more  
restraint on Saturday. He said the message of hate some rally 
speakers champion was not enough to overcome constitutional 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right to free speech ... applies not only to politically  
correct statements but also to statements with which we may 
disagree and, indeed, abhor,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's attorney, Michael Hess, immediately appealed, and a  
hearing was scheduled for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	If the city loses its fight, it will be the second time  
organizers have won a court battle to hold the event in Harlem. 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called Chin's ruling unreasonable and 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an example of a judge putting his head in the sand,''  
he said, ``and somehow being so overwhelmed with the inability to 
make a distinction between a proper First Amendment demonstration 
and an excuse for violence that he really just can't see the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated last year's crowd at 6,000, while organizers  
claimed a turnout of 300,000. Organizers say they are expecting up 
to 20,000 people this year, although a number of black elected 
officials in Harlem are urging people to stay away from the rally, 
centered at 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The turnout last year was pathetic,'' said Hess, the city's  
attorney. ``This year's turnout will be even more pathetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the city was pleased it was not ordered to grant a  
parade permit sought by demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory. Victory. Victory,'' said Malik Z. Shabazz, a lawyer  
and organizer of the rally, who stood outside the federal 
courthouse in Manhattan after the ruling. ``We are coming in peace 
and safety and security.''

<HEADLINE> Kevin Bacon Ready To Be Cut Loose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Bacon is an accomplished actor who has  
worked with Oscar winners and top directors. He is also a dedicated 
family man with two children, and sings and writes songs with his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, when you hear his name, does the 1984 film ``Footloose''  
still come to mind? 
</P>
<P>
	That's a typical reaction, said Bacon, who has mixed feelings  
about his breakthrough role as Ren McCormack, a city kid who moves 
to a small town where dancing has been outlawed. (One reviewer 
wrote: ``Bacon's charisma sparks innocuous film.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be better known for something that I've done in  
the last 15 years. It would have been nice if something had taken 
its place,'' he said during an interview at a Manhattan hotel. 
``But by the same token, I don't want to look a gift horse in the 
mouth. It was an important movie for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since ``Footloose,'' Bacon's two dozen film credits include  
``JFK,'' ``A Few Good Men,'' ``The River Wild'' and ``Apollo 13.'' 
He is most proud of ``Murder in the First,'' a 1995 film that also 
starred Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and William H. Macy. 
</P>
<P>
	His new film is ``Stir of Echoes,'' a psychological thriller  
that follows Bacon on a supernatural journey after he is hypnotized 
at a neighborhood party. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that attracted Bacon to the role was director David  
Koepp's advice to view the part as a great character instead of a 
classic leading man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think part of the reason I have not always been as  
successful as a leading man is that the characters just haven't 
been that well written,'' Bacon said. ``A lot of times, people will 
focus more of their energy on bad guys or funny best friends, and 
the hero gets the short end of the stick in character 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Bacon said, he can't always see the flaws of a  
character or a story until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing a picture for the first time is always a real shock. I  
try to, if I can, get in and see some dailies and cut footage just 
to see bits and pieces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the period leading up to the release of a new film that is  
the most stressful, he said. There are the interviews, the buzz and 
opening weekend box-office numbers to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bacon won't read the reviews -- at least not of his own  
work. He stopped about 10 years ago, saying he wasn't getting any 
constructive suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Bacon and his brother Michael formed the  
Bacon Brothers. The inspiration for the band's songs are often 
real-life events, explained Bacon, dressed in a black button-down 
shirt with jeans and looking younger than his 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been an actor, I have done a million interviews and  
profiles for magazines, and while I try to be honest about my 
feelings about things, I think the most revealing thing I've ever 
done is the lyrics of a song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting There'' is the Bacon Brothers' new CD.  
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said he can't decide whether he prefers acting or music.  
But he likes the team attitude that comes with being in a band. 
Acting in films can be ``oddly isolating,'' he said, while in the 
band, everyone has a necessary and complementary role. 
</P>
<P>
	He particularly likes working with his brother because there is  
a high degree of trust and support. They share lead vocals, and 
sibling rivalry only surfaces when it comes to how many songs each 
has written. Right now, Bacon is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel blessed that I've been able to bring music into my  
life, even if no one ever heard of the band, it's such a blessing 
to be able to play -- to get together with the guys and play. It's 
kind of a magical experience when it's working right and it's 
grooving.''

<HEADLINE> Coach Robinson Ready at UNLV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENTON, Texas (AP) -- When John Robinson coached at Southern Cal,  
the annual goal was to win the Rose Bowl. As he prepares for his 
first game with UNLV, school supporters will settle for a victory 
of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, out of a job last season after being fired by USC,  
returns to the college sidelines Thursday night when the Rebels 
play North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	UNLV carries a 16-game losing streak into its opener. It's the  
second-longest skid in Division I-A, two behind Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that we expect to win,'' Robinson  
said. ``That's necessary to compete. Losing wounds you. If you 
don't shrug it off, you'll always be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior receiver Len Ware has felt the sting and heard Robinson's  
soothing words. Now he's curious to see which will be stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we have John Robinson, the program isn't going to  
turn around by itself,'' Ware said. ``He's not going to be in the 
uniform out there, but he will put us in a position to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old coach won four Rose Bowls with the Trojans and  
has a career record of 104-35-4 over 12 seasons. He also coached 
the Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was lured to the desert by a program long overshadowed  
by the school's basketball team and desperate for an identity. So 
far, it's worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot of football hype around here. `What a great  
team we'll be!' `Coach Robinson's here now!' `You're going to win 
it all!''' Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all a bit much, Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of getting my picture in the paper every day, but we  
need all the help we can get,'' he said. ``We have to sell this 
program to the community over the next five years to get where we 
want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Texas is going through a similar growth process in its  
second year under Darrell Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles won just three games last year after winning four in  
1997 and five in '96. Beating the Rebels would be a good start 
toward reversing the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know each other a lot better than a year ago,'' Dickey  
said. ``As far as the ability to get things done, we'll find out 
Thursday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Texas officials hope for a crowd of at least 17,000 at  
Fouts Field, even though the Dallas Cowboys are playing an 
exhibition game in nearby Irving. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey understands that much of the interest in this game is  
because of the visiting team and its coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be much of a factor, but I know there  
has been a lot of hype,'' he said. ``This is a team that has a new 
coach with a great reputation who we know will bring in a football 
team that will play hard and be well prepared.''

<HEADLINE> Road Rage Killer Gets Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A former financial analyst was sentenced to death  
after testifying that road rage led him to shoot and kill two truck 
drivers and injure a third man he suspected of being a truck 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Alan Feldman confessed in testimony and in letters to  
opening fire on the drivers, Robert Stephen Everett and Nicolas A. 
Velasquez, in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes on Tuesday before  
sentencing Feldman, 41, to lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett, 36, was killed on U.S. 75 north of Dallas. Feldman, who  
was riding a motorcycle, had contended that Everett almost ran him 
over. Velasquez, 62, was fatally shot 40 minutes later at a Dallas 
gasoline station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will tell you this: I found it quite pleasurable to kill  
those two men!'' Feldman wrote a former girlfriend in December 
1998, two months after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are an angry person and someone provokes you to  
violence ... it feels wonderful to cause their death and to watch 
their pain.'' The letter was read in court by a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman's attorney, Jim Oatman, offered records from an  
inpatient psychiatric center showing that his client was treated 
for substance abuse and paranoia in 1993, but no mental health 
experts testified on Feldman's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing the defense presented could stand the test of the  
evidence or Feldman's lack of remorse, jury foreman Steve Joachims 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his written hand, he confessed and communicated that he  
would do it again, that he was actually happy about it,'' Joachims 
said. ``Very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A paramedic, Cynthia Manion, had testified that she and  
Velasquez prayed together and he spoke of his family as he was 
being taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted them to know how much he loved them,'' she said.  
``He didn't understand why it had happened. ... This person had 
just come up and shot him.'' Velasquez died later in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman also admitted shooting a third person, Antonio Vega, in  
September 1998 because he thought he was a truck driver. He 
survived.

<HEADLINE> Hilton Hotels May Buy Promus Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilton Hotels Corp. and Promus Hotel Corp.  
said Wednesday they are in discussions about a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said in a brief statement that Hilton had begun  
talks with Promus about ``a possible business combination,'' but 
said there was no assurance a deal would be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past Hilton has expressed interest in buying Promus, but  
executives have said that the company was too pricey. Promus had 
$1.1 billion in revenues in 1998, while Hilton showed $1.8 billion 
for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the talks  
Wednesday, said a deal could be worth more than $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger would expand Hilton's stake in the lodging industry.  
Promus' interests include Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Homewood 
Suites and Hampton Inn. If Hilton acquired Promus, it would open 
the limited-service and all-suites segments of the travel market to 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hilton stockholders would likely have to deal with  
reduced earnings of their shares if a deal were to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus suffered a management shakeup after the company merged  
with Doubletree Corp. in December 1997. The top executives from 
both companies quit in August 1998 because of management strife. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Blake, the former chief executive officer of insurance  
company USF&AMP;G Corp., said Promus wasn't for sale shortly after 
being named chairman, president and CEO. He said Promus would 
instead be seeking acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Promus reduced its earnings estimates for 1999, citing  
weak market conditions and poor performance at its Red Lion hotels. 
Two brokerages lowered their ratings on Promus and its stock 
dropped by 18 percent in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of talks with Hilton sent Promus stock soaring 10.1  
percent, or by $2.93 3/4, to close at $32 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where Hilton slid 4.1 percent, or by 50 cents, to 
close at $11.68 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Worries Mountain Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif. (AP) -- Giant wildfires burned throughout  
the West, with the biggest blistering 52,800 acres and threatening 
homes as it crept toward lake resorts high in the San Bernardino 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents gathered on the shores of Lake Arrowhead to watch the  
orange glow of the blaze Tuesday night, fearing their homes will 
meet the fate of a dozen houses already consumed in the Mojave 
Desert below. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Willow fire was the largest of numerous fires  
being battled by more than 9,000 firefighters in California, Idaho, 
Montana, Nevada and Utah. Elsewhere, a 40,000-acre blaze has 
charred miles of grass in southern Idaho, five miles from Snake 
River town of Glenns Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters fought 20 mph winds and low humidity as they  
increased containment of the Willow blaze to 20 percent. Six minor 
injuries were reported, and firefighters counted some 30 structures 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shifting winds made the fire burn back on itself and  
helped slow it down a bit,'' said Kathy Saindon, a San Bernardino 
County fire spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze chewed through dense stands of timber among peaks more  
than 8,000 feet high, and there was growing nervousness among 
residents of alpine communities stretching from Lake Arrowhead east 
to Big Bear Lake as they watched billowing plumes of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Crane, 56, of Green Valley Lake, about 10 miles west of Lake  
Arrowhead, said most residents have been panicking since the blaze 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been so busy and scary around here because you see the  
people packing and see the flames all around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were not sure where the fire was going. Even though  
the biggest flames were roiling high in the mountains, there was 
still concern for scattered homes on the fringes of the desert 
floor communities of Apple Valley and Lucerne Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people voluntarily left homes in the desert, but by  
late afternoon there were still no evacuation orders up in 
Arrowhead or Big Bear Lake, seven miles from the nearest flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to stay in their homes as long as they can,'' said  
Sheri Newcomer, regional Red Cross director. ``But we keep getting 
calls with people asking, 'Are you open if we have to leave?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Interagency Fire Center said increasing winds and  
low humidity will likely plague firefighters throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty miles west of Apple Valley in Angeles National Forest, 778  
firefighters battled steep terrain in a 3,500-acre wildfire that 
damaged three cabins in the North Fork area. That fire was 10 
percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riverside County 70 miles east of Los Angeles, the 3,000-acre  
Mixing fire was 70 percent surrounded. The nearby 1,523-acre Pines 
fire was nearly contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, firefighters struggled with clusters of  
fires mostly uncontained burning about 23,735 acres in the 
Shasta-Trinity area. A 34,441-acre fire in Modoc National Forest 
and a 12,587-acre cluster fire in Plumas National Forest were also 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Idaho near Glenns Ferry, a downed power line Monday  
night sparked the blaze that cut a 21-mile swath through grass and 
brush.

<HEADLINE> Puff Daddy Is All Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Puff Daddy calls it his ``Frank Sinatra room.''  
</P>
<P>
	Steps away from the ``Daddy's House'' studio in Manhattan, the  
lounge has all the comforts a wealthy rap entrepreneur and his 
modern rat pack would expect. A pool table. Plush sofas. A fully 
stocked bar. Stereo equipment. Five televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on this late summer afternoon, no one removes the pool  
table's plastic cover. A bottle of champagne and four glasses 
remain untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Daddy's in his house, but Sean ``Puffy'' Combs is all business.  
</P>
<P>
	He darts between two telephones, where behind each blinking  
white light is a radio disc jockey in a faraway city to sweet-talk. 
The marketing director for Puffy's corporation, Bad Boy 
Entertainment, buttonholes his boss between calls. Two reporters 
and a camera crew wait. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's time to face ``Entertainment Tonight,'' a photographer  
asks Combs to put a denim jacket over his white shirt. Without 
answering or smiling, Combs walks across the room for his jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the mood, Combs' five-year-old son, Justin, bursts into  
the room with some playmates. Combs smiles broadly and hoists the 
laughing boy over his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's back to work. Justin sits on a sofa playing with  
Monopoly money. Daddy continues his hunt for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	By any measure, it's a pivotal time for Puff Daddy, Inc. Two  
years ago, he was music's reigning king. For 25 straight weeks, he 
participated in each No. 1 song in the country, including his 
tribute to the Notorious B.I.G., ``I'll Be Missing You.'' His $53 
million in earnings last year made him a Forbes magazine cover 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been known more for his parties than his golden  
musical touch. Assault charges against a fellow music executive 
were an embarrassing blemish. With the much-awaited follow-up to 
his multiplatinum ``No Way Out'' in the stores, his longevity as a 
music luminary is being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting a lot of naysayers, you know,'' he said.  
``And I've been doing this for years. I've been working all day and 
all night. There's going to have to come a day when they're going 
to have to give it all up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he sits down, his handlers warn that Puff doesn't want to  
talk about the beating he and two others allegedly inflicted on 
record executive Steven Stoute on April 15. Combs was angered about 
his depiction in a video; Stoute wound up with a broken arm and 
jaw. Combs has said the men have settled their differences, 
although it's not clear what that involves. 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly doesn't avoid the subject on his new disc,  
``Forever.'' The opening cut includes a re-created news report 
about his arrest; Combs said that's the way he lets fans know about 
some of the events in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The album ends with a Public Enemy tribute in which Puff Daddy  
declares himself ``public enemy number one.'' He warns listeners 
not to read too much into that sentiment, though it's hard to hear 
the song and not sense his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spoken about the incident time and time again,'' he said.  
``It's a mistake in my life. I've made my bed, now I've got to lie 
in it. It's not the way I normally act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cynic could suggest that an assault charge would harden the  
reputation of an artist in a field where toughness is glorified. 
Certainly, Puff Daddy's album is filled with the coarseness and 
bravado of the streets -- city streets, not those around his summer 
home in Long Island's fashionable East Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Puff Daddy said he's neither sought, nor received, such  
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, it's not me,'' he said. ``It's not like me. I don't make a  
hard-core, gangster album. I don't have a record. I didn't spend 
any time in jail. If anything, it's hurt me. It's hurt the way 
certain people look at me. It gave people the chance to have 
something to say, and I gave them that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took heat from another direction when he posed for the cover  
of Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a proud moment for Combs and his mother, who raised him  
in Mount Vernon, N.Y. At age 29, he was celebrated in the 
publication for his business acumen. Puff Daddy has taken advantage 
of musical success to diversify, launching ``Notorious'' magazine 
and entering the lucrative, and competitive, world of urban fashion 
with his ``Sean John'' line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out being a Catch-22,'' he said. ``I felt like I had  
to do it for my race and my generation. But at the end of the day 
it brought me a whole lot of problems, because everything became 
about the money, and that's not why I do what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musically, Combs gets more respect as a producer than a  
performing artist. He's a mediocre rapper, and seems to sense that. 
His album is filled with guest stars -- R. Kelly, Jay-Z, Redman, 
Lil' Kim, Busta Rhymes, Nas, Mario Winans and Bizzy Bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear a whole album of Puff Daddy,'' he said.  
``I want to hear other people, the co-stars. The other artists give 
me a little bit more diversity and I bounce off them. As a 
consumer, I don't know if I'd want to hear an entire album of 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he considers it better both lyrically and in performance  
to ``No Way Out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One criticism Puff Daddy bristles at is when people dismiss him  
for piggybacking on the creativity of others. ``I'll Be Missing 
You,'' for example, is built on the melody of the Police's ``Every 
Breath You Take'' and features Sting's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forever'' contains two prominent samples. Puff Daddy's  
spiritual hymn, ``Best Friend,'' borrows from Christopher Cross' 
hit, ``Sailing.'' The new song, ``Angels With Dirty Faces'' samples 
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's ``Fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The critics need to get over it,'' he snapped. ``There's an  
art to what I do. I like rapping over old school beats. It's not 
that easy. If it was that easy, everyone would be able to do it. 
It's such a beautiful experience, I don't know why anybody would 
knock it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my style. I'm not trying to go down in history as the  
best producer, if you don't want to give me that. But you have to 
give me that at least I knew how to pick the samples I sampled, I 
treated them with respect, and I made them sound just as good or 
better as when you first heard it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combs is interrupted by an aide whispering in his ear.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maryland?'' he asks.  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Baltimore's on the agenda for the next day. So is  
Washington, D.C. And Miami, New Orleans, Memphis and Atlanta in the 
days to follow. He has a 4 a.m. plane reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Time to go. Business calls.

<HEADLINE> Disney Set To Sell Angels, Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. has reportedly outlined a  
deal to sell the Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks to billionaire 
Henry T. Nicholas III for $650 million, a sum millions of dollars 
above industry estimates of the teams' value. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney has ``completed the parameters of a deal'' to sell the  
baseball and hockey club to Nicholas, columnist Peter Gammons wrote 
for ESPN.com on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts have valued the Angels-Ducks package at $375  
million to $425 million, but Nicholas ``stepped up and closed the 
deal,'' the columnist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN.com is the online information unit of cable broadcaster  
ESPN, which is owned by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports have said Disney and Nicholas were in talks but  
that a deal had yet to be reached. Disney has refused comment on 
reports of talks with Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would need the approval of Major League Baseball, and  
the Los Angeles Times, quoting an unidentified high-ranking 
baseball source, reported today that Disney has not yet sought 
permission from the commissioner's office to share financial 
information with Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that Disney and Nicholas could agree on the broad  
outline of a purchase first and adjust the price later, the Times 
said, citing unidentified sources. Disney could raise more than 
$300 million with the sale of the two teams, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas is president and chief executive officer of Irvine,  
Calif.-based semiconductor group Broadcom Corp. A message 
requesting comment was left at his office today but there was no 
immediate response. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily Variety, citing unidentified sources, reported that no  
agreement was likely to be announced until later this fall. The 
entertainment industry paper said that securing the deal could take 
much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney signed an agreement three years ago to pay $140 million  
for the Angels. The company also paid a $50 million franchise fee 
for the hockey team. However, both teams have not been money 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Disney sold Fairchild Publications for a  
reported $650 million. Analysts have said Disney's recent selloff 
efforts have been an attempt to cut costs and boost dropping 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels entered the season with payroll of $60 million, a  
franchise record. But they have fallen out of contention in the AL 
West in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mighty Ducks have never made it beyond the second round of  
the playoffs, and were swept by Detroit in the opening series this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Sept. 9 Will Test Y2K Contingency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Y2K planners in business and government will have a chance to  
rehearse their end-of-millennium routines when the date 9-9-99 
arrives next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agencies, banks, electric utilities and other  
companies around the United States will be watching closely for 
Y2K-like computer trouble next Thursday. Other countries will have 
teams in place as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear is that some computers may translate Sept. 9, 1999, as  
a ``9999'' stop-program command. Although few Y2K advisers expect 
major problems such as widespread electrical outages, no one is 
ruling out the possibility of smaller disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can definitely guarantee you that there will be no  
glitches,'' said John Koskinen, President Clinton's Y2K czar. 
``We're going to monitor it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K planners and some industries are taking advantage of the  
situation to test their readiness and backup systems for New Year's 
Day, when the real Year 2000 bug may hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to run through any complicated exercise like that so  
people aren't seeing this kind of deployment for the first time in 
December,'' said Gerry Cauley, Year 2000 program manager for the 
North American Electric Reliability Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, most of the attention has been on Jan. 1, when  
computer programs recognizing only the last two digits of a year 
might read ``00'' as 1900. But several other problems could occur 
before then, Sept. 9 among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric industry will conduct a major drill, beginning  
Wednesday night, to make sure its thousands of workers understand 
procedures for Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Some banks will spend Thursday testing techniques to spot and  
report Y2K trouble, while President Clinton's Y2K advisory council 
will collect status reports. An international Y2K group will 
monitor other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case problems do occur, the Coast Guard will add  
supervisors to keep navigation reliable, and the Transportation 
Department is assembling a team normally mobilized only during 
natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines decided against setting up a command center, concluding  
that failure is unlikely, and will simply keep watch, said Thomas 
Browne, executive director for the Aviation Millennium Project in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The September date was picked partly out of confidence that  
nothing will go wrong. The electric industry went through a smaller 
drill on April 9 -- a date that was problematic because it was the 
99th day of the 99th year. That day passed with no reported 
troubles in electric and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the confidence this time is that 9999 is not a  
widely used end-of-file or end-of-program marker. Also, dates are 
more likely to appear in computers as 090999. And a 9999 problem is 
relatively easy to spot and fix within the millions of lines of 
programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems are likely to be limited to billing and other business  
information programs that run on older mainframe computers, sparing 
home users and systems that operate power grids and other 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Using two digits for the year, on the other hand, is a more  
common technique. So the new year could disrupt financial 
transactions, airline schedules and power grids. Another potential 
problem is Feb. 29, 2000; some computers might not recognize that 
it is a leap year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, studies have prompted confidence among Y2K planners.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the fears are unfounded,'' said Bruce  
McConnell, director of the International Y2K Cooperation Center, a 
clearinghouse established by the United Nations and the World Bank. 
``I'm not saying there won't be problems, but the kind of problems 
will really be a blip.''

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown's Wife Denies Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Brown's wife took the witness stand  
Wednesday, blaming herself for her stormy marriage and denying the 
football Hall of Famer threatened to break her neck or ever hurt 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown said she lied to a 911 operator and police when  
she claimed the couple had a history of domestic violence and that 
he had threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband has never laid a hand on me, and I had no reason to  
believe he ever would,'' she said under cross-examination by 
defense attorney William Graysen. 
</P>
<P>
	``So all this information you gave to the 911 officer was  
false?,'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's correct,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown later acknowledged telling a television  
interviewer that premenstrual syndrome led her to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
	When she is premenstrual, ``I become more sensitive, more  
emotional, more irritable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She sought treatment and was advised to take vitamins, exercise  
and stay away from salty foods, but was not following the doctor's 
orders at the time, Monique Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of her daylong account, Monique Brown became  
tearful as she insisted the only people she feared after making the 
emergency call from a neighbor's home the night of June 15 were the 
estimated 18 officers who arrived at her Hollywood Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt so bad about what I'd done,'' she said. ``It was way,  
way too much. The mistake I'd made was using the 911 operator and 
allowing myself to be led and manipulating to get what I wanted ... 
I didn't realize what I had created and it was way out of 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, ``I was just relieved that my husband was alive,''  
she said, explaining she thought they were going to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you think they might harm you?'' Graysen asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she said in a choking voice.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, is on trial in Hollywood Municipal Court on one count  
of making terrorist threats and one count of vandalism, both 
misdemeanors. He could face 18 months in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office is pursuing the case without Monique  
Brown's cooperation. She has urged that charges be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day Graysen, outside the jury's presence,  
asked Judge Dale S. Fischer to exclude planned prosecution 
testimony from an expert on domestic violence, arguing that Monique 
Brown had recanted her allegations. However, the judge rejected the 
motion and said jurors must decide whether Monique Brown lied to 
police or in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who appeared pained during much of the testimony, emerged  
from court at the lunch hour holding his wife's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit there and I agonize with her,'' he said. ``She is the  
victim in many, many ways. I'm so happy she's able to stand up and 
present herself and represent us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown, 25, portrayed the couple's two-year marriage as  
marred by shouting matches but never violence, although she 
acknowledged that she once had to leave home and stay with friends 
after arguing with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	She blamed herself for the problems.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was so frustrated,'' she said. ``I had complaints about his  
playing so much golf, giving me so much responsibility. I felt he 
wasn't making the right business decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown said things came to a head when they argued about  
a trip he was taking to Miami, where she suspected he was having an 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had been building up over six months,'' she testified.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I wasn't going to take this anymore, and I was  
going to leave,'' she testified. ``I knew he was having an 
affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid my marriage was ending,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown told her the marriage was over and attacked her car with a  
shovel, smashing the windows and denting the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	She tacitly gave him permission, she added.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Go ahead. ... It's your car, anyway. You're going to  
have to fix it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown said the car was registered to her but it was used  
for Brown's company business. 
</P>
<P>
	She Brown said she was not afraid at any point, even when she  
heard Brown smashing the car windows. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged telling police that Brown once stood over her  
with a metal spear and asked her if she wanted to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you tell the detectives that if you took him to court, he  
said he would kill you?'' Deputy City Attorney Grace Kim Lee asked 
at one point, as Brown sat across the room watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Monique Brown said. ``But it was not true.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Is that why you are changing your story?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' Monique Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Lee asked her if she thought Brown should  
learn to control her anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to learn to control my anger before I can speak for  
my husband,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also testified about a June 13 argument in which she grabbed  
the TV remote control away from Brown as he lay on their bed. She 
felt he was paying more attention to the TV than to her, she 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that when he threatened to kill you by snapping your  
neck?'' Lee asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never threatened to kill me by snapping my neck,'' Monique  
Brown replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Officer Fernie Montesdeoca testified Tuesday that Monique  
Brown told officers responding to her 911 call that ``the defendant 
had threatened to kill her by snapping her neck.''

<HEADLINE> Parents Charged in Python Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLYLE, Ill. (AP) -- The parents of a 3-year-old boy squeezed to  
death by a pet python were charged Wednesday with endangering the 
life of a child and possession of a dangerous animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Altom, 26, said Wednesday he didn't know the snake was  
vicious enough to kill his son, Jesse, who was asleep on the living 
room floor of the family's mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame the snake. ... I don't really believe he tried  
to stalk my son down. He might have got out of the cage and he 
cuddled up by him,'' Altom said after his son's funeral Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have had a snake in my house if I'd thought it was  
going to kill my son. That boy was everything in my world,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The endangerment charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in  
prison.

<HEADLINE> 10 Commandments Judge Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- A judge who displays the Ten Commandments  
in his courtroom credited his religious faith after a prosecutor 
decided to clear him of possible ethics charges over a legal 
defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like today we've been delivered by His righteousness,''  
Circuit Judge Roy Moore said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore addressed a courtroom full of supporters after St. Clair  
County District Attorney Van Davis said there was no evidence to 
support an Alabama Ethics Commission complaint alleging the judge 
may have violated state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners voted 5-0 in June that there was probable cause  
that Moore illegally profited from the defense fund, established by 
friends who support Moore's legal fight to keep the display in his 
courtroom. The commission sent the case to the state attorney 
general, who gave it to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund, established by a Moore supporter, has taken in more  
than $100,000 in donations during Moore's fight against the 
American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged his display and 
his practice of starting court sessions with prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis said Moore neither solicited donations himself nor  
controlled the fund. ``Our investigation revealed no evidence that 
Judge Roy Moore used his office for personal gain,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said the ethics case was prompted by his highly publicized  
court fight against the ACLU, which contends the judge's courtroom 
religion violates the doctrine of separation of church and state 
contained in the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about ethics,'' Moore said. ``This was an effort  
to stop the message that the acknowledgment of God ... is not now 
nor has ever been nor ever will be a violation of the First 
Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Supreme Court eventually dismissed the ACLU's case  
without ruling on the merits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission also has been  
investigating Moore, apparently questioning whether his Ten 
Commandments activities have violated any rules of judicial ethics. 
But the commission operates confidentially and has not commented 
about the probe.

<HEADLINE> Warm Socks As Sleeping Aid? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Instead of counting sheep, the next time you have trouble  
sleeping, try putting socks on your feet. 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher says people with chronically cold feet might drift  
off faster if they warm their feet with socks or a hot water 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the body appears to prepare for sleep by widening  
the blood vessels in the hands and feet to help radiate body heat 
away, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	Warming the feet and then removing the socks or water bottle  
would promote this dilation, said the researcher, Anna Wirz-Justice 
of the Psychiatric University Clinic in Basel, Switzerland. Most 
people go through the process naturally and wouldn't need socks or 
a water bottle to help them sleep, she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She and colleagues didn't directly test whether socks or water  
bottles promote sleep. But they did analyze data from 18 healthy 
young men who participated in sleep studies. The results suggest 
that blood vessel dilation in the hands and feet in late evening, 
and resulting heat loss, are key to falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis appears in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.

<HEADLINE> Eastwind Airlines Grounding Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- As many as 20,000 ticketholders could be  
affected when Eastwind Airlines suspends flights next week, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled discount carrier will suspend operations  
indefinitely as it tries to close a deal for its sale. It will 
suspend flights to and from Greensboro, Orlando, Fla. and Trenton, 
N.J., beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will lay off about 50 of its 145 employees,  
including pilots, flight attendants and some ground personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers departing before noon Tuesday but not scheduled to  
return until after Sept. 7 will get a return ticket on another 
airline. Anyone else who has paid for a flight on Eastwind 
scheduled after Sept. 7 will get a refund for the unused portion of 
the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we really don't see ourselves continuing  
Eastwind service, based on the financial performance we have had 
over the last 12 months,'' said Chris Dimitriyadi, the airline's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitriyadi had said just last week that the airline would  
continue operating despite heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed purchase agreement involves a European carrier  
looking to establish a U.S. presence and an investment company that 
owns a regional Southeastern carrier. Dimitriyadi declined to name 
the companies but said both are made up of airline veterans. He 
said the deal may be closed by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind's owner, New Jersey-based UM Holdings Ltd., is  
continuing talks with about 10 other potential buyers. UM is asking 
at least $10 million for the airline and its leases on two year-old 
Boeing 737-700s. 
</P>
<P>
	If Eastwind is able to find a buyer, the flight suspensions will  
be lifted, Dimitriyadi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensboro-based airline has lost $29 million in the past  
four years and still owes money to airports, passengers and travel 
agencies. It has been the target of scores of customer complaints 
about canceled and delayed flights, double billing and poor 
customer service.

<HEADLINE> 22 Umpires Call Their Last Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Greg Kosc couldn't mask his emotions as he  
prepared for the final game of his 23-year career as a major league 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	As he accepted the lineup cards before Wednesday night's game  
between the Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Kosc had 
tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last day,'' he told Orioles manager Ray Miller.  
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was one of 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted by  
major league baseball in the wake of the union's ill-fated attempt 
to try to force an early start to negotiations for a new labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 22 were working Wednesday night in Los Angeles, San  
Diego, St. Louis and San Francisco. Three of them -- Terry Tata, Tom 
Hallion and Bill Hohn -- worked the Dodgers' 5-4 loss to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a game today, but I'm more sad about the departure of  
some old friends,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We're 
going to miss them. I was hoping they'd resolve it somehow. It's a 
shame, they're going to be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Pulli, a 28-year veteran, was given the final ball after  
the Cardinals beat Florida 9-3 in St. Louis. Before the game, he 
pretended to eject Cardinals' third-base coach Rene Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's one of the 22 worst umpires in this league, I'm a  
kamikaze pilot,'' Lachemann said. ``It's a big mistake that they 
fired him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc called Wednesday's game at Camden Yards without incident.  
Afterward, he shook hands with Baltimore's Brady Anderson, Miller 
and Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `Maybe it will still work out for you, Tiny, but  
thanks for all years of being so professional,''' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc then spoke with Rothschild before walking off the field for  
the last time. He will formally be out of a job at 6 a.m. EDT 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, 50, refused to talk to reporters. But in the parking lot,  
he said, ``I don't know anything. I haven't heard a thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to make a phone call from his hotel room, where the  
bad news awaited him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc received a business degree in business administration from  
the University of Texas-El Paso, where he competed in weightlifting 
and threw the shot put and hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, a 255-pounder, still lifts weights and works out on a  
regular basis. Because baseball players usually pick a trait and 
then go the opposite way with a nickname, he's known among his 
peers is ``Tiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We argue with these people, but you have to remember they're  
human beings with a family and a lot of time in the big leagues,'' 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Hickox was scheduled to work the game at home plate, but  
skipped the game to be in a U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, 
where lawyers for the umpires' union and baseball worked out the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> UPS Driver Sues Teamsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A United Parcel Service driver who was beaten and  
stabbed by Teamsters for working during a strike filed a lawsuit 
against the union and 10 officials on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roderick Carter was pulled from his UPS truck and attacked Aug.  
7, 1997, during a two-week national strike. Six striking UPS 
workers participated in the beating, and one, Benigno Rojas, 
stabbed Carter six times with an ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The union bailed out the attackers, all of whom were convicted.  
Rojas served time in jail for aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a former Miami Hurricanes linebacker, was unable to work  
for nearly two months after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, Mr. Carter is not comfortable at work, he doesn't  
feel safe at home, and he constantly is concerned for his two young 
daughters and his wife,'' said Joseph Hillock, spokesman for the 
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which filed the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before the attack Carter said told a television reporter  
he wasn't striking because he needed to support his family. That 
evening, the Carters received several hang-up calls and one 
threatening call -- all of which were traced to the home of Anthony 
Cannestro, Sr., president of the Teamsters Local 769, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton Orr, labor counsel for the local chapter, declined  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eager To Veto GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is room for compromise with Republicans  
on tax cuts, but they must be modest and not come at the expense of 
adequate spending on critical programs, a top White House aide 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said President  
Clinton hopes to begin serious negotiations with the GOP-led 
Congress on spending and tax issues after he vetoes the 10-year, 
$792 billion Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that some tax relief is appropriate,'' Podesta said  
following a National Press Club speech Wednesday. ``It ought to be 
balanced against the other important national needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta stressed the administration's contention that the tax  
bill passed by the GOP-led Congress spends too much of projected 
budget surpluses -- at the expense of Social Security and Medicare -- 
and is improperly weighted toward wealthier taxpayers. He said 
Clinton would veto the measure as soon as congressional leaders 
send it to the White House, which will occur as early as Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please send us the tax cut bill so that we don't have to keep  
fooling around with the phony debate,'' Podesta said. ``Send it 
down to us so that we can veto it, and then move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans kept the tax bill locked away on Capitol Hill during  
the August recess as they tried to drum up public support for the 
measure and demonstrate their commitment to cutting taxes as a 
prelude to the 2000 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 10 years, the bill would reduce all income tax rates by 1  
percentage point, ease the marriage penalty on many two-income 
couples, eliminate estate taxes and the alternative minimum income 
tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand pension and 401(k) laws and 
provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	There are mixed feelings within the GOP about whether to seek  
compromise with the president on a smaller tax bill. Some 
hard-liners would rather force a veto on the $792 billion bill and 
use that as a political issue, but others believe voters prefer a 
concrete accomplishment even if it is more modest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said a tax cut of up to $300 billion over 10 years  
might be acceptable, and moderate lawmakers of both parties in 
Congress are working on alternatives somewhat higher than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Podesta discounted any growth in public support for the  
GOP plan, many Republicans believe Clinton's willingness to 
compromise shows that parts of the bill are popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``This latest exercise is further proof that President Clinton  
does not want to admit that he is dead set against giving any tax 
relief to married couples, small business owners, investors and 
millions of other Americans,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the size of any tax cut depends on how lawmakers  
cope with tight spending caps imposed as part of the 1997 balanced 
budget deal. Unless the caps are lifted -- neither the White House 
nor GOP leaders are suggesting that -- many programs are going to 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Podesta accused Republicans of shortchanging  
vital science and research programs in various spending bills, 
including a cut of $1 billion from Clinton's fiscal year 2000 
request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a 
cut of $1.8 billion for civilian research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all be working toward bipartisan progress, not  
playing politics with an issue so fundamentally crucial to our 
nation's future,'' Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the House Appropriations  
Committee, said that unless the spending caps are altered, 
lawmakers will be forced to make painful choices in allocating a 
limited pool of money throughout government. Clinton, she said, 
wrote a budget that depended on unrealistic revenue increases, such 
as higher tobacco taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the caps, for example, the spending bill that pays for  
labor and many social programs would fall $19 billion under 
Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to deal in reality,'' Morra said. ``We've done the  
very best we can to prioritize spending under very tight budget 
restrictions. It's tough.''

<HEADLINE> The Artists: Polish Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Think of the world's art treasures, and minds go  
to Italy's Sistine Chapel, France's Louvre and Amsterdam's van Gogh 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if organizers of an exhibition touring the country have  
their way, thoughts someday also will go to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition ``Land of the Winged Horsemen: Art in Poland,  
1572-1764'' opened in Baltimore in March and is now showing at The 
Art Institute of Chicago, where it runs through Monday. It will 
open at the Huntsville Museum of Art in Alabama on Sept. 25 before 
traveling to California and Oklahoma and then returning to Poland 
for a final viewing at The Royal Castle in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition brings together about 150 works of art --  
ceramics, glass, furniture, weapons, metalwork, paintings and 
textiles -- from museums, churches and public institutions in 
Poland. Many have never been shown outside their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Also shown are items relating to Poland's elected monarchy and  
its nobility -- a silver-gilt crown of fake jewels, a king's throne, 
a Turkish-style coffee set, tapestries and more. And there is 
religion art. Coffin plates (which included a portrait of the 
deceased, usually nailed to a coffin), chalices, a gilded velvet 
Torah curtain, two 18th-century Hanukkah lamps and exquisite oil 
paintings are among the items. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition takes its name from the Husaria -- a Polish heavy  
cavalry regiment whose winged armor made a rushing sound as the 
horsemen rode into battle. The armor, featured in the exhibition, 
is made of hammered steel and brass, adorned with feathers and 
leopard skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Wardropper, curator of European decorative arts and  
sculptures at The Art Institute, believes the exhibition refutes 
the myth that Poland is a country without great art. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can see it was a grand and noble country that fully  
participated in all the artistic and literary movements of Europe 
and had its own distinctive culture,'' he said. ``It was just so 
overrun by battles throughout its history and has lost so much of 
its art and culture. ... But when one can assemble it in an 
exhibition such as this ... it's quite impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The myth has been long in the making. In the catalog  
accompanying the exhibition, Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann writes, ``The 
prejudice that Poles lack art and possess little culture was 
already established at the time represented by the objects in the 
exhibition.'' He adds that most American museums, universities and 
publications have until now effectively ignored Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, this exhibition might have featured many more art  
treasures had it not been for the thefts and destruction invaders 
have inflicted upon Poland over the years -- from the Swedes in the 
17th century to the Nazis in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Churches, often purveyors of art in many countries, were not  
spared from the pillaging, and art belonging to Polish Jews fared 
even worse, ``having been annihilated during the Nazi occupation,'' 
the catalog notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few items of Jewish art have survived,'' Wardropper said.  
``Catholic art has definitely survived better, but even there it, 
too, was subject to looting and destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The religion art that has survived to be in this exhibition,  
however, is impressive -- ``dazzling,'' as Wardropper describes it. 
``Many churches and monasteries in Poland are still veritable 
museums of ancient art,'' the catalog notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Featured in the exhibition are several objects that have been  
recovered only in recent years, including a sculpture of Christ on 
the cross carved in about 1758 and stolen from a church in 1946. 
The sculpture, by Johann Georg Pinsel, was missing for 40 years but 
found in 1990 in another church. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardropper's hope that the exhibition will help conquer the  
ignorance many people have of Poland's culture is shared by the 
country's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message in the catalog, Kwasniewski writes, ``Our past,  
more than a millennium old, remains, generally speaking, unknown 
and obscure.'' But the exhibition, he concludes, ``will help the 
Poles become better understood in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition will run at the Huntsville Museum of Art, Sept.  
25-Nov. 28, and then the San Diego Museum of Art from Dec. 18, 
1999-Feb. 27, 2000. It goes to The Philbrook Museum of Art, in 
Tulsa, Okla., March 25, 2000-June 18, 2000, before heading to The 
Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland next summer.

	Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 108.60  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues lent some strength to Wall  
Street today, driving most stocks higher and helping the Dow Jones 
industrials end a four-day losing streak. The Dow was up 108.60 at 
10,937.88. It was the first gain for the blue-chip index since last 
Wednesday, when the index closed at 11,326.04. Broader stock 
indicators also closed higher, with the Nasdaq composite index up 
11.46 at 2,750.81. Intel led the Nasdaq and was among the strongest 
components of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 as it unveiled a new 
microprocessor chip intended for use in devices that route 
information across the Internet. Analysts said the development 
raised expectations that the Internet boom will feed continued 
growth at computer companies. In a similar vein, IBM was one of the 
strongest Dow stocks today. IBM and Cisco said yesterday they will 
jointly provide networking equipment and services to companies 
looking to do business online.

	Mixed Signals in Economic Reports  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is continuing the longest  
peacetime expansion in history, although rising interest rates are 
beginning to slow some sectors, including home building. The Index 
of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.3 percent to 108.0 in July, 
the Conference Board reported today. But construction spending 
unexpectedly fell 0.5 percent in the same month, according to a 
separate government report. The mixed signals may take pressure off 
the Federal Reserve, which already has raised interest rates twice 
this summer in an attempt to slow the economy's growth to a 
noninflationary pace.

	GM, DaimlerChrysler Sales Strong  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- August was a hot month for automakers, as General  
Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG reported strong U.S. sales 
thanks in part to better rebates and incentives. ``The industry 
continues to run at a spectacular rate, and manufacturers are 
competing fiercely for every sale,'' said John G. Middlebrook, GM 
vice president and general manager of vehicle brand marketing. GM 
said today its sales were up 64 percent over last year -- a 
comparison skewed by United Auto Workers strikes that all but 
halted GM's North American production last year. Truck sales helped 
GM and also pulled sales in DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit up 9 
percent over last year.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilton Hotels Corp. said today it is in  
discussions about a possible merger with Promus Hotel Corp. In a 
brief news release, Hilton said it had begun talks with Promus 
about ``a possible business combination.'' The company said there 
was no assurance a deal would be reached. A call placed to Memphis, 
Tenn.-based Promus before business hours was not immediately 
returned. In the past Hilton has expressed interest in buying 
Promus, but executives have said that the company was too pricey. 
Promus had $1.1 billion in revenues in 1998, while Hilton showed 
$1.8 billion for the same period.

	Organizer Larry Haneborg said it would have been easier for him  
to donate $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 3,000 people attended the weekday concert. Haneborg  
said it grossed $50,000, but the cost of putting it on was nearly 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Haneborg said there might not have been enough time to promote  
the concert. He also said turnout might have been hurt by the fact 
that the show was held on a Wednesday with temperatures in the 90s.

<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Priceline.com and Alliance Capital  
Partners today announced a joint venture that will allow consumers 
to set the prices and terms they want to pay for home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	The service called Pricelinemortgage will allow consumers to  
find out within minutes if they have been approved for financing, 
the companies said today in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, which debuts after Labor Day, uses Fannie Mae's  
automated underwriting system to speed the application process. 
</P>
<P>
	When a borrower's ``name-your-own-rate'' offer is accepted,  
Pricelinemortgage provides a locked-in rate. It also guarantees 
closing costs and says it can save consumers up to $1,000 in 
closing costs compared to other online and conventional lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com has been offering name-your-price mortgages,  
refinancing and home equity loans through LendingTree Inc. since 
February and says it will continue that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Stamford, Priceline.com allows Internet users to name  
their own prices for automobiles, lodging, airline tickets and 
other products and services. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Films: Strong Roles for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Susan Sarandon is a flaky mom on the road,  
while Jodie Foster gets to know the king. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Watson pines in poverty, while Melanie Griffith goes loopy  
in the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
	A suicidal Winona Ryder gets shipped to the asylum, while  
Angelina Jolie plays detective doppelganger for a paralyzed male 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall film season is at hand, and it promises an interesting  
crop of strong, eccentric female roles that range far beyond the 
Hollywood standard of women as ``the girlfriend'' or looking to 
land a man. But it's not necessarily a ``to-die-for'' season for 
women on screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, it's a continuation of a gradual move toward more films  
that present women as real, full-blown people, as opposed to eye 
candy for male leads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed for the positive,'' said Diane Keaton, who  
directs and co-stars with Meg Ryan, Walter Matthau and Lisa Kudrow 
in ``Hanging Up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More women are out there in every aspect of filmmaking, and  
because of that there's more opportunities for female roles to be 
more complicated and more independently represented, meaning not 
attached to a male.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are skeptical. Films featuring exceptional women's roles  
remain a much tougher pitch, said Audrey Wells, who wrote the 
female buddy movie ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,'' starring 
Janeane Garofalo and Uma Thurman. Wells makes her directing debut 
this fall with ``Guinevere,'' starring Sarah Polley as a young 
woman involved with an older man, played by Stephen Rea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's definitely been proven that movies from a female  
perspective can be successful and ultimately very profitable,'' 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be if there were 10 pieces of the pie, men got all  
10,'' Wells said. ``Now, women get maybe two pieces of the pie, but 
they have to compete with each other over those two pieces. I think 
that pie allotment is a fixed thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slate of roughly 150 films due out before year's end remains  
dominated by male leads. And men star in most of the likely 
blockbuster candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Among this season's higher-profile movies: Pierce Brosnan back  
as James Bond in ``The World Is Not Enough''; Arnold Schwarzenegger 
battling Satan in ``End of Days''; Tom Hanks and Tim Allen lending 
their voices again to ``Toy Story 2''; Robin Williams as ``Jakob 
the Liar,'' bringing cheer to a Jewish ghetto with faked reports of 
Allied advances against the Nazis; Kevin Costner returning to the 
ballpark in ``For Love of the Game''; Brad Pitt and Edward Norton 
trading blows in ``The Fight Club''; Jim Carrey in ``Man on the 
Moon,'' the life story of the late, bizarre comic Andy Kaufman; and 
Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane in ``Sleepy Hollow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the major studio lineups promise a number of captivating  
roles for women. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Girl, Interrupted,'' starring Ryder as a suicidal young woman  
sent to a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
	--''The Bone Collector,'' with Jolie as the investigative eyes  
and ears for bedridden cop Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Anna and the King,'' with Foster as the ``King and I''  
governess hired by the ruler of Siam to teach his 58 children. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Crazy in Alabama,'' where Griffith escapes an abusive husband  
and flees the South for Hollywood in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Anywhere But Here,'' starring Sarandon as an over-the-top  
mother who moves to Beverly Hills intent on foisting her vision of 
a better life on her teen-age daughter, played by Natalie Portman. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Angela's Ashes,'' the adaptation of Frank McCourt's Pulitzer  
Prize-winning memoir, starring Watson as the goodhearted but 
emotionally petrified mother of a brood of impoverished Irish 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wasn't a particularly heroic person, but she had a very  
strong humanity,'' Watson said. ``It's quite different from the 
other roles I've had where the women had fiery or very expressed 
emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The English actress, who electrified audiences as cellist  
Jacqueline du Pre in last year's ``Hilary and Jackie,'' said she 
had been working in films almost nonstop for four years ``playing 
these fantastically interesting female roles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether that's luck, I don't know. I feel incredibly lucky to  
be making films, period. I haven't quite gotten over that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarandon is no stranger to such roles. In ``Thelma and Louise,''  
she was half of the female road buddy team that went on a violent 
spree. In ``Bull Durham,'' she played a ``woman who had sexual 
appetites and wasn't punished for them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly healthy if there are more complicated,  
interesting and less-cliched parts out there for women,'' Sarandon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The noncliche category this fall includes Meryl Streep teaching  
violin to East Harlem youths in ``Music of the Heart''; Milla 
Jovovich as Joan of Arc in director Luc Besson's ``The Messenger''; 
Ashley Judd playing a woman wrongly imprisoned for her husband's 
murder in ``Double Jeopardy''; Patricia Arquette in the 
supernatural thriller ``Stigmata,'' about a hairdresser who 
manifests the wounds of Christ; Laura Dern as a woman who helps 
defend an uncle accused of attempted murder in ``Daddy and Them''; 
Elisabeth Shue as a simple-minded waif who saves lobsters from 
restaurants in ``Molly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anjelica Huston directs and stars in ``Agnes Browne,'' the story  
of an Irish widow raising seven children; Claire Danes lends voice 
to the Japanese animated hit ``Princess Mononoke,'' about a girl 
raised by a wolf god who fights human encroachment in the forest; 
Kate Winslet appears in director Jane Campion's ``Holy Smoke,'' 
playing a Hindu-smitten Australian who turns the tables on cult 
deprogrammer Harvey Keitel; Annette Bening is a cheating wife in 
``American Beauty,'' a caustic look at family values in suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Opportunities are there to make compelling movies about women,  
said Patricia Rozema, who directs the latest Jane Austen 
adaptation, ``Mansfield Park.'' But those films are far less likely 
to win the marketing attention that male-oriented movies do, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that my work justifies $30 million in  
promotion,'' Rozema said. ``But I've always been able to make my 
movies. Women can get films made, there's no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Mansfield Park,'' Rozema said she imbued the mousy main  
character, a poor cousin played by Frances O'Connor sent to live 
among rich relations, with some forceful traits of Austen herself, 
making her a bold, freethinking, slyly humorous writer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's needed is not just roles for strong women, but ones  
where women are allowed to be failures and fragile and twisted and 
complex,'' Rozema said. ``And not some guy doing twisted chicks in 
a movie out of hate for women, but out of fascination and 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarandon said the mother in ``Anywhere But Here'' is far removed  
from the stereotyped parent trap Hollywood often falls into. 
Wearing tight pants and heavy eyeliner, her character is 
impractical, unrealistic and outright embarrassing to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to come up with a lot of different types of mothers  
involving people other than teen-agers,'' Sarandon said. ``The 
public is willing to buy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for daughters, said Kudrow, co-star to Ryan and Keaton in  
``Hanging Up.'' Kudrow plays a neglected youngest sister clamoring 
for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	While she's landed some juicy roles such as the lonely sister in  
``The Opposite of Sex'' and the bride in ``Analyse this,'' Kudrow 
said she's not sure there has been much across-the-board 
improvement in how women are presented in movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still read a lot of scripts where the part is the girl part,  
and her role in the movie is really just a reflection of the man 
she's with,'' Kudrow said. ``Actresses are looking for those strong 
parts where it's not about her just trying to get a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the heyday of the studio system, women often were presented  
as well-rounded characters, Kudrow said. Somewhere along the way, 
though, Hollywood became ``too afraid to write women as complete 
people,'' Kudrow said. ``Don't give them any quirky traits because 
you might be accused of hating women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Sydney Pollack said that trend has been reversing  
gradually as women take more active filmmaking roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's built up over a number of decades,'' said Pollack, who  
directs Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas as worlds-apart 
characters thrown together when their spouses die in a plane crash 
in ``Random Hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like anything else, it reaches a point where progress becomes  
logarithmic,'' Pollack said. ``It's been coming since the '60s, 
really, but we're finally seeing some real fruit from the women's 
movement in movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some other fruit from this season's movie harvest:

<HEADLINE> Sosa Hits 56th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 56th  
homer Wednesday night, a solo shot in the fourth inning to 
straightaway center field off San Diego Padres left-hander Sterling 
Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball went an estimated 431 feet, hitting a television camera  
on a platform that juts out from the permanent wall. Sosa had been 
2-for-14 (.143) lifetime against Hitchcock, with no homers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Sosa's second homer in as many nights and his 13th in 18  
games. Sosa has 26 career homers against San Diego, the second most 
against any team. He has 30 against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead and allowed Sosa to stay four  
ahead of Mark McGwire, who hit his 52nd earlier Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ford Faces Fine for Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will be fined at least $1  
million and has agreed to institute a series of safety improvements 
to answer at least a dozen workplace violations cited in connection 
with a February explosion that killed six workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Occupational and Safety Administration today was  
expected to release a synopsis detailing fines, safety violations 
and specific safety changes that Ford has agreed to make. 
</P>
<P>
	A top state official and an unidentified senior Ford executive  
told The Detroit News for a story today that the fine against the 
automaker would be between $1 million and $2 million. The fine, 
which would be the largest for workplace safety violations in 
Michigan history, comes after a seven-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 1 explosion in the powerhouse at the Rouge complex also  
injured 14 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said Ford also had agreed to a series of specific  
safety changes and agreed not to contest the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement agreement allows the company to focus its  
efforts on accident prevention,'' James Padilla, Ford manufacturing 
group vice president, told the newspaper. ``We cannot change the 
terrible events of the past, but we can work hard to make our 
workplaces safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Ford also will donate an amount equal to the  
civil fine to area hospitals with burn units, and spend another $1 
million to establish a joint Ford-United Auto Workers research fund 
to prevent workplace accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the automaker announced it had hired CEC Consultants, a  
Cleveland firm, to help it examine safety procedures at power 
plants across North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of three workers have sued Rouge Steel, which  
co-owns the Rouge complex. Those claims are expected to be dropped 
after the families of the workers sign settlements with Ford, which 
has offered more than $30 million to settle claims.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Families of those who perished  
last year on Swissair Flight 111, which crashed off the coast of 
this tiny fishing village, dedicated a monument Wednesday to the 
victims and those who helped recover their remains. 
</P>
<P>
	During a solemn dedication ceremony on a remote bluff  
overlooking St. Margaret's Bay, more than 800 family members joined 
200 volunteers and military officials who had recovered human 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a day short of the one-year anniversary, the families  
silently disembarked from a caravan of buses near the monument and 
crowded together on boulders, forming a silhouetted line against 
the cloudless sky and the sparkling sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sheer numbers were a startling reminder of the scope of  
the air disaster -- which killed all of the 229 people aboard the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ceremony, Peggy Coburn, whose husband Richard had  
been on the New York-Geneva flight, thanked the villagers and 
military officials who, she said, had ``helped and cared'' after 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever need strength or comfort, all I will need to do is  
remember you, and I will gain strength and I will be comforted,'' 
said Coburn, who lives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wept as Royal Canadian Mounted Police Inspector Andy  
Arsenault sang a ballad, called ``Roses on the Rocks,'' which had 
been written for the occasion. The mourners laid flowers on the 
rocks surrounding the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument, which was designed with input from the families  
and the villagers, consists of two halves of a 6-foot tall granite 
stone. The two halves face each other. One is dedicated to the 
victims, and one to those who ``worked tirelessly to provide 
assistance in the recovery operations and comfort to the families 
and their friends during a time of distress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One half of the boulder points toward a burial site, an elevated  
spot visible across the cove, where remains of the victims -- mostly 
unidentified -- were interred on Tuesday and Wednesday in two dozen 
metal coffins. Their families had come by bus to mourn earlier 
Wednesday in a private burial. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of the boulder points toward the impact site.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Navy frigate Ville de Quebec anchored offshore. A  
year ago, the Ville de Quebec had been one of the first ships to 
arrive on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	As it steamed toward its position Wednesday, the ship stopped  
over the crash site, and the crew observed a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Manuel, a firefighter from nearby Boutiliers Point,  
remembered laying flowers on the rocks for the families soon after 
the disaster. He recalled that a young girl next to him who had 
lost her father had burst into sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was real difficult to feel all the pain,'' Manuel said  
before the dedication ceremony. ``I think I'll be back often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the families stayed away from the ceremonies because  
they were upset by the decision to bury 2,300 pounds of 
unidentified remains in a mass grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Remains that had been identified were given to the families for  
private burial. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still unknown what caused the fire that filled the cockpit  
and caused a massive outage of the jumbo jet's electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
	A final report is not expected for more than a year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Challenged on Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge's authority to take control  
of evidence from the ruins of the 1993 Branch Davidian inferno is 
being challenged by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-page motion filed Tuesday by department lawyers contends  
that U.S. District Judge Walter Smith has no legal basis for an 
order demanding custody of all documents and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, an FBI spokesman said Director Louis Freeh had  
recommended to Attorney General Janet Reno that she appoint an 
outside investigator to probe why it took his agency six years to 
acknowledge using incendiary tear gas canisters in the waning hours 
of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would welcome a qualified group of (independent)  
investigators to do that investigation,'' spokesman Tron Brekke 
said, acknowledging that the agency's credibility has been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is searching for a qualified outsider but has reached no  
final decision, Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department motion in Waco said the judge's Aug. 9  
order ``threatens a wholesale intrusion'' into the executive branch 
and an ``unwarranted and substantial burden'' on the entire federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be plain ... that separation of powers prevents a  
federal court from acting as an independent investigator,'' the 
motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a Waco federal prosecutor wrote Reno that lawyers  
within her department had long withheld evidence that the FBI fired 
pyrotechnic tear gas within hours of the fatal fire at the 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Department of Public Safety had requested that Smith  
take control of Davidian evidence it was holding for the Justice 
Department. The DPS said it thought the agency was being used by 
the federal government to keep the evidence from public inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had claimed for years that only nonburning tear gas was  
used during the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston said Monday he found notes  
referring to acknowledgment by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team that 
``military gas'' -- an incendiary device -- was used during the April 
19, 1993, assault on Mount Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes were written by a paralegal for the U.S. attorney's  
office in 1994 before the criminal trial of 11 Davidians. Johnston 
said a handwritten notation on the notes recommended they not be 
shown to anyone outside the department's legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed Branch Davidians may seek new trials based on the  
revelation, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get our hands on a piece of evidence proving that  
something was withheld from us, we'll probably go back into 
court,'' said attorney Rocket Rosen, who represents Davidians Kevin 
Whitecliff and Livingstone Fagan. ``I think it's very likely based 
on what I'm hearing and reading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said defense attorneys may argue their clients are being held  
illegally because the government failed to disclose its use of 
incendiary devices.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Owner: Team Won't Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings owner Red McCombs said  
Wednesday that he has never threatened to move the NFL franchise to 
another city if the public refuses to help him build a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs issued a brief statement after a report in Wednesday's  
Star Tribune that he was prepared to move the team if necessary. In 
remarks Tuesday morning to business leaders, McCombs was quoted as 
saying, ``We need a stadium right now or the Vikings won't be here 
five years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs' statement Wednesday said, in part: ``I have never  
mentioned at any time to anyone moving the Minnesota Vikings. ... I 
have never mentioned to anyone at any time the issue of breaking 
the lease on the Metrodome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs' statement did not dispute the Star Tribune story nor  
say he had been misquoted. An assistant said the owner was 
traveling to New York on Wednesday and was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan has talked about a new stadium before. He said last  
month at the Vikings' training camp that ``the stadium issue is 
really just a matter of mathematics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the comments reported Tuesday were his most forceful yet.  
And they surprised many, especially since opinion polls show a 
majority of Minnesota residents remain opposed to subsidies for 
professional sports stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people were somewhat stunned by it,'' Mpls/St. Paul  
magazine editor Brian Anderson told the Star Tribune. ``I was 
asking myself, `Did I miss something here?' Because a message is 
being delivered here that I hadn't heard before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura, who opposes using tax money for sports  
stadiums, challenged McCombs to open the team's books to the 
public. ``If indeed they are losing money, let us determine the 
legitimacy and the amount of the loss and then determine a course 
of action,'' Ventura said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	If a new stadium is the answer, the governor said his first  
choice would be personal seat licensing, in which people pay a fee 
for the right to buy a season ticket before the stadium is built. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton said she has talked to  
McCombs about stadium issues and said she thought it was odd that 
his comments were characterized as threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never have the Vikings or Red made threats about leaving,''  
Sayles Belton said. ``He always talks about how enthusiastic people 
are about the team and how important the team is to the fans 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sayles Belton is backing an idea to raise the sales tax in  
Hennepin County by a half-cent to raise money for a Twins ballpark 
and a renovated Metrodome. McCombs' statement Wednesday said he 
supports those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	To leave town, the Vikings would have to break their lease with  
the Metrodome, which runs through 2011.

<HEADLINE> Top Half of Open Draw Droops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three days into the U.S. Open, the top half of  
the men's draw is drooping, missing two of the tournament favorites 
and one of its heaviest hitters. It is left with No. 5 Gustavo 
Kuerten as its top remaining seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries took top-seeded Pete Sampras and two-time defending  
champion Patrick Rafter out of the mix early. Before the tournament 
ever began, their half of the draw took a hit when No. 11 Mark 
Philippoussis, a big-serving finalist here last year, pulled out 
because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras left before playing a match, his run at a record 13th  
Grand Slam title ended by a herniated disc in his back. Then Rafter 
went down with an aching shoulder, forced to retire from his 
first-round match against Cedric Pioline. It marked the first time 
since this tournament began in 1881 that a defending champion has 
lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for the tournament,'' Rafter said. ``Especially  
with Pete playing such great tennis, and my form was pretty good, 
as well, coming into here. I was feeling pretty confident about 
having some good wins here. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's very tough to pull yourself off that court.''  
</P>
<P>
	For Pioline, the casualties were no problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pioline is still here,'' he said. ``It's good.''  
</P>
<P>
	That left Kuerten, who was hitting with Sampras when the  
four-time champion was injured on Sunday, at the top of that half 
of the draw and perhaps wondering about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian, winner of the French Open two years ago, has  
never made it past the second round of the U.S. Open. He plays Paul 
Haarhuis next. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Kuerten comes No. 7 Todd Martin, who barely made it  
through the first round with a five-set victory that included three 
tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Next is No. 9 Greg Rusedski, a finalist here two years ago who  
held off Juan Carlos Ferrero 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. He's noticed the 
changing face of his half of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's definitely a little more open,'' he said.  
``There's still a lot of guys who can play good tennis, still a few 
guys you can kind of pick as favorites in the top section.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 14 Tommy Haas advanced with a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) victory  
over Thomas Enqvist but, in keeping with his half of the draw, he 
needed some treatment from the trainers for a hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bothering me a little bit,'' he said. ``I pulled a little  
muscle. I have to be careful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With so many of those around him falling, Haas is determined to  
hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it opens up the draw,'' he said. ``Maybe there are  
chances for the other ones. You know, it's just bad luck. That's 
just the way it goes. Injuries happen to everyone. It just makes 
the players appreciate to be healthy and can't wait to come out 
again to play next time..'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseeded Goran Ivanisevic advanced with a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6,  
6-2 victory over Ville Liukko and was philosophical about his 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Pete here and Rafter, Grand Slam is nobody's  
tournament,'' he said. ``In a Grand Slam, you cannot ever predict 
who will win. Anybody can win this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even him?  
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The top half of the draw was hurt early when Philippoussis, a  
big hitter who flourishes on hard courts like those at the National 
Tennis Center, pulled out and was replaced by clay court specialist 
Felix Mantilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The pinch hitter didn't last long, losing on Wednesday to Magnus  
Norman 1-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer John McEnroe, broadcasting the Open for USA  
Network, thinks the casualty rate can be traced to a schedule 
packed with too many events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have way too many tournaments,'' he said. ``They expect too  
much from the top players. The quality goes down. If you play too 
much, the odds are higher that something bad is going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top half of the Open draw can confirm that.

<HEADLINE>  Lemieux Takeover of Penguins OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that he's back in the NHL as an owner, Mario  
Lemieux has plenty of ideas about how to make hockey more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	First things first, though. His initial priorities center around  
making the Pittsburgh Penguins more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, that means lower ticket prices and,  
eventually, a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make it more (reasonable) for families and young  
kids to come back to the Civic Arena,'' Lemieux said Wednesday 
after the NHL's Board of Governors approved his takeover of the 
team with partners. 
</P>
<P>
	A new arena will be necessary to keep the team in Pittsburgh,  
Lemieux said. The Penguins currently play in the 38-year-old Civic 
Arena, oldest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the highest-paid player in the league when he starred  
in Pittsburgh, said he will also turn his attention to keeping his 
players' salaries as low as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do,'' said Lemieux, whose $13 million  
contract one season was higher than the combined total made by the 
next two players on the NHL salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a Hall of Famer who won six scoring titles and led the  
Penguins to Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992, also said 
he would like to see more scoring in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I did best,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we can find a  
way to make the game higher scoring. We have to see what we can do 
to open the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, of course, was the league's most ardent critic in this  
regard before retiring in 1997. He felt that skill players were 
hampered by suffocating defenses and a lack of effort by the league 
to crack down on pesky holding penalties that didn't allow players 
to skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Scoring has been down dramatically in the NHL in the '90s,  
prompting the league to rethink its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, without being specific, said he would ``do anything I  
can to improve the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He already has just by his presence, according to NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all feel good about the Penguins in Pittsburgh,''  
Bettman said. ``Having (Lemieux) at the board level will be a 
positive, good for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's approval came during a Board of Governors meeting that  
was otherwise devoted to general business. Lemieux received a warm 
reception from the owners when he stepped into the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of respect for Lemieux as a player,'' Bettman  
said. ``They were delighted that the effort was made, as he had 
done it, to keep hockey in Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's takeover climaxed a long struggle by the former hockey  
great and his associates to keep the team in Pittsburgh. Only court 
approval remains to finalize the deal, and that's expected to be 
taken care of by a bankruptcy judge during a hearing Friday in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins went into bankruptcy last season and were only able  
to meet their payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision by the board made it just under the wire  
for the Penguins. They're due to open training camp on Saturday and 
will play their first exhibition game on Sept. 11 against the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering more than  
a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to raise 
more money. He said the market value of the Penguins is currently 
$85 million, the price of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has the largest stake in the team, most of it coming  
from the $25 million in deferred salary the Penguins owed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important for me to keep the Penguins in  
Pittsburgh,'' Lemieux said. ``That's why I decided to put the group 
together. I have spent more than 15 years of my life in Pittsburgh, 
and I have a good relationship with the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is the first retired player to take over ownership in  
one of the four major North American pro sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited about the opportunity to come back,'' Lemieux  
said. ``This is a dream come true, after 10 months working on the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea it would be this difficult. I'm glad we were  
finally able to put this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arena lease with SMG, a Philadelphia-based company,  
accounted for much of the delay in Lemieux's takeover. Under the 
lease, SMG will continue to control the Civic Arena until 2004, 
when it will revert to Lemieux, with SMG as the arena manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins blamed the high cost of their lease with SMG to  
play at the Civic Arena for helping push the franchise into 
bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Give Money To Private Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush, decrying federal education policies that ``cheat poor 
children,'' says his administration would require states to test 
disadvantaged students, strip federal funds from the worst-scoring 
schools and allow private schools to get the public money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a back-to-school address laying out his first education  
proposals of the 2000 campaign, Bush says federal money withheld 
from schools that repeatedly fail state testing standards would 
follow students to better public schools, charter schools, tutoring 
or ``whatever option parents choose'' -- including private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Wading into the school voucher debate, Bush said in a draft of  
his address, ``Federal money will no longer flow to failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers expect the proposal to draw criticism from  
liberals and conservatives alike, a result they say would only 
underscore the Texas governor's ability to find a middle ground 
that balances conservative principles with moderate policies and 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	Though aides said Bush intentionally avoided the politically  
charged term ``school vouchers,'' his proposal would in fact pump 
federal money into private schools -- a concept Democrats say would 
hurt the public school system. Requiring tests is not popular among 
conservative Republicans who favor local control, though Bush was 
careful to say he would leave it up to states to choose and 
administer the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``A president is not a federal principal, and I will not be  
one,'' Bush said. ``The federal government must be humble enough to 
stay out of the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough 
to give states and school districts more authority and freedom, and 
strong enough to require proven performance in return. When we 
spend federal money, we want results -- especially when it comes to 
disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pigment and poverty need not determine performance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush is proposing a dramatic shift in the federal Title I  
program, which spends $7.7 billion a year to help educate poor 
children. The Education Department wants to increase the program to 
$8 billion to serve 12 million students in 44,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bush's plan, every school getting Title I money would be  
required to test its impoverished students on basic academics each 
year. A warning would be issued to schools that fail to make 
progress toward the state standards. After three years of no 
progress, the Title I money would be matched with other federal 
education money and given to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The state would establish an education account -- about $1,500 a  
year for a student's parents to use toward the education 
alternative of their choice. ``For whatever offers hope,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the best cases, he said, schools would be forced to get  
better. In the worst cases, needy children would be removed from 
bad schools and given money to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools  
to cheat poor children,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal could have a huge impact on poor school systems --  
particularly urban areas -- that rely on Title I money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be against a plan like this,'' said Reginald Felton,  
director of federal relations for the National School Boards 
Association. He said money given to personal education accounts 
would leave the rest of the school system shortchanged. ``The 
objective is to raise the academic achievement of all students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This likely is not Bush's final word on vouchers. He plans to  
deliver two other education addresses this fall, and aides say he 
is considering other ways to use federal money for force 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed shifting the Head Start program from the  
Department of Health and Human Services to the Education 
Department, returning the program's focus to preparing 
disadvantaged pre-schoolers for school. Greater efforts would be 
made to terminate unsuccessful programs and offer contracts to 
churches, synagogues and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential  
candidate, has promised to create unlimited access to pre-school if 
he became president. With polls showing education as the top voter 
concern, Gore traveled to Texas on Wednesday to question Bush's 
education record as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Chris Lehane, criticized Bush for supporting  
congressional tax cuts that Democrats say will force school 
spending reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any Republican presidential candidate who is supporting a  
risky tax cut that would hurt our children -- especially in areas 
like Head Start and Title I -- has little credibility talking about 
education,'' Lehane said. ``Sound like the Texas two-step to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker: ``Governor Bush has shown  
in Texas that you can cut taxes and make education a top 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas test scores have risen during Bush's tenure, and the gap  
between the scores of whites and minorities has closed. However, 
Texas students' scores on SAT college entrance exams still lag 
behind the national average. He has failed to push a school voucher 
bill through the Texas legislature.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Family Loses Quake Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A sixth member of a Georgia family that got  
caught in the earthquake in Turkey has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkan Kilic, 77, of Marietta died Sunday, two days after a  
memorial service for her four grandchildren who were killed in the 
quake Aug. 17. Also killed was her husband, Nizam Kilic. The 
Turkish-born couple were retired pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Kilic family were vacationing at the seaside  
resort area of Yalova when the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kilic suffered a stroke and was paralyzed on her left side  
during the earthquake, which killed more than 14,000 people. Family 
members brought her to Atlanta, where she was diagnosed with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter-in-law Cigdem Kilic said the woman suffered a  
second stroke on Sunday while in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of Mrs. Kilic's daughters-in-law, Jan Kilic, remained  
hospitalized. She suffered neck, head and back injuries during the 
disaster that killed four of her children, ages 9 months to 6 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 3-year-old daughter was pulled from the rubble days after  
the quake and suffered only a black eye.

<HEADLINE> Ovary Removal Lowers Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For women with a type of gene mutation that  
puts them at high risk of breast cancer, surgical removal of both 
ovaries can reduce their chances of breast cancer by about 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a study published today in the Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Rebbeck of the University of Pennsylvania School of  
Medicine, the lead author of the study, said such findings could 
eventually help medicine find the best therapy for women at high 
risk of breast cancer because of a mutation of the BRCA1 gene. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 47 women with the gene mutation had undergone  
surgery to remove both ovaries, and another 79 had the gene 
mutation but not the surgery. The women were patients at five 
different institutions or hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebbeck said that among those who had ovarian surgery, there was  
a 67 percent reduction in the incidence of breast cancer after 10 
years. For women whose progress was followed for between five and 
10 years, the risk reduction was even greater -- about 72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is helpful, but it is a small study,'' said Dr. Lynn  
Hartmann, a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic. ``It clearly 
needs to be taken with some caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BRCA1 gene mutation is thought to be a factor in only a  
small percentage of both breast and ovarian cancer cases 
nationally. But for women with the mutation, the chances are very 
high of developing the disease, Rebbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women with the mutation and a family history of breast cancer  
have up to an 80 percent chance of developing the disease over a 
lifetime, while the mutation carries an ovarian cancer risk of 40 
to 50 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical science has been struggling to find the best way to  
treat such women and to determine who should be tested for the BRCA 
gene mutation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among options being studied and practiced are preventative  
mastectomy and the use of drugs that appear to lower the incidence 
of breast cancer among women at high risk. Removing the ovaries has 
been used to reduce the ovarian cancer risk, but some experts 
believed the surgery also could reduce the risk of developing 
breast cancer by limiting hormones that encourage tumor growth. 
That is the issue addressed in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first study demonstrating a surgical approach to  
breast cancer risk reduction among BRCA1 mutation carriers,'' 
Rebbeck said. Although only a small percentage of women have the 
mutation, he said, the findings may help doctors and patients make 
decisions about how to deal with risks posed by the mutation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and  
Public Health said in a journal editorial that although the 
findings are reassuring, the results do not represent the final 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study ... is only a first step in determining what are  
the best management options for women who carry BRCA1 mutations and 
needs to be interpreted with caution,'' Helzlsouer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mutation, BRCA2, also has been linked to breast cancer  
but affects fewer women. Only the BRCA1 mutation was included in 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebbeck said the study does not suggest that ovarian removal is  
the solution for all women with the BRCA mutation or even that all 
women should be checked for the gene flaw, since only a small 
percentage of women have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of about 183,000 breast cancers diagnosed annually, he said,  
only 5,000 to 9,000 can be linked to the BRCA1 mutation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rebbeck said women who have a family history suggesting a  
high risk, such as a mother or sister who developed breast or 
ovarian cancer at an early age, should talk to genetic counselors 
for help evaluating their medical options. 
</P>
<P>
	He said removing the ovaries does not eliminate the risk of  
breast cancer. And, Rebbeck said, the surgery brings on menopause, 
which carries some increased risk of osteoporosis, the brittle bone 
disease, and heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' McCrary Returns to Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens defensive end Michael  
McCrary returned to the team Wednesday morning after skipping the 
last two days of practice over a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary, who had 14.5 sacks last season, left the team Saturday  
upset with efforts to negotiate a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left because I was frustrated. I wanted to make a point,''  
McCrary said. ``I hope the fans understand this is the ugly side of 
football. It's something I don't like, but you have to go through 
it every now and then. But I've come back and I'm really looking 
forward to practicing next week and helping us win this first game 
in St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old McCrary hasn't practiced much with the Ravens  
since the start of training camp because he is recovering from 
offseason knee surgery. McCrary has yet to play in a preseason game 
with the Ravens, who are 3-0 during camp, and he won't see action 
in Friday's exhibition game against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to have him back, the key now is to get ready for the  
Giants game,'' coach Brian Billick said. ``Unfortunately he won't 
be able to participate there, but we'll still get some good out of 
today's workout and he'll start fresh next Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary is in the final year of a three-year contract. He wants  
a five or six-year deal for about $6 million a year, including a 
$13 million signing bonus. The Ravens have offered similar money 
but only an $11.5 signing bonus. McCrary has said if he doesn't get 
an extension before the season opener, Sept. 12 in St. Louis, he 
will test the free agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that my agent and the Ravens will come to a  
fair-market deal before the season starts,'' McCrary said.

<HEADLINE> Punter Treated for Suspected Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Rookie punter Josh Bidwell underwent  
surgery Wednesday for a suspected case of testicular cancer, Green 
Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diagnosis and prognosis will be forthcoming, and we will make  
that information known when it becomes available to us,'' Wolf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Bidwell family was quoted by the Milwaukee  
Journal Sentinel as saying the surgery went well and the problem 
was caught early, possibly allowing Bidwell to return to the field 
in 2-to-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell noticed something was wrong a couple days ago, reported  
it to a doctor and had an ultrasound exam Wednesday, resulting in 
the decision to do the surgery the same day, the source told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell, the Packers' fourth-round draft pick from Oregon and  
the first punter drafted in 1999, was the only punter on Green 
Bay's roster. He also had been the primary holder for placekicker 
Ryan Longwell. 
</P>
<P>
	He practiced with the team Tuesday afternoon, and it wasn't  
immediately clear when the suspected cancer had been found. A 
Packers spokesperson said the surgery took place Wednesday 
afternoon and that doctors would know more about Bidwell's 
condition in the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers claimed first-year punter Chris Hanson on waivers  
from the Cleveland Browns to fill in for Bidwell. Green Bay plays 
its final exhibition game against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday 
night at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Packers kept Bidwell as their only punter even  
though he hadn't lived up to expectations in exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his best performance last weekend at New Orleans,  
averaging 43.5 yards on six punts. The 6-foot-3 Bidwell's size and 
athleticism, along with his booming 46.0 yards-per-punt averaged 
during his senior season at Oregon, convinced the Packers to spend 
a fourth-round pick on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell was a second-team All-America at Oregon last season.  
Originally recruited by the Ducks as a receiver, Bidwell signed 
with the Packers the day after training camp began in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers were concerned by Bidwell's inconsistency during  
training camp and exhibition games. He attributed his problems in 
part to the new NFL rule requiring untouched footballs be used in 
kicking situations, which made kicking more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything mechanical with myself,'' Bidwell said last  
week. ``I'm kicking the way I always do. It's just an adjustment I 
have to make to the pro game. I know I've got to make it quickly, 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson, who played at Marshall, signed as a free agent with  
Cleveland last April and averaged 43.7 yards on 10 punts in three 
exhibition games for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Chris Reed, a first-year player from Abilene  
Christian, was waived to make room for Hanson on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Landeta, the Packers' punter in the previous three seasons,  
signed with Philadelphia in the offseason. Bidwell beat out 
journeyman Will Brice for Green Bay's top job last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf's announcement about Bidwell's surgery came late Wednesday  
afternoon -- only two days after former Packers defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmur died from cancer in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just found out this afternoon,'' team president Bob Harlan  
said shortly after the announcement. ``I talked to Ron and he told 
me about the surgery. We're awaiting the results.''

<HEADLINE>  Lemieux Takeover of Penguins OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that he's back in the NHL as an owner, Mario  
Lemieux has plenty of ideas about how to make hockey more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	First things first, though. His initial priorities center around  
making the Pittsburgh Penguins more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, that means lower ticket prices and,  
eventually, a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make it more (reasonable) for families and young  
kids to come back to the Civic Arena,'' Lemieux said Wednesday 
after the NHL's Board of Governors approved his takeover of the 
team with partners. 
</P>
<P>
	A new arena will be necessary to keep the team in Pittsburgh,  
Lemieux said. The Penguins currently play in the 38-year-old Civic 
Arena, oldest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the highest-paid player in the league when he starred  
in Pittsburgh, said he will also turn his attention to keeping his 
players' salaries as low as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do,'' said Lemieux, whose $13 million  
contract one season was higher than the combined total made by the 
next two players on the NHL salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a Hall of Famer who won six scoring titles and led the  
Penguins to Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992, also said 
he would like to see more scoring in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I did best,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we can find a  
way to make the game higher scoring. We have to see what we can do 
to open the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, of course, was the league's most ardent critic in this  
regard before retiring in 1997. He felt that skill players were 
hampered by suffocating defenses and a lack of effort by the league 
to crack down on pesky holding penalties that didn't allow players 
to skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Scoring has been down dramatically in the NHL in the '90s,  
prompting the league to rethink its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, without being specific, said he would ``do anything I  
can to improve the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He already has just by his presence, according to NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all feel good about the Penguins in Pittsburgh,''  
Bettman said. ``Having (Lemieux) at the board level will be a 
positive, good for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's approval came during a Board of Governors meeting that  
was otherwise devoted to general business. Lemieux received a warm 
reception from the owners when he stepped into the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of respect for Lemieux as a player,'' Bettman  
said. ``They were delighted that the effort was made, as he had 
done it, to keep hockey in Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's takeover climaxed a long struggle by the former hockey  
great and his associates to keep the team in Pittsburgh. Only court 
approval remains to finalize the deal, and that's expected to be 
taken care of by a bankruptcy judge during a hearing Friday in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins went into bankruptcy last season and were only able  
to meet their payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision by the board made it just under the wire  
for the Penguins. They're due to open training camp on Saturday and 
will play their first exhibition game on Sept. 11 against the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering more than  
a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to raise 
more money. He said the market value of the Penguins is currently 
$85 million, the price of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has the largest stake in the team, most of it coming  
from the $25 million in deferred salary the Penguins owed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important for me to keep the Penguins in  
Pittsburgh,'' Lemieux said. ``That's why I decided to put the group 
together. I have spent more than 15 years of my life in Pittsburgh, 
and I have a good relationship with the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is the first retired player to take over ownership in  
one of the four major North American pro sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited about the opportunity to come back,'' Lemieux  
said. ``This is a dream come true, after 10 months working on the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea it would be this difficult. I'm glad we were  
finally able to put this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arena lease with SMG, a Philadelphia-based company,  
accounted for much of the delay in Lemieux's takeover. Under the 
lease, SMG will continue to control the Civic Arena until 2004, 
when it will revert to Lemieux, with SMG as the arena manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins blamed the high cost of their lease with SMG to  
play at the Civic Arena for helping push the franchise into 
bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Adidas, NCAA Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by Adidas  
America Inc. to keep the NCAA from limiting the size of commercial 
logos on uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland, Ore., subsidiary of the European apparel and  
footwear company filed suit in November in U.S. District Court in 
Kansas City, Kan., saying the NCAA's bylaw limiting the size and 
number of logos on uniforms violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber in March denied the  
company's motion for a preliminary injunction, and in an order 
filed last week dismissed the lawsuit, the NCAA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important decision for the NCAA and for  
intercollegiate athletics,'' NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said. 
``The judge agreed with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adidas has many other opportunities to get its message across  
to consumers other than on the backs of college players,'' Dempsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed in the ruling. We are going to ask the  
judge to reconsider it and if that is unsuccessful we will file an 
appeal,'' said Adidas spokesman John Fread. ``It has been a very 
complicated lawsuit regarding trademarks and logos and we feel the 
principle is worth pursuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bylaw restricts member schools to selling space for only a  
single manufacturer's logo or mark on apparel and limits it to 2 1/4 
square inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas' logo consists of three parallel stripes down the arms  
and legs of apparel. The company said the distinctive mark cannot 
fit in the area set out by the NCAA rule. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court said Adidas, which advertises with NFL, NBA, WNBA  
and Major League Soccer and baseball teams, did not show it had 
been hurt by the NCAA rule.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 21 Years for Killing Cat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man who shot his cat to death because it  
hissed at him was sentenced to 21 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Wesela, 48, was convicted in May of being a felon in  
possession of a gun. The judge cited Wesela's 26-year criminal 
record when he sentenced him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He killed the cat in January after an argument with his wife,  
whom he accused of having an affair. According to testimony, Wesela 
first threatened her with the gun, firing a shot into the ceiling. 
Later the same day, he became upset with the cat because it hissed 
at him and shot the pet as it hid under a bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his past crimes, said assistant U.S. attorney Paul Kanter:  
armed robbery, beating a man with a tire iron, hitting an 
undercover agent with a bottle during a drug-related robbery, 
hitting two people in a car wash and damaging a public works 
vehicle with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have this pattern, it's more than just killing a  
cat,'' U.S. District Judge Rudolph T. Randa said. Wesela was tried 
in federal court as part of ``Project Triggerlock,'' a 
federal-local program aimed at gun possession by felons.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya-Trinidad Fight Hyped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight is being hyped as the  
greatest non-heavyweight championship bout since Sugar Ray Leonard 
beat Thomas Hearns 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree this fight is going to surpass any heavyweight  
championship fight in the last 15 or 20 years,'' De La Hoya said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The welterweight title match between De La Hoya and Trinidad on  
Sept. 18 at Las Vegas certainly looks like it should be a dandy -- a 
fight between two unbeaten welterweight champions, just as Leonard 
and Hearns were when they met on Sept. 16, 1981, at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It saw it on tape a few years ago, and it was good fight,'' De  
La Hoya said of the Leonard-Hearns bout, which took place when he 
was 8 years old without boxing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th-round knockout by WBC champion Leonard of WBA champion  
Hearns was a great fight -- a match of ebb and flow between two men 
who could jab, move and punch with power. It will be remembered not 
because a man with a fan on his back crashed against the ring or a 
fighter bit a piece off his opponent's ear, but because of the high 
level of skill demonstrated, because of the outcome right to the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, the WBC champion, and Trinidad, the IBF champ, are  
two of the most talented fighters in the world today, but to expect 
them to match the Leonard and Hearns of that September night in 
1981 might not be fair. 
</P>
<P>
	It does, however, have all the qualities of the kind of match  
that whet's a boxing buff's appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	It sells itself, unlike two upcoming heavyweight matches -- Mike  
Tyson, probably against Orlin Norris on Oct. 23, and the 
championship rematch between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield on 
Nov. 13, both at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoting Tyson now is a matter of selling brass for gold, and  
you have to wonder how much longer Tyson can be sold on his past 
reputation, now badly tarnished, especially against a 
sleeping-potion opponent like Norris. In fact, the bout would not 
be a pay-per-view match. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Lewis-Holyfield, the first fight on its own merits did  
not justify a rematch. It was a bout between a big man (Lewis), who 
has not demonstrated the fire-in-the-belly approach to fighting 
that excites fans, against and an opponent who said he wasn't 
feeling well that night. 
</P>
<P>
	What Holyfield might have been feeling was 36 years of age, plus  
many years of tough fights. That combination adds up to an old 
fighter, and he will not be younger Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	If either man had won, a rematch would have been a much harder  
sell that it will be as a result of inept judging that resulted in 
a majority draw rather than the win Lewis deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Come to think of it, it would be great if De La Hoya-Trinidad  
just come close to being as great as Leonard-Hearns.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Plans Less Asia Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The World Bank expects loan disbursements to  
Asian countries to fall dramatically in the fiscal year ending in 
June 2000 because the region is moving toward economic recovery, a 
bank official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Michel Severino, the bank's vice president for East Asia  
and the Pacific region, said the bank lent $6.2 billion to Asian 
governments in fiscal 1999 and expects that amount to drop by as 
much as a third this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As Asia's countries regain economic health and attract capital  
flows and market liquidity, the need for crisis-lending should 
diminish, meaning that the role of the World Bank in Asia will 
change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at the stage where recovery is there, but still  
fragile,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Structural and long-term solutions to problems must now be  
addressed as the crisis is being mastered,'' Severino said in 
Singapore, where the World Bank was opening a new office. 
</P>
<P>
	The office will be a liaison with local and regional private and  
public sector groups to develop a long-term strategy for the bank 
in the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic and financial volatility that we have all  
witnessed in the past two years have set back the poverty-reduction 
efforts that have been so promising the region,'' he said. ``The 
crisis underlined a fundamental truth: that economic growth must be 
sustainable institutionally, socially, environmentally and 
culturally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Severino said Asia's economies still have much to accomplish in  
terms of restructuring and reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``As economies re-emerge, countries have to be prepared to  
regain competitiveness,'' he said, adding that what is lacking so 
far is private investment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the World Bank and its advisory and consultancy  
expertise will take on greater important -- ``soft activities'' that 
will take the place of lending activities, he said.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers already know they will be  
playing before sellout crowds at their first four home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's newest team, which has sold nearly 13,000 season

<P>
	``The response has been tremendous and is consistent with the  
community's overall support of this team,'' said Derek Schiller, 
vice president of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers are selling individual tickets only for the first  
19 games on their home schedule. Seats for the remaining 22 home

<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Phi Beta Doc won the Saranac  
Handicap in track-record time on Wednesday, beating favored 
Monarch's Maze by 2 1/4 lengths in the 92nd running of the $111,700 
stake for 3-year-olds on turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Phi Beta Doc, ridden by Ramon Dominguez, went 1 3-16 miles in

<HEADLINE> ITF Applauds Drug Ruling Vs. Korda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The governing body of tennis says the decision  
to uphold the action against Petr Korda strengthens its stance on 
drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole case hasn't been about the ITF vs. Petr Korda,''  
Deborah Jevans, executive director for medicine of the 
International Tennis Federation, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been about the whole integrity of the sport and its  
anti-doping program. If we find ourselves whereby `I don't know' is 
a valid and acceptable excuse for a player to have a banned 
substance in their body, then, to be honest, there's little point 
in testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That essentially was Korda's explanation when traces of the  
steroid Nadrolone were found in his system after he lost in the 
quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When an independent appeals committee, a three-person panel of  
medical, technical and legal experts, accepted the explanation, the 
ITF appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The appeal was 
upheld Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ITF lawyer Darren Bailey said the arbitration panel did not  
accept Korda's account that he did not know how the substances got 
into his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player couldn't establish the relevant circumstances in  
which the offense occurred, and therefore, he was unable to 
establish the reasonableness of his action,'' Bailey said. ``In 
those circumstances, he was unable to rely on the exceptional 
circumstances provision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said the decision makes the players more responsible for  
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a key component of the decision,'' he said. ``In the  
future, players will be accountable for having to identify what 
substances entered the body and how it happened. I think that's an 
important lesson because it reinforces the responsibility on all 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Young, general counsel for the ATP Tour, said the Korda  
case would lead to some changes in the ITF drug program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased the decision has helped clarify the  
interpretation of the rule as we always said it should be 
interpreted,'' he said. ``However, we also think it's prudent to 
look at the specifics and make some adjustments in the language to 
help avoid this in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda, winner of the 1998 Australian Open and once No. 2 in the  
world, retired from tennis after failing to qualify at Wimbledon in 
June. His penalty for the drug offense is forfeiture of all his 
ranking points and tennis earnings from the time of the offense. 
That comes to more than $660,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's writing the check right now,'' Jevans said.

<HEADLINE> Workers Fight English-Only Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carlos Solero couldn't believe his ears when his  
bosses started reprimanding him for speaking Spanish on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I was singing to myself or just mumbling, I would get  
a warning,'' the 31-year-old assembly-line worker says of the 
``English only'' policy his bosses instituted at a suburban Chicago 
manufacturing plant two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the policy was needed to improve communication  
on its assembly line. Eventually, Solero was asked to sign a work 
agreement that included the policy -- but refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, 'You cannot shut me up,''' says Solero, who was  
fired three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he and seven other Spanish-speakers -- and the federal Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission -- have filed lawsuits against 
Watlow Batavia, a metal-casting and assembly plant in Batavia, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say it's part of a growing movement against  
employers who try to force workers to speak English on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see more and more of these types of  
lawsuits, especially as the population of immigrants grows and more 
languages are spoken in the workplace,'' says Jose Behar, an EEOC 
attorney handling the agency's lawsuit against Watlow. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints filed by the EEOC against companies with English-only  
polices have nearly tripled in the last three years, according to 
an agency spokesman. Ninety-one were filed nationwide last year, 
compared with 32 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that English-only policies are illegal. Companies can  
have them as long as they can prove they are a ``business 
necessity'' -- say, in an air-traffic control tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, say Behar and others, some companies are taking it  
too far -- and instituting policies often because they simply want 
to know what their employees are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's some type of health and safety at stake, those  
are situations where English only should be required. But in the 
vast majority of jobs, there really is no justification,'' says 
Donya Fernandez, an attorney with the Language Rights Project, a 
San Francisco-based organization that serves as a resource for 
workers who either can't or sometimes prefer not to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the organization helped work out an agreement at an  
Emeryville, Calif., casino where kitchen cooks were told they had 
to speak English, even though they all spoke Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
	Human resource officials agree they're having to deal more often  
with candidates who speak other languages as technology companies 
increasingly are recruiting from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hawn, a computer industry headhunter for Cleveland-based  
Management Recruiters, says he's often asked to find candidates who 
speak another language -- most recently, a request for a 
Korean-speaking computer systems engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's also seen a language backlash. He says a hiring manager  
at a Fortune 100 company in New York recently asked him not to send 
any more candidates with strong accents for an Internet hardware 
sales position. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was really pushing the envelope of EEOC laws. I was really  
uncomfortable,'' says Hawn, who complained to the manager's 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Watlow defend their English-only policy, which they  
say was temporary and part of an overall plan to improve an 
assembly department in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing against speaking any other language as long as  
the customer's needs are being met ... But the department was 
experiencing problems where we thought communication was only one 
of many issues,'' said Diana Rader, the human resources manager for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers in the assembly department spoke Spanish,  
she concedes. ``(But) when you had supervisors and customers coming 
in and trying to help solve the problems, the common language was 
English,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases against Watlow Batavia are expected to be heard in  
U.S. District Court in Chicago early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, rulings have been mixed. The U.S. Supreme Court  
refused to review a federal appeals court's 1994 decision that 
allowed a South San Francisco, Calif., meatpacker to continue using 
its English-only policy -- a ruling President Clinton opposed. But 
in January, a federal judge in Chicago ruled in favor of 200 
workers who fought an English-only policy at Synchro-Start 
Products, a Niles, Ill., manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Solero has gotten a job as a line worker at  
another suburban Chicago company, Kraft Foods Inc., where he says 
he's free to speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the United States. I understand that,'' says Solero,  
who grew up in Puerto Rico and now lives in Aurora, Ill. ``But when 
I'm talking to another Hispanic person, why shouldn't I be able to 
speak my own language?''

<HEADLINE> IRS Reviews Cash-Balance Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics of a popular new kind of pension plan  
said Wednesday a confidential Internal Revenue Service memo 
bolsters their claims that the plans violate age-discrimination 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the IRS district office in  
Cincinnati raised questions about ``cash-balance'' plans that bear 
out ``what I and others have been saying: If the rate of accrual 
goes down as workers get older, then the plan violates the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is among 40 members of Congress who have requested an  
investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 
the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo, dated September 1998 and released this week by  
Sanders, says that the cash-balance plan at an unnamed company 
``does not satisfy the clear and straightforward requirement'' of 
age bias law because the benefit accrual rate ``decreases as a 
participant attains each additional year of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar plan adopted July 1 by IBM has triggered protests from  
some of the computer giant's workers around the country. About 700 
IBM workers at a microchip plant in Essex Junction, Vt., attended a 
Sanders town meeting on the issue earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``On its face, it seems to me that there is real question about  
the legality of IBM's actions,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM spokeswoman Jana Weatherbee said that while some workers  
oppose the new plan it is essential for the company to keep pace 
with benefits packages offered by competitors like Intel and 
Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still spend the same amount of money on our people, but we  
shifted some money from the pension plan to cash compensation and 
stock options,'' she said. ``The predominant work model today is 
that you don't spend your whole career at one company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 companies have converted to the cash-balance  
pension plans, which can reduce costs by cutting future benefits to 
middle-aged workers while allowing younger workers to take a larger 
payout if they depart before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the losers in these plans are workers with 15 or  
more years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Under more traditional defined-benefit pension plans, workers  
receive the maximum amount based on length of service and their 
level of salary in final years before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS gets involved in pension plans because corporate  
contributions are tax deductible. The Cincinnati memo involves only 
one unidentified company and asks the IRS to set a national policy, 
but that has not yet been done. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and others want the IRS to halt all approvals until the  
age bias allegations are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the serious and unresolved age discrimination questions  
that exist, the service (the IRS) should not bless these 
arrangements,'' the 40 House members said in their letter.

<HEADLINE> New Panda Cub Has Public Wowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Michelle Forbes and her two children arrived at  
the San Diego Zoo on a mission -- they wanted see the newborn giant 
panda. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere they looked, pandas stared them in the face, from  
stuffed toy animals and poster-size cut-outs to coffee cups, key 
chains and T-shirts emblazoned with black-and-white pandas. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the closest she ever got to the as-yet-unamed cub.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this monumental event, but an event you can't  
experience,'' said Mrs. Forbes of Apple Valley, staring at a $10 
ceramic panda figurine in the zoo gift shop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pandamonium -- er, pandemonium -- has taken over since the Aug. 21  
birth of the celebrity cub, the first in the Western Hemisphere in 
nearly a decade and one of the few births in captivity for the 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	But the zoo research team has put the mother and cub off limits,  
in hopes the mom won't get upset and endanger the cub. Since no one 
has gotten close enough to determine gender, it's known around the 
zoo as ``the offspring'' or ``the baby panda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daily newspaper and nightly television updates have only served  
to whet the public's appetite. Snippets of the hairless newborn -- 
about the size of a stick of butter -- have come from video footage 
taken from hidden cameras in the panda pen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to do anything to disturb the mothering  
process,'' said Dr. Barbara Durrant, a reproductive physiologist 
overseeing the health of the mother and cub. 
</P>
<P>
	The tree-lined canyon road leading to the panda research center  
and exhibit has been closed and a guard posted. Small signs ask 
visitors to lower their voices in the ``Baby panda bear zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo has even suspended nightly laser and slide shows at a  
nearby amphitheater to keep the noise down. ``It doesn't seem to 
bother that many people. Most understand the importance of it,'' 
said zoo spokeswoman Sarah Marai. 
</P>
<P>
	The cub's mother, Bai Yun (pronounced BUY-yoon), and father,  
16-year-old Shi Shi (pronounced SHE-SHE), are on loan from China 
for 12 years. When the cub is named, it will reflect its heritage, 
Durrant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Video footage -- and the zoo's Internet site -- shows 213-pound  
Bai Yun in a semi-dormant state, constantly holding the gray cub 
and rarely leaving their small den. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, zoo officials breathlessly reported that Bai Yun, who  
turns age 8 on Tuesday, left the den to eat a bamboo meal for the 
first time since the birth. Mom has gone for water twice, but she 
hadn't eaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been following it every day on the news,'' said Ann  
Scott of Poway, Calif., whose 7-year-old daughter, Heather Jones, 
arrived at the zoo with one question: ``Where's the panda bear? I 
want to see the panda bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo attendance is down slightly this summer, but it's unclear if  
it has anything to do with the closed panda exhibit, Ms. Marai 
said. That will change when the cub goes on display, she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The newborn is actually the nation's fifth panda birth. In the  
1980s, under the full glare of the national media, a panda pair at 
the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., failed to produce a surviving 
cub despite four births spread over four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Like her offspring, Bai Yun was herself artificially  
inseminated. Shi Shi, who has never reproduced in captivity, seemed 
to lack any interest in mating. There are only about 1,000 giant 
pandas left in existence. 
</P>
<P>
	For Angela Carr of Chicago, the rarity of the San Diego birth  
was enough to bring her 5-year-old son Jeremy to the zoo for a 
chance at a peek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the novelty of it -- a baby panda. We've never  
seen one,'' Mrs. Carr said. ``We wanted to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy just shrugged his shoulders upon learning no cub would be  
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see the tigers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pledges Aid to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS CENTER, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush spelled out  
a farm aid package he said would bolster ``the heart of our 
economy'' even as he collected the backing of key rural activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's farm package included short-term fixes like emergency aid  
and special tax-free savings accounts, ideas Congress already is 
considering, and also proposed ways to boost agricultural exports, 
the key to long-term prosperity, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to farmers to see them through the transition  
period,'' said Bush. ``Crises come and go, but commitments don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that blocking China's admission to the World Trade  
Organization was a costly mistake and that European allies should 
be pressured to lift restrictions on genetically altered 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't appreciate unfair trade barriers,'' said Bush. ``We  
want to compete and we want to compete on level ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the state for the first time since winning a  
high-profile straw poll last month, Bush not only collected the 
formal endorsements of more than 100 farm activists and leaders, 
but more than half the Republicans in the Iowa Legislature as well 
</P>
<P>
	Though the endorsements reinforce Bush's front-runner status in  
the Republican presidential race leading up to Iowa's precinct 
caucuses, he said, ``I've got a lot to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush donned a green cap, and stood amid hay bales on a farm just  
outside Des Moines to spell out his trade proposals, an important 
issue in a state where the farm economy is sour. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmers are expected to export $49 billion worth of  
commodities this year, down from the peak of $59.8 billion three 
years ago. The Agriculture Department is expecting only slight 
improvement in 2000. Economists blame the decline on the Asian 
economic crisis and a worldwide glut of grain.

<HEADLINE> No Second Chances for Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rich Garcia didn't want sympathy, not at that moment, anyway. He  
would have settled for a little understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia stood at a pay phone outside a Philadelphia courtroom,  
waiting to find out whether he and 21 other umpires still had the 
jobs they sweated and sacrificed for, and in his case, labored at 
for 25 years, loving nearly every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Tuesday. Garcia had to wait Wednesday as well after the  
court hearing again failed to produce a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has bills. Everybody has kids in school,'' Garcia  
said. ``Anybody who works for a living understands what that's 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they don't understand,'' he added, ``is why we did what  
we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Garcia and just about every other umpire in the union did  
was hand in their resignations to major league baseball in 
mid-July. They became effective Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass-resignation scheme, hatched by bellicose union boss  
Richie Phillips, might go down as the dumbest negotiating ploy in 
the long and messy history of labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	With the umpires contract expiring Dec. 31. Phillips feared a  
lockout and was looking for a way around the no-strike provision in 
the existing contract. Why he chose professional suicide is still 
anybody's guess, because by resigning voluntarily, the umps 
surrendered what little protection federal labor law extends. 
</P>
<P>
	When they got the news, the suits running baseball could hardly  
believe their good fortune. Without explaining the rhyme or reason, 
American League president Gene Budig sent letters to nine umps 
accepting their resignations; his NL counterpart, Len Coleman, 
mailed pink slips to an additional 13. Then baseball hired 25 minor 
league umpires to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was a lawyer's dream. The umpires filed a lawsuit  
July 26, but withdrew it just ahead of baseball's request to 
dismiss. Their union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the 
National Labor Relations Board, which Daniel Silverman, the NLRB's 
New York agency regional director, said could be decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the umpires went back to court Monday, asking U.S.  
District Judge J. Curtis Joyner to issue an injunction preventing 
baseball from letting the 22 go. Instead of a hearing, seven hours 
of conferences ensued -- with the legal meters running -- while 
Joyner put the matter off until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part,'' Garcia said, ``is that people are  
laughing, saying, `Hey, you resign, you lose your job.' Well, all 
we were trying to do was get baseball to the bargaining table. It 
didn't work. But none of us saw what was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my job,'' he said. ``It's all I've ever wanted to do.  
It's been hard enough on the veterans, but we've got some young 
guys who waited years for their shot, and now their necks are on 
the block, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint argues the integrity of baseball will be harmed  
unless the best and most experienced umpires work the games, but 
the union was not beyond a sympathy plea, either. The legal brief 
before Joyner lists all the umpires scheduled for termination, 
along with their marital status and the number of children and 
grandchildren they have. There are sad stories spilling out behind 
each and every name. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like 52-year-old Jim Evans and 50-year-old Greg Kosc, are  
probably too old to take up a new line of work. A relative 
youngster, Ed Hickox worked the minors for 17 years before getting 
his callup to the big leagues at the start of this season. His 
payback for all that time away from family, for staying in cheap 
motels and working the far-flung, dimly lighted corners of the 
baseball universe, was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder, then, that Hickox broke into tears the other night  
during an interview with ESPN, trying to explain how much it meant 
to him to work a game close to home with his two small daughters 
looking on proudly from the stands. And then there's perhaps the 
saddest story of all, of umpire Drew Coble, about to lose not just 
his job, but his wife to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of us has a family that's going to be hurt,'' Garcia  
said. ``And every one of us loves baseball. I look back at what got 
us here and I think, `Yeah, we did it, but somebody would have to 
be nuts to take us seriously.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the cruel way that his business often works, Garcia became  
perhaps the best-known umpire working when he blew a call in right 
field in the AL playoff between the Orioles and Yankees three 
seasons ago. Then, a 13-year-old New Yorker named Jeff Maier leaned 
over the railing and helped turn a warning-track fly ball into a 
hometown home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia regretted it then. But it's no longer the one call he  
wishes he could make all over again.

<HEADLINE> Study Calculates El Nino Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overall the El Nino weather phenomenon of  
1997-98 produced more benefits than destruction for the United 
States, according to a new analysis by climatologist Stanley A. 
Changnon. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is his rundown of the good and bad, reported in the  
September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad Nino:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lives lost, 189 including 65 in various southeastern tornadoes,  
42 from February tornadoes in Florida, 28 in the Northeast ice 
storm, 24 in snow and rainstorms, 17 in California storms, 8 
drowned in Texas, 3 drowned while snowmobiling in Michigan and 2 
dead in a Minnesota tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	--Property losses in storms, $2.8 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	--Federal government relief, $400 million.  
</P>
<P>
	--State assistance, $125 million.  
</P>
<P>
	--Agricultural losses, $600 million to $700 million.  
</P>
<P>
	--Lost sales in snow removal equipment, $60 million to $80  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tourist industry losses, $180 million to $200 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Good Nino:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lives saved 848, including 757 who survived extreme cold, 14

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Mixed, Tokyo Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday, but  
the region's largest exchange, Tokyo, surged ahead amid speculation 
the Japanese government will intervene to stop the yen from rising 
further against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up  
365.92 points, or 2.1 percent, at 17,802.48. It had fallen 482.41 
points, or 2.69 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing talk about government intervention to stop the  
Japanese yen's rise boosted export and banking stocks, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But currency traders were less optimistic and sold the dollar as  
they saw no signs that the Bank of Japan was buying the greenback 
to prop it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at its lowest level since January. Late  
Wednesday, the dollar bought 109.22 yen, down 0.96 yen from 110.18 
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
109.59 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar last traded below 110 yen in Tokyo on Jan. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	A strong local currency could hurt the country's economy by  
making its exports more expensive abroad, and thus less 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices finished moderately higher, although  
bigger early gains were wiped out by heavy selling in companies 
with close ties to mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed up 61.42 points, or 0.5  
percent, at 13,544.19. The Hang Seng had fallen 1.5 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, the key index reached a seven-week high as investors  
continued to snap up semiconductor shares on expectations that 
sector will continue to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index rose 115.60 points, or 1.4 percent, to  
8,273.33, the highest level since July 12, when the index ended at 
8,463.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, shares plunged on rumors that some of Hyundai  
Group's executives were arrested for manipulating stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kospi index fell 32.36 points, or 3.5 percent, to 905.52.  
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Yonhap News Agency later confirmed that  
prosecutors were planning to arrest Hyundai Securities Co. Chairman 
Lee Ik-chi on stock manipulation charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also are barring nine executive of the  
conglomerate, including Lee, from leaving South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stocks fell as the precipitous fall of its  
currency, the baht, against the dollar added to negative sentiment 
on the banking sector. The SET index lost 5.71 points, or 1.3 
percent, to 434.56, 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares rebounded from recent losses, but  
trading was thin amid recent political and economic uncertainties. 
The Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite index rose 0.8 percent, or 
4.750 points, to 571.776. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares slumped on selling by foreign  
fund managers. The Composite index fell 14.5 points, or 1.8 
percent, to 752.91 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks fell for the fifth straight session on  
concerns over U.S. and domestic interest rates. The PSE index fell 
21.06 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,152.76. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Singapore shares rose slightly, but sentiment  
remained weak after the 1.6 percent fall Tuesday. The Straits Times 
Index rose 5.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,122.34. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares rose, as strengthening base metal  
prices lifted demand for mining stocks. The All Ordinaries Index 
closed at 2,997.4, up 45.5 points, or 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed nearly flat amid a lack of  
clear leads. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 2.54 points, or 0.1 
percent, to 2,150.08.

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Falls in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending fell unexpectedly in  
July, declining 0.5 percent, a sign that one of the economy's 
strongest sectors is beginning to slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that spending fell to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $695.7 billion. In June, 
construction spending fell slightly, according to revised figures. 
Previously the government estimated that spending had actually 
increased 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	July's spending decrease was worse than many analysts'  
expectations. They were forecasting that spending would actually go 
up a sizable 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity -- driven by low  
mortgage rates -- were a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	To slow down the economy and prevent inflation, the Federal  
Reserve last week bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a point, 
making borrowing more expensive. The Fed hinted additional rate 
increases may not be needed this year unless the economy shows 
signs of overheating or inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates are starting to weigh on the minds of more  
Americans. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of 
consumer confidence -- which measures consumers' likeliness to spend 
-- fell for the second straight month in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising mortgage rates took a bite out of the housing market in  
July. Existing-home sales fell 3.9 percent, while sales of new 
homes rose a slight 0.1 percent but still reached the 
second-highest level ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction report showed that spending on all private  
construction projects fell 0.7 percent in July, following a tiny 
increase in June. In July, Private construction totaled $545 
billion, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. However, spending 
on hotels and motels, and office buildings showing increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on government projects rose 0.3 percent to a seasonally  
adjusted annual rate of $150.7 billion, after falling slightly in 
June. Government spending on schools and other educational 
facilities, conservation and development systems and water supply 
plants all showed decreases. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on all residential projects fell 0.8 percent in July to  
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $319 billion with spending on 
single-family homes down while spending on apartments was up.

<HEADLINE> French Check 2 Retail Chains' Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French stock market watchdog said today it  
would look into a rise in share prices of Carrefour and Promodes 
before the two French retail chains announced their merger earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will examine trading in Carrefour and Promodes shares ahead  
of and after the takeover offer,'' the Operations Commission of the 
Bourse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such surveillance is normal following large mergers and does not  
mean an investigation will be launched. In the past month, the 
watchdog commission has said that it would look into several 
mergers, including the proposed creation of aluminum giant 
Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup, which would be formed by the combination of 
Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Aluminium, French company Pechiney 
and Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly stock deal between Carrefour and Promodes announced  
Monday -- valued at about $16.3 billion -- would create the world's 
second largest retail group, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Promodes shares rose 6.7 percent Friday in heavy trading volume  
while Carrefour shares rose nearly 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carrefour-Promodes operation will have a market  
capitalization of about $49 billion and expected annual sales of 
more than $50 billion. However, it will still be much smaller than 
Wal-Mart, which had sales of $140 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups are primarily food retailers, with several  
well-known supermarket chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have mentioned both Carrefour and Promodes as potential  
prey for Wal-Mart. The U.S. giant, based in Bentonville, Ark., has 
already made two acquisitions in Germany and most recently, it 
bought the British supermarket chain Asda Group PLC.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wants Credit Suisse Back Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese tax authorities have ordered the Swiss  
bank Credit Suisse to pay millions of dollars in taxes it allegedly 
evaded, Japan's NHK television said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The order comes after regulatory officials announced in July  
that Credit Suisse's Japanese banking license will be revoked in 
November because it helped Japanese companies hide losses, then 
obstructed investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse allegedly sold financial products to about 60  
Japanese corporations to help them hide losses from regulators and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse has said it discovered and reported to authorities  
that some employees were delaying the lengthy probe into the 
scandal. The bank also apologized and dismissed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	As the case progressed, Tokyo tax officials discovered that  
Credit Suisse hid $23 million in profits from the shady 
transactions, and the tax officials ordered the bank to pay $9.2 
million in back taxes, NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, Credit Suisse spokeswoman Karin Rhomberg confirmed  
that the bank must pay back taxes in Japan, but declined to 
disclose the amount. She said the payment is unconnected to the 
scandal and is the result of a normal tax inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaharu Hino, the head of the Financial Supervisory Agency,  
said in Tokyo that Credit Suisse employees may face criminal 
charges for obstructing the probe. The agency supervises financial 
markets.

<HEADLINE> Denver Officials Renewing Oaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Mayor Wellington Webb and 16 other city officials  
have had to retake the oath of office because the judge who swore 
them in wasn't empowered to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, elected to a third term in May, thought he and his  
colleagues were sworn in on July 19. But former U.S. District Judge 
Sherman Finesilver, who administered the oath, had lost the right 
to perform the ceremony because he had resigned and gone back into 
private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judges are appointed for life. If you retire, you still have  
judicial authority. He resigned,'' said the mayor's spokesman, 
Andrew Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	The goof was discovered when the federal court in Denver sent  
the signed oaths to Washington to get an official seal. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb and members of the City Council retook the oath on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Finesilver, who also served as a state and county judge,  
questioned whether the second swearing-in was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the city is using an abundance of caution,'' he said.  
``I believe I appropriately administered the oath to city 
officials.''

<HEADLINE> Leyland Reportedly Might Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland, disappointed  
with the performance of his team, is considering retiring as a 
baseball manager, according to a Denver newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland said after 35 years in professional baseball, he no  
longer is certain he has the fire in the belly necessary to lead a 
major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland told The Denver Post he has held recent, serious  
discussions with Rockies owner Jerry McMorris about stepping down 
as manager next month, after his first season on the job in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously considering retiring from managing,'' Leyland  
said Wednesday, before a 9-8 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to discuss the situation after the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than 12 months after he signed a three-year, $6 million  
contract with Colorado, many of his friends in the Rockies' 
organization now believe Leyland is leaning heavily toward 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with having trouble communicating with  
the players. I love my players on this team. And, believe me, it 
has nothing to do with the ownership of this team. I love this 
ownership,'' Leyland said from his clubhouse office, during an 
exclusive interview with The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is simply a case of whether I have all the  
ingredients necessary to do everything it takes to do this job 
anymore. I just don't know. It's something I'm tossing and turning 
about every night. I just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who had high hopes of competing for a playoff spot  
this year, are currently in last place of the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been disappointing,'' said Leyland, who takes full  
responsibility for an underachieving team. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Gebhard resigned under pressure Aug. 20.  
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a point in your life when you've got to decide  
what you really want to do with your life,'' said Leyland, who 
admits to missing his family while traveling during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also asked McMorris if it would be possible for him to  
remain with the organization in a reduced role, with less 
responsibility and constraints on his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Detroit Tigers and Los Angeles Dodgers both  
recruited him before Leyland joined the Rockies a year ago, he 
insisted his departure would indicate the end of a managerial 
career whose highlights have included more than 1,000 major league 
victories and a World Series championship with Florida in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I decide not to manage here in Colorado, I think that would  
be the end of it for me as a manager,'' Leyland said. ``I can 
assure you, I won't be going anywhere else to manage.''

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former St. Louis Blues defenseman Ed Kea, whose  
hockey career was cut short by a head injury, drowned to death 
Tuesday in an accident at his family's summer cottage in Ontario. 
He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Kea played 583 games over 10 seasons in the NHL, scoring 30

</P>
<P>
	The Blues acquired him along with Don Laurence and a draft pick  
in a trade for center Garry Unger on Oct. 10, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He was playing for the Blues' Central Hockey League affiliate in  
Salt Lake City in 1983 when he suffered the injury that ended his 
career. Kea suffered severe head trauma when he fell and hit his

	ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rebel leader promised  
demonstrators today that Russian peacekeepers would not be deployed 
inside their town, while the United Nations decided to station 
international police here until the standoff over the Russians is 
resolved. Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovo Liberation Army, met 
with local leaders in Orahovac and addressed a crowd of local 
ethnic Albanians, who erected barricades over a week ago to prevent 
Russian soldiers from taking up positions in the town. The ethnic 
Albanians claim Russian mercenaries committed atrocities in

tonight in Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Still apparently in prison 
was a Yugoslav CARE worker, Branko Jelen, who was detained along

seven days after NATO launched its bombing campaign to force 
Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo. Jelen was taken into

Israelis and Palestinians approached agreement Wednesday on a 
land-for-security deal that set a one-year deadline for ending 
decades of hostility. On a day marked both by shouted ultimatums 
and grins of optimism, the sides cleared all but one hurdle to 
reviving the U.S.-brokered Wye accord hours before Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright was to arrive in the region. ``There is a 
desire to have peace,'' Albright told reporters as she flew to

Penguins was approved today by the NHL's board of governors, 
climaxing a long struggle by the former hockey great and his 
associates to keep the team in Pittsburgh. Only court approval 
remained to finalize the deal, and that's expected to be taken care 
of by a bankruptcy judge during a closing hearing Friday in 
Pittsburgh. Lemieux said he and his group of investors, numbering 
more than a dozen, have put together $52 million so far and hope to 
raise more money.

<HEADLINE> Amana Recalls Over 5,000 Gas Ovens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amana Appliances is recalling more than 5,000  
gas-fueled, down-draft ovens that have a faulty lock. The oven can 
open during the self-clean cycle, exposing people to high 
temperatures, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission said customers should stop using the  
self-cleaning feature but can continue to use the oven for cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	The oven comes in either black or white. The model number  
AGDS901E or AGDS901WW appears on lower left side behind the utility 
drawer. The cooking surface has two gas burners on the left side 
and a gas grill on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Major department store and appliances stores sold the ovens  
nationwide from October 1995 through July 1999 for between $1,500 
and $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should call Amana for a free replacement of the  
self-clean locking mechanism, at 1-800-266-3535.

<HEADLINE> Many Young Workers Feel Left Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jennie Smith, 28, wonders when she will share  
the rewards of the nation's booming economy, and a new poll by the 
AFL-CIO shows there are many young workers like her. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a masters degree and six years of work experience, Smith  
can't find the job she wants as a community college professor 
because many schools have replaced full-time professorships with 
part-time teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
	She has cobbled together a career teaching classes at community  
colleges in two states -- Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- but earns 
just $15,000 a year with no benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm angry,'' Smith said. ``Clearly it's young people who are  
left out in the cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of young workers surveyed for the AFL-CIO  
poll said they believe large corporations, top management and 
stockholders are doing well, but 42 percent said the economic 
situation facing their own families is either ``just fair,'' ``not 
so good'' or ``poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young workers ``see today's jobs as failing to meet the most  
basic needs: health care, retirement security and time to spend 
with family,'' said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, which was released Tuesday, was commissioned by the  
labor federation as part of a campaign to woo young workers to join 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 752 young working adults, ages 18 to 34,  
was conducted June 10-15 by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. For 
comparison purposes, some questions were also asked of 401 workers 
ages 35 and older. The overall margin of error was plus or minus 4 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those ages 18 to 34, fewer than half -- 45 percent -- rated  
the economy as excellent or good, compared with 58 percent of those 
over age 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Although unemployment is at its lowest rate in nearly three  
decades, 55 percent of young workers said the new jobs available 
are mostly lower-paying. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of young workers -- 58 percent -- said employers  
are falling short when it comes to sharing profits with employees. 
A similar percentage, 55 percent, said companies aren't doing 
enough to provide family-friendly workplace policies. 
</P>
<P>
	And only about four out of 10 young workers said they are  
covered by an employer-sponsored health plan or a retirement plan 
their company contributes to, compared with about six out of 10 
older workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that most young workers are born pessimists or expect  
to advance without paying some dues, the poll found: 
</P>
<P>
	Among those 18 to 24, 62 percent said they believe that with  
education and hard work a person can do well and get ahead. 
However, that drops to 52 percent by the time workers reach their 
early 30s.

<HEADLINE> Three Umps on Tata's Crew Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Choking back tears, Tom Hallion said he hated  
baseball, at least right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hohn said his heart is broken.  
</P>
<P>
	And Terry Tata was too overcome with emotion to speak with  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite a scene in Dodger Stadium on Wednesday night after  
Hallion, Hohn and Tata apparently umpired their final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Milwaukee's 5-4 victory over Los Angeles was  
completed, Hallion walked into the umpires' room with his arm 
around Tata, apparently consoling his crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie umpire Ron Kulpa, the only one of the Tata's four-man  
crew who keeps his job, walked with his colleagues into the room in 
a tightly knit group. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion, Hohn and Tata were three of 22 umpires whose  
resignations were accepted by baseball in the wake of the union's 
unsuccessful attempt to try to force an early start to negotiations 
for a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five umpires who were hired by baseball in July will  
become permanent starting Thursday. Many of them have been vacation 
fill-ins from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess devastated would be the only word that I can use to  
describe my feelings right now,'' the 42-year-old Hallion said. 
``If I was to lose my job because of my work and my performance on 
the field, I could handle that as a human being, as a person and as 
an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to lose your job and be put in this situation. ... It not  
only has broken my heart, but it has devastated me as an 
individual. Right now, I'm sitting here, I just did my last game. 
This is what I want to do, this is what I love to do. I love 
baseball. Right now, I hate baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion, whose father died earlier this year, said he ``had it  
on automatic pilot'' throughout Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head was so far out of that game because of everything I  
was thinking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to saying he has a broken heart, Hohn criticized the  
American League umpires who rescinded their resignations, cracking 
the union's solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've put in a lot of effort and energy to be a fine National  
League umpire,'' he said. ``And to be terminated the way I have 
been, it's hard to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a pitching change in the eighth inning, Hohn, umpiring at  
third base, went into a crouch and, staring at the dirt, seemed to 
be reflecting on the recent events as well as his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got one half of my life dedicated in baseball,'' he  
said.. ``I'm 44 years old. I can't go sell my services anywhere 
else. I mean, my college education was the minor leagues, and 
they're going to throw me out at 44?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several players as well as Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and  
Brewers skipper Jim Lefebvre supported the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see it,'' Johnson said. ``They've probably all  
thrown me out at one time or another, but I know there's a mutual 
respect. We're going to miss them. They're part of the game, just 
like (Raul) Mondesi, (Eric) Karros, (Gary) Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Terry Tata after the game; he said he'd been  
fired. I told him I'd had three of them. Everybody knows they're 
giving you the best they've got. The mood was a little somber, we 
had three in this series, I really like all three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers third baseman Jeff Cirillo said he could tell the  
umpires were downcast throughout the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope everything gets worked out,'' Cirillo said. ``We're  
losing a lot of good umpires. The game will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's kind of a consensus here that some of the umpires have  
been sticking it to us because of Bud Selig. I haven't seen it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before being elected commissioner last summer, Selig was  
president of the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just crazy, what's come out of this thing,'' Dodgers  
catcher Todd Hundley said. ``It's just ridiculous. The umpires got 
some bad advice. It's just too bad, to have all these umpires gone 
is tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the eighth and ninth innings, Dodger Stadium organist  
Nancy Bea Hefley paid tribute to the departing umpires with a few 
choruses of ``I'll Be Seeing You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umps only hope it's true. Their only option now is the  
arbitration agreed to by management.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Spoken to Kids About Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain said Wednesday that he had talked extensively with his 
children about illegal drugs and joked that he had told his 
13-year-old son ``I'd beat him within an inch of his life'' if he 
used them. 
</P>
<P>
	More seriously, McCain said, ``I'm aware of the temptations  
young people are exposed to. I hope my children will not be tempted 
-- and I say that with the full knowledge that some very wonderful 
families and very loving parents have children who have fallen prey 
to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after former first lady Barbara Bush said she had never  
asked her son, front-running Republican candidate George W. Bush, 
whether he had used cocaine, McCain was asked whether he had talked 
to his own children about illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said drugs were not a problem when he was growing up, but he  
is aware of the dangers they cause in today's society and that is 
why he chose to talk to his children about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Joking with reporters, he said, ``I told my 13-year-old son I'd  
beat him within an inch of his life'' if he used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has seven children, has said that he never used  
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the wide-ranging news conference, McCain attempted to clarify  
his position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had assumed a 17-year record of pro-life voting -- and that's  
what people really care about, voting, not talking -- would have 
established my credentials as a pro-life person,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, he said he would ``immediately support  
efforts to move in (the) direction'' of a constitutional amendment 
banning abortion. ``The bottom line is I support the pro-life 
position; I believe life begins at conception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, he worries about deep divisions in  
American society over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned we can't work together to eliminate abortion,  
because it's a terrible situation,'' he said. He advocated 
decreasing legal abortions by encouraging adoption, continuing 
welfare reforms that discourage out-of-wedlock births and improving 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain alarmed antiabortion activists last week when he said he  
would not support immediate passage of a constitutional amendment 
banning abortions, because women would seek illegal and dangerous 
operations. After an outcry, McCain reiterated his general support 
for an amendment, but did not put a timeline on it. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in The Union Leader of Manchester this week accused  
him of ``trying to cater to both sides on a divisive issue,'' and a 
cartoon showed his tour bus zigzagging across the state from 
``Pro-Life Village'' to ``Pro-Abortion Notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criticisms represent a serious challenge to the Arizona  
Republican, who is considering skipping the Iowa caucus and is 
focusing much of his attention on New Hampshire's 
first-in-the-nation primary.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Weakens, Pummels Outer Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVES, N.C. (AP) -- Reduced from a hurricane to a tropical storm,  
Dennis paid a return visit to North Carolina's Outer Banks on 
Wednesday, its pounding waves and gale-force winds cutting Hatteras 
Island in half and thwarting a National Guard relief convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Dennis would probably linger for days off the  
coast, ruining at least the start of the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After battering the coastline Monday, Dennis headed out to sea,  
but on Tuesday it began backtracking. At 2 p.m. Wednesday, it was 
drifting westward at 5 mph, 100 miles from Cape Hatteras, lashing 
the barrier islands with 14-foot waves. The storm's winds were near 
60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of rough surf and rip currents, beaches were closed to  
swimmers as far north as Massachusetts' Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	The pummeling took a toll on 50-mile-long Hatteras Island, which  
was without electricity, telephones and in some cases water, 
because electric pumps were knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 5,000 people, mostly residents, who stayed on the island  
after being ordered to evacuate Sunday were stuck when the only 
north-south highway became impassable. In the village of Hatteras, 
ham radio operators reported extensive flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also cut an 8-foot-deep trench across a neck of land  
between Avon and Buxton. That prevented a National Guard relief 
column from reaching three communities on the south end of the 
island with food, fuel and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy, which included a Humvee, a fuel truck, a wrecker and  
a cargo truck, had braved 4-feet-deep sand that had blown from the 
island's dunes to deliver 3,700 ready-to-eat meals to three fire 
stations before having to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is getting the road clear so we can get some  
help to those people,'' said Sgt. Craig Garriss of the North 
Carolina Highway Patrol. ``They're in dire need of help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard helicopter airlifted a pregnant Hatteras Island  
woman who went into labor Wednesday. No information on her 
condition was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, at least three cars were buried in  
sand up to their door handles in Nags Head. One cottage collapsed 
at Kitty Hawk, and five were reported destroyed at Rodanthe on 
Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Ocracoke Island, immediately south of Hatteras Island,  
flooding was widespread and the roughly 1,000 islanders remained 
without power Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 people live along North  
Carolina's 320-mile coast, and the summer tourist influx swells the 
population to about half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dennis brushed by the Outer Banks the first time,  
vacationers and residents were ordered to evacuate Sunday. Late 
Monday, some returned when Dennis headed into the Atlantic, only to 
have to leave again Tuesday when the storm began backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kinchner of Dover, Del., was one of the Nags Head  
vacationers who tried to stay. On Wednesday, he was packing up, 
strapping a grill, cooler and fishing rods to a rack on his sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping to stick it out,'' he said, ``but it's  
futile.''

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Top Scorer Gets $7.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Markus Naslund, the Vancouver  
Canucks' leading scorer last year, was rewarded for his 
breakthrough season by signing a three-year contract on Wednesday 
worth $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Markus' season last year was the first of several  
quality seasons to come,'' assistant general manager Dave Nonis 
said. ``We don't mind paying at all for guys that put out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old left wing will earn $2.25 million this season,  
$2.35 million next season and $2.6 million in 2001-02. He earned 
$800,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Naslund, a restricted free agent this summer, had career highs  
of 36 goals and 66 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get a little stability with a three-year deal,  
after taking one-year deals the last three years,'' Naslund said 
from his home in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he found ``the joy'' for playing hockey again for the  
first time in many years last season, Naslund is confident he can 
continue to be a consistent offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's going to be pressure, but I honestly like  
pressure,'' said Naslund, who before last year had managed a 
combined 63 goals in his first five seasons in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years before, they really didn't count on me, they really  
didn't care if I was dressed or not, and I really didn't like 
that,'' he said. ``Last year I felt the pressure that I needed to 
score to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted 16th overall by Pittsburgh in 1991, Naslund broke into  
the league in the 1993-94 season with the Penguins. The Canucks 
acquired him in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks, who open training camp Monday, have five remaining  
restricted free agents yet to sign, including defenseman Ed 
Jovanovski and left wing Todd Bertuzzi.

	With his knee in shreds and a newborn daughter at home, the U.S.  
national team's career scoring leader found himself torn between 
family life and resurrecting his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, days away from his Miami Fusion debut, the 30-year-old  
striker has a refreshed outlook leading to Saturday's home game 
with the Los Angeles Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most motivated I've been in years,'' said Wynalda,  
who has yet to play a Major League Soccer game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda tore a ligament in his left knee in March while playing  
for Leon of Mexico's top league. He was on loan to the club, set to 
rejoin the San Jose Clash when the MLS season opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury capped a frustrating stretch that included injuries,  
struggles in San Jose and the U.S. team's embarrassing last-place 
performance at last year's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the first times in my life I really didn't  
care,'' Wynalda recalled. ``I had been so frustrated with 
everything that had happened with the injury and losing in San 
Jose. I was a different person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days he sees the setback as a blessing. The break gave him  
time to reassess his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he was able to attend the birth of his daughter,  
Brooke. If not for the injury, he would have had a game the night 
of her delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our baby was born I told my wife `I don't care if I ever  
play again,''' Wynalda recalled. ``I was at a point where you know 
there is more important things in life than playing this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But like many athletes, it was difficult to stay away. His  
absence lasted about three weeks, and Brooke played a big role in 
that as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened is I got up in the middle of the night and I was  
talking to my wife,'' Wynalda said. ``I told her I want my little 
girl to know what Daddy does and that was it. Ever since then I've 
wanted to get back on the field for her, just so she can see Daddy 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami acquired Wynalda in June as part of a four-team deal. His  
wife, Amy, happened to be wearing a Fusion shirt when Eric got the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming here is what Eric needed,'' Amy said. ``I swear he's  
never been so motivated, so focused, so anxious, so excited to go 
to therapy. It's been hard for him putting so much energy into his 
rehab and tough coming home to be a dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the national team's scoring record, Wynalda also  
holds the distinction of scoring the first goal in MLS history. His 
MLS totals stand at 21 goals and 29 assists in 51 games, but he 
says he has much more to give. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is more important than anything,'' he said. ``To be  
a well-rounded person, I have to be a soccer player. I lost myself 
for various reasons. Maybe now I'm the person I always wanted to 
be.''

<HEADLINE> Critic Dissects TV Ads With Flair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Talk about a pitch man. John Forde can seduce  
you into paying attention to television commercials and then, get 
this, thinking about them. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Forde, a charmingly loose cannon who has fixed  
his aim on the American way of selling, knows how to entertain as 
he encourages us to avoid being patsies with credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental Engineering'' is his vehicle, a new half-hour series  
that is making its way to an increasing number of PBS stations. The 
premise is simple: Forde and his guests, including professors, 
comics and writers, view and critique TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The result isn't exactly argument television a la ``Politically  
Incorrect'' or ``The McLaughlin Group,'' but there is lively 
discussion as panelists zing the manipulative tricks shamelessly 
employed by advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone is Forde, who comes across like Jim Carrey with  
a master's degree. His approach can verge on the scholarly (he was, 
after all, a philosophy major) and the conversation occasionally 
sounds like a self-conscious dorm session. 
</P>
<P>
	But Forde, with a toothy, manic grin that gives him away, prods  
his guests to lighten the mood with smart-minded quips. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing a commercial touting a paper towel's germ-fighting  
abilities, he asks why the bathroom in the ad is shot out of focus. 
So you can't see the overflowing landfill outside the window, 
panelist Kristin Tillotson suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedian Tim Mitchell's ire is stoked by a commercial for an  
economy car that plays on class differences by asking whether rich 
people are ``more entitled to brake safely on a rainy day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are going to fall for this ad, that  
somehow Buick is against the rich. Yeah, 'Buy the new Buick 
Commie-mobile,'' quips Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental Engineering' has its roots in cable access television  
and retains some production minimalism: simple graphics and a spare 
set, and editing that could use a bit more spark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew going into it we needed to make awkward look somewhat  
cool,'' says Forde (pronounced Ford-dee), speaking from St. Paul, 
Minn., where he lives and where the show is taped. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show's heart and head are in the right place, as Forde  
sees it. ``Mental Engineering'' tries to amuse while ensuring that 
advertising, which he considers the dominant propaganda of our 
time, gets the scrutiny it should. 
</P>
<P>
	``The head of one of the biggest advertising firms said the  
purpose of advertising is to get the consumer to live vicariously 
through the brand. ... That's saying, 'This is how we want to get 
people to spend their lives,' '' Forde said. ``That's got a lot of 
gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turns to a text, ``How Advertising Works,'' published by Sage  
Publications, to make another point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's well documented that the function of advertising is to  
increase your satisfaction with the brand you're already using. 
It's about deepening your rut,'' Forde says. 
</P>
<P>
	He himself is definitely anti-rut.  
</P>
<P>
	Forde, 41, passed on a career as a psychologist after deciding  
media would be a better fit. He was encouraged by the press 
secretary to U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who advised Forde 
he could be ``the liberal Rush Limbaugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief stint as an on-air intern with a Twin Cities radio  
talk show -- ``All hostile, all the time,'' jokes Forde -- he signed 
up in 1997 for a class in public access TV. In short order, he 
produced 18 episodes of ``Mental Engineering'' on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by the response, Forde gambled his life savings (with  
his wife's blessing) to make 13 new, slicker episodes. The series 
is airing on PBS stations in cities including Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle, Washington 
D.C., Denver, Omaha, Neb., Indianapolis and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He's searching for funding to do more shows -- warning, however,  
that even underwriters may find their ads under the microscope. 
(Network options beyond noncommercial PBS, of course, would be slim 
and none.) 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Forde hopes that ``Mental Engineering'' will  
encourage viewers to think critically about the world in general, 
beyond advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to model the art and the habit of asking good  
questions, and to do this through this tangible, vivid thing 
(advertising),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	My, my. Who could have guessed TV commercials would be the  
subject of rigorous intellectual analysis? 
</P>
<P>
	``By whom?'' Forde responds, chortling. A salesman to the very  
end. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brister Criticizes Broncos' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- There's trouble in Broncoland.  
</P>
<P>
	Denver's quarterback controversy erupted into angry words  
Wednesday as deposed starter Bubby Brister criticized his head 
coach, even as Brister returned to the practice field and pledged 
his support to new starter Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister said he was ``disappointed'' and ``shocked'' by his  
removal as starter and indicated he probably would have quit the 
team had it been an issue only between him and coach Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	During a remarkably candid news conference, Brister said he felt  
deceived by Shanahan and felt he was being made the ``fall guy'' 
for team-wide breakdowns during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was just between me and Mike, I probably wouldn't have  
come back,'' Brister said. ``But I didn't want to walk out on my 
teammates and my assistant coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how seriously he considered leaving the team, Brister  
said, ``It depends on what time of day it was. When I had a level 
head and thought about it, I knew I couldn't walk out on Romo 
(linebacker Bill Romanowski) and Mac (wide receiver Ed McCaffrey) 
and Brian and the guys. I can't do it. It's not about me and Mike. 
It's about the team and the long road to try to three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe it to my teammates to come back and work hard and be  
ready when they need me. I'm supporting Brian as well as he 
supported me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning announcement Monday, Shanahan said Griese, a  
second-year pro who has yet to start an NFL game, would be the 
starter instead of Brister, who was 4-0 as a starter last season 
while John Elway was injured. Elway subsequently retired after 16 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised like most of you were,'' said Griese, the son  
of Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese. ``But I thought I was going 
to play this year at some point -- not because Bubby was going to 
falter, but because it's a long season. Not a lot of guys can make 
it through the season without getting hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister retreated to his foothills cabin, where he was consoled  
by some teammates, and he met for about an hour on Tuesday with 
Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was clear that some unresolved issues remain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with what happened,'' Brister said. ``I can't  
lie. I am very disappointed. I was shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Informed of Brister's remarks, Shanahan said, ``If he wasn't  
bitter and didn't feel bad, he wouldn't be made up of the right 
stuff. Bubby is a competitor. He's a warrior. He wants to play. I 
want him to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I told Bubby, he's going to come in and play a lot this  
year. Brian Griese will have some growing pains. I think Bubby will 
help our team most coming off the bench, giving us a spark. He's a 
lot more relaxed on a backup role. Bubby is going to win a lot of 
games for us this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Elway's heir apparent, Brister said he never had any  
indication he might lose his job during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had said we were competing for the job, that would  
have been fine,'' the 37-year-old Brister said. ``That wasn't the 
case. I was just biding my time, waiting for the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan disagreed, saying, ``Everybody's job is on the line.  
There's not one position on our team where someone has that 
position won. We evaluate people every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister struggled in three of the Broncos' four exhibition  
games, twice throwing interceptions on his first pass of the game. 
He had no touchdowns and three interceptions, while Griese had six 
touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that performance, Brister said he thought he earned the  
right to start opening day, ``but Mike obviously doesn't feel that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he believed he could work through his dispute with  
Shanahan, Brister said, ``I don't have to work with Mike. Kubes 
(offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Gary Kubiak) is my 
coach. I'm upset with Mike right now, and he's probably upset with 
me. I'm upset for a lot of different reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting he has felt the pressure of replacing Elway, Brister  
tried to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to have to play and help us eventually,'' he  
said. ``It's a long way to Feb. 1. When the smoke clears, we'll see 
what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one Denver player felt Brister's comments were  
ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if challenging Shanahan's autocratic rule ultimately would  
lead to the end of Brister's career with the Broncos, veteran 
safety Tyrone Braxton said, ``I think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does he expect Brister's name on the waiver wire soon? ``No, not  
this year, because we need him and we don't know how Brian is going 
to handle it,'' Braxton said. ``But Mike doesn't forget things like 
that. Let's see what happens later on.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs acquired minor league third  
baseman Cole Liniak from Boston on Wednesday, completing a 
three-player deal that sent reliever Rod Beck to the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Liniak was the player to be named later when the Cubs obtained  
lefty Mark Guthrie for Beck on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Liniak batted .264 with 12 homers and 42 RBIs in  
95 games for Boston's Triple-A affiliate at Pawtucket. He was a

<HEADLINE> Driver Who Killed 27 Is Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA GRANGE, Ky. (AP) -- After spending less than 11 years behind  
bars, the man convicted of the nation's deadliest drunken driving 
accident, a head-on collision that killed 27 people, walked out of 
prison today as a free man. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Mahoney walked down the steps in front of the Kentucky  
State Reformatory, carrying his possession in two brown paper bags. 
He was driven away in a car with tinted windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, now 46, served nine years and six months in prison, and  
spent nearly a year in jail before his trial. He earned his early 
release with good behavior and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, whose blood alcohol content was nearly three times the  
legal limit, drove his pickup truck the wrong direction on 
Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, and slammed into a bus that was 
taking 67 people home from a church outing to an amusement park 
north of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims to have no memory of the crash, learning of it only  
after he woke up in a hospital with his own relatively minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney is believed to be staying with his parents, who live in  
his former hometown of Worthville, in northern Kentucky, said State 
Corrections Department spokeswoman Carol Czirr. 
</P>
<P>
	Karolyn Nunnallee said she is no longer angry at Mahoney for  
taking the lives of her daughter, Patty, but she is deeply 
disturbed about a system that sentenced him to only 16 years in 
prison and released him so early. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors initially considered seeking the death penalty for  
Mahoney, but concluded they could not make it stick. The jury 
convicted him of manslaughter, assault and wanton endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told it would be hundreds of years,'' Mrs. Nunnallee  
said last week. ``So I was really prepared for him to spend his 
life in prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was up for parole in 1997, Mahoney spoke about  
possibly making public appearances to talk about the dangers of 
drunken driving. After he was denied early release, Mahoney refused 
all interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nunnallee, who now lives in Florida, has become a crusader  
as president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She would like to 
see Mahoney join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``His message would be phenomenal,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	State Police Lt. Henry ``Sonny'' Cease, who investigated the  
crash, said Mahoney wants to spend his life the way he spent his 
sentence -- quietly and without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Cease has kept up with Mahoney, often seeing him when he took  
trainees to the prison yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my impression that he wants to blend back into  
society,'' Cease said. ``I think he's done the time that was dealt 
to him and it's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth of Mahoney's sentence was automatically knocked off for  
what is known as ``statutory good time.'' He also earned time off 
for taking courses -- he obtained a GED and took classes in small 
engine repair -- and for keeping his nose clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he served his sentence, Mahoney will not have any  
reporting or conduct requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a free man,'' said Corrections Department spokeswoman  
Carol Czirr. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Mahoney has been the janitor in the ``honor dorm''  
section of the Kentucky State Reformatory, a medium-security 
prison, and has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's paid, as far as what the jury assessed against him,''  
said Paul Richwalsky, who prosecuted Mahoney and objected to the 
original sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this is an indication of what the rest of his life will  
be like,'' he said. ``I hope that we never hear of him or from him 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Pete Rose's Ex-Bookie Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEBANON, Ohio (AP) -- The man who said he was Pete Rose's  
bookmaker has been arrested on charges that include assaulting a 
police officer, a jail official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Peters, 42, was scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing  
Thursday afternoon in Warren County Court, according to the county 
jail in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters is accused of assaulting a Springboro police officer  
about 3 a.m. Tuesday, the Dayton Daily News reported in its 
Thursday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said the officer stopped Peters' car because it  
was weaving. The officer was injured when Peters elbowed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters drove from the scene, but was arrested about five hours  
later by a Warren County sheriff's deputy and taken to the jail, 
about 25 miles northeast of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond was set at $50,000 for Peters, charged with driving under  
suspension, resisting arrest, falsification and the assault charge, 
said a jail official who would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters helped authorities build their case against baseball's  
career hit leader, saying Rose placed bets on baseball, including 
the team he managed, the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose admitted betting through bookies, but denied placing bets  
on baseball. He later pleaded guilty to two felony counts of 
failing to report income from autograph appearances, baseball 
memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was banned from baseball in August 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	Peters served concurrent two-year sentences at a federal prison  
in Terre Haute, Ind., for tax and drug trafficking convictions.

<HEADLINE> Killer Bees Attack Man in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- An 83-year-old beekeeper who did not  
realize his hives were apparently taken over by Africanized 
``killer bees'' was attacked while mowing his lawn and in critical 
condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgil Foster was stung 50 times Tuesday and was not breathing  
when paramedics arrived. He went into cardiac arrest as they worked 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Health department officials estimate Foster's three hives,  
originally set up for more timid European bees, held about 1 
million Africanized honeybees. They also built a hive in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanized bees are not more venomous than other varieties, but  
they are more aggressive and attack in large numbers. They appear 
very similar to European bees, although killer bees have a shorter 
wingspan. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bees are conclusively found to be Africanized, it would  
be their first recorded attack on a person in the county. 
Authorities destroyed the swarm after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the problem with Africanized bees,'' said John Hurley,  
county bee inspector. ``They don't move in mean. They're just like 
a regular bee and then, all of a sudden, they realize, 'we've got 
to defend this.' They're very unpredictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster had more than 60 years of beekeeping experience but had  
largely gotten out of the hobby until recently, when some wild bees 
settled in his hives. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members warned Foster to get rid of the bees because they  
could be Africanized, but he didn't think that was the case, Hurley 
said.

	Dry conditions is giving a boost to soybean futures prices. The  
distressed condition of large portions of the soybean crop is also 
boosting prices.

percent of all U.S. soybeans were in good to excellent condition -- 
a decline of 1 percentage point from a week ago.

<HEADLINE> MIT Student Dies From Laughing Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- On the eve of a new semester another MIT student  
has died from substance abuse, despite efforts by the school to 
prevent such a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1997 drinking death of a freshman, Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology mandated alcohol education for all 
students. They established sanctions and will soon require all 
freshmen to live in campus dorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on Tuesday, a 22-year-old physics major seeking a laughing  
gas high was found dead in his dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Guy, 22, of Mission Viejo, Calif., had apparently used a  
plastic bag to inhale the nitrous oxide. The bag was found on his 
head, a campus spokesman said 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner ruled the MIT junior died from asphyxiation  
as a result of nitrous oxide intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're treating it like an accident and that's because we have  
no evidence of a suicide,'' Ken Campbell, a university spokesman, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, Scott Krueger, an 18-year-old freshman, died  
three days after lapsing into an alcohol-induced coma on the floor 
of a fraternity. The incident drove campus officials to require all 
freshmen to live on campus beginning in fall 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the shock of Scott Krueger has penetrated a great deal  
and this will have a similar effect,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT is known among college administrators as having some of the  
best drug prevention programs anywhere. The school even provides 
literature about inhalants like nitrous oxide to students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the right program is no guarantee that you're not going  
to have a sensational incident like this,'' said Kevin Kruger, 
associate executive director of the National Association of Student 
Personnel Administrators, an organization for campus 
administrators.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gov't Knocks Western Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's government tried Wednesday to contain the  
damage from allegations of Russian mob involvement in money 
laundering through the Bank of New York, claiming that the case has 
been overblown by Western media and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Western reports on the scandal  
were part of a deliberate policy by ``certain circles who don't 
want Russia to reassert its role as a great power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov, in a speech at the Moscow State Institute for  
International Relations, called the media reports ``an attempt to 
manipulate unconfirmed facts in order to cast a cloud on our 
nation. Russia will not tolerate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov also said the reports reflected a ``political struggle''  
in the United States, though he did not blame any specific 
politicians. Other Russian leaders have also suggested the news 
leaks in the scandal are rooted in U.S. election campaign battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion was  
laundered through the Bank of New York. Some reports claim that the 
money included International Monetary Fund aid to Russia -- an 
allegation Russian officials have angrily denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said his Cabinet has been on top  
of the case and was in close contact with the FBI and other U.S. 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone wants to blow up these issues because of political  
motives, he is free to do that, but this isn't going to either 
speed up or slow down investigators' work,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin had been asked about a statement by U.S. Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers, who said in an interview with USA Today 
published Wednesday that Washington wouldn't support new IMF loans 
to Russia until there is an adequate account of previous IMF aid to 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Treasury official, however, said in Washington Wednesday  
that the Clinton administration hasn't come to a decision on 
whether Russia should receive any additional loans from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's central bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, insisted  
Wednesday that ``the money which was received from the IMF was used 
properly to support budgetary revenues.'' He was speaking to Dow 
Jones Newswires during a trip to Zurich, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government was initially silent about the scandal,  
which was first reported last month. It could be the among the 
largest money laundering schemes ever uncovered in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving criminal gains through  
a series of bank accounts to make them look like legitimate 
business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged with any crime in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York case is just one of several that allegedly  
link prominent Russian political or business figures to corruption 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian prosecutor Nikolai Volkov was in Switzerland this week  
to examine documents and consult with his Swiss counterparts on a 
case involving a Swiss construction company suspected of bribing 
its way into the Kremlin to get lucrative renovation contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kremlin officials and the head of the company, Mabetex, have  
denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> GM, DaimlerChrysler Sales Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Pickups, sport utility vehicles and minivans  
continued to pull buyers onto car lots in August, setting high 
marks for sales at General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and 
several foreign automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the strongest months ever for vehicle sales,''  
said David Healy, a Burnham Securities Inc. analyst. ``If anything, 
the pace of sales seems to be strengthening rather than dropping 
month to month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the results were in line with expectations that the  
industry's yearly sales total would shatter the record of 16.1 
million vehicles, set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Wednesday its sales were up 64 percent over last year --  
a comparison skewed by United Auto Workers strikes that all but 
halted GM's North American production last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also said it set an August record for truck sales behind its  
sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban, Chevy 
Tahoe and GMC Yukon. The company recently has added rebates of up 
to $1,000 on slow-selling models in its full-size pickup line -- the 
first since redesigned versions were introduced this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry continues to run at a spectacular rate, and  
manufacturers are competing fiercely for every sale,'' said John G. 
Middlebrook, GM vice president and general manager of vehicle brand 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks also pulled sales in DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit up 9  
percent over last year. Chrysler's cars were up less than 1 
percent, but trucks were up 13 percent behind sales of the Jeep 
Grand Cherokee, which set a record for its sales in any month. 
</P>
<P>
	Like GM, DaimlerChrysler offered a wide range of rebates,  
discount leases and finance rates on many of its models. Automakers 
have traditionally used incentives in August to push last year's 
models off car lots, but this year there appeared to be better 
deals for car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ironic thing in this period of very strong sales is that  
incentives are really driving the market,'' said Alan Baum, an 
analyst with IRN Inc. ``The reason is that auto companies want to 
maintain their market share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign automakers also reported record August sales. Toyota  
said sales were up 3 percent, beating the record set for the month 
last year. While Toyota's car sales were down slightly, sales of 
its Lexus SUVs and its new Tundra full-size pickup more than made 
up for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda said sales were up 10.5 percent last month, breaking the  
record for the month set in 1997. Honda's redesigned Odyssey 
minivan and Accord sedan powered the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen said its sales were up 34 percent, while Mitsubishi  
said sales were up 48 percent. Mercedes-Benz and Subaru also 
reported higher sales. One exception to the trend was Nissan, whose 
sales were down 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. was scheduled to release its sales today.

<HEADLINE> GUESS? Recalls 78,000 T-shirts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clothing designer GUESS? is recalling more  
than 78,000 girls' T-shirts with a liquid-filled bubble patch on 
the front. The liquid contains a petroleum distillate that can be 
harmful if ingested, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The bubble patches come in three shapes -- a heart, a circle and  
a rectangle -- with liquids in three different color combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-shirts were sold in clothing stores nationwide from June  
1997 through March 1999 in sizes small through extra large. They 
cost $10 to $26 depending on the style. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should stop wearing the T-shirts immediately and  
return them to the store where they were purchased for a refund, 
the commission said.

<HEADLINE>  Venice Film Festival Opens Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- The grande dame of film festivals opened  
today with a flurry of self-doubt and high-minded pledges about 
cinema as art. It was, in other words, business as usual on the 
Lido. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venice Film Festival, now in its 56th edition, is the  
world's oldest film festival and it has suffered in recent years 
from a mid-life crisis. The festival's last director floundered for 
two years, then stunned everyone by quitting on the last day and 
declaring festivals obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe there is something wrong with film festivals as such,''  
the new director, Alberto Barbera, admitted today. But, he added, 
``none of us has an innovative model to counter it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Barbera has put together a program that seems to have  
something for everyone, including enough high-wattage star power to 
send spectators scrambling for their sunscreen and ample portions 
of both sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbera brings a fresh eye and a taste for young directors to  
the festival, where established talent will be competing against 
relative newcomers. He also displays his love for masters of the 
medium such as Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock and Akira 
Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival also features two of the most talked-about American  
movies of the year, neither showing in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival opens with the European premiere of Kubrick's final  
work, ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Stars Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are on 
hand, as is Kubrick's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight Club,'' starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, will also  
be shown. 
</P>
<P>
	As a special tribute to Kubrick, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' is showing  
on all three of the festival's main screens tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies are, of course, also about commerce and Venice is an  
important European launching pad for Hollywood films. In addition 
to ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' it boasts several other intriguing premieres 
out of competition, including Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' 
starring Sean Penn and Uma Thurman, and horror king Wes Craven's 
first conventional movie, ``Music of the Heart,'' with Meryl 
Streep, Aiden Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the competitors are ``Holy Smoke'' from the Oscar-winning  
director of ``The Piano,'' Jane Campion, ``Topsy-Turvy'' from Mike 
Leigh, director of the acclaimed ``Secrets and Lies,'' ``The Cider 
House Rules,'' an adaptation of John Irving's best-selling novel, 
and ``Mask of Zorro'' star Antonio Banderas' directorial debut, 
``Crazy in Alabama,'' starring his wife, Melanie Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival wraps up on Sept. 11 with a career achievement  
award for comedian Jerry Lewis.

<HEADLINE> Carson, Calif. Pitches NFL Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- Carson made its pitch for a football team  
again to the NFL on Wednesday, with officials in this suburban city 
seemingly just as unclear on their prospects as other groups trying 
to lure a team to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Goodell, an NFL vice president who is the league's point  
man on stadiums, made City Hall here the last of his four stops 
during a whirlwind visit to Southern California. His itinerary had 
him holding separate meetings earlier in the day with backers of 
the Coliseum, Hollywood Park in Inglewood, and Anaheim as possible 
homes for an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking for about an hour with Carson City Manager Jerry  
Groomes and attorney Darold Pieper, Goodell rushed off to catch a 
flight without speaking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were aware they were visiting us as well as three other  
locations, and essentially we understand that their goal was to get 
a current assessment of these sites and the options that are 
available so that they can present them to the team owners, or at 
least to the (expansion) committee,'' Groomes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the conversations were productive, at least in our  
view that Carson is a great location for this and we think that 
there are many possibilities that could be put together to make 
this a feasible deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the same thing  
Wednesday about the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``With literally two weeks to go'' before the NFL's Sept. 15  
deadline, ``we remain committed to returning NFL football to Los 
Angeles in a new Coliseum,'' Ridley-Thomas said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this can be accomplished in a way that is  
acceptable to the NFL, to all necessary governing bodies, to 
prospective owners and to Los Angeles football fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas hopes to convince the NFL of the feasibility of a  
new approach to providing money for the Coliseum remodeling and 
adjacent parking. The funds would come from taxes on revenue 
generated by a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has imposed a Sept. 15 deadline on Los Angeles for  
coming up with an acceptable proposal for the league's 32nd 
franchise. As that deadline approaches, it appears more likely that 
Houston instead will be promised a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Groomes said it seems impossible to predict what the 31 team  
owners might decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the position of Roger (Goodell), and for that  
matter, ... (NFL commissioner Paul) Tagliabue. It's hard for them 
to predict where 31 people are going to come from, especially this 
group of 31,'' Groomes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's expansion committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 9 in  
Washington, D.C., and representatives from Los Angeles and Houston 
are slated to meet with NFL officials in New York on Sept. 13. A 
full meeting of the league's team owners isn't scheduled until Oct. 
6 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson was one of three sites, along with the LA Coliseum and  
Houston, originally considered by the league for the expansion 
team. The NFL narrowed that list down to the Coliseum, then opened 
the door for other proposals again after talks with the Coliseum 
backers hit snags over what the league considered a lack of public 
funding and insufficient parking. 
</P>
<P>
	Groomes said Carson is by no means desperate to have an NFL  
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see ourselves as a desperate community trying to find  
a life raft in this NFL franchise. Frankly speaking, without 
suggesting that we're not interested, we can take it or leave it,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in spinning wheels in this process or  
being used as leverage for something else.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Bradley Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from ``Old Young Man,'' a 1968 documentary on Bill  
Bradley produced for the United States Information Agency: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fantastic sensation, you know, when you work on  
something for hours, and maybe weeks even, and nothing goes. Then 
on about the ten thousandth time, you finally do the shot right. 
And you know it's right because it feels right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Bradley, on basketball  

</P>
<P>
	``It's the nature of sport that it creates people like Bill  
Bradley who are famous far beyond reason, really. And he has got to 
live with this the rest of his life. He may become a public figure, 
but my point is that he already is one, and the sport made him 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--John McPhee, author of a magazine profile of Bradley in 1965  

</P>
<P>
	``He's sort of a loner, kind of. I don't know what he's done,  
you know, other than being a scholar and basketball star, but he 
also seems to have a concern about people. But he takes it so much

<HEADLINE> Saints' Williams Cleared To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans rookie running back Ricky  
Williams, sidelined with an ankle injury since the first preseason 
game, has been cleared to play in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, injured after just nine carries in the Saints first  
exhibition game of the year, was given the go-ahead to play in the 
Sept. 12 opener against the Carolina Panthers, Saints trainer Dean 
Kleinschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second MRI of Williams injury, a high ankle strain, cleared  
the former Heisman Trophy winner to return to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The repeat MRI on Ricky Williams showed exactly what we  
expected,'' Kleinschmidt said. ``It shows that the ankle is stable 
and that there is no widening of the ankle mortise joint and that 
it is in the process of healing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team expected Williams to return for the opener all along,  
and had repeatedly denied reports that he would miss the first two 
games of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will sit out the final preseason game against the  
Tennessee Titans on Thursday night. He has not practiced or played 
since Aug. 13, but began limited drills on the injured ankle this 
week, under the supervision of Saints trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no problem putting the injury behind him, Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that big of a deal,'' Williams said Wednesday. ``You  
just go along, go along, start playing and you play. It's not like 
it's traumatized me or anything to not be ready. It's just a 
progression and when I'm ready, I'll be on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he had numerous injuries while playing in college  
at Texas, including a similar ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worse, but it was on the other ankle,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although he won't have taken a hit in a month by the time he  
plays again, Williams doesn't anticipate any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only been a couple of weeks,'' he said. ``I don't think  
you lose it that fast.''

<HEADLINE>  Apple Unveils 'Desktop Supercomputer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Calling it ``the world's first desktop  
supercomputer,'' Apple Computer Inc.'s charismatic leader Steven 
Jobs unveiled his company's latest workstation, designed to further 
extend the company's technological and financial rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most powerful personal computer ever brought to  
market,'' Jobs, Apple's interim CEO, told more than 1,000 cheering 
spectators attending the Seybold publishing conference here 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pulled a brown cloth cover off the sleek, glistening  
computer, and took a small bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computers, powered by chips made by Apple, Motorola Inc.  
and IBM, cost between $1,600 and $3,500 and mark Apple's continuing 
efforts to sell to business users such as architects, publishers 
and graphic designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors appeared to signal their enthusiasm today  
for the new machine, pushing Apple's stock price up 3 percent, or 
$2.12 1/2 at $67.37 1/2, in early trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The G4 chip incorporates a new execution unit named the Velocity  
Engine, which is the heart of a supercomputer miniaturized onto a 
sliver of silicon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs also unveiled a new 22-inch flat-panel display monitor,  
dubbed the Apple Cinema Display, which together with the top G4 
model will sell for $6,500 in October. The display monitor is twice 
as bright, twice as sharp and has three times the contrast of 
traditional monitors, Apple said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software developers on hand gushed over the new machine.  
</P>
<P>
	``The new G4 is an unbelievable machine for creating compelling  
content that adds life to the web,'' said Rob Burgess, CEO of 
Macromedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Adobe Systems CEO John Warnock said the G4 runs his company's  
image editing software Photoshop -- significantly faster than any 
other platform. 
</P>
<P>
	During the unveiling, Jobs held a head-to-head race against an  
Intel Pentium III system, rendering a scene with Buzz Lightyear 
from the movie ``Toy Story.'' Jobs claimed that the G4 was more 
than twice as fast as the Pentium machine, which was running at a 
speed of 600 Mhz. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel didn't let the thrown gauntlet go unchallenged.  
</P>
<P>
	At about the same time, at an Intel developers conference in  
Palm Springs, Intel CEO Craig Barrett announced that the 
``Coppermine'' Pentium III processor, an enhanced version of its 
high-end chip, will be released in October. It will operate at a 
speed of at least 700 Mhz -- more powerful, but not necessarily 
faster, than Apple's 500 Mhz G4.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Disney for Portrayal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- A woman is seeking $8 million in damages over  
a Disney TV movie that she contends inaccurately portrays her as a 
``black Mammy'' during the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	Amelia Boynton Robinson was heavily involved in the Selma civil  
rights movement during the 1960s and was an identified character in 
the movie ``Selma, Lord, Selma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was depicted as a stereotypical ``black Mammy'' whose main  
function was to make religious utterances and to participate in 
singing spirituals and protest songs, said Bruce Boynton, her son 
and an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother's depiction in the movie was drastically wrong,''  
the son said. ``It doesn't bespeak the type of character my mother 
actually had at all -- not only had but continues to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which aired in January, was based on a book by the  
same name. 
</P>
<P>
	A Disney executive, Jack Yellen, did not immediately return a  
telephone call.

<HEADLINE> Depardieu, Huppert: Enduring Icons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- It's been 25 years since Gerard Depardieu and  
Isabelle Huppert burst into prominence in a whimsical road movie 
about three scruffy hippies seeking sexual adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Les Valseuses'' (``Going Places''), Bertrand Blier's 1974  
cult hit, he was a long-haired, big-nosed unknown, and she was a 
waifish ingenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, at the height of their careers, Huppert and Depardieu are  
icons of French cinema who have fans throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Depardieu, or ``Gege,'' the nickname by which he's known, has  
more than 100 films to his credit. He's whispered love sonnets in 
``Cyrano de Bergerac'' and hurled Gallic insults as the rotund 
Obelisk in the recent blockbuster ``Asterix and Obelix Versus 
Caesar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the man who battled neglect and poverty and overcame a  
severe speech impediment to star in ``Green Card'' and ``The Return 
of Martin Guerre'' took on another challenge this year: He made his 
directing debut with ``Un Pont Entre Deux Rives'' (``A Bridge 
Between Two Banks''), a poignant story about a small-town cleaning 
woman who gets her emotional thrills from watching movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Depardieu co-directed his off-screen companion, Carole Bouquet,  
in what French critics deemed her best performance ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old actor also shined in the role of the husband she  
leaves -- a potbellied worker forced to spend weekdays away from 
home, laying pipes for the Tancarville bridge going up over the 
Seine near Le Havre in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Depardieu single-handedly carries the French cinema on  
his broad shoulders -- not only as its most prolific actor, but also 
as producer and promoter of young talent. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently helped establish ``Emergence,'' the French  
equivalent of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute. It raises funds 
to finance seminars for budding directors. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has offered his talent -- at minimal cost -- to any young  
director with a good idea. Which is why his name figured among the 
production credits of ``Mirka,'' a low-budget Algerian film 
released last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actor and Business Man: Depardieu and Co.,'' headlined the  
weekly news magazine, Le Point, in a cover story earlier this year 
that spoke about his oil venture in Cuba and sales of his Chateau 
de Tigne wine to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Depardieu has said he doesn't like being labeled  
``businessman,'' but wants control of his affairs so he can live 
his life the way he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the soul of a businessman,'' he says. ``I don't  
even have a secretary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His failed oil venture cost him more than $1 million, and he  
called his winery ``practically nonprofit.'' But he added that 
recent negotiations were on to sell nearly a third of the chateau's 
yearly output of 350,000 bottles as kosher wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he still manages to dominate stage and screen. This  
winter he played a 16th-century emperor in a four-month stage 
production and finished filming a miniseries on Balzac to air on 
French TV in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer he's been filming ``Vatel,'' a period movie in  
English about the Duke of Conde's valet. 
</P>
<P>
	Huppert also cuts a unique figure among French movie stars.  
</P>
<P>
	She may be no match for Catherine Deneuve's classic blond beauty  
or Isabelle Adjani's beguiling, dark exoticism. But with her face 
of a million facets, she is widely regarded as France's most 
versatile actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why, at 44, she may be the nation's most enduring  
female star, a box-office heavyweight who makes almost as many 
films a year as the prolific Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
	In a career that spans nearly three decades, she has worked with  
every major French director: Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, 
Bertrand Blier and Bertrand Tavernier among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Huppert has made four movies in the past year, including  
``L'Ecole de la Chair'' (``The School of Flesh''), the tale of a 
fortysomething fashion designer who falls for a bisexual gigolo 20 
years her junior. 
</P>
<P>
	The film fared better in the United States than in France, but  
still earned Huppert a nomination for best actress at this year's 
Cesar ceremonies -- the French equivalent of the Academy Awards -- 
over which she presided. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll touch you or it won't,'' she said during a recent  
interview at her Left Bank apartment. ``You'll either love it or 
hate it, but it won't leave you indifferent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Benoit Jacquot said he wanted Huppert, and only Huppert  
-- with her signature impassivity -- to play the role of Dominique, 
an established divorcee who buys sex and finds love in the arms of 
a low-life Arab prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	```It's love at first sight,'' Huppert said. ``Dominique is  
wildly attracted to this man, and experiences intense physical 
passion she can't explain. When things get too painful, she pulls 
out. She's a survivor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huppert has been a mainstay of French cinema since her debut 25  
years ago as the teen-age ingenue deflowered by Depardieu and 
Patrick Dewaere in ``Going Places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, she has incarnated 53 roles, including: a  
19th-century tubercular courtesan, a wartime abortionist and a 
simple postal worker-turned-killer in ``La Ceremonie'' (``Judgment 
in Stone''). 
</P>
<P>
	That performance won her a Cesar for best actress in 1995 and  
had critics comparing her relationship with Chabrol to that between 
Grace Kelly and Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleagues say Huppert chooses her films carefully, on the basis  
of a director's style and themes that matter to her. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, for example, she sought out independent  
filmmaker Hal Hartley and asked him for a part. He cast her as a 
pornography-writing ex-nun in his 1993 ``Amateur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huppert has evolved over the years, the adolescent curves  
melting away to reveal a girl-next-door appeal enhanced by her 
delicate auburn looks and diaphanous skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many French actresses of her generation, she also has  
triumphed on stage: as Joan of Arc at the Bastille-Opera in a 
three-hour, one-woman show directed by U.S. director Robert Wilson, 
and in London, as Mary Stuart -- speaking English. 
</P>
<P>
	Another English-language role, in Michael Cimino's 1979  
big-budget ``Heaven's Gate,'' could have been a ticket to 
Hollywood, but it flopped, and Huppert hasn't worked there since. 
</P>
<P>
	She is an intensely private person. Lush greenery on her  
balconies keeps prying photographers at bay, and she has 
successfully sued more than one celebrity glossy for invasion of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with her child at a nearby public park, the waifish  
Huppert -- in dusty black pants and no makeup -- looks more like a 
baby-sitter than a movie star who regularly earns superlatives from 
France's notoriously harsh critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the daily Liberation, Gerard Lefort deemed her performance in  
``The School of Flesh'' ``grandiose,'' saying it destroyed any 
notion that Huppert might be ``over the hill.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Kids Go Back to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of Kosovo students  
returned to school today, the first time pupils in the province 
have been able to attend class since NATO launched its war against 
Yugoslavia five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most schools in Pristina, the provincial capital, were cleaned  
up and ready for students who will spend the next month in makeup 
classes because school was suspended after NATO's bombing campaign 
began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rural schools have been shut down since February 1998, when  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists. The crackdown ended in June when 
Milosevic accepted a peace plan that included 40,000 NATO-led 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hasan Pristina school in the provincial capital, excited  
11-year-olds raced up to their classrooms on the third floor, 
marveling at the absence of a grill that formerly separated them 
from Serb children, most of whom have fled the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came up here yesterday just to see where my class would be,  
and I couldn't believe it,'' said Arjjir Rexha as he waited for his 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials were uncertain how many students -- ethnic  
Albanians and Serbs -- would show up for class. The United Nations 
estimates nearly half of Kosovo's schools were damaged or destroyed 
in 18 months of ethnic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Albanian children have not officially attended school since  
1989, when Milosevic revoked the province's autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ethnic Albanians responded by establishing their own,  
unofficial schools, financed by contributions from Albanians 
abroad. Most Serb pupils fled Kosovo with their parents to escape 
reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians after Yugoslav troops withdrew 
from the province under the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In areas where Serb children remain, they will share school  
buildings with the Albanians. To avoid trouble, one group will 
attend classes in the morning and the other in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials hope the resumption of classes will represent an  
important step toward rebuilding the province after years of ethnic 
unrest and war. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major step will come Sept. 19, when the Kosovo  
Liberation Army is to disarm and disband under a June agreement 
with NATO. On Tuesday, the NATO commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Mike 
Jackson, met with KLA leader Hashim Thaci to discuss the rebel 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting took place behind closed doors. But sources close to  
Thaci who spoke on condition of anonymity said the two also 
discussed terms to end an eight-day stalemate between local ethnic 
Albanians and Russian soldiers in the southern city of Orahovac. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been blocking roads to the  
town for more than a week, refusing to allow Russian peacekeepers 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the unrecognized Kosovo parliament held its first  
session since the end of the Kosovo fighting. The parliament was 
elected in March 1998 in balloting which was not recognized by the 
Serb-led Yugoslav government. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose Democratic League  
of Kosovo dominates the assembly, said parliament must cooperate 
with U.N. and NATO-led forces to draft new laws to replace the 
Serbian legal code. 
</P>
<P>
	The parliament's influence within the Kosovo Albanian community  
has been eclipsed by the Kosovo Liberation Army which did not take 
part in the 1998 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the top U.N. official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner,  
swore in seven new judges and two prosecutors in the divided 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges will be part of a new legal system being set up by  
the United Nations to replace the Serbian law that previously ruled 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials are eager to have a judiciary system up  
and running in the province. The peacekeepers, who started arriving 
on June 12, have not been able to prevent revenge attacks and 
criminal acts from taking place.

discussed terms to end an eight-day stalemate between local ethnic 
Albanians and Russian soldiers in the southern city of Orahovac. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been blocking roads to the  
town for more than a week, refusing to allow Russian peacekeepers 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the unrecognized Kosovo parliament held its first  
session since the end of the Kosovo fighting. The parliament was 
elected in March 1998 in balloting which was not recognized by the 
Serb-led Yugoslav government. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose Democratic League  
of Kosovo dominates the assembly, said parliament must cooperate 
with U.N. and NATO-led forces to draft new laws to replace the 
Serbian legal code. 
</P>
<P>
	The parliament's influence within the Kosovo Albanian community  
has been eclipsed by the Kosovo Liberation Army which did not take 
part in the 1998 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the top U.N. official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner,  
swore in seven new judges and two prosecutors in the divided 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges will be part of a new legal system being set up by  
the United Nations to replace the Serbian law that previously ruled 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials are eager to have a judiciary system up  
and running in the province. The peacekeepers, who started arriving 
on June 12, have not been able to prevent revenge attacks and 
criminal acts from taking place.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Slow To Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illinois Rep. David Phelps worries that Al  
Gore won't escape negative comparisons to Bill Clinton. Rep. 
Anthony Weiner faults the vice president for spending too much time 
wooing establishment politicians. Fellow New York Rep. Joseph 
Crowley fears Gore isn't paying enough attention to key Democratic 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the three House freshmen appear on the carefully tended  
and aggressively recruited list of lawmakers who have endorsed 
Gore's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in endorsements. I don't believe in anything else.  
... They're tremendous validators for what we're trying to do,'' 
said Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, just 69 of the 256 Democrats in the House and Senate  
have publicly endorsed the vice president. That includes only one 
of the 11 Democratic senators up for re-election in 2000 -- 
Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, whose seat is considered safe -- and four 
of the 20 House Democrats who are considered vulnerable next year 
because of their narrow margins of victory in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``As important as the presidency is, we are very invested in  
recapturing the House of Representatives,'' said Washington Rep. 
Brian Baird, president of the House freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm paddling my own canoe,'' said Kentucky Rep. Ken Lucas, who  
won his seat in 1998 by 6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts freshman Michael Capuano, another one who has put  
Gore off, said it's too early in the campaign. The question is, 
``Can Al Gore do it? ... I am not convinced yet who will be best 
for the country and my district,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowley, the New York freshman, has decided to support Gore  
because of the vice president's outreach to veterans and labor 
unions, but the lawmaker hasn't made an official endorsement 
because of local politics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps said he's attended Gore campaign strategy sessions and  
voiced concern that ``Gore is having a tough time trying to 
overcome being compared to Bill Clinton.'' He said he believes in 
Gore's strength as a candidate but has not pledged support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to be sure. I've got to get my own house in order,''  
he said. ``We're just being cautious. It shouldn't be interpreted 
as being negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress aren't the only ones hesitant to side with  
Gore over challenger Bill Bradley. So is Kate Michelman, president 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. 
``American women can count on either one of them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign is planning a series of fall events to make a  
splash with new endorsements from critical Democratic communities -- 
including blacks, Hispanics, organized labor and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiner, whose New York district is considered ripe territory for  
a Bradley insurgency, recently complained to his local newspaper 
about Gore and the administration's plan to build a radar tower in 
Gateway National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho and another Gore campaign aide ``were on the phone with  
me instantly,'' Weiner said. ``Bradley has strong connections here. 
If Gore is going to start hemorrhaging support, it may be here. But 
they have been pretty aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman added, ``They may be investing too much time in  
making sure that politicians are being kept happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, who asked not to be identified, said Gore  
aides warned Colorado Rep. Mark Udall ``not to cross the line too 
much'' after the congressman organized an informational meeting for 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Coelho said the Gore camp listens for murmurs  
of support for Bradley and tries to swiftly answer each one. ``The 
mere fact we call, they may take that'' as a threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the August congressional recess, Coelho held at least  
four ``members-only'' sessions on Capitol Hill to address concerns 
about the viability of Gore's campaign. ``It's their careers that's 
at stake, too,'' Coelho said. ``And so they want to make sure that 
there is a way of you winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho asks lawmakers to seal their endorsements by signing  
pledge cards that lock in their votes for Gore at next summer's 
Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has three Hill endorsements -- Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey,  
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone and Illinois Rep. William Lipinski. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put effort into reaching out to elected officials, there's  
no question,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. ``But at the end 
of the day, voters make this decision and that's where a lot of our 
effort is focused.''

<HEADLINE> Georgian President Visiting Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- The president of the republic of  
Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze, will meet with President Clinton in 
Washington this month, the White House announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze will also speak before the United Nations in New  
York before traveling to Washington for the Sept. 23 White House 
meeting, said a statement from White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
The statement was issued from the Clinton family vacation spot in 
upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States strongly supports the sovereignty, stability  
and territorial integrity of Georgia,'' the statement said. It went 
on to praise Shevardnadze's role ``in promoting prosperity and 
democratic development for all the people of Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders will discuss current U.S.-Georgia cooperation,  
and ways to broaden the relationship, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia is a former Soviet republic, and its leader was once a  
prominent Soviet politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze has remained in power in Georgia through years of  
political upheaval, including an assassination attempt last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Roy Myers scored in the second and 58th  
minutes as the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the San Jose Clash 3-1 
Wednesday in Major League Soccer action. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles moved into a first place tie in the MLS Western  
Conference with Colorado (16-8). 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Vanney added a goal on a 71st minute penalty kick for the  
Galaxy (16-9). 
</P>
<P>
	Alejandro Sequeira scored in the 59th minute for San Jose  
(14-11), whose three-game winning streak was ended at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' first goal began when goalkeeper Joe Cannon punched  
Vanney's corner kick away from the net to Los Angeles forward Cobi 
Jones, who directed the ball to Danny Pena. Pena then headed the 
ball back to Myers, whose shot from 15 yards out deflected off the 
right goal post into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles increased its lead to 2-0 when Carlos Hermosillo  
slid a pass to Myers, who put a short shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose scored its goal a minute later when Sequeira sprinted  
past the Galaxy defense and put a shot from just inside the penalty 
area past Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanney then put the first penalty kick of his four-season MLS  
career into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clash led 17-15 in shots, with both teams taking nine shots  
on goal. Hartman made eight saves while Cannon made six.

<HEADLINE> Jews Divided on Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials received a public show of support  
from several community leaders a day after the fatal police 
shooting of a hammer-wielding, emotionally disturbed man in an 
Orthodox Jewish neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilman Noach Dear and several Jewish leaders defended  
the police response during a joint news conference Tuesday with the 
mayor and police officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough of a relationship to believe in the Police  
Department, and that the officers did this because they had to,'' 
said Rabbi Shmuel Lefkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Four officers fired 12 shots at Gary Busch on Monday night after  
he refused orders to drop a 11-inch claw hammer he was using to 
beat a sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said  
a preliminary investigation indicated the officers acted 
appropriately. Officers had tried to subdue the 6-foot-3, 159-pound 
man with pepper spray before the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the movies,'' Safir said. ``You don't shoot hammers  
out of hands. You don't shoot people in the leg.'' If a suspect 
uses a weapon in exerting deadly force, police shoot with the 
intention of stopping the suspect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other community leaders questioned whether deadly force was  
necessary. The shooting prompted hundreds to demonstrate into the 
early morning hours Tuesday in Borough Park, a predominantly 
Hasidic neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you mean to tell me, in a situation like this, the police  
shoot to kill?'' state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, D-Brooklyn, said 
Tuesday in front of the rowhouse where Busch lived. 
</P>
<P>
	At another news conference Tuesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton called  
the city to rally together against police brutality. The black 
activist has led several marches criticizing police in the past, 
most recently for the shooting of an unarmed African immigrant 
earlier this year. Four police officers have been charged with 
murder in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's incident began when police responding to a 911 call  
found Busch in his apartment holding a claw hammer. He was wearing 
a prayer shawl and tefillin -- leather boxes containing pieces of 
Scripture that are attached to the body with straps. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch, 31, refused orders to drop the hammer, according to  
police. He had used the same hammer on Sunday when he allegedly 
attacked a man who was sitting in a car, said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a 
police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch walked toward an officer, who stumbled. Sgt. Terrence  
O'Brien stepped in between them and Busch began hitting O'Brien 
with the hammer, Biegel said. Again, police ordered Busch to drop 
the hammer and when he ignored them, they fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors said they were leery of Busch because of his  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were very wary of him because he acted strangely,''  
said resident Simcha Erez, 24. ``He would talk to himself and wore 
a heavy coat in the summer. People stayed away from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch's mother, Doris Busch Boskey, told reporters her son was a  
former medical student at Mount Sinai Medical School, which he left 
in 1991 because of a kidney ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there was a lot of depression, some mania,'' she  
told reporters at her home. ``But he was never violent. He was 
never aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't draw guns. We have to talk,'' Mrs. Boskey said. ``You  
don't just kill people. There has to be another way.''

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driver Who Killed 27 Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA GRANGE, Ky. (AP) -- The man convicted in the nation's  
deadliest drunken driving accident -- a fiery, head-on collision 
that killed 27 people on a church bus -- was released from prison 
Wednesday after 9 1/2 years and is free to get another driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Mahoney, 46, was driven away in the back seat of a car,  
carrying his belongings in two brown paper bags. He said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my impression that he wants to blend back into  
society,'' said state police Lt. Henry ``Sonny'' Cease, who 
investigated the 1988 crash that led Kentucky to tighten its 
standards for school buses. ``I think he's done the time that was 
dealt to him and it's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney was driving his pickup truck the wrong way on an  
interstate when he smashed into a bus carrying home 67 people from 
a church outing at an amusement park. The bus' gas tank ruptured, 
and flames engulfed the front section. Mahoney's blood alcohol 
content was .24, more than twice the level of intoxication in 
Kentucky of .10. 
</P>
<P>
	The former chemical plant worker was convicted of manslaughter  
and sentenced to 16 years in prison but got time off for good 
behavior and taking courses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the wreck, Kentucky changed its specifications for school  
buses, requiring them to have flame-retardant seats, fuel tank 
cages, push-out windows, left-side emergency exits and escape 
hatches in the roof. Federal law had already required fuel tank 
cages on buses manufactured after 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, which made the bus chassis, quickly settled with 65 of the  
67 families affected by the crash, reportedly for at least $36 
million. Two other families later accepted settlements as their 
case was going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mahoney was turned down for parole in 1997, he chose to  
serve out his sentence and left prison with no restrictions or 
reporting requirements. He can even get a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky law does not prohibit convicted felons from driving,  
even those convicted of causing a drunken driving-related death. 
Driving records are expunged after five years of no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Rob Wilkey, who unsuccessfully sponsored legislation  
last year to increase penalties for drunken driving, said that 
after someone serves his sentence, he should be able to make a 
living, and driving is almost a necessity to hold down a job. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``In light of his release, that is an issue we in  
the General Assembly ought to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney is believed to be staying with his parents, who live in  
his former hometown of Worthville not far from the crash, which 
took place outside Carrollton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry Mahoney, no matter what he is labeled, should be  
grateful he can go back to some sort of a normal life,'' said 
Karolyn Nunnallee, whose 10-year-old daughter Patty was the 
youngest victim to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nunnallee became a crusader after the accident and is now  
national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She said she 
is not angry at Mahoney, but troubled by the system that gave him 
only 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wishes Mahoney would use his experience for the  
good of others: ``If he can prevent it from ever happening again, 
he could save lives.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. congressional staffers on a  
fact-finding mission to Iraq wrapped up their visit to Baghdad 
today, then headed to battered southern areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. fighter planes in the northern no-fly zone  
bombed an Iraqi air defense site near Mosul today after being fired 
upon, the U.S. European Command, based in Germany, said in a 
statement. Mosul is about 250 miles north of the Iraqi capital, 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation will visit the impoverished southern city of  
Basra today, which has been tense since the mysterious Feb. 19 
assassination of the supreme leader of Iraq's Shiite Muslims, 
Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader, and his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiites are the majority in Iraq but most power is in the hands  
of Sunni Muslims. A Shiite uprising was crushed after the 1991 
Persian Gulf War, and U.S. and British warplanes also patrol parts 
of the south to prevent Iraqi forces from attacking Shiite rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Basra's nearly 1.5 million people live on meager government  
rations and clean water is in short supply, conditions Iraqi 
officials have blamed on U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are in Iraq to examine the impact of the sanctions  
imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The measures 
cannot be lifted until Iraq proves to the international community 
that it has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and honored 
other 1991 Gulf War cease-fire obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad accuses Washington of blocking any effort by the  
international community to ease the sanctions. Some members of 
Congress have questioned the effectiveness of the Clinton 
administration's Iraq policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional staffers have refused to speak to reporters,  
leaving official comments to trip organizer Phyllis Bennis of the 
Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennis called Tuesday's meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  
Aziz ``warm, cordial and productive.'' According to Iraqi news 
reports, he briefed them on the effect of sanctions in Iraq's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also met Tuesday with Iraqis involved in  
education, health and literature, and have visited a hospital and 
Health Ministry and U.N offices in Baghdad. They end their southern 
tour on Thursday and plan to depart Iraq Friday.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Soar on Crop Worries / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures raced to their highest level in  
three weeks Wednesday in a second straight day of strong advances 
reflecting crop concerns. Grain futures also were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices pushed higher as crop time nears with both the  
size and condition in question. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said earlier this week that less than half the crop was in good to 
excellent condition -- way under last year's rating at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for dry, warmer weather through most of the soybean  
belt this week also boosted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans helped carry corn prices higher for the third straight  
day. Investors also reacted to reports of low yields and light test 
weights in the eastern corn belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices also were buoyed by the soybean market activity.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.83 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.21 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 5 3/4 cents to 
$4.88 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed and pork futures advanced on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>

	October live cattle fell .18 cent to 66.37 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .17 cent to 79.02 cents a pound; October

<HEADLINE>  Beanie Babies To Be Retired by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The message -- ``all Beanies will be retired'' --  
came in a flash on Ty Inc.'s Web site and then disappeared, 
startling and confusing the Beanie Baby legions. 
</P>
<P>
	Could it be that the Oak Brook, Ill., toymaker is really  
bringing an end to the Beanie Baby, one of the hottest toy crazes 
of the decade? Or is it just a marketing ploy? 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, toy experts say company president Ty Warner is  
likely to revive a market that has steadily been losing interest in 
the cuddly animal toys. 
</P>

	``Ty Warner is a very smart man. He knows how to create a

	The privately-owned company has distributed more than 100  
characters, from dinosaurs and teddy bears to birds and zoo 
animals. The company's revenue was estimated at just $1.7 million 
in 1995 but had ballooned to $674 million by last year, according

</P>
<P>
	Beanies initially became popular because their price of $4 to $5  
was affordable for most children. Later, they became valuable 
collectibles for adults who could sell a single toy for as much as 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengths people have gone to get Beanie Babies are legendary.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the former bank president and his wife who were charged  
in Wisconsin earlier this year with embezzling millions of dollars 
-- a good chunk of it used to buy Beanie Babies. In Salinas, Calif., 
a woman admitted using stolen credit card numbers to feed her habit 
of buying Beanies. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year, people lined up to hand over their firearms in a  
Guns for Beanies promotion sponsored by the Kankakee, Ill., police

<P>
	Tannenbaum said prices were up Wednesday but were not  
skyrocketing, since many collectors were still holding back on 
putting their Beanies up for bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Nickels, a Ty spokeswoman, had little to say when reached  
Wednesday at the company's headquarters. She confirmed that the

<HEADLINE> Poland, Germany Remember WWII </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- With a handshake at the border, the  
presidents of Poland and Germany heralded reconciliation between 
their countries today, the 60th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of 
Poland that started World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The first shots of what was called the Second Great War were  
fired in Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. Fighting eventually spread 
through 61 countries on four continents before ending six years 
later, with 50 million people dead and the world order changed 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski shook hands with his  
German counterpart, Johannes Rau, in the middle of a bridge over 
the Oder River separating their nations. Flowers and flags marked 
the spot where a white line used to signify the border. 
</P>
<P>
	They then walked to the Polish side and greeted a small crowd,  
some of whom applauded, with Rau calling it ``a great day for both 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in Gdansk, an air raid siren sounded at noon in this  
Baltic port at the towering concrete monument that marks where a 
German war ship opened fire on the Westerplatte depot to begin the 
war. With flags fluttering under clear skies, Kwasniewski and Rau 
each pledged cooperation and friendship at a ceremony attended by 
veterans of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The century that is ending now was a century of war,'' Rau  
said. ``Let us work together from this day forward so that at the 
end of the next century, Poles, Germans and all Europeans can say: 
The 21st century was a century of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwasniewski, a former communist, noted Gdansk was where the war  
began, but also where the Solidarity movement that toppled 
communism in Poland was founded. He added that Poland's defeat of 
communism helped spur the subsequent reunification of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We meet in an entirely different country, a different world,  
and those who used to be our enemies we consider good neighbors and 
close partners,'' he said. ``For the first time in our history we 
have been allies, and I'm proud that I can say more -- we are 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poland was one of the war's biggest casualties, losing two  
decades of independence, 6 million of its people and 40 percent of 
its national wealth. Decades of communist rule established by the 
Yalta agreement followed the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Poles have democracy 10 years after toppling the  
communists, but the bitter memories remain. An April survey of 
1,092 adults by the state Center for Polling Public Opinion found 
one in four Poles -- mostly the elderly who lived through the war -- 
doubted reconciliation with the Germans could ever happen. The poll 
had a 3 percent margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, communist rulers cultivated the Poles' enmity  
toward Germany to strengthen the nation's isolation from Western 
countries. But since Poland and the former East Germany shed their 
communist systems, the reunified Germany has been Poland's 
strongest foreign investor and was a key supporter for its 
membership to NATO in March. It also has supported Poland's bid to 
join the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconciliation began with former West German Chancellor  
Willy Brandt, who knelt in penance at the memorial for victims of 
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising during a 1970 visit. Brandt also signed 
a treaty with Poland renouncing claims to 40,000 square miles of 
former German territory incorporated into Poland at the end of the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Poles who survived the German invasion retain vivid memories of  
the first day. At 4:45 a.m., the German armored ship 
Schlezwig-Holstein, on a friendly visit to Gdansk, fired at the 
Westerplatte depot and its 182-strong garrison headed by Maj. 
Henryk Sucharski. Within hours, German tanks rumbled across the 
border and the battle against Polish defenders began. 
</P>
<P>
	It took just over a month for the Germans to fully prevail, with  
Hitler holding his victory parade in Warsaw on Oct. 5.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Recordings To Be Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ``Nixon Bugged Himself'' headline shocked  
America, yet Richard Nixon wasn't the first to wire the White House 
for sound. Franklin Roosevelt did it. So did Truman, Eisenhower, 
Kennedy, Johnson and Reagan. Eisenhower even taped his own vice 
president -- Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans will soon get an earful of Oval Office conversations  
dating from the 1950s. After languishing in storage at the National 
Archives for years, more than 450 hours of presidential recordings 
are slated for release by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public should be prepared over the next three years for a  
huge dump of presidential recordings,'' said Timothy Naftali, 
director of the presidential recordings project at the Miller 
Center of Public Affairs, a nonpartisan research institute at the 
University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, 5 1/2 more hours of Kennedy tapes were opened. New  
Eisenhower recordings are to be released this month. Tapes of 
Lyndon Johnson chatting on the phone in 1964 will be unsealed 
within two months. And on Oct. 5, historians hope to clamp on 
earphones and listen to 445 new hours of Nixon tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Fawcett, deputy assistant archivist for presidential  
libraries at the National Archives, cited several reasons for the 
flurry of tape releases. 
</P>
<P>
	Faster declassification efforts have allowed recordings to be  
more quickly released. The passing of time has eliminated privacy 
and confidentiality concerns that can complicate releases. And 
after reviewing miles of tape, the archives is ready to respond to 
dogged requests from researchers and historians, who believe the 
recordings are second only to being a fly on the wall of the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tapes allow you to sit on a president's shoulder as he  
makes the most important decisions of his administration,'' Naftali 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Naftali and a team of 12 scholars began an  
ambitious project to transcribe all known presidential recordings. 
The team is working on Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson tapes and 
has long-range plans to transcribe the 3,700 hours of Nixon tapes 
as well as recordings left by Truman and Roosevelt. The FDR and 
Truman tapes have been open to the public for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	William Doyle, author of a book on presidential recordings,  
calls them a ``cockpit voice recorder of the presidency -- a black 
box of American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listeners hear domestic policy being made; foreign relations  
being smoothed. Roosevelt lets go boisterous laughs and raps on his 
desk 17 times during one sentence. Truman jokes with reporters. 
Angry at Congress about foreign aid, Johnson breathes ``heavily 
into the phone in deep, guttural snorts,'' Doyle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower, who recorded a June 1954 meeting in which he  
chastised Nixon for campaigning too aggressively against the 
Democrats, fancied tape machines before he was president. Later 
this year, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library will unseal tapes 
recorded when he was president of Columbia University and NATO 
commander in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eisenhower tapes are extraordinarily hard to understand,''  
Naftali said. ``At times, it's like listening to Mickey Mouse and 
Donald Duck. But the scholars are getting something out of these 
conversations. The pre-presidential ones are much clearer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy recordings are clear enough to hear the sounds of  
presidential fidgeting. ``He would play with his glass and you get 
this bang, bang, bang,'' Naftali said. ``It sounds like an auto 
mechanic is building a Corvette in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Ford only taped three phone calls, including one on  
Sept. 1, 1975 that is both historical and comical. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford thought he was talking to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  
about an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. The 
connection was so bad that he didn't realize he was talking to 
someone else until five minutes into the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you this morning, President Sadat? I wanted to call  
and congratulate you on the great role that you played in the 
negotiations that have culminated in this agreement,'' Ford told 
the unknown third party. 
</P>
<P>
	A man on the other end kept saying ``Hello? Hello?''  
</P>
<P>
	Ford kept replying ``Hello?'' and ``I can't hear you very well,  
Mr. President.'' But then he politely continued, lauding the third 
party and gushing goodwill from America. Sadat eventually made it 
to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford thought that by recording this call he would capture an  
historic moment,'' said Doyle, who found the tape in 1997 at the 
Gerald R. Ford Library. ``Instead, he captures himself in an 
unintentional comic operetta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No known tape recordings exist from the Carter and Bush  
administrations. President Reagan left behind 12 audiocassettes, 
which have not yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House denies the existence of an audio taping  
system. But Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment report 
said Clinton once told his paramour, Monica Lewinsky, ``that he 
believed an unnamed foreign embassy was listening in on the 
president's official telephones so they would have to be careful in 
their phone conversations.''

<HEADLINE>  Beanie Babies To Be Retired by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The message -- ``all Beanies will be retired'' --  
came in a flash on Ty Inc.'s Web site and then disappeared, 
startling and confusing the Beanie Baby legions. 
</P>
<P>
	Could it be that the Oak Brook, Ill., toymaker is really  
bringing an end to the Beanie Baby, one of the hottest toy crazes 
of the decade? Or is it just a marketing ploy? 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, toy experts say company president Ty Warner is  
likely to revive a market that has steadily been losing interest in 
the cuddly animal toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty Warner is a very smart man. He knows how to create a  
product. He knows how to create demand,'' said Leonard Tannenbaum, 
president of Collectingnation.com, which has an auction site

<HEADLINE> Martin Lawrence Still Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Martin Lawrence was breathing  
without a ventilator as he continued his recovery from a coma 
triggered by a weight-loss jog in summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who had been near death after suffering heat  
exhaustion and hyperthermia Aug. 22, was ``alert and responding to 
commands,'' according to a statement from his publicist, Kim Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing great,'' she said Tuesday. The actor's prognosis  
was changed from guarded to good, and Lawrence was listed in 
serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 34, was trying to lose weight for a movie role when he  
went running near his home in 100-degree weather. His girlfriend 
found him collapsed on the doorstep and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Los Robles Regional Medical Center had said Lawrence  
might have to undergo dialysis to remove excess protein trapped in 
his kidneys, but Ms. Jones said the procedure wasn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor starred in the Fox TV comedy ``Martin'' from 1992-96  
and has appeared in films including ``Life,'' ``Bad Boys'' and 
``Nothing to Lose.'' His next film, ``Blue Streak,'' opens Sept. 
17.

<HEADLINE> Conference USA May Want SMU, TCU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Conference USA has targeted Texas  
Christian and Southern Methodist in the league's expansion plans, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	A source told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that the league is  
likely to add the two schools within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, they're interested in SMU and TCU,'' the source  
told the newspaper. ``I don't think they're going to be accepting 
applications from schools interested in joining; they're going to 
select who they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, presidents of C-USA universities voted in Chicago to  
authorize commissioner Mike Slive to explore expansion 
possibilities and report within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could just say we are going to work with one school or two  
schools,'' said Slive. ``But I think it's fair to say our board 
wouldn't have authorized me to go out and work hard for two weeks 
and very quickly if they weren't willing to listen. ... This is on 
the fast track, as you can tell by the nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, SMU and TCU are part of the eight-member Western  
Athletic Conference. The conference lost eight other members this 
summer when they left to form the Mountain West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The next meeting of C-USA presidents is scheduled for Oct. 11 in  
New York. Slive said board members would likely meet in a 
conference phone call before then.

<HEADLINE> Religious Judge Cleared in Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELL CITY, Ala. (AP) -- A judge who displays the Ten Commandments  
in his courtroom was cleared today of allegations he personally 
profited from a legal defense fund set up to protect his right to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair County District Attorney Van Davis said a two-month  
investigation by his office found nothing to support a complaint 
against Circuit Judge Roy Moore filed by the Alabama Ethics 
Commission. The panel in June unanimously ruled there was probable 
cause to believe Moore had profited from a defense fund set up to 
protect the Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigation revealed no evidence that Judge Roy Moore  
used his office for personal gain. At no time was Judge Moore even 
in control of this defense fund,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is ``absolutely delighted'' with the decision, said Steve  
Melchior, an attorney for the Etowah County circuit judge. ``We 
have had to go through a character assassination since July 1997. 
That is what happens when someone bears false witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the only time Moore received money from the fund was  
when he got $400 to reimburse him for phone calls made in the case. 
Davis said there was nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of Moore's defense fund, Dean Young, said Moore  
``documented everything to the last penny'' and did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	If charged with a crime and convicted, Moore could have faced up  
to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has traveled the country since 1996 making speeches about  
his legal fight against the American Civil Liberties Union to keep 
a handmade Ten Commandments plaque hanging in his courtroom. The 
ACLU contends the plaque violates the constitutional separation of 
church and state. An Alabama Supreme Court ruling, dealing with a 
technical issue and not the merits of the dispute, dismissed the 
case, and the display remains in Moore's court. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama Ethics Commission Director Jim Sumner said in June that  
members believed Moore spent money from the fund on more than legal 
expenses and used the ``mantle of his office'' to solicit funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumner said this morning that he had not discussed the case with  
Davis. But he said the Moore defense team was more cooperative with 
the prosecutor than they were with the commission, ``so he had more 
information than we did.''

<HEADLINE> Liberty's Rookies Show the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tamika Whitmore and Crystal Robinson weren't in  
the league when the New York Liberty played in the inaugural 1997 
WNBA championship against the Houston Comets. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't experience the disappointment of a 14-point loss  
when the Comets held New York to 38 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the rookies are reveling in better moments, like the  
69-54 victory over the Charlotte Sting on Monday that sent the 
Liberty to the WNBA Finals against the Comets for the second time 
in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, the two-time defending champions, advanced with a 72-62  
victory over Los Angeles in the Western Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-3 championship series begins Thursday night at  
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitmore, a 6-foot-2 center who led the nation in scoring her  
senior year at Memphis, scored 10 points off the bench against the 
Sting. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, as a rookie, it feels great,'' Whitmore said. ``Not  
many rookies get this opportunity in their first year in the 
league. It just shows how much charisma and talent we have on this 
New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is a rookie only in the sense that she's a newcomer to  
the league. The 5-foot-10 forward led the now-defunct ABL in 
3-point shooting (.466) and made 4-of-5 from behind the arc to 
finish with 18 points against the Sting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought hard this season and had a lot of ups and downs,''  
Robinson said. ``A lot of people doubted us. We didn't have any 
superstars, but we are a good team. '' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rebecca Lobo went down with a season-ending knee injury 42  
seconds into the opener, the Liberty's future looked bleak. But Sue 
Wicks and Whitmore went to work on the boards and Robinson, the 
Liberty's first-round pick, shot .437 from behind the arc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say enough about Crystal Robinson,'' New York coach  
Richie Adubato said. ``They double-team her and triple-team her and 
(Charlotte) even threw a little diamond-and-one on her. But she 
continues to show what a marvelous shooter she is. She has that 
quick release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty, a strong defensive team, is playing especially well  
on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	New York shot a WNBA playoff-record 55 percent in Game 2 against  
the Sting and followed with a 54-percent performance on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty got a big boost from their reserves, who outscored  
the Sting's bench 20-0. Sophia Witherspoon matched Whitmore's 10 
points off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sophia has been instant offense for us,'' Adubato said. ``When  
she comes in, we try to run because she has a tremendous ability to 
get to the basket in transition. Both of them came in and obviously 
8-for-12 shooting is pretty good off the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitmore has contributed consistently in the last two weeks  
after recovering from a midseason ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that Tamika is back, we know she is a terrific offensive  
player,'' Adubato said. ``She can play inside or out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York will have to contain Cynthia Cooper, who is averaging  
17 points in the playoffs, five points off her average. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Delays High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Premature wheel wear discovered during testing  
of Amtrak's new high-speed Acela train prompted the railroad to 
announce Wednesday it is delaying the launch of the service until 
next spring at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	While an embarrassment for the railroad, Amtrak President George  
Warrington offered one consolation for Northeast passengers 
expecting the 150 mph trains to start running later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrington said that a project to straighten curves and run  
electricity along tracks between Boston and New York was on 
schedule, which will allow Amtrak to cut travel times by up to one 
hour, 40 minutes using its existing locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
	Trip times should also improve slightly on New  
York-to-Washington runs, which will compose the second half of the 
Acela high-speed route. 
</P>
<P>
	``The infrastructure and electrification program will enable us  
to take advantage of those investments in advance of introducing 
the actual (high-speed) train sets themselves in the spring,'' 
Warrington told reporters in a telephone news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Acela has been hampered in testing by ``wheel hunting''  
problems. At speeds of 130 mph to 145 mph, the wheels began shaking 
from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Lapare, the North American head of the Canadian firm  
Bombardier Inc., which is building the train with Paris-based 
Alstom, said engineers found ``excessive wheel wear'' on passenger 
coaches in the two eight-car test trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This delay is unfortunate but not unusual when new technology,  
although proven, is being introduced in a new environment,'' Lapare 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapare said engineers are trying to build a smaller suspension  
to help remove ``some of the rigidity of the truck ... to make the 
going through curves a little bit easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrington also defended the delayed introduction.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is about taking the time to make this train right,'' he  
said. ``It is as a practical matter not a toughest choice because 
we have no interest in cutting corners and accepting a train that 
does not meet performance standards or the standards of excellence 
that Amtrak has set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acela is the cornerstone of a $2 billion plan to revive Amtrak  
and promote high-speed rail as one means of addressing highway and 
air traffic congestion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad is spending $710 million to buy 20 eight-car train  
sets from Bombardier-Alstom. The trains were set to be fully 
operational by the fall of 2000, allowing Amtrak cut the trip 
between New York and Boston from 4 1/2 hours to just over three hours, 
and the trip from New York to Washington from nearly three hours to 
2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrington acknowledged Wednesday that the company will see  
revenues drop because of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``That slippage is one-time, and it is short-term, and it is in  
no way consequential to our long-term revenue or our absolute 
commitment to operational self-sufficiency by 2003,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Despite Wall St. Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped further against most major  
currencies Wednesday, approaching its lowest level of the year 
against the Japanese yen, as it failed to get a lift from a rebound 
in U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 109.05  
Japanese yen, down from 109.59. It last was this low on Jan. 11, 
when it closed at 108.22 yen. The dollar also lost ground to the 
euro, which rose to $1.0594 from $1.0578 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The persistent weakness in the dollar against the yen is  
fostering weakness in the U.S. currency's trading against other 
major denominations, said Robert Lynch, currency strategist at 
Paribas in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said the dollar's rapid approach of its 1999 low ``raises  
the threat of intervention by the Bank of Japan. It's becoming a 
bit more critical at these levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have been predicting for days that the Japanese  
government will intervene to prop up the dollar against the yen. 
Such a policy would prevent the yen from getting too strong, which 
would lower Japan's export profits and hurt the country's resurging 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak dollar would make U.S. exporters stronger competitors in  
world markets, but it also would raise the price of imported goods 
and make overseas travel more costly for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5127 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5136, and 1.4896 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4925. 
</P>
<P>
	But the British pound fell to $1.6062 from $1.6064.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8453 German 
marks, down from 1.8507; 6.1889 French francs, down from 6.2071; 
and 1,828 Italian lire, down from 1,832.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Ends Up 108.60 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues lent some strength to Wall  
Street Wednesday, driving most stocks higher and helping the Dow 
Jones industrials to their first advance in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 108.60 to 10,937.88 after having lost 496.76 over  
the previous four sessions. The index had not closed higher since 
last Wednesday, when it rose 42.74 to an all-time high of 
11,326.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also gained Wednesday. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 10.66 to 1,331.07, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 11.45 to 2,750.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was among the high-tech issues to revive a market that has  
sagged under interest rate concerns. The chip maker, up 1 1/4 to 83 
7/16, led the Nasdaq and was among the strongest components of the 
S&AMP;P 500 as it unveiled a new microprocessor intended for use in 
devices that route information across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the development raised expectations that the  
Internet boom will feed continued growth at computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, IBM was one of the strongest Dow stocks,  
rising 2 7/16 to 127. IBM and Cisco said Tuesday they will jointly 
provide networking equipment and services to companies looking to 
do business online. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts remained somewhat skeptical about how strong the  
market really is, with summer vacations and continued worries about 
higher interest rates combining to keep many investors on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some underlying anxiety,'' said David G. Sowerby, a  
vice president at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., noting that investors are 
once again fearful that the Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates for a third time this year if it determines the economy is 
growing too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board today provided the latest sign that the  
economy continues to grow at a brisk pace. The research group's 
Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a key barometer of future 
economic activity, rose 0.3 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Conference Board's report was balanced by a Commerce  
Department report that showed home building and other construction 
spending was surprisingly weak in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose sharply last week after the Fed's most recent rate  
increase as investors temporarily grew more optimistic that the 
central bank might leave rates untouched for the rest of the year. 
But as fear returned to Wall Street, prices turned lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed has created some discomfort in the near term,''  
Sowerby said. ``But if they stay committed to low inflation, they 
are setting the stage for a strong market down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most analysts remain wary heading into September, an  
often treacherous month for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has likely set the table for a rocky month,'' said  
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., 
citing a lack of market leadership and the worries about higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's pockets of strength today included brokerage  
stocks, which rose after Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on 
several of its competitors. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 3 11/16 
to 89 1/2, and Lehman Brothers rose 1 5/8 to 55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper rose 1 9/16 to 48 4/8, helping the Dow after  
PaineWebber raised its rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus Hotel Corp. rose 2 15/16 to 32 amid reports that Hilton  
Hotels is negotiating a deal to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 853.19 
million shares. Trading volume dropped back from 1.01 million 
shares in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.16 to 430.99.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.1 percent amid  
speculation that the government will step in to stop the dollar's 
decline against the yen. The dollar dipped to a new 
seven-and-a-half month low against the yen in late afternoon 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DAX index rose 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose  
0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals To Call Up Right-Hander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals' second group of  
minor-league callups will include pitcher Chad Hutchinson, a 
second-round draft pick last year who made his Triple-A debut 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a right-hander, struck out 11 and walked five in six  
innings for Triple-A Memphis and got a victory at Vancouver. He 
will join the team after the Pacific Coast League season ends Sept. 
6 to work with pitching coach Dave Duncan and get some major league 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa doesn't plan to give Hutchinson  
any starts, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dunc's anxious to get a look at him,'' La Russa said. ``He's  
had some promising outings, but there's indications he still has 
some work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan said Hutchinson, who was 7-11 with an 4.72 ERA at  
Double-A Arkansas, has had a dominating breaking ball all season 
but has struggled to control his fastball. In 141 innings at 
Arkansas, he struck out 150 and walked 85. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's something they'd like to see improved upon,''  
Duncan said. ``All in all, I think he's had a decent year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, 22, was a two-year starter at quarterback at  
Stanford before deciding to concentrate on baseball. He signed a 
$3.5 million deal last June that included a $2.4 million signing 
bonus and $1.1 million for a four-year guaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Alan Benes, out more than two years with shoulder  
woes, will also join the bullpen after making one more rehab start 
at Memphis. On Monday night, Benes lasted three innings and gave up 
one run and walked three while striking out two. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Cardinals called up first baseman Eduardo Perez,  
catcher Marcus Jensen and right-hander Mark Thompson. None of the 
players were expected to report until after Wednesday's game 
against the Florida Marlins had begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also plan to recall right-hander Jose Jimenez, who  
had a no-hitter and two-hitter against Arizona's Randy Johnson but 
was 5-12 with a 5.81 ERA overall. Jimenez, who was demoted Aug. 18, 
was 1-1 with a 2.92 ERA at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also plans to call up infielders Placido Polanco and  
Luis Ordaz. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move Wednesday, right-handed reliever Curtis King was  
recalled from a rehab assignment and optioned to Memphis.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo To Sell 2 Plants, Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. announced a  
restructuring plan today that includes selling two steel plants, 
cutting thousands of jobs and establishing a joint venture with 
Kobe Steel Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will attempt to slash operating costs  
through personnel transfers and a work force reduction of about 
5,000 jobs through early retirement over the next five years. 
That's almost a third of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger of the two plants to be spun off, in Japan's  
southernmost main island of Kyushu, produces wire rods and bar 
steel for auto parts. It had about 70 billion yen ($640 million) in 
revenues in the fiscal year that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo said it will form a sales and manufacturing joint  
venture with Kobe Steel in the seamless pipes business by April, 
and it agreed with Nippon Steel Corp. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. to 
study cooperation in export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	With the reorganization, Sumitomo said it aims to post a pretax  
profit of more than 20 billion yen ($183 million) in the next 
fiscal year, beginning in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With the return to profitability, Sumitomo Metal said it hopes  
to resume dividend payments. The company stopped paying dividends 
in fiscal 1998 for the first time in four years.

<HEADLINE> Vail Resort in Hot Water With Feds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- A temporary dirt logging road carved across a  
half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest 
ski area, in trouble with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Tom Allender, resort planning director, and his crews  
built the road to access an 885-acre expansion into undeveloped 
backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had  
done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in 
the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation  
last month. The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to 
$27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the 
Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through 
wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake. But the EPA's  
Steve Ireland rejected that defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United  
States without a permit, it is a violation,'' he said. ``It's worse 
if they knew they were breaking the law, but whether it was 
unintentional doesn't change anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road,  
leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut 
timber and no way to remove it. It may have to be burned on site. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so  
logging trucks could remove the timber without rumbling through the 
tourist-clogged village. Allender said he became confused when 
building it because surveyors had left three proposed routes marked 
with ribbons through the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial  
effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the  
project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't 
adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx. 
Last fall, a group calling itself Earth Liberation Front claimed 
responsibility for an outbreak of fires at the resort that caused 
$12 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix  
the damage to the wetlands.

`She,' Connick has refocused himself on what he does best, taking 
almost full control of this project and his 16-piece big band and a 
full orchestra.'' Connick was born on Sept. 11, 1967.

<HEADLINE> Fading Blue Jays Lose Hamilton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays playoff hopes are fading  
and the news got worse as starting pitcher Joey Hamilton is out for 
the season with a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who has pitched with pain for most of the season, will  
see Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Alabama on Monday. Hamilton 
may undergo exploratory surgery next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long struggle throughout the year,'' Hamilton  
said. ``I've definitely strengthened my tolerance for pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being acquired from San Diego in an offseason trade,  
Hamilton signed a three-year, $18 million deal. He started the 
season with muscle impingement and after two bad starts was placed 
on the disabled list for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	After allowing five runs in two-plus innings on Tuesday,  
Hamilton said his shoulder felt worse. He is 7-8 with a 6.52 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays are also without starter Chris Carpenter, who will  
miss at least one start with elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Toronto manager Jim Fregosi and General Manager Gord  
Ash held a meeting with the player's before Toronto's game against 
Minnesota Wednesday night. The Blue Jays entered the day five games 
back in the AL wild card race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want anybody to think that Gord and myself have  
given up,'' Fregosi said. ``I don't want anybody feeling sorry for 
themselves. Whatever games we have left I expect them to do their 
job.''

<HEADLINE> Modeling Companies Forgive $3M Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two modeling agencies accused of using  
deceptive marketing tactics have agreed to forgive $3 million in 
payments owed by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission had accused Model 1 Inc. of Tysons  
Corner, Va., and Creative Talent Management Inc. of Vienna, Va., of 
misrepresenting their abilities to get lucrative jobs for consumers 
who contracted for their training classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission alleged in May complaints that the companies also  
falsely represented themselves as selectively scouting for models 
and actors when in fact all candidates who made deposits were 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a consent order filed last Friday in U.S. District Court  
in Alexandria, Va., the companies are prohibited from 
misrepresenting that they can help consumers get high-paying 
modeling or acting jobs or that they have expertise to assess their 
marketability. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed in the order to refrain from promoting or  
offering offer screen tests as part other services, such as 
modeling classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement prohibits the companies from collecting  
outstanding payments -- about $3 million -- from consumers who signed 
up for training courses but had not attended any classes. 
</P>
<P>
	They also must post a $500,000 bond before they can sell acting  
or modeling classes again and refund about $200,000 to consumers 
who signed up for screen tests after May 31.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victims Fund at $4.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The largest fund established to help  
victims of the Columbine High School shootings has accepted its 
final donations after collecting $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Healing Fund, an arm of the Mile High United Way, will  
disband next week after disbursing the final $1 million to the 
those seriously injured in the April 20 shootings, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Healing Fund's $4.4 million was part of the $6 million that  
donors from around the world contributed to 30 different charities 
established for the victims. The Healing Fund acted as a general 
holding pot. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money already has been distributed to families of  
the shooting victims. Gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 
12 students and a teacher before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1.6 million will go toward community programs, such as  
counseling and youth violence prevention programs. Additional 
contributions will go to victims with specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the families' request, the breakdown of the last $1 million  
will not be released publicly, said Kelley Cahill, spokeswoman for 
Mile High United Way.

<HEADLINE> German Utility Firms Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- The chairmen of German utility giants  
Viag AG and Veba AG discussed a possible merger Wednesday with 
Bavarian Gov. Edmond Stoiber, whose state is a major shareholder in 
Viag, but no decision was reached, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veba chairman Ulrich Hartmann said the talks were ``constructive  
and (had) a good atmosphere,'' but that more talks were necessary 
given the scale of the merger under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a Viag spokeswoman confirmed that the cornerstone of a  
merger had been worked out, but said many questions remained, 
including possible antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Cartel Office chief Dieter Wolf told reporters Wednesday  
that the two groups had approached his office to gauge how the 
merger would be received, but that nothing had been formally 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if approval were sought, his office would focus on the  
energy and chemicals divisions of the two groups and any potential 
monopoly operations. Both are also involved in mobile telephones, 
but Wolf said that would not necessarily be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Bavaria, which owns 25.1 percent of Viag, must also  
approve the proposal. The Bavarian government has stated that it 
intends to sell its stake by 2003, but also wants to protect the 
20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Veba and Viag are the second- and third-largest German energy  
companies, respectively, in sales terms. Combined, they move into 
the top spot in the country, with combined sales of $10.9 billion 
in 1998, but still trail Electricite de France, which holds the No. 
1 spot in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The French utility, which has used its protected home market as  
a launching pad for expansion beyond its borders, is aggressively 
bidding for a 25 percent stake in Germany's fourth-largest power 
producer Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricite de France's looming presence is seen as one of the  
drivers for regional industry consolidation, and the German 
government seems to be pushing for German energy companies to 
become major European players. 
</P>
<P>
	A Veba-Viag ``merger doesn't automatically make them a huge  
international player,'' said Simon Allen, a European utilities 
analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers. But a linkup does give the 
companies leverage and breathing space to position themselves for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``EdF is still seen as the big potential threat,'' said Nicola  
Mann, a utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch.

<HEADLINE> Allergic Reaction Kits Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Thousands of injection kits used to treat severe  
allergic reactions and asthma attacks are being recalled because of 
the possibility of a serious defect: The drug may not be potent 
enough to work. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500,000 of the emergency injection kits are being  
recalled in the United States and Canada. The kits are routinely 
carried by people who are prone to acute asthma attacks or have 
deadly allergies to certain foods or bee stings. Users inject 
themselves with epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, to counter 
the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of the epinephrine, American Home Products'  
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, said Tuesday that routine 
quality-control tests found that the drug was not as potent as it 
was supposed to be. No one has been harmed by the kits, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is just the latest setback for American Home, which  
faces legal problems over its diet drugs and Norplant contraceptive 
device. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall involves three kits: the Insect-Sting Treatment Kit  
packaged and distributed by Derm/Buro Inc., and the Hollister 
Stier-Ana-Kit and the Ana-Guard, both packaged and distributed by 
Bayer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the kits are sold by prescription and cost around $40.  
</P>
<P>
	The kits should be returned to the hospital, clinic or pharmacy  
where they were obtained, American Home said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip de Vane, North American medical director for  
Wyeth-Ayerst, said people should take no chances and should contact 
their pharmacists or health care providers to determine whether 
their kit is being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can call Wyeth-Ayerst at 1-800-999-9384.  
</P>
<P>
	About 450,000 Ana-Kits and 55,000 Ana-Guards are being recalled  
in the United States and Canada, said Kathleen Bauernschmidt, 
spokeswoman for Hollister-Stier Laboratories of Spokane, Wash. 
Bayer sold its allergy kit manufacturing business to 
Hollister-Stier in June. It was unclear how many kits were being 
recalled by Derm/Buro. 
</P>
<P>
	People who are prone to allergic reactions can suffer what is  
known as anaphylactic shock, in which swelling of the airways can 
cut off breathing and the heart can stop. Epinephrine, a naturally 
occurring hormone, is used to increase blood flow and restore 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of kits being recalled represents about 25 percent of  
all allergic reaction kits on the market, Ms. Bauernschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, American Home agreed to pay a reported $50  
million-plus to settle claims from 36,000 women who complained that 
Norplant caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, a jury awarded $23 million to a Texas woman who  
claimed the company failed to warn her about the dangers of 
American Home's diet drugs Redux and Pondimin, which is part of the 
drug combination called fen-phen. Hundreds of lawsuits are now 
pending nationwide against the company over the drugs' potential to 
cause heart-valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company this summer suspended shipments of a childhood  
diarrhea vaccine after it was linked to bowel obstruction in 32 
infants. And last year, American Home recalled a painkiller Duract 
after it caused fatal liver problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The allergy kit recall affects: Derm/Buro Insect-Sting Treatment  
Kits with the lot numbers 0397, 0497, 0597, 8141, 8139, 11464, 
13239. The products were distributed between June 1997 and February 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Also affected: Ana-Kits with lot numbers AK344 through AK363 and  
lot AK366, and Ana-Guard with lot numbers G00196 through G00220, 
and lots G00222 and G00223. They were distributed by Bayer between 
April 1997 and April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Machinists Vote on Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Thousands of Machinists union members who work  
for The Boeing Co. weighed in today on a new three-year contract 
that union leaders called the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract, affecting 44,000 members of the  
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, was 
set to expire at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. The Machinists have struck 
over two of the last three contracts, most recently for 69 days in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact was not exactly what the union wanted -- dissident  
members made sure their co-workers were aware of its flaws -- but 
many interviewed on their way to union-hall polls appeared ready to 
accept it as the best they were likely to get. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small percentage that plans to vote no but I can't  
really understand why. I think they just wanted to be militant,'' 
said Mark Dodds, 42, a 16-year Boeing worker who is a painter in 
the company's Auburn plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is really nothing worth going out on strike over,''  
Dodds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here 25 years and I've seen three strikes and this  
is one of the best contracts I've seen,'' said Larry Shively, who 
works for Boeing in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition to the agreement focused on retirement benefits  
and job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing offered a 25 percent increase in pensions, to $50 a month  
per year of service -- well below the 300 percent increase sought by 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract offer also guaranteed ``no layoffs as the direct  
result of subcontracting or offloading,'' but dissidents noted 
other language exempted ``commercial airplane strategic work 
placement requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leadership at the company and the union said the exemption  
concerns work allocated to foreign workers as a condition of 
winning aircraft orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good contract and the members are going to buy it,''  
predicted Bill Johnson, president of the union's Seattle-based 
District Lodge 751. 
</P>
<P>
	One in five Boeing workers is a Machinist -- 44,000 out of  
210,000 worldwide. Boeing, the nation's No. 1 exporter, plans to 
deliver a record 620 commercial planes this year, but a fierce 
rivalry with the European consortium Airbus Industrie has prompted 
an intensive effort to streamline operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure to keep producing helped bring negotiators  
together. The company dropped its demands for a seven-day work week 
and more worker contributions to health-insurance premiums. It 
offered two annual wage increases of 4 percent and a third-year 3 
percent raise, as well as a 10 percent signing bonus worth $4,400 
to the average machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say it again: That's the best contract in aerospace,  
period. By far. Talk to anyone around the country,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing ran double full-page ads this week -- outlining contract  
basics and urging union members to vote -- in newspapers serving 
cities with substantial Boeing work forces, including Seattle, 
Spokane, Everett, Tacoma, Bellevue and Kent in Washington; 
Portland, Ore.; and Wichita, Kan. The company also ran radio and TV 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not taking this for granted,'' said Boeing chairman  
and CEO Phil Condit, who stepped in personally to end a prickly 
bargaining stalemate last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ``offers unprecedented job security, the best wages  
and retirement plan in the industry, and world-class benefits. It's 
the right thing for employees and the company,'' Condit said.

<HEADLINE> George Buck: Celebrating Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- George Buck began collecting jazz records in  
high school. Now his collection fills two warehouses and nine 
record labels. 
</P>
<P>
	And those are just the records he has for sale.  
</P>
<P>
	Buck produced his first jazz record on Aug. 16, 1949, during  
summer break from college. The Jazzology label he created then is 
still going strong, with worldwide sales of traditional jazz -- the 
music Buck sometimes calls ``my jazz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, worried that a major label might buy the company  
after his death just for his Al Hirt and Pete Fountain masters, he 
created a nonprofit foundation to keep it all going after he is 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The GHB Jazz Foundation usually releases 80 to 100 CDs a year.  
But last month, it had 50 new CDs to celebrate Buck's 50th 
anniversary in recording. Some were all new, others reissues and 
added new and additional tracks to old LPs that had been released 
on vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicians who recorded Buck's first album all are dead, but  
his current favorites played at his recent 50th anniversary party: 
Clive Wilson on trumpet, Tom Fischer on clarinet, Steve Pistorious 
on piano, Tom Bartlett on trombone, Hal Smith on drums and Tom 
Saunders on bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, he's like a patron of the arts,'' said Dan  
Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers 
University's Newark campus. The only way to keep such a deep and 
lavish catalog is to ignore the bottom line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Buck sees it, ``The recording business is not a business  
-- not in jazz. You do it because you love the music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buck's office overlooks the French Quarter Flea Market. His  
battered desk faces away from the window, toward row upon row of 
wooden box shelves filled with records and CDs. These are for mail 
order; another office sends CDs to the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	The desk seems at least as old as his high-bodied typewriter  
with its stair-step keyboard. He has a brand-new computer but has 
not yet learned how to use it, though dictation and text-reading 
software have definite appeal for a man who knows the world through 
touch and hearing because of his failed eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really think it could work, but my phone book made me  
a convert,'' he said. He pulls a slim black gizmo from a drawer to 
show it off. ``All I have to do is say the name and hold it up to 
the phone, and it dials the number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buck's love of traditional jazz goes way back, to when he was  
about 15 and heard Muggsy Spanier on the radio. A year or two 
later, he found a single at his record store. He bought it, and was 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the swing era. He bought some drums -- he still has the  
set, in the third-floor warehouse apartment where he also keeps 
most of his personal record collection -- but couldn't find anyone 
to play with in Elizabeth, N.J., where he lived. He did find one 
other fan, though, and they'd get together on weekends to listen to 
records and talk. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided while he was still at Lynchburg College in Virginia  
that he wanted to keep this music alive by recording it. So he 
cashed the war bonds he'd bought hawking newspapers as a kid in 
Washington, D.C., got together his favorite musicians -- clarinetist 
Tony Parenti, cornet player Wild Bill Davison, Jimmy Archey on 
trombone, Art Hodes on piano, Pops Foster on bass and Arthur 
Trappier on drums -- and rented a New York studio. 
</P>
<P>
	The record cost well over $1,000. He made little of it back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea what the market was for jazz,'' Buck said.  
</P>
<P>
	He figured the big record stores with a name for jazz would buy  
a total of 500 copies, and he could sell another 500 by mail. The 
big stores bought five to 15 each. 
</P>
<P>
	He still has some of the original two-record sets: a 10-inch set  
with one song on each side, and two 12-inch records -- RCA had 
introduced LPs only a year earlier -- with a total of nine songs. 
Each take went directly to vinyl. A 10-inch record held only three 
minutes per side. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the first day, everything ran too long. ... I said, `It's  
so good I'll put out 12-inch disks,' so they wouldn't have to do 
retakes,'' Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
	He never put out singles, only albums with heavy-duty covers and  
liner notes: ``I thought there should be written material with it. 
It should be educational,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1952, he got a deal with a national distributor. The  
profits it yielded two years later paid for his next recording 
sessions. But he couldn't turn those sessions into records until 
the early 1960s, when a radio station he had bought at bankruptcy 
sale in 1958 became the lead station in Columbia, S.C. As a top 40 
station, it got him back into the record business. 
</P>
<P>
	His earlier contracts with distributors had been so disastrous  
that he decided to stick entirely to mail order. He now has one 
distributor contract, and has added some of his lines, such as 
modern jazz, to make the ensemble more attractive to distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Buck purchased the Creole label. Like many other  
independent labels, it had been forced out of business by bootleg 
companies that sold their music for much less. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio, though, has remained in his blood. He now owns a  
half-dozen stations, and broadcasts a jazz show each Sunday. The 
money he makes from radio pays for his records and the jazz history 
books that the GHB Jazz Foundation also publishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenstern has a hard time singling out one or two of the  
company's most important achievements. There is the almost 
unheard-of longevity and the fact that Buck keeps everything in the 
catalog instead eliminating poor sellers. Then there's his issues 
of the previously unreleased Eddie Condon Town Hall concerts from 
the 1940s, and the transcriptions -- jam sessions recorded for radio 
use, but available only on bootleg albums before Buck bought World 
Transcriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck figures he has about 2,000 titles available across his nine  
labels. And he's still recording more. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have that much material, not all of it is immortal  
music,'' Morgenstern said. ``But a goodly percentage of it is. And 
all of it is worthwhile.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Eagles Get GB's Michels for Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay  
Packers traded first-round disappointments on Wednesday, the Eagles 
sending defensive end Jon Harris to Green Bay in return for 
offensive tackle John Michels. 
</P>
<P>
	Each rejoins a former coach -- Harris will play for former Eagles  
coach Ray Rhodes and Michels for former Packers assistant Andy 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, the 25th overall choice in the 1997 NFL draft, played 24  
games in two seasons, with eight starts. He had 73 total tackles 
and two quarterback sacks. Michels was the 27th player selected in 
the 1996 draft 
</P>
<P>
	He started nine games as a rookie and then five more in 1997.  
Last year, Michels tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right 
knee and missed the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said Michels would compete for a starting job in  
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Are Faster Lanes an Illusion? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The urge to change lanes while driving may be caused by an  
optical illusion that convinces people the cars in the other lane 
are going faster, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic problem is that cars spread out when they're going  
quickly and bunch up when they slow down, said Dr. Donald 
Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto. 
So when you pass a bunch of slower cars in the other lane, it 
happens fairly quickly. But if you are passed by the same cars 
while your lane slows temporarily, they go by one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	That leads to the illusion that the other lane is moving faster.  
</P>
<P>
	Redelmeier's advice: ``Resist small temptations to change  
lanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, Redelmeier and a  
Stanford University statistician reported the results of computer 
simulations of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed that a driver can spend more time being overtaken by  
cars in the other lane than in passing them, even though both lanes 
travel at the same average speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you're going to have many more moments of frustration to  
balance the relatively few moments of pleasure,'' Redelmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also showed 120 driving students a videotape of  
an adjacent lane of real traffic, depicting a side view from the 
back seat of a car. Seventy percent believed the traffic they saw 
was going faster than the car with the camera, when in fact it was 
going slightly slower on average. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ervin, head of the engineering research division at the  
University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, said the 
study offers ``a great hypothesis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important and interesting issue that deserves more  
attention,'' especially with experiments that follow real drivers 
in their vehicles, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Lions Coach Denied Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Lions coach Wayne Fontes' claim  
that he suffered injuries while coaching wasn't credible, a 
magistrate wrote in denying Fontes worker disability compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fontes has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence  
that he has a disability, which arose out of, and in the course of, 
his employment with the Detroit Lions,'' Magistrate John Hurbis 
wrote in the decision dated Aug. 6 and released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes' lawyer, Gary Busch, said he would appeal the decision,  
calling Hurbis' ruling ``political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like the magistrate was intent on denying benefits  
throughout the whole case,'' Busch said. ``Wayne isn't the most 
sympathetic plaintiff, but legally and factually, this should have 
been winnable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for the Detroit Lions seeking comment weren't  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes, 60, spent 11 years with the Lions as a defensive  
backfield coach and eventually as coach, taking over from the fired 
Darryl Rogers late in the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes, fired after the 1996 season by Lions owner William Clay  
Ford, last year filed a claim for disability benefits, saying he 
has been unable to resume coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted he was hurt first during a game in 1989 and again  
Nov. 12, 1995, during a game against Tampa Bay. While he was 
talking to his defensive squad on the sidelines, the Lions' offense 
turned the ball over, and the defense rushed onto the field, he 
said. Two players hit his shoulders, and a third knocked him to the 
ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He got up and continued coaching but was hurting badly by the  
time he got home, Fontes testified during a hearing in June on his 
compensation claim against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurbis questioned Fontes' claims that he was injured while  
employed by the Lions and that those injuries were serious enough 
to prevent him from working again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court finds as less than candid the testimony of the  
plaintiff and his witnesses,'' Hurbis wrote, suggesting Fontes' 
injuries could have stemmed from a 1990 automobile wreck, for which 
he was treated at Henry Ford Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the decision, Hurbis questioned how Fontes can continue  
playing golf despite his alleged suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would a man subject himself to the rigors of playing golf,  
when to endure pain thereafter, would require him to spend the next 
three days on the floor,'' Hurbis wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	During the June hearing, the Lions presented no witnesses and  
the only evidence the medical records of Fontes' treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch said that since the Lions had no witnesses testify, the  
evidence should have weighed in Fontes' favor, ``but the magistrate 
said he didn't believe him anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Fontes, Wayne's brother and a former assistant coach for  
the Lions, testified that he had to help his brother get off the 
floor, where Fontes often rested after practices because of his 
injured back. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurbis found the need for such assistance ``inconceivable.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems incongruous to the court that the nature of the  
plaintiff's medical problems would render him unable to arise from 
the floor, considering the medical testimony of either doctor,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	At his June hearing, Fontes acknowledged that he swims and  
continues to play golf despite the injury. His attorney said Fontes 
often agrees to play in charity golf events. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not playing good golf, he's out there trying to lend his  
name to a good cause,'' Busch said. ``There have been times he goes 
and plays two or three holes and then he can't play any more.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Work To Subdue Bullies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Brianna Thomas' mood shifts suddenly from  
bubbly to thoughtful as she recalls years of being teased about her 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was little I would cry,'' said the 16-year-old, who is  
a junior at Woodruff High School. ``When I got older I'd say, 
'That's just you being ignorant' and walk away. But some kids in 
school tend to be pushed to the edge and they could snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As students across the country return to schools newly fortified  
with metal detectors, hall cameras and security guards, experts and 
students say the most important deterrent to violence is often 
overlooked: Teaching students to respect one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security issues are a necessary knee-jerk reaction, but what  
goes on every day in every school and every hallway is more 
important to the solution than locking up our schools,'' said 
George Batsche, a school psychology professor at the University of 
South Florida and co-director of the university's Institute for 
School Reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The two students who killed 15 people, including themselves, at  
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., reportedly felt 
alienated and harassed by other students. Students' alienation and 
anger also were cited in the wake of other school shootings, 
including those in Paducah, Ky.; Springfield, Ore. and Jonesboro, 
Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of the situations is so unique, but the anger that came  
out is pretty common and anger can come from a lot of things,'' 
said Susan Gorin, executive director of the National Association of 
School Psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Such issues are quite real to students such as Ashayla Scott, a  
16-year-old junior at Woodruff who says she's dreamed about 
classmates shooting up her school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always think about those who are known to be bullies as  
being violent,'' she said. ``But now it's those who are quiet and 
always picked on that you have to wonder about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the cause, anger and alienation can be  
exacerbated by being bullied or taunted, psychologists say. In 
fact, those who are bullied, not the bullies, usually commit the 
most violent acts, Batsche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists say television violence, the Internet and easy  
access to weapons can make the consequences of bullying more dire 
than in the past, when many students suffered in silence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet allows kids to interact with others who share  
similar feelings, and can make them feel it's OK to seek revenge, 
Batsche said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, there were individuals in schools considered  
weird or different, but they didn't have anybody to talk to; they 
had no peer group to activate them,'' he said. ``Now they find kids 
a thousand miles away who feel the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, victims of teasing do not act out in violence against  
other students, but inward, at themselves. On Wednesday, in 
southern Illinois, administrators at Freeburg High School said they 
were investigating whether the bullying of a freshman by fellow 
students led the 14-year-old to commit suicide last week. His 
father said the boy shot himself after four days of relentless 
tormenting. 
</P>
<P>
	How children deal with bullying depends on their personality,  
but experts say it's how schools deal with bullies and victims that 
will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Batsche said schools should include social skills training in  
the curriculum and adopt a zero tolerance policy for bullying -- 
including intolerance for bullying by teachers and other adults. 
</P>
<P>
	When students returned to Taft Elementary School in Lockport,  
Ill. last week, they were told that bullying won't be tolerated and 
will be met with tougher penalties, Principal Trish Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe harassing and bullying behavior is at the core  
of the violence,'' she said. ``Usually the reason kids get teased 
is because they look different or dress different or their 
mannerisms are different. We want kids to know that just because 
someone is different doesn't mean they're bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But how can schools distinguish between normal teasing and  
harmful bullying? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had parents say 'That's just normal boy behavior,'''  
Carlson said. ``But it's not normal boy behavior when someone's in 
tears on a daily basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, school administrators say it's difficult to make  
anti-bullying efforts a priority because of pressure to implement 
more visible and immediate security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel awareness programs impact more kids than putting in  
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cameras, but we have to do some 
security to satisfy parents and the community,'' said Galesburg, 
Ill. superintendent Ronald Cope.

<HEADLINE> Some Donate to Multiple Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 1,600 people have contributed money  
to two or more presidential candidates this year, with some handing 
out $1,000 checks to four or five competitors across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City real estate developer Lewis Rudin gave $1,000  
apiece to Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush -- the 
party front-runners -- and the same amount to Democrat Bill Bradley 
and Republicans Dan Quayle and Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team  
and Phoenix Suns basketball team, contributed $1,000 apiece to 
Bradley, Bush and Republican John McCain. Both Rudin and Colangelo 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of campaign finance records found 1,622 people who  
contributed to two or more presidential candidates this year, with 
122 giving to at least three. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they shelled out $4.1 million, according to the study  
conducted by the Campaign Study Group for The Associated Press. 
Most gave the $1,000 legal maximum to each candidate they 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts say many of these donors are hedging their  
bets, trying to make sure whoever wins will count them as financial 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has benefited most from the strategy. Almost two-thirds of  
the multiple-candidate givers -- 1,055 people in all -- gave to Bush. 
The Texas governor will report raising $50 million by the end of 
the month, aides said. That's more money than any presidential 
candidate ever has had available to seek the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're giving for pragmatic reasons, a donation to George  
W. Bush makes a lot of sense,'' said Larry Makinson, executive 
director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which 
studies campaign finance. ``There are a lot of pragmatic donors out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore received money from 581 people who also  
supported another presidential candidate. Among those, 228 gave to 
Gore and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic Chairman Ivan Seidenberg contributed $1,000 each  
to Gore, Bush and McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce 
Committee, which oversees the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our company's and our executives' view that it's early in  
the process, and we will contribute to a number of credible 
candidates to encourage a healthy dialogue among all qualified 
contenders,'' Bell Atlantic spokeswoman Susan Butta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic is awaiting federal approval of its merger with  
GTE and is seeking permission to offer long-distance telephone 
service. The regional Bell company also has a key interest in 
legislation that will decide which companies will be able to carry 
data over long-distance telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Magazine editor Bill Regardie gave $1,000 to Gore in April and  
$1,000 to Bush in June. Regardie said one friend was raising money 
for Gore, another for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both said, `I need your help. It's important to me,''' said  
Regardie, whose new magazine, Regardie's Power, is due out in 
September. ``Those people have come through for me in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Regardie added, no one can accuse him of playing  
favorites if he gives to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National  
Committee who is now a Washington lobbyist and a member of Bush's 
steering committee, not only gave to the candidate he is supporting 
but to four others: Dole, McCain and two who have since withdrawn 
from the race, Lamar Alexander and John Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given to the people who helped me when I was chairman,''  
Barbour said. ``When people are nice to you and help you do your 
job, you ought to show them your appreciation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who are giving to Bush may decide to hedge a little  
bit, Makinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're giving for ideological reasons, there's a whole  
field of people to choose from,'' Makinson said. ``Even if you're 
giving just for pragmatic reasons, you may feel it judicious to 
cover your bets.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Wants Evidence Back From NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- In a ruling issued Wednesday, a judge  
said University of Florida police were wrong to forward information 
gathered in a search of sports agent Tank Black's office to the NFL 
Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge James R. Barber III of Columbia, S.C., ordered  
campus police to stop passing along information to the NFL and to 
retrieve everything already handed over. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped short, however, of ordering the evidence suppressed,  
leaving that to any court that might hear a case against Black or 
his company, Professional Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Black nor anyone from his company have been charged in  
the investigation. Black's company is accused of making cash 
payments to former Florida players Johnny Rutledge, Jevon Kearse 
and Reggie McGrew while they were still eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first leg in proving there's a conspiracy  
by the NFLPA and government agencies to conduct a witch hunt on 
Tank Black and drive him out of business,'' Black's lawyer, Leonard 
Mungo, said. 
</P>
<P>
	With help of evidence gathered in the police investigation, the  
NFLPA came to the conclusion that Black's company paid the players. 
The union has recommended his license be suspended for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	That case is scheduled to go to arbitration. Black and Mungo are  
contesting the choice of Roger Kaplan as the arbitrator, arguing 
that Kaplan is the NFLPA's chosen arbitrator and therefore can't be 
impartial. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Barber refused to quash the search warrant police  
obtained for Black's office in May, as Black had originally asked. 
The judge did, however, say that four of the five bases for the 
warrant were ``misleading, untruthful and incorrect.'' The fifth 
gave probable cause to demonstrate Black had violated Florida's 
agent law and made the search valid. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty of violating the law, Black could face five  
years in jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber also ordered police to return all items taken during the  
10-hour search that were beyond the scope of the search warrant.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Resumes Quest for 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken was activated from the disabled list  
Wednesday, eager to resume his quest to reach 400 homers and 3,000 
career hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was at third base and batting seventh for the Baltimore  
Orioles against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. It was his first game 
since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been sidelined with nerve irritation in his lower back.  
Ripken had 399 career homers and 2,968 hits when placed on the 
disabled list in August. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 31 games left to reach both milestones, although Orioles  
manager Ray Miller said he would probably rest Ripken on occasion 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hit his 399th homer on July 25. Three games later, in the  
final home game before a lengthy road trip, he hit a liner off the 
top of the wall in left field that went for a double. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to hit a home run because I thought it would be great  
to do it here at home,'' he said. ``I was able to concentrate and 
put a good swing on the ball. But it seemed to take me out of my 
game a little bit, trying to swing hard and hit a home run every 
time. You can't hit a home run by swinging for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting his 3,000th hit this season will be difficult, given  
that he has to average more than one hit per game. Ripken said 
there would be no special feeling in joining Tony Gwynn and Wade 
Boggs in reaching the milestone this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 3,000 hits happen, it happens. But it hasn't been a goal to  
do it in a certain period of time and it hasn't been a goal to do 
it in a certain year,'' he said. ``You just play, and things happen 
when they happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who turned 39 last week, played in a record 2,632  
straight games before voluntarily ending the streak last September. 
He went on the disabled list for the first time in his career April 
20 because of a bad back, missing three weeks, and returned to DL 
shortly after experiencing back pain Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In between he hit in 49 of 61 games, batting .352 with 15 homers  
and 43 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Orioles long ago dropped out of contention, Ripken  
doesn't have much to play for except personal goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The true satisfaction out of the game of baseball is to win,''  
he said. ``It's a whole lot more fun playing on a winner and having 
a chance to go to the playoffs. It's been a frustrating season in 
that regard.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec's Son Indicted in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The son of one of the International  
Olympic Committee's most powerful members was indicted Wednesday on 
federal charges that he lied to the FBI about the Salt Lake bribery 
scandal and fraudulently obtained a green card through his 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second criminal case arising from the alleged  
vote-buying during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges allege that John Kim, the son of South Korean IOC  
executive board member Un-yong Kim, lied to an FBI agent in 
February when he described the work he did for a Utah company 
called Keystone Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Kim's job was a sham and that his  
salary was actually paid by the Salt Lake Bid Committee and Kim 
himself, as part of a scheme to get Kim a green card and influence 
his father to vote in favor of Salt Lake's Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first criminal case resulting from the scandal, Utah  
businessman David Simmons admitted that he helped create the fake 
job for the younger Kim at Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, who pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor tax charge,  
told Salt Lake Olympic Committee investigators the deal was 
approved by Un-yong Kim and arranged by Tom Welch, who headed the 
Olympic bid and later the organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim has responded by suing Simmons in South Korea, claiming  
Simmons' testimony was false. He claimed his deal with Simmons' 
company was purely business and that he knew nothing of the 
arrangement between the bid committee and Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Kim has been cited as a candidate to replace Juan  
Antonio Samaranch as IOC chief in 2001. Kim has consistently denied 
any wrongdoing in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from the Salt Lake committee. 
Kim got only a ``severe warning'' from the IOC in March. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16-count indictment unsealed Wednesday in New York City  
charges that John Kim lied to the FBI by claiming his job at 
Keystone was a real, full-time and permanent position. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Kim used the sham position to fraudulently  
obtain a green card and then used the immigration document to visit 
the United States repeatedly from 1995 to this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim family spokesman Bill Schechter said Wednesday that he had  
not yet seen the indictment and had no immediate response. John Kim 
was in South Korea, but Schechter said five armed Justice 
Department agents had appeared at Kim's home on Long Island on 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Schechter also said the Justice Department has a copy of a  
document in which Kim was informed in writing by SLOC officials 
``that Sen. (Orrin) Hatch is prepared to provide special 
legislation if necessary to overcome any problems that John may 
have on his green card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Hatch said he only advised the committee on  
immigration procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``My office furnished the information as we routinely do with  
all constituent requests for assistance with immigration problems. 
To my recollection, no other action was taken,'' said Hatch, a 
four-term U.S. Senator from Utah and chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's indictment said John Kim received $104,000 through  
phony contracts and invoices until Simmons finally cut him off in 
1992 for ``non-performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim then arranged to reimburse Simmons $40,000 to partly cover  
the expense of his own employment. The Salt Lake Bid Committee 
added $78,000 in reimbursement in disguised payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he used fake contracts and phony invoices to  
conceal the arrangement and deducted John Kim's salary from his 
taxes as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department began investigating allegations of  
bribery in Salt Lake's Olympic bid last December. The Internal 
Revenue Service and Customs Service are also involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's lawyer, Tom Schaffer, said he has not seen Wednesday's  
indictment and wouldn't comment on it. He said government 
investigators haven't contacted his client. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim faces 17 felony charges. Giving the FBI false information  
carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges involving the use of a green card carry maximum  
penalties of 10 years in the first two instances and up to 15 years 
for the other violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has an extradition treaty with South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Francophone Summit Coming to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- Leaders from the French-speaking  
world gather in eastern Canada this weekend for the 8th Francophone 
Summit -- three days of talks on culture, trade and politics, all of 
it in French. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun  
Sen and former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali were 
among those attending the meeting in New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	Boutros-Ghali is the first secretary general of the 52-member La  
Francophonie, a loose grouping of French-influenced countries from 
around the world, most of them former French colonies in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization tries to promote and maintain French culture,  
but has been recently expanding its scope to touch more on trade 
and politics. In recent years, it has sent observers to elections 
in Djibouti and Togo. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's theme is youth, although other more pressing issues  
might steal the limelight when the summit begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and Quebec are both hosts, and their continued dispute  
over Quebec's independence aspirations are sure to surface as 
separatists try to garner support for their cause from their 
francophone friends. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the issue of human rights may flare again.  
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International lists 32 of the 52 invited delegations as  
human rights abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the last summit, held in 1997 in Vietnam, the hosts came  
under fire for clamping down on the press just as the summit was 
calling for all members to respect human rights and basic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably this year, several of the invited guests are  
currently at war with one another, battling rebel insurgencies or 
struggling with internal political strife. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Congo hasn't confirmed who, if anyone, would come.  
Rwanda, which is also on the guest list, is currently backing 
rebels who have fought a yearlong war to oust Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila from power. 
</P>
<P>
	Burundi is sending its vice-president, a notable choice  
considering what happened the last time Burundi sent its head of 
state to Canada for a francophone summit in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-president Jean-Baptists Bagaza had just settled in Quebec  
City when word came that he had been deposed in a coup, led by 
Burundi's current president, Pierre Buyoya.

<HEADLINE> Marketing to New Moms Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hospitals, long under fire for giving out free  
baby formula, are coming under scrutiny for other gifts: credit 
card applications, life insurance brochures, chocolate bars and 
other products aimed at the new family. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has been collecting stories from  
new moms offended by the marketing at childbirth and he's asking 
the American Hospital Association to discourage the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think the hospital should be taking on the role  
of facilitating corporate promotions,'' said Ann Leonard of 
Washington, who gave birth in July to daughter Dewi and was handed 
five bags of promotions on her way out of the hospital. ``They're 
supposed to tell me how to take care of my baby, not help some 
company make sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many parents love the free stuff, and hospital nurses say  
the only complaints they get are when a competing hospital gives 
away more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an overwhelming time,'' said Carol Rosse, spokeswoman for  
SSM St. Mary's Health Center outside St. Louis, who also recently 
had a baby. ``You're sort of appreciative for anything you can get 
your hands on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and other hospital officials said the only significant  
criticism usually involves the free baby formula that is often 
included in the packages. Critics contend that giving away formula 
discourages moms from breast feeding, which can be frustrating at 
first but which medical experts consider healthier. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nader's is the first organized protest over other commercial  
products that have crept into the gift bags. The products are 
packaged by national companies that give them away to hospitals, 
which in turn give them away to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Many new mothers say they love the freebies. Brynda Fowler of  
Austin, Texas, said she saved $4 or $5 in diaper coupons and 
enjoyed the free baby wipes and free diaper bag in her gift pack. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the credit card and life insurance offers, ``I just threw  
it in the trash,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But George Washington University Hospital, the target of  
Leonard's complaint, agreed the commercial items were 
``inappropriate'' and promised to replace them with neutral gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``After our review of the bags' content we found your complaints  
to be valid,'' Phillip S. Schaengold, the hospital's chief 
executive officer, wrote Nader's group after it lodged the 
complaint on Leonard's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the issue has been brought to the  
American Hospital Association's attention. Spokesman Rick Wade said 
the group would research the issue and, if appropriate, suggest 
that its members examine their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can overdo anything,'' Wade said, saying certain products  
might be ``over the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At University Hospital in Cleveland, head nurse Catherine Dahlem  
gets calls almost every week for her staff to hand out one product 
or another. She doesn't have time to sort through all of the 
offers, so she just uses the packages put together by national 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix can include just about any product that might interest a  
new parent, such as a new credit card to help buy all those new 
baby products, or life insurance for parents starting to plan 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies promoting their products pay the distribution and  
marketing firms to be included in the packs, which are given to 
hospitals without charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the hospitals love getting them,'' said  
Kristi Goyette of American Baby Group, which distributes about 3.5 
million packages each year to 4,000 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nader is pressing his case by collecting the names of mothers  
who range from annoyed to outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you are a new family, and you have all your anxieties,  
and you're bombarded by promotional materials,'' said Hailyn Chen, 
26, of South Pasadena, Calif., who gave birth last year to 
Katherine. ``You almost think, to be a good parent, maybe I do need 
to get all this stuff.''

<HEADLINE> New Show Obsesses on Collectibles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who woulda thunk it: a letter from George  
Washington sharing air time with Speedy Gonzalez jelly glasses. A 
Beanie Baby collection competing for attention with a 19th-century 
Bible. A Civil War officer's pocket journal alongside, yes, a 
miniature model of the General Lee, the car from ``The Dukes of 
Hazzard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's all on your TV screen to see, and -- if you so desire in  
this age of boundless synergy -- on the Internet to buy and to have 
and to hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Eras, niches and tastes meld -- collapse, some might argue -- into  
one aggrandized, commodified pile of Very Significant Stuff in 
``Treasures in Your Home,'' a curious example of what might happen 
if someone put eBay, QVC and ``The Price Is Right'' into a blender 
and pressed frappe. 
</P>
<P>
	PAX TV's ``Treasures'' (7-8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 6-7 p.m.  
Central and Mountain, Monday-Friday), which made its debut last 
month, resembles in some ways PBS's ``The Antiques Road Show,'' 
another haven for garage-sale gurus. But ``Treasures'' takes the 
concept even further, offering a live, simultaneous auction online 
through its Web site, www.treasuresinyourhome.com, which also 
simulcasts the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television's changing, and we're at the forefront of where  
television's migrating to,'' says PAX TV President Jeff Sagansky. 
``It's going to be this multimedia experience where you create 
something for TV, but it lives all day long in other forms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The format is heavy on regular-guy participation -- average Joe  
meets Independent Appraiser to see what that old family Bible or 
mama's childhood doll is really worth: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ron has what he believes to be a Confederate Civil War compass.  
Does he? No! It's a replica made in the 1920s, probably in India. 
But it's still worth a C-note! 
</P>
<P>
	--Rachel thinks she has a World War I chocolate tin embossed with  
presidential profiles. Does she? Yes! More than $100! 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar has restored an antique oil can for a locomotive and  
thinks it might have some value. Does it? Beautiful restoration 
job, says the appraiser, but not worth a lot of moola. 
</P>
<P>
	And if they want to put their item up for bids, it goes up on  
the Web site in an instant. Synergy! (An interesting note: Fewer 
people than you might think are willing to put their coveted stuff 
up, even if the chance of profit is good.) 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, ``Treasures'' is cheerful and harmless, exuding  
middle-of-the-road bonhomie and trafficking in stuff you might see 
on walls and shelves at TGI Fridays or The Ground Round -- old 
advertising accouterments, antique lamps, books with very 
serious-looking bindings. 
</P>
<P>
	But look a little deeper. It's a bit disconcerting how each item  
is presented as a cultural fetish object. Sure, ``stuff'' is the 
show's stock-in-trade, but ``Treasures,'' a joint production of PAX 
TV and ChannelSpace Entertainment's Collectingchannel.com Web site, 
elevates collecting to an obsession. The consumptive message: 
Collect what you want, but for goodness' sake collect SOMETHING. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers are invited on the live telecast to tell about ``a  
collectible that changed your life.'' A parade of stuff-bearing 
hopefuls wait with expectant faces as their goods are appraised. 
Host John Burke's booster-like enthusiasm, while charming, only 
accentuates this feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there one thing you've learned this week that you didn't  
know?'' he asks guest co-host Shelley Taylor Morgan of ``General 
Hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' replies Morgan. ``I want more stuff.'' (Morgan later  
reveals she collects man-in-the-moon items, and shows a video of 
some of the more than 1,500 in her home.) 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Frank Holsinger, a Union officer in the Civil War who  
faithfully kept his diary through Gettysburg, through Antietam, 
through a visit to President Lincoln in Washington. Today it's part 
of a show that also features an on-the-spot report from a Barbie 
40th-anniversary convention. And here's the great part: It's worth 
hundreds of dollars! 
</P>
<P>
	Another segment features a letter written by Anne Frank's  
father, Otto, a few weeks after he was freed from a concentration 
camp. Shortly afterward, the topic is a ``Star Wars'' poster -- 
rarity or reproduction? Not that there's anything wrong with 
pop-culture collectibles, but such juxtaposition risks trivializing 
the important and elevating the irrelevant. The chaff becomes the 
wheat, and the wheat is forgotten in the clutter. 
</P>
<P>
	But this isn't really the fault of the program, which is  
entertaining and informative. In today's marketplace, everything is 
a commodity. See it on TV, desire it and, now, bid for it online, 
all in just moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look hard enough and long enough, you can find just  
about everything,'' independent appraiser Dave Maloney says on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be right. But behind ``Treasures in Your Home'' lurks a  
question any collector will -- or should -- eventually face: 
Ultimately, is everything really worth finding? 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	MARLEY TRIBUTE: The late Bob Marley's music will be the subject  
of a special all-star tribute on TNT. Previous tributes to Burt 
Bacharach and Johnny Cash have been successes both critically and 
commercially for the network. Erykah Badu, Sheryl Crow, Lauryn 
Hill, Queen Latifah, Sarah McLachlan, Busta Rhymes and Seal have 
already agreed to join the Marley family for the special, which 
will be taped in Jamaica on December 4. The network will air the 
special on Dec. 19, making it a Marley Christmas.

<HEADLINE> FB Coach June Jones Goes to Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Everybody keeps asking June Jones the same  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would a football coach turn down a fat NFL contract for a  
much-lower paying job at a university that is hurting financially 
and riding an 18-game losing streak? 
</P>
<P>
	For June Jones, the new coach at the University of Hawaii, the  
answer is easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something I've always wanted to do,'' he told the  
latest questioner at a recent booster club rally. ``I played here 
(in 1974) and I coached here (as an assistant in 1983), so it 
wasn't a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it's something I wanted for a long time. If it  
wasn't Hawaii, I wouldn't have done it. It wasn't something that 
just transpired in a couple of months. I wanted to do this for a 
number of years, but the timing wasn't right until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Chargers certainly wanted him back as coach. They  
were willing to remove the ``interim'' designation from his job 
description after he replaced Kevin Gilbride in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	No thanks.  
</P>
<P>
	They offered him a tidy sum.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks again, but no.  
</P>
<P>
	And, in a last effort to sway him, the Chargers emphasized  
Hawaii's budget problems and dismal record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried very hard to talk me into staying, but I have had  
no second thoughts about my decision to leave,'' said Jones, who 
went 3-7 with the Chargers after a 19-29 record as coach of the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't get me wrong, I love the NFL,'' he said. ``I was a  
player or a coach for 20 years. But I enjoy being part of the 
situation here. It's do or die. My alma mater is in dire straits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Hawaii, Jones inherits a team trying to dig its way out of  
the nation's longest losing streak, which dates to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will get a sense of where the Rainbows stand on Saturday  
night. Hawaii opens the season at home against No. 21 Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're not very deep,'' he said. ``We recruited  
players to fill the holes. But a lot of JC players haven't 
practiced and we can't rely on them the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're kind of thin. We haven't been able to  
practice the way we want for fear of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had he said those words when he was informed that one  
of his starting defensive backs had gone down. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I mean,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones wasn't trying to tip his hand as he talked about the  
Hawaii run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of things we did in San Diego and Atlanta,'' he  
said. ``We're trying to find a niche as to what we can do. A lot of 
times the talent has to dictate it, so we need to get in place to 
be fully efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge doesn't faze him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about what we have to get done,'' Jones  
said. ``We know we're backed into a corner. I knew that when I took 
the job. We've known about the deficit and know what we have to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the field, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. I'm looking  
forward to the task of making this a winning program again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven years ago, Hawaii was looking up, going 10-2 and  
upsetting Illinois in the Holiday Bowl. There's been nothing but 
trouble since, culminating with an 0-12 record last season and the 
firing of Fred vonAppen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a firm believer that history and tradition do matter and  
the players need to understand that there is a tradition here,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	His returning players endured a 5-31 record during vonAppen's  
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't won a football game in a while, but they need to  
understand that not too long ago they were Holiday Bowl 
champions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones acknowledges it will take time to get things right.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be some growing pains,'' he said. ``But as we  
get the players in place, work through all the repetitions and 
learn to do things correctly, we'll get better as time progresses. 
But it's not going to happen overnight.''

<HEADLINE>  Zedillo Faces Cat Calls During Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo faced  
catcalls Wednesday from opposition lawmakers attacking his record 
on poverty as he delivered his state-of-the-nation address to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception Zedillo got in Congress contrasted sharply with  
his strength in polls. A survey published Wednesday in the 
newspaper Reforma found two-thirds of Mexicans approve of how 
Zedillo is governing the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fifth state-of-the-nation address, Zedillo steered clear  
of controversial subjects, concentrating on gains in education and 
pledging fairness in July 2000 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo said his administration was meeting its economic goals,  
but conceded poverty was a huge problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that we need to go faster, and deeper, in  
attacking poverty,'' Zedillo said. ``For this we need a strong 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But applause was sparse, and he was interrupted several times by  
catcalls and sarcastic signs held up by members of the 
opposition-dominated legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing well ... with 60 million in poverty,'' read a sign  
held up by congressman Antonio Prats of the left-center Democratic 
Revolution Party during the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Another held up a sign referring to a $65 billion plan to use  
taxpayer money to bail out failed private banks. Some of the bad 
loans being paid off in that program were actually campaign 
donations to Zedillo's party. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo pledged that there would be ``no political use of public  
funds in 2000, as there never has been any such use in any year of 
this administration,'' -- drawing a roar of disbelief from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew his biggest applause when he said, ``This government  
will continue to handle the conflicts that have caused so much 
concern using legality, never authoritarianism, and tolerance, 
never violent confrontation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Zedillo delivered a state-of-the-nation address,  
the peso had plummeted, the government was chopping its budget and 
lawmakers were screaming about a mammoth bank bailout plan. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the economy is sound and, according to a new poll,  
Zedillo's popularity is at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The peso is trading stronger than it was a year ago, the stock  
market's IPC index has risen from under 3,000 points to over 5,000, 
and inflation is in line with a 13 percent goal for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget, slashed four times last year because of diminishing  
oil revenues, contains an $840 million surplus in the first half of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Reforma poll also suggests Zedillo's support has more to  
do with his character than his performance. Forty-seven percent 
gave him high marks for honesty, compared with 14 percent 
describing him as ``bad'' or ``very bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in regard to the economy -- which Mexicans identify as the  
greatest problem facing their country -- approval and disapproval 
for Zedillo's policies was about even at 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those surveyed say they believe that after  
Zedillo's term ends next year, the country will have an economic 
crisis like those that have frequently followed presidential 
transitions. The poll of 1,550 people has a margin of error of 2.5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo has faced criticism that the growth -- gross domestic  
product rose a healthy 2.6 percent in the first half of the year -- 
hasn't yet filtered down to most Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
	In what his supporters is an attempt to encourage greater  
democracy, Zedillo has declined to name a successor for the first 
time since his party took power 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That opens the way for the ruling party's first primary.

<HEADLINE>  Zedillo Faces Cat Calls During Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo faced  
catcalls Wednesday from opposition lawmakers attacking his record 
on poverty as he delivered his state-of-the-nation address to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception Zedillo got in Congress contrasted sharply with  
his strength in polls. A survey published Wednesday in the 
newspaper Reforma found two-thirds of Mexicans approve of how 
Zedillo is governing the country. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Richard Thompson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) -- Ever the self-deprecator, Richard  
Thompson ponders what he did wrong to become one of modern music's 
most acclaimed cult figures while missing the wide success many 
think he merits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe my big mistake has been not realizing you've got to have  
an image,'' Thompson said over lunch at an Italian restaurant near 
his home in the coastal Los Angeles community of Pacific Palisades. 
``I've got no concept of self-image, really. I've got no desire to 
have one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his core of devotees, though, the British folk-rocker has a  
definite image that has ripened through three decades of pious 
musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
	It begins with his days as a teen guitar sensation with the  
English folk band Fairport Convention in the late 1960s. It 
continues through the duo years of the 1970s and early '80s with 
then-wife Linda Thompson -- their marriage ended soon after the 
release of ``Shoot Out the Lights,'' an album on many critics' 
top-10 list of the '80s. It culminates with his nearly two decades 
as a solo artist whose latest album, ``Mock Tudor,'' hit stores 
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an image of a brilliant musician and songwriter who early  
on preferred to be somewhere to the left and rear of center stage 
and ultimately got his wish: Thompson's quirky, sardonic music has 
captivated his merry band of followers but failed to grab the 
record industry or mainstream listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was to ever have a hit, it would mean that the bar of  
excellence would have been raised so much in pop music that I would 
lay down and flop like a fish,'' said Bonnie Raitt, who covered 
Thompson's ``Dimming of the Day'' on her album ``Longing in Their 
Hearts'' and her live recording, ``Road Tested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's underrated and underappreciated,'' Raitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	At this stage, as he just turned 50, Thompson shrugs it off with  
a loud, laconic, ``It's OK, it's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Thompson remains signed to a major label, Capitol, at  
a time when many second-tier musicians have found themselves cut 
loose through record-company consolidation. He packs smaller venues 
with adoring fans, touring with a band of old friends and now, even 
family. His son, Teddy, has joined his current tour. 
</P>
<P>
	And Thompson has inspired a legion of musicians, prompting two  
tribute albums that featured R.E.M., David Byrne, Los Lobos and 
Victoria Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a major influence of mine,'' said Shawn Colvin, who  
toured with Thompson in the early 1990s. ``I learned so much on 
that tour. It was like songwriting college. I thought, 'I'm a 
finger painter and this guy's Picasso.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to a Richard Thompson concert, you see rabid fans,  
enough so that the guy has a career, thank God,'' Colvin said. ``It 
could be worse, but it could be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he would like to have a hit -- though he quickly  
distinguishes, hit album, not single. ``I'm not looking for a 
single hit,'' he said. ``Album would be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hits may have eluded him, but Thompson has managed to have his  
way with his music, blending albums that draw on rock, folk, blues, 
Scottish traditional tunes, jazz, jug-band music -- anything and 
everything that has caught his ear over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though strains of those influences are apparent, ``Mock Tudor''  
is mainly a straight-ahead rock album, unlike the rock and acoustic 
mixes of Thompson's other 1990s efforts such as ``Rumor and Sigh,'' 
``Mirror Blue'' and ``You? Me? Us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the rock treatments suited the songs, a dozen  
tunes that he grudgingly concedes amount to a ``walk down memory 
lane'' of his London years from the 1950s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate that term, really, but it probably is,'' Thompson said.  
``It's stories about people that still have some relevance for me 
now. You still meet the same types of people. There's still the 
same type of creeps out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose there's people that you miss, that's another thing.  
There's a lot of people that didn't make it out of the '60s and 
'70s. I suppose it's a way of me trying to define my relationship 
with them. If I write a song about it, it helps me to understand 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Thompson's fallen comrades were two friends killed in a  
van accident in 1969 that Thompson survived as well as former 
Fairport lead singer Sandy Denny, who died of injuries from a fall 
down the stairs in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mock Tudor'' refers somewhat affectionately, somewhat  
derisively, to the architectural style of tract-housing 
construction in London between the World Wars. What was intended as 
an escape for middle-class city dwellers turned sour as urban 
London spiraled outward. 
</P>
<P>
	``You moved out in the suburbs, and it was supposed to be like  
the country, but it ended up being like the suburbs,'' Thompson 
said. ``You started off with a field behind the house, and you 
went, 'Oh, fantastic, look at this, I'm right in the country.' But, 
of course, the next year, they'd built another mile behind your 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mock Tudor'' is the most personal album yet by Thompson, who  
is fond of distinguishing between the singer and the song. Some of 
the musical recollections are based on his own experiences, some on 
others he knew, some on fictional characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of creative writing, I think, is in a sense to try to  
decode something,'' Thompson said. ``It's trying to decode your own 
life and subsequently other people's lives and their circumstances. 
Where you come from, who your parents were. Why am I in this mess? 
Why am I deranged? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you write songs about it, you can kind of get under some of  
those layers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening track, ``Cooksferry Queen,'' is based on a smalltime  
hood Thompson knew who was transformed into a flower child by a 
hippie girlfriend. ``Sights and Sounds of London Town'' is a 
gazetteer of the old city through the eyes of some seamy denizens. 
``Walking the Long Miles Home'' comes from Thompson's youth, 
hoofing it home from club shows after missing the last bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing track, ``Hope You Like the New Me,'' deals with  
rip-off artists: ``I stole your jokes -- just the good ones, how the 
gang all laughed with glee, I also stole the way you tell them, 
hope you like the new me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're in the music business for any length of time, people  
steal from you to a greater or lesser extent -- other artists, 
managers, agents, publishers,'' Thompson said. ``It's the sort of 
business, like the film business, it attracts some of the wrong 
kind of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson fights one type of rip-off artist, bootleggers who sell  
unauthorized recordings of his concerts. He's released a handful of 
``official bootlegs,'' available by mail-order through fan clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do get heavily bootlegged,'' he said. ``The only way I can  
fight back really is at the end of every major tour, to have 
something ready to go that's better recorded than anybody else 
would have and that's representative of that tour. I really don't 
like having my copyright stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's just as pragmatic about creating music. Though he jokes  
that he does his creative work in a ``small monastic cell, where I 
thrash myself with birch twigs,'' Thompson treats music as a 
business, his songwriting as a job. He said that when writing for 
an album, he tries to put in a workmanlike, 9-to-5 day shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up his career, Thompson hurls out a string of whimsical  
epitaphs: ``Tortured, unappreciated genius,'' ``He died with his 
boots on,'' ``I didn't know people were still making music like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, he said, he's happy to keep recording, get on stage  
and play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music industry's in such chaos at the moment, anyway,''  
Thompson said. ``There's such huge changes every week. No one quite 
has a clue how the dust is going to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be on the fringes and gaze cynically across the  
bedeviled landscape and just hang on until I see which way the dice 
have fallen.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Rookie Steve Francis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets signed rookie guard Steve  
Francis to a contract Wednesday, five days after acquiring his 
rights from Vancouver in the largest trade in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, the second overall pick in the June draft, had refused  
to sign with the Grizzlies, setting in motion a three-team, 
11-player trade. Houston made the deal under the presumption it 
would be able to get Francis under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this opportunity to come for a long  
time,'' Francis told Houston television station KRIV. ``I think I 
really worked hard to get myself into this position and no matter 
what the money, I'm still the type of person who loves to play 
basketball and have a love for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although terms were not disclosed, Francis is due a three-year  
contract worth about $9 million under the rookie salary cap. The 
parameters of the deal would have been the same in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve is a special player,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich  
said. ``I don't think you see a guy with his kind of talent come 
around often. We feel blessed to have the opportunity to bring him 
here and make him a big part of our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis joins a lineup of Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon and  
Charles Barkley, although Barkley hasn't re-signed with Houston 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Francis said that with those guys as his  
teammates he should lead the league in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't ... something will be wrong,'' said Francis,  
Houston's projected starting point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Francis, Vancouver sent journeyman forward Tony  
Massenburg to Houston for forwards Othella Harrington and Antoine 
Carr and guards Michael Dickerson and Brent Price. The Rockets also 
gave the Grizzlies an undisclosed amount of cash plus a first-round 
draft pick over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando sent Don MacLean and a future first-round pick to  
Houston in exchange for the Grizzlies' Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, 
Rodrick Rhodes and Makhtar Ndiaye. The Magic also dealt their 2002 
second-round pick to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Francis, a second-team All-American in his only  
season at Maryland, averaged 17 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.5 
assists while leading the Terrapins to a 26-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two previous seasons, Francis led Houston-area San  
Jacinto Junior College and Alleghany Community College to unbeaten 
records.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed in Texas Hacking Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A high school dropout was executed  
Wednesday for beating and hacking to death a Vietnamese immigrant 
so he could have his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond James Jones, 39, used a meat cleaver to murder Su Van  
Dang, 51, in a 1988 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones told police Dang tried to run from the house, but he  
dragged him back inside. Dang's body was set on fire in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came three years after Jones was released from prison  
for holding up a convenience store. He was the 22nd Texas inmate to 
be executed this year and the 100th to go to the Texas death 
chamber during Gov. George W. Bush's 4 1/2 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	In appeals rejected by the courts, Jones said he killed the  
victim in self-defense while resisting a homosexual advance, that 
he was mentally retarded and that the theft of the stereo was an 
afterthought, meaning he should not have been charged with capital 
murder, which specifies a slaying be committed as part of another 
felony.

<HEADLINE> Willie Mays Sr. Dies at 89 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Willie Mays Sr., the father of the  
Hall of Fame outfielder, died after a brief illness. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Mays, a retired steelworker and railroad porter, died Friday at  
Sequoia Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Mays was a versatile athlete and passed his love of  
baseball on to his son, who played for the Giants in New York and 
San Francisco, and later the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mays Sr. was born in the industrial town of Westfield, Ala., and  
played for black baseball teams in the South. He worked on 
passenger trains as a porter and later in a Westfield steel mill. 
At one point, he and his son, then in high school, played together 
on the mill's semiprofessional baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father ... made a very good living there,'' Mays said. ``I  
really didn't have a hard time eating like other people around me 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mays attended many of his son's games with the Giants before he  
lost his sight because of glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his son, Mays is survived by a grandson.

<HEADLINE> Gas Not Blame of Gulf War Illnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Soldiers exposed to nerve gas during the  
Persian Gulf War were no more ill than other veterans of the war, 
according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego say  
their study indicates that the nerve gases sarin and cyclosarin 
aren't necessarily to blame for the illnesses reported by thousands 
of Gulf War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared hospitalization records of 124,500 Army  
veterans who may have been exposed to the nerve gases and 224,800 
who were not. 
</P>
<P>
	For the four years after the 1991 war, there was no difference  
in how many of each group were hospitalized for any reason. There 
also was no significant difference in hospitalization rates for any 
of 15 specific types of disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't rule out some possible low-exposure effects,'' said  
Dr. Gregory Gray, a Navy captain who headed the study. ``But it's 
strong evidence that there's not a difference in hospitalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nerve gas study appeared in Wednesday's issue of the  
American Journal of Epidemiology, published by the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Hygiene and Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Sullivan, head of the National Gulf War Resource Center, a  
Washington, D.C.-based group formed on behalf of sick Gulf War 
veterans, said the study is unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their tortured history of lies leaves them with zero  
credibility on the issue of Gulf War illnesses,'' Sullivan said, 
claiming the military has changed its story many times on toxic 
exposures during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that we would never, ever trust the tobacco  
industry if they issued a statement saying that cigarettes improved 
your health,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans who might have been exposed to nerve gas were in  
military units deployed near the Khamisiyah weapons depot when it 
was demolished in March 1991. It was later determined that some of 
the 1,250 rockets destroyed contained sarin and cyclosarin, enough 
to release an estimated 342 gallons into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 of the 700,000 troops who fought in the war  
against Iraq have officially complained of health problems they 
attribute to service in the Persian Gulf. Many suffer from extreme 
fatigue, joint and muscle pain, concentration and memory problems, 
rashes, fever, diarrhea and other chronic problems.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spurred by weakness in the bond market hurting  
insurers and a decline in pharmaceutical shares headed by 
SmithKline Beecham, European stocks fell to their lowest point 
Tuesday in a week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz AG, the biggest stock in the Dow Jones Stoxx Insurance  
index, closed with a loss of 7.30 euros, at 247.00 euros, while in 
London, Allied Zurich was the worst blue-chip performer, with a 
loss of 45.5 pence to 760.5 pence. Banks and insurance companies 
hold large bond portfolios and are more sensitive to rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline led the drop in European pharmaceutical stocks after  
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested modifications to 
its license application for Bexxar leukemia treatment. Its shares 
closed down 26 pence at 810.5 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies fell 5.89  
points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 308.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 5.89 points 
at 323.44. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 68.56 points to 3,769.14,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 75.64 points at 3,699.76. 
</P>
<P>
	French retailers outperformed in domestic markets, prompting  
gains among other European food retailers as talk about 
consolidation proliferated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Carrefour announced it was proposing a friendly euros  
15.6 billion all-share takeover of Promodes, creating the world's 
second-largest supermarket retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Carrefour's stock rose 13.60 euros to 154.00 euros,  
and Promodes jumped 64.00 euros to 893.00 euros. In London, Tesco 
and Sainsbury were the best blue-chip performers, gaining 7.25 
pence to 184.25 pence and 7 pence to 429 pence, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Paris CAC-40 index closed down 1.5 percent to  
4,589.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 2.25 percent to 5,270.77,  
Milan's MIBtel index fell 1.9 percent to 33,627, Amsterdam's AEX 
Index fell 2.0 percent to 572.42 and London's FTSE 100 index of 
blue-chip shares closed down 2.0 percent at 6,246.4.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With David Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The urban cowboys and honky-tonk girls  
sucked on beers at a country music bar called The Bullpen, and 
cheered on David Ball as he sang his two-stepping anthems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bullpen, in an industrial area just north of downtown  
Nashville, has returned to its country roots after lasting just two 
weeks as Club Manhattan's, an upscale discotheque. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's back to being a place where David Ball music feels  
right. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bullpen could be the set of a 1970s Burt Reynolds or Clint  
Eastwood ``good ole boy'' comedy film. The hostess has enormous 
blond permed hair and wears black hot pants and knee-high boots. 
Men who apparently pump some serious iron strut around in tight 
Wranglers, enormous belt buckles, boots, Western shirts and cowboy 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
	Honky-tonks like this still thrive, in a time when there are  
several singers with major label recording contracts who are too 
young to even be admitted through the front door. And Ball, who has 
been crowded off the radio by the pop-leaning sounds of just such 
youngsters, still has an enthusiastic audience there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I be-LIEVE,'' Ball begins his biggest hit by drawing out  
the second syllable of the word ``believe'' for dramatic effect. 
``I got a thinkin' problem/seems you're always on my mind/the 
memories go round and round/I've tried to quit a thousand times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, 46, acknowledges he's feeling a little out of place these  
days in Nashville. But like the guy in ``Thinkin' Problem,'' 
quitting isn't an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of got me thinking that I need to go find a place to  
go do what I do,'' he said. ``It's still alive. It's still out 
there somewhere. It's too discouraging to look at what's going on, 
and try to fit into that. Good God! 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that I used to think about country music is that it  
didn't chase the fad. It had an integrity to it that was maybe 
above that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball was born in Rock Hill, S.C., the son of a Baptist minister.  
With boyhood friends Walter Hyatt and Champ Hood, Ball played 
stand-up bass and sang as part of Uncle Walt's Band, an eclectic 
trio that relocated to Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, Ball fell in love with the country music he heard in  
the dance halls, and has played it ever since. He avoided Nashville 
until the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like it until Randy Travis,'' Ball said of  
contemporary country music. ``Heck, Ricky Skaggs started having 
hits on the songs that I was doing. And I thought, `This is really 
interesting.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking the time was right, Ball moved to Nashville and was  
signed by RCA. That didn't work out, but a few years later, Warner 
Bros. gave him a second chance. ``Thinkin' Problem'' was a No. 2 
hit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then his singles haven't done as well, though he makes  
consistently great country music records like the new ``Play.'' But 
in honky-tonks like The Bullpen, he's a superstar every night. 
</P>
<P>
	1. You're having trouble getting radio play. Do you feel out of  
step with what's happening in country music? 
</P>
<P>
	Ball: I do feel a little bit out of touch. To try and chase it,  
and cut my music to where it fits in with what's going on at a 
certain time, I'm not interested in doing that. I'm more interested 
in pursuing my own vision. 
</P>
<P>
	2. It's funny that you're now a standard-bearer for traditional  
country music. It's not like you were born in a log cabin in the 
hills and sang it when you were a kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball: But I'm all the more locked into it because of that. I  
grew up in a real heavy folk thing in high school -- which is the 
beginning of country music. And of course I grew up in church, so 
there was also gospel, and radio was playing Roger Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	From my listening, I got into country music at the beginning --  
Jimmie Rodgers. From Jimmie Rodgers I just took it all the way up 
to Merle Haggard and George Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last 10 or 15 years, I really haven't had any  
influences. I never got into contemporary country music. I was not 
a fan of '70s pop, '80s pop, '70s country, '80s country. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Does good country music have to be depressing?  
</P>
<P>
	Ball: Right after I finished my first album, I'd kind of used up  
all of my brokenhearted songs. The second album was more positive. 
But even when I write a positive song, it's an idea like `It's 
Looking Like a Bad Day for the Blues.' That's a big part of country 
music, to me. I think there's a lonesome sound to it that I like, 
that I'm drawn to. 
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Thinkin' Problem'' is your calling card, your biggest hit  
and a song you have to play every time you perform. Do you ever get 
tired of singing it? 
</P>
<P>
	Ball: Doesn't bother me a bit. It's pretty straightforward and  
simple and to the point. And those are the ingredients of a 
classic. That's why I tend to write that way. ... I just like it. I 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Would you quit if you lost your record deal in Nashville?  
</P>
<P>
	Ball: Gosh, I don't think so. I really like to play and sing.  
The reason I really got into this was to have a great band. I'd 
like to do more or less what Willie Nelson was able to do. Just get 
it to the people. Because they're out there. They want it. They 
want to hear it. And my job is to take it to them. If I can't do it 
through radio, then I've got to put it on the road and bust it 
there. I believe that's how Willie did it, in Austin. That was 
pretty cool, to pull something like that together. He followed his 
music and chased it, went and got it. That would be the way I'd 
like to do it.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former St. Louis Blues defenseman Ed Kea, whose  
hockey career was cut short by a head injury, has died. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Kea drowned Tuesday in an accident at his family's summer  
cottage in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Kea played 583 games over 10 seasons in the NHL, scoring 30  
goals and 175 points. He spent his first six seasons with the 
Atlanta Flames, who signed him as a free-agent on Oct. 6, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues acquired him along with Don Laurence and a draft pick  
in a trade for center Garry Unger on Oct. 10, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He was playing for the Blues' Central Hockey League affiliate in  
Salt Lake City in 1983 when he suffered the injury that ended his 
career. Kea suffered severe head trauma when he fell and hit his 
head on the ice during a game. The injury left him physically and 
mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kea and his family remained in St. Louis after the injury. He is  
survived by his wife, Jennifer, and four children. Funeral services 
were pending.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Cuts Hatteras Island in Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical storm Dennis weakened today and  
began drifting back toward North Carolina's Outer Banks, where its 
first pass had sliced Hatteras Island in half and isolated 
residents of three towns. 
</P>
<P>
	After stalling this morning, the storm began plodding westward  
again early this afternoon at 5 mph, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of rough surf and rip currents, beaches were closed to  
swimmers as far north as Massachusetts' Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's top sustained wind had slowed to 60 mph today.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to spin down,'' said James Franklin of the  
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``There's no thunderstorm 
activity keeping it going. Once that happens, it slowly spins 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was likely to downgraded from a tropical storm before  
the end of the day, but cautioned that it could still strengthen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis approached the first time, vacationers and residents  
were ordered to evacuate the Outer Banks on Sunday. By Monday night 
they began returning when Dennis headed into the Atlantic, only to 
have to leave again Tuesday night when the storm began 
backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who stayed behind, mostly residents, provisions were  
begging to get scarce today. A convoy of National Guard vehicles 
carrying diesel fuel, water and ready-to-eat packaged meals left at 
dawn today to push as far south as possible along Hatteras Island's 
only highway, N.C. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy got two-thirds of the way down the island before  
discovering that days of gale-force wind and 14-foot waves had 
severed the 50-mile-long island, cutting an 8-foot-deep channel at 
a point where the island was just a quarter-mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Avon and Buxton, it's completely washed out,'' Sgt.  
Joe Baker said by satellite phone as the convoy rushed to get off 
the island before high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to get to Buxton, but we couldn't get that  
far,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant hundreds of people were isolated in Buxton, Hatteras  
and Frisco, and the washout also had cut off their water, phone 
service and electricity serving about 5,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the convoy, which included a Humvee, a 5,000-gallon  
fuel truck, a wrecker and a cargo truck, also found as much as 4 
feet of sand from the island's dunes had washed onto parts of the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ocean has come in and knocked the dunes down,'' Baker  
said. ``I didn't see any houses down, but we did see some damage, 
some roofs, decks and walkways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy delivered 3,700 meals to three fire stations north of  
Avon. Helicopters were waiting for calmer weather to deliver 
hundreds more meals to Hatteras. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our water line, our power line, our telephone line and  
our kids' access to the school,'' motel owner John Hooper said 
earlier. ``It's our whole way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of rain and 55 mph wind that kept other aircraft on the  
ground, the Coast Guard sent a helicopter to Hatteras Island today 
to pick up a woman in labor. Amber Simerly, 19, was taken to 
Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth City, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory evacuations were ordered Tuesday in the communities of  
Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills, along with the mainland 
side of Pamlico Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	While a hurricane watch was lifted this morning, a tropical  
storm warning was still in effect for most of the North Carolina 
and Virginia coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy surf advisory was posted for the whole New Jersey coast,  
and most beaches banned swimming. Along the south shore of New 
York's Long Island, no swimming was allowed at state park beaches 
and it was up to lifeguards to decide whether to let people wade 
along the shore. Two beaches on Cape Cod, at Westport and Eastham, 
were closed to swimmers because of rip currents, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. today, Dennis was centered about 100 miles east of  
Cape Hatteras, 65 miles closer than it was Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maximum sustained winds were near 60 mph, with tropical storm  
force winds extending outward up to 175 miles from the center. Wind 
blowing onto the shore in the warning area was producing storm 
surges 2 to 4 feet above normal tide, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the washout and road damage on Hatteras, waves  
had destroyed five condemned houses on the beach at Rodanthe. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Pietro of Collegeville, Pa., and his family packed up and  
left their rented Kitty Hawk beachfront house Tuesday as water 
washed under it at high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always come down here this week,'' Pietro said. ``This is  
the first time I've gotten nailed. If it's stalled, it's going to 
be miserable.''

<HEADLINE> Marshals Impound FBI Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Previously undisclosed evidence in the FBI's  
1993 tear-gas assault on the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas, 
has been impounded by federal marshals as Justice Department 
officials begin talking with possible candidates to head an outside 
investigation of the escalating tear-gas controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The marshals took custody of an infrared videotape recorded  
during the early morning of April 19, 1993, when FBI agents lobbed 
incendiary tear-gas canisters at a concrete bunker adjacent to the 
Davidians' compound, an FBI source said Wednesday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the wooden compound erupted into flames. Cult  
leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the inferno, 
some from gunshot wounds, others from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, who have been heavily  
criticized over the Waco tragedy, have said there was no evidence 
to suggest the blaze was set by the combustible canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Justice officials directed the marshals to seize the  
evidence Wednesday afternoon after being informed by the FBI that 
new information had been discovered in the files of the FBI's 
Hostage Rescue Team at Quantico, Va., Justice and FBI officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News and The New York Times in today's  
editions quoted officials as saying an audio track on the infrared 
tape picked up the voice of an agent seeking and receiving 
permission from a commander to fire incendiary tear-gas grenades at 
the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has decided upon an independent inquiry -- as recommended by  
the White House, the head of the FBI and several lawmakers -- 
instead of one run from within her department, the Times and The 
Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An informal list of several potential outside candidates to head  
the probe was in circulation, and some of them have been contacted, 
a Justice source said Wednesday. Reno was out of the country on 
official business through today. 
</P>
<P>
	Department sources said Reno and her top aides were angered at  
the latest twist in the newly resurgent Waco controversy. Just a 
week ago, the FBI was forced to retreat from six years of denials 
that it had used incendiary tear gas during the final hours of the 
51-day siege, which had begun in a bloody shootout when federal 
agents tried to arrest Koresh on weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	That belated admission about the incendiary tear gas has  
prompted an outcry on Capitol Hill, where congressional Republicans 
are readying hearings for the fall. A frustrated Reno also ordered 
an inquiry to determine why combustible tear gas was used against 
her orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, on Wednesday urged Reno to resign over  
the Waco controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the attorney general should step down,'' Gramm said.  
``This is another example of where she has either lied to the 
American people or allowed the American people to be lied to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newly uncovered Forward-Looking Infrared, or FLIR, tapes  
were turned up as part of FBI Director Louis Freeh's order that all 
files be searched for relevant information in advance of the 
investigation, the FBI source said. After the evidence was found, 
it was transferred to FBI headquarters in Washington, where the 
marshals took possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations during the  
siege and the final tear-gas assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier this afternoon, senior main Justice Department  
officials learned from the FBI that the FBI had found additional 
materials in its possession regarding the shooting of military CS 
gas rounds on the morning of April 19,'' Justice spokesman Myron 
Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice officials ``immediately directed the United States  
Marshals Service to take possession and inventory the materials,'' 
Marlin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI concurred, bureau spokesman John Collingwood said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious to identify and preserve for outside review and  
congressional oversight anything that may bear on the firing of the 
military gas rounds,'' Collingwood said. ``In the end, the only way 
we can completely restore our credibility is to identify every 
scrap of information we have and immediately turn it over to 
whomever is doing the review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a chorus of voices on and off Capitol Hill, the White  
House has made clear its preference for an independent 
investigation, a White House official said Wednesday. ``We would 
support a thorough and independent look at this,'' said the 
official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, who wants to head off any perception of conflict of  
interest, earlier this week indicated support for an inquiry to be 
conducted without FBI or Justice Department involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's conclusion that the fire was set by Davidian  
cult members has long been doubted by conspiracy theorists and 
others who allege the government engaged in a widespread cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee, which is already planning  
hearings, was set to issue subpoenas today to the White House, 
Justice and Defense Departments, the FBI and Texas Rangers seeking 
documents and other Waco-related information, said spokesman Mark 
Corallo.

<HEADLINE> Prison Makes Drake Appreciate Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Two months ago, Jerry Drake sat in a prison  
cell, wondering if his football career had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Mark Smith still a holdout and Eric Swann still not  
recovered from knee surgery, Drake will start for the second 
straight game when the Arizona Cardinals play their final 
exhibition game Friday night against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry certainly has overcome a lot of things,'' coach Vince  
Tobin said. ``He's been injured the last two years and, of course, 
he had the scrape with the law. I think he realizes that this is 
his last chance, and he's working very, very hard to make the most 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he completed his six-month drunken driving sentence on July  
3, Drake had no illusions about where he stood in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 30 years old on the last year of his contract. The  
Cardinals had made him available to Cleveland in the expansion 
draft, and the Browns had passed on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a guy who got injured two years back to back and had some  
problems off the field,'' Drake said. ``Not too many people would 
give me a chance. But I'm still having fun. I'm not looking at what 
I've done in the past. I'm looking at right now. You get a chance, 
you come in and you do your best and see what happens. That's all 
I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drake was an NFL long shot from the start. He played at Hastings  
College in Nebraska, an NCAA Division II school, and signed with 
the Cardinals as a free agent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the practice squad that season, and appeared in 14 games  
the following year. He earned a three-year contract, but injured 
his neck in the 1997 training camp, underwent surgery and 
eventually missed the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Back with the team in 1998, Drake started at defensive end in  
the season opener against Dallas, but he was diagnosed with a lower 
back injury, and eventually underwent more surgery and missed the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical problems were compounded by his off-field woes.  
</P>
<P>
	Last February, Drake entered an Arizona prison to serve a  
six-month sentence for two counts of aggravated driving under the 
influence of alcohol. In November 1997, while he was injured, he 
was stopped and arrested in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert, where he 
lives. A month later, he was arrested again by police in Tempe when 
he drove away from a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, he pleaded no contest to the charges and was  
sentenced to concurrent prison terms of six and four months. 
</P>
<P>
	During his time in jail, he missed the birth of his son Jerry  
Jr. in April. He worked out rigorously in prison and came to camp, 
at 6-foot-5 and 315 pounds in the best shape of his life. Alcohol, 
he said, wasn't worth what it had cost him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he relishes just being able to play football again.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you appreciate life,'' he said. ``It's hard to get  
second chances. I'm just thankful that I am getting a chance to 
help the organization and hopefully make the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drake found himself valuable to a Cardinals organization that  
had earlier indicated it was losing patience with him. Swann, one 
of the NFL's fiercest defensive linemen, seems nowhere near ready 
to play after extensive knee surgery last season. Smith, graded 
Arizona's top defensive lineman last season, is locked in a 
contract dispute that shows no sign of being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were injuries to several other defensive linemen in  
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Drake has gotten his shot, and while he's no all-pro, he's done  
well enough to earn the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played pretty well,'' Tobin said. ``He gives us an anchor  
point that you need in the type of defense that we play. Jerry does 
a good job of holding his space and making them run somewhere else, 
and that's certainly a starting point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drake said he wants Swann and Smith to return because of what it  
would mean for the team. He figures there still would be room for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If those guys were here, I'd still play,'' he said. ``Nobody's  
going to play all the time. I'd still get a few snaps here and 
there. It's great man. It's beautiful. I can't complain. I'm just 
happy, you know.''

<HEADLINE> Milk Cooperatives Market Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Dairylea Cooperative on Wednesday  
announced the formation of a joint milk marketing venture with 
Missouri-based Dairy Farmers of America, one of the largest dairy 
cooperatives in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy Marketing Services expects to market nearly 10 billion  
pounds of milk annually in the Northeast. Together, the two 
cooperatives manage about 35 percent of the Northeast's milk 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies' membership activities and services and all  
businesses will remain separate. But the milk marketing 
cooperatives expect to save their members as much as $5 million per 
year in transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a giant step of cooperation in the Northeast,'' said  
Lewis Gardner, a dairy farmer from Galeton, Pa., and a DFA regional 
chairman. ``Both DFA and Dairylea have milk trucks traveling the 
same roads. We also serve many of the same customers. By working 
together, we can reduce our marketing costs significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milk will be provided by more than 6,000 farmers located  
throughout New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, 
West Virginia and New Jersey, said Clyde Rutherford, president of 
Syracuse-based Dairylea. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will serve more than 90 fluid milk and  
manufacturing customers in the area, Rutherford said. Major 
customers of the Dairy Marketing Services include Suiza Foods, 
Kraft Foods, Great Lakes Cheese, Leprino Foods, H.P. Hood and 
Sorrento Cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairylea is owned by 2,600 farmers throughout the Northeast. It  
markets about 5 billion pounds of milk annually and participates in 
a milk marketing network stretching from Maine to Maryland to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy Farmers of America is based in Kansas City and has 25,000  
members in 45 states. It operates 33 manufacturing plants in 15 
states producing dairy products, including cheese, butter, 
condensed milk, cream cheese, nonfat dry milk, dehydrated dairy 
products and a variety of whey products. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be based in Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Study: AIDS Drugs Abet Risky Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The drug cocktails that have allowed AIDS  
sufferers to live longer lives may be encouraging people vulnerable 
to HIV infection to let down their guards, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The more confidence gay men have that the drugs can prolong the  
lives of AIDS patients and prevent transmission of the disease, the 
less likely they are to use a condom during anal sex or abstain 
from other risky behavior, according to a study presented Tuesday 
at the National HIV Prevention Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is among the first to support anecdotal evidence that  
improvements in AIDS treatments may contribute to increasingly 
devil-may-care attitudes among those at high risk for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been this rumor that we've been hearing about  
increases in unprotected sex,'' said Sheila Murphy, one of the 
study's authors and a psychologist at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is kind of the first wave of actual data that shows  
things like the number of sexual partners increasing as a function 
of this sort of optimism,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers surveyed 410 gay men in West Hollywood, Calif., who  
said they were aware of the drugs called protease inhibitors. When 
taken in combination with older AIDS drugs, the inhibitors can 
reduce the level of the virus in the blood so low that it can't be 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 346 who did not have HIV, those who were more confident  
about the ability of drugs to control AIDS said they used condoms 
74 percent of the time during anal sex. Those who were less 
confident said they used condoms 85 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 64 who were HIV-positive, those who were optimistic about  
the drugs used condoms 66 percent of the time, compared with 85 
percent condom use for those who believed the drugs were less 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly many Americans equate improved treatments with a cure,  
which they are not,'' said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy director 
of the center for HIV prevention at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the conference said the study was too limited to  
draw broad conclusions about how advancements in AIDS treatment may 
fuel risky behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they acknowledge that the drug combinations have  
dramatically changed the way people perceive AIDS. The disease used 
to mean rapid sickness and certain death, but now people are 
surviving in relatively good health for longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's sort of a complacency that's developed in the gay  
community,'' said CDC researcher Rich Wolitski. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolitski cited a number of studies that have shown other  
sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise among gay men -- a 
sign that their sexual habits also put them at risk of contracting 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no studies have been published, some scientists say it's  
possible that the new AIDS drugs do reduce the odds of transmitting 
the virus. Previous studies have shown people with higher levels of 
HIV in their blood are more likely to transmit the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would never tell somebody who is HIV positive that by  
taking drugs they've been rendered noncontagious,'' said Dr. Myron 
Cohen, chief of the infectious diseases division of the University 
of North Carolina.
